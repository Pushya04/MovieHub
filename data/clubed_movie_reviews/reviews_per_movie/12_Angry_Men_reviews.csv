"No bombs, no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less","This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.  Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Film Reflecting American Cultural Changes,"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lays it on a little thick,"I'm going to be contrary. The movie is about as preachy as you can get. The 12 jurors are all cartoonish stereotypes, locked into their predictable characters. The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.The morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some ""lesser of two evils"" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.Don't you get tired of Hollywood clonking you over the head with a moral lesson? Especially when Hollywood isn't any better than the rest of us.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a Character-Study Is Meant to Be.,"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Simple, yet brilliant","This film is investing from start to finish. None of the performances feel like actors playing characters, but instead as people who just happen to be being filmed. The dialogue is phenomenal, the camerawork is absolutely phenomenal, the heat and claustrophobia of the environment sets in right away and gradually gets more and more intense. This film is absolutely phenomenal, and I would recommend it to absolutely anybody who enjoys film as an art form.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!","There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history,"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good script, great dialogs and a set of actors who would be the envy of the world","This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Classic in every sense and moment and frame,"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Dissonance,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Classic not to be Missed,"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The CASE for 12 ANGRY MEN,"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it! I am absolutely certain that You will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.,"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Everyone has a breaking point""","12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My Take On 12 Angry Men,"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see. Well before you see the remake. Just for some laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An outstanding movie.,"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.I won't highlight a single performance, each is as remarkable as the next.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I'm not angry with 12 Angry Men,"Sidney Lumet's first film is one of his best. Of course, it helps to have people like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Ed Begley.

Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques.

A chamber film about self-discovery.""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces.

A Vindication of Doubt and Inquiry,"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.What seems to be a closed case slowly unravels through deeper discussion. In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion.

To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J.

I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away.

Birds of a Feather...,"A room of jurors take their seats, deliberate; a young man's future on the line, his life at stake; twelve white middle aging men, show us time and time again, what diversity and difference helps negate.A lesson about bias and prejudice, as relevant today as it ever was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system,"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"So Simple, So Brilliant","So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just watch the first 30 minutes of it and you'll put it far away on the very top of your list!!!,"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.And that line ""well, so long"" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.This film is a symbol of simple but great film-making that suggests a man should always return to his senses every time and every where.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A masterful chmaber drama that creates palpable tension from its magnificently assembled ensemble,"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simplistic but rightfully so,"This movie is pretty brilliant. It is so simple and neat with one simple concept. It is not too long so it never get's boring. Small almost incignificent changes in the movie makes it interesting. And at the same time you are finding out more about the entire murder case, and how racism and sterotypes can break a good democracy. I really do like the touches like how the camera zooms in gardually over time. With really nice actors with somewhat conving diolog it makes you want to watch till the end.It's simply brilliant. But it doesn't have anything to make it exciting or something that I would want to watch again, or being able to watch over and over again. But I do understand that some people really like this movie, hard to explain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The material is slightly forced for dramatic purposes but the delivery is perfect across the board,"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good.,"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good.

"One of the best, most essential movies you could ever watch","At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.I do not know what you could add in this review, is that it's so great, even if you do not like these spoken themes, I recommend it as a movie about thinking and entertainment at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Angry Men: A Classic Work of Genius,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Interesting and enthralling courtroom drama,"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.If you want to experience the power of cinema, regardless of your age, gender and cultural upbringing, watch this - you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Unsurpassed Character Study & Very Good Drama,"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Best Courtroom film Ever,"The first time I discovered IMDB's top 250 list, I noticed that ""12 Angry Men"" was the 5th best movie ever. I had heard of the film but only the version starring Jack Lemmon from 1997. After some research, I realized this film has one of the strongest casts of any movie ever released. Its cast has much success outside of this film. Out of the 12 jurors, five nominations for Oscars, three won Oscars, seven received an Emmy nomination, and six received a Golden Globe nomination. Henry Fonda, who is the film's lead actor, is one of my favorites of all time. His film ""On Golden Pond"" is a film that I view as perfection. Fond's performance in this film is one of the finest of his career.This film also is directed by Sidney Lumet, who made another favorite movie of mine ""Murder on the Orient Express."" This film is one of those films that is pretty much perfect. I don't love it as much as ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" but I love it more than any other courtroom drama. It's better than my other two favorite courtroom dramas, ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" I think it's much better than the highly overrated ""To Kil a Mockingbird."" I don't see what people see in that film. I think it's a six.In Conclusion. This film is not the best Henry Fonda film (On Golden Pond).

A real classic with great dialogues,There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Intense court room drama,"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form. A movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to sit down and watch and old black and white film with a strong cast of stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Communications Skills,All of the drama this movie has to offer stems from the fact that one juror could express his opinions better than any of the other jurors.Those with poor communications skills gave the viewer a false  impression that they were shallow people who formed an opinion based on reasons other than the merits of the trial.The question that must be answered throughout the movie is: Should a juror's personal limitations in expressing himself bottle up solid evidence in deciding whether a defendant is guilty or innocent?,,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest movies ever? Not really,"Date: 18 May-First Time Watch-I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Is ""12 Angry Men"" a GREAT or NON GREAT movie? Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict ...","Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): ""Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE""Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): ""I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): ""I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE""Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): ""First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE""Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): ""A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE""Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): ""Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE""Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE""Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): ""Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why ""12 Angry Men"" is a GREAT MOVIE""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?""","A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda - I don't know anyone cooler than this guy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side.

Let's take off the nostalgia glasses,"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Simple Formula, Colossal Result","I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list.To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema,"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Classic,"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from an ordinary premise.","Saw this first time when I was in 5th grade.

This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome.

Great actors; somewhat preachy script; still worth watching,"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence.A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating.

There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot.

Excellent !,"+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++""Twelve Angry Men"" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.""Twelve Angry Men"" is a ""trail film"" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Deservedly a Top Ten Film,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The All-Time Great Liberal Agenda Movie,"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good,"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.Regards SimonPs.

"A Pretentious Amateur ""Detective"" Story","12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur ""detective"" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.Juror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for ""years"" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.The Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.For instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;Since the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.What year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.Trains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.Then the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.A juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.The entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.Apparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.This is a manipulative and poorly written film designed to sow doubt where none exists and to instead have you believe in emotional reasoning over logic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The  Lonely Juror,"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Greatest movie ever made,"Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A bit overwrought, over-directed, but compelling nonetheless...","Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Not your standard thriller !,"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.10/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pretty Good,"For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.While I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.The truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.6/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Angry Men,"Perfect. That's what 12 Angry Men is. Perfect. There isn't a thing about this movie I didn't love. The tension, the pacing, the room they're in, the acting, the filming, the directing, it's all perfect. Quite frankly, I'm a little mad that I hadn't seen this film sooner.The thing that stuck out to me perhaps the most was the pace and tension. Often, especially with older films, the pace tends to be relatively slow compared to more recent films. Yet, 12 Angry Men never slows down. There isn't a dull moment to be had. The only break we as the viewer get is when the jurors take their bathroom breaks. And even then, the conversations and debate continue. I personally love films that never ease on the pace and tension, and this one certainly doesn't.I also loved the pacing in terms of the story. The way information was revealed to the viewer in these deliberate increments made me get on the edge of my seat and stay there until the film ended. I was, of course, on the side of Juror #8 from the get-go, so I was always rooting for him to get his view through. But that doesn't mean that I would deny the fact that the opposing side made great arguments as well. As such, I was constantly waiting for what the counter-arguments from both sides would be.For a film about 12 men sitting in one room debating about their decision as a jury, 12 Angry Men is incredibly tense. And without that tension, this film wouldn't work. The reason, I believe, this film is so tense, is because the viewer is just as torn about the case as the jurors. The constant barrage of opposing views, both giving strong arguments, make it difficult to make up your mind. Just as much as it is a film about human nature and how opinions and preconceived ideas can affect our thinking, it's a film that forces the viewer to tackle these problems personally.12 Angry Men blew any expectations that I might have had right out the window. No matter how many great things I had heard, I never expected it to be so fantastic, and quite frankly perfect. I loved that it happened on the hottest day of summer and everyone was sweating.

Legal philosophiser to appeal to any intelligent person,"There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.Which is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one.I have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system.The moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.One of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.Solon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet.In any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.I would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree.But the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury.One of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict. I guess for all its faults the Anglo-Saxon version of justice is the better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Nobody knows the truth, and anything is possible.","However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.One thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.I will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It only takes one articulate juror....,"12 angry men. I've always thought the jury system was imperfect - 12 people from the general population - none of them lawyers, and most if not all, by the laws of probability,,not versed in legal idiosyncrasies. It only takes one very strong, articulate and confident juror to be able to convince the other 11. None of them are trained. It's all pretty much based on gut feeling. And most of us are sheep. Even though I've always thought - via my untrained instinct - that the jury system was fundamentally flawed, I've never really seen it challenged in film or conveyed in such a powerful way as 12 angry men did. Not only was the film entertaining on a theatrical level, it also rings true today. Is there a better system to judge guilt or innocence? I don't know.

Such a great movie,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Communication, Understanding and Respect as Key","12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy.It is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted ""Guilty"". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012).In light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask ""WHY?"", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the ""Guilty"" side, a range of interests was noticed – where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to ""get out of here"", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son. Insodoing, we would be able to correct inaccurate and biased perceptions, while respecting and understanding the basic concerns of others.At the core of it, clear communication and active listening of interests, alongside values of respect and empathy, are crucial in ensuring efficiency and an improvement or maintenance of relationships.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Classic A Must See,"12 Angry Men is a great movie I am a big fan of classics genre I can confidently say that this by far the most unique film I have ever seen. Although people of my generation we tend to watch modern films but I have a special place in my heart for classics as well, It was when I surfed around the Internet looking for something good to watch. Then I stumble upon this title '12 Angry Men' I didn't think of it as much so I thought I will just give it a try. As it started I have to be honest I wasn't paying much attention first but as the movie progressed I kind of got engaged to the whole argument the men were having from that point I got sucked in to the film. I like the way it is viewed as a first person while making the experience more interactive.

Riveting but problematic,"I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them.When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie!  I fear it takes on more than it can handle. But what a worthy effort!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Three for the Acting,"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Who's Who of Character Actors,"This is another classic film which I am certain nobody realized would be a classic when it was made. I doubt that director Sidney Lumet realized fully what he had in the cast he assembled, for many of the names were not yet household words in 1957, the year 12 Angry Men was produced. 	The names are impressive: Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Robert Webber, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Edward Binns, John Fiedler and a very young Jack Klugman are the players we recognize today as belonging in the Who's Who of American character actors of the era. Edward Sweeney and George Voskevec, capable artists in their own right, round out the cast. 	The story intrigues. Except for short sequences at the beginning and end, the story takes place entirely within a stuffy jury deliberation room. A jury of 12 men is charged with determining the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. In the beginning of deliberations, only Fonda believes the young man innocent. The story's brilliance comes in how it progresses to 11-1 for a guilty verdict to finally a 12-0 vote for acquittal. Along the way, we are introduced to each of the jurors in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The reasonable juror portrayed by Fonda, the hot-headed ultra conservative played by Cobb, the shallowness of Warden's character, and E.G. Marshall's thoughtful stockbroker are a few examples of character development within the setting of a jury room on a hot night.We learn much about the background and psyche of each juror as we progress along and the talents of each cast member shine brightly within the framework of an interesting story, a story which contains more than a little bit of social commentary on the times in which it was filmed.12 Angry Men is a must see for anyone interested in the human psyche and social commentary.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One thing I liked a lot is that every juror has a strictly unique personality, and can only be convinced in a specific way. But what puts that movie up there for me is that you never know if the kid was or wasn't guilty. Throughout the movie, Juror #8 remarks that it is possible to be right or wrong, and with the information they have, nothing can be taken for granted. It ultimately comes to what is morally correct, having an innocent kid killed or letting a murderer out in the streets.

Quality work all around.,"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

He dismisses the old man's account and makes assumptions about the female witness's eyesight all based on personal experiments and conjecture, not verified evidence.Juror 8's tactics and amateur detective work, created bias on the jury with emotional appeals rather than sticking to the trial facts, and undermining the judicial process.

12 Angry Men (February 14/15),"Sidney Lumet's first film, 12 Angry Men follows a dozen jurors as they attempt to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. It's a simple premise that's employed to sporadically electrifying effect by Lumet, as the director, along with screenwriter Reginald Rose, does a superb job of introducing each of the (nameless) twelve men of the title - with the uniformly stellar performances going a long way towards initially luring the viewer into the claustrophobic proceeds. Star Henry Fonda delivers a typically compelling and thoroughly charismatic turn as the lone juror convinced of the accused's innocence, with the actor's magnetic work matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Jack Klugman, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and Lee J. Cobb. (The latter is often riveting as Fonda's most vocal and tenacious opponent, and there's little doubt that the film is at its best when focused on the two characters' increasingly contentious arguments.) It's not terribly surprising to note, however, that 12 Angry Men's dialogue-heavy structure results in a decidedly erratic midsection, with the movie's few lulls stemming mostly from the characters' penchant for small talk. This is a minor complaint, of course, for what is otherwise an above average drama, and it's clear, too, that the film has aged surprisingly well in the years since its 1957 release.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A movie with no cheap tricks and out of immersion experiences.,If truly love movies and character development and seeing faces react and incorporate true human emotions. You will thoroughly enjoy this classic. I recently went back to this film to really put myself in a time where this was needed to make movies riveting.All the characters are highly believable for the given time period and their reasoning for believing or not believing is completely believable as well. It warmed my heart to hear each character say something that fit their characters so well.I honestly cannot see whats to hate about this film unless you are against B&W movies and you have to have only action in your movies.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Absolout Masterpice.,"Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" (1957) has me laughing out-loud every time I see it. This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in ""Citizen Kane"". A brilliant piece of film making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simplicity is class,"That's what we mean when we say simplicity is class. This is a masterpiece by a budget of a dinner for two.

Ahead of its time,"A black-and-white film released in 1957, 12 Angry Men was nevertheless one that can captivate its modern audience despite the fact that the entirety of the film was practically shot in a Jury room and consisted of just dialogues. Yet, it may be precisely on this ground that it was able to illustrate clearly to the audience the importance of overcoming our implicit prejudices to arrive at a successful negotiation. Without dictating any Jurors to take up an extreme 'bad guy' role (these are characters and personalities that we often see in our everyday lives), the film further attempts to draw parallels from the Jury room to the real world through urging us to reflect on our prejudices as we go through the hum-drums of our everyday lives.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliant Group dynamics,"I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la ""You volunteer"" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair).It is only when one says ""I am not too sure"" the discussions take place and various lacunae and wrong assumptions come to surface. In business, those are taken (sometimes) positively to plug the loopholes and polish the proposal (here of course there were no midway) but still the dynamics of a business meeting was replicated. The members with their own personal opinions (back grounds, prejudices), changing courts, on one side and again on other side, as the respective prejudices were addressed by the two opposing camps. Though all the background of each were not clearly brought out, but still one could guess, from their prejudices. Change the topic, and as I said it is a board meet.On the lighter side. this movie is strangely devoid of feminine presence. In the whole movie, leave aside jurors, there are not a single member of the fair gender credited or un-credited. In fact only two women ever get referred to, first being one of the star witnesses and the other one of the juror's wife.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Near The Acme Of Cinema,"At its core 12 Angry Men is like an ode to the American legal system and justice in general.

Of whom what more can say other than they're all excellent.The film and play its adapted from is a masterful work in writing and why it is what it is. However, don't let the impressive script and performances prevent you from noticing what a fine job Sydney Lumet did.It's nice to see this film receiving the recognition it deserves from so many, here it's rated #5 (a bit high for my taste), and those doubtful of how intresting a dozen guys yelling at each other can be, will probably be in for a surprise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"ACLU claptrap, yet an engrossing picture; angelic Fonda is unbearably smarmy","It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off.  11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony.  He nobly upholds the concept of ""reasonable doubt.""  Guess who triumphs?The movie is remarkable.  Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains:  the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant.  Cliches all, even back in 1957.Yet, the cast is so real.  These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives.

Hardest movie I ever had to review.,"I love my kino, and love my classics, so let's get down to brass tacks as to why I give this a 6.* The movie is timeless. It could have been shot in any decade.* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography... and that's about it.But, just like the jurors in ""12AM"", we must look beyond the 'facts'.* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the ""Kaiser Sauze"" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that ""mind blowing"" at all.* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to ""Song of the South"". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing.

Excellent Film- Intense drama set in a jury room.,"A film that challenges your perceptions as much as the characters. Gripping, intense and as relevant today as 1957.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simply engrossing.,"12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a ""reasonable doubt"" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Here in 2024!,"Title: ""12 Angry Men: A Timeless Masterpiece""In an age where the allure of modern blockbusters often overshadows the cinematic treasures of the past, Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" stands as a testament to the enduring power of classic cinema. Released in 1957, this timeless masterpiece continues to captivate audiences with its gripping narrative and timeless themes. At first glance, the premise may seem simple: twelve jurors are tasked with deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder. But as the deliberations unfold within the confines of a claustrophobic jury room, the film delves deep into the complexities of human nature, exploring themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of empathy. What sets ""12 Angry Men"" apart is its masterful storytelling and impeccable craftsmanship. Shot almost entirely within the confines of a single room, the film relies on dialogue and character development to drive the narrative forward. Each juror brings their own biases and preconceptions to the table, leading to heated debates and intense confrontations that lay bare the flaws and foibles of the human condition. As the tension mounts and the stakes grow higher, the true brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" shines through. Through the lens of the jury room, the film holds a mirror up to society, forcing viewers to confront their own prejudices and assumptions. In doing so, it transcends the confines of its era, offering timeless insights into the nature of justice and the power of collective action. But perhaps the greatest strength of ""12 Angry Men"" lies in its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. Despite being over six decades old, the film remains as relevant today as it was upon its release. Its exploration of themes such as systemic bias and the importance of due process continues to strike a chord in an age marked by social and political turmoil. Moreover, the performances of the cast elevate ""12 Angry Men"" to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Led by Henry Fonda as Juror 8, the ensemble cast delivers performances that are as nuanced as they are compelling. Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their role, breathing life into characters that transcend the confines of the screen. As the credits roll and the final verdict is reached, ""12 Angry Men"" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer. It is a film that challenges conventions and defies expectations, reminding us of the power of cinema to provoke thought and inspire change. In a world inundated with flashy special effects and CGI-laden spectacles, ""12 Angry Men"" serves as a reminder of the timeless appeal of storytelling in its purest form. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of empathy, understanding, and the pursuit of justice - values that are as relevant today as they were in 1957. In conclusion, ""12 Angry Men"" is not just a movie; it is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate and inspire audiences with its powerful message and masterful execution. If you have yet to experience the magic of this cinematic gem, I urge you to do so without delay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of a kind. A masterpiece.,"This movie is about so many different things. It's touching the subjects of independent thinking, not to judge a book by its cover, humanity and the value of facts. Well, I guess you can even relate it to the wave of fake news in our society today. But for me more than everything else, this movie is a tribute to the american democracy. We see 11 men who change their opinion by the power of strong arguments from Juror #8, and thats exactly what the democratic conversation is about. The idea that conversations and arguments from conflicting sides led to the best possible outcome is a cornerstone of democracy. Therefore, this movie is also about being open-minded and willing to listen to others in order to gain more knowledge.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"great movie, great actors, all-time classic","This is a very good kind of theatrical movie, it has great actors, a serious plot, and gives a lot to think about. I can't say that I enjoy watching trials on screen (like, I really love ""To kill the mockingbird"", but it isn't for the trial scenes, however dramatic and well-played). Regardless of that, I will sit down to watch this movie again, just for the big ideas behind it, and the great play of actors. The movie is all about the hasty choices we make about somebody else's lives, because we want to carry on with our own, we rush things and can end up sending someone to the ""chair"" with our hastiness. Luckily, in this jury on screen there was one man who was willing to say ""wait, is there really evidence enough to send this man to the chair, and do so right away, without even considering some possibilities of his innocence?"" There turn out to be so many possible ways in which the witnesses could be interested in giving false evidence that in the end it strikes you atrocious that the other 11 men wanted to send the (probably) innocent boy to the chair. And again, if it wasn't for another man to doubt the boy's guiltiness (the old man, who said member of the jury number 8 ""wanted support, so I gave it to him""), nothing would come out of it. Yet, he switched because he also wasn't 100% certain of the crime being the convicted boy's doing. The most astonishing was to hear the ""I will kill you!"" said by one of the members of the jury to another, and that I think owing not only to the agitated state of the jurer (who had his hear in the matter, because of the relationship with his son). I think it was to make the plot more dramatic, and obviously give evidence that a shout like this cannot necessarily mean that one carries out the stated intention. Speaking of the member of the jury who wanted to punish his son through the convict's death, I found that very convincing. His character and his play was believable, corroborated with his cynical words in the beginning: ""I think those bastards need to be dealt with before they cause any trouble. Save us time and money."" And his position as the last one to switch, the most stubborn, and the one that took this case the most personally is logical. Dostoevsky once said that one cannot send anyone to death for killing. He explained that by the difference in the feelings of a person strangled to death by mercenaries, and the person being put to death by the court. According to him, the victim of a sudden attack always has hope when he is dying, until the very last minute. And hope is taken away from the person that is murdered for the murder of another, legally. I do not know if I agree, for there are very serious cases. But that is something to think about, something related to this great movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A simple story told perfectly.,"Personal Rating: 10/10If someone asked you to create a compelling film, shot in only one location, black and white, a dozen actors, no fancy camera work, almost non-stop dialogue, and based entirely on an argument, could you do it?Well, 12 Angry Men rises to that exact occasion. If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is.

Now I have a reasonable doubt!,"Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says ""it needed to be talked"" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too! Last but not least the run-time of the is about 90 minutes so after getting engaged in 90 minute of fighting arguments you feel like you have watched a game where the winner is humanity of course!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Against the Grain,"It seems that this movie is unanimously a masterpiece, a 9/10, and according to the list, the #5 best movie of all time according to IMDB.I'm going to be the dissenting juror to this conviction. While the movie is undoubtedly very good for its time and for being a black and white movie, I believe it is overrated at its score and where it sits in the top 5. I'm astonished this is as high ranked and rated actually.It's like the jurors in the room pressuring everybody to side with their opinion, and anybody who doesn't agree with their assertion is outcasted and must give into peer pressure and consent to a 9/10. However, not me, I give this very good movie a 7/10, and I could see it in the 90-100 ranked range, maybe the 50 range at best.There is practically no action, no big twists, and no grand surprises. There were just a couple of scenes such as where Fonda's character pulls out the knife or when the angry juror demonstrates the angle of the knife on Fonda that created some tension, but most of it is too even and simplistic to be considered great. Sure, the arguments brought up by the characters were often interesting and valid, but they were just using step by step logic that wasn't overly cerebral. That's fine, but the point is that there was no big mindblowing 'aha' moment. It was just a step by step chiseling of the evidence that was again interesting at some times, but at others it was just basic.There was definitely a lot to learn from in this movie in terms of how a jury works if one has never been on one, as well as how the system works regarding arriving at verdicts. I'm sure for its time, it was very enlightening for people unfamiliar with the constitution, and even today there are timeless elements to the study of the situation.I have one more minor criticism. While Fonda's acting was good, I found his character to be a little bit too much portrayed like an angel. The director even has him place the most angry juror's jacket on him at the end, and the camera just about solely focuses in on him at the end. They didn't even include the reading of the final verdict or show the boy's or the attorneys' reactions or the courtroom's. I mean, come on, Fonda's character may have just convinced eleven other men to let the culprit walk free, and yet the director paints him as a basically perfect person, like an angel. I think this betrays the script in a sense because there was ample evidence that the boy was guilty, not because of the pathetic prejudicial arguments or preconceptions of character, but because of some other key pieces of evidence. For example, just because juror four can't remember the exact name of the movie he saw or struggles to recall the actor names shouldn't be enough to disregard the boy's statements. I'm not saying he was definitely guilty, but the way the script was playing out, I don't think it was clear enough to pain Fonda's character as this perfect person the way they did, especially at the end, although this could be a trope of the times in the 1950's to always have a hero be idealized.In summation, it is a very good movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again as it is rather monotonous with very little action if any at all and very few twists. Still, I'm glad I watched it once and would put it in the top 30 or so of black and white movies, but definitely not in the top 5 movies of all time. Just off the top of my head, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Gone With the Wind are better older movies than this was.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Overhyped,The movie is a one time watch. They have just over thought all the evidences provided and declared it's not true. Total nonsense. They should have atleast shown how the killing took place. Waste of time. It's literally takes place in one room . They could have atleast shown flashbacks. The acting in the movie was okaish. Pls give it 1 star so that the average goes down and people don't have to waste their time seeing it.

blown away...,"I just watched this for the first time, ashamed to admit that the IMDb ranking was the first I'd heard of it. My excuse is that I am not American, and not a ""die-hard"" classic films fan. That being said, I really prefer movies with intelligence and a good realistic plot.Now the movie itself... I was sitting 1,5 hours captivated by a black/white feature all taking place in one room with just talking...The reason for this was the amazing acting by everyone involved. The characters really grab you, and you hang on every word. It is clear that these actors were ""forced"" to be more skillful, they had no special effects to cover their shortcomings.It was like watching a room full of Daniel Day Lewis' going full blast for 90 min... anyway, that's what I thought of it :)(and by the way, any remake of MUST cast DDL as that last, angry juror ;))",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An absolutely important courtroom drama that was way ahead of its time,"In spite of being recommended multiple times, I only got to watch this masterpiece during the months of quarantine in 2020 and I was really surprised. Alongside being a masterfully crafted film, the most important aspect was how this film was way ahead for its time being released in 1957.It follows the tension between 12 jurors locked in a room who must arrive at a unanimous decision to convict an 18 year old who is accused of murdering his own father that at the first glance looks like an open and shut case. However, when one of them decides the other way, each one must face their own prejudices and moral burdens as reality is put into trial. It deals with multiple themes. most importantly the idea of democracy, racism, xenophobia and the dangers of preconceived ideas. The screenplay is sharp and the tension between the characters keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. What results is a rare courtroom drama that takes outside of the court but creates more impact than a lot of new age courtroom films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A classic,"A complete classic that stands the test of time. Extremely well written with giving us a group of 12 men who are in a court case and are the ones who will decide the fate of a young man who was put on trial for a murder it seems very obvious he committed, but over the course of the movie more information is uncovered showing whether he truly did it or not. Great dialogue that gives you an insight into these characters without showing you any of their backstory, fun back and forth talk between characters. You feel enclosed in the room the characters are in since the majority of the movie takes place in one small room, but it completely works, this movie is essentially perfect, high recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lee couldn't be better,"I completely recognize that 12 Angry Men is a classic, but it's just not my favorite old movie. If Lee J. Cobb didn't give such a fantastic performance, I wouldn't like it at all. As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the ""reasonable doubt"" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.In essence, the jury starts the film seemingly all decided to decide guilty to a murder trial. While giving their preliminary vote in the back room, Hank realizes he will be the only one with the power to prolong the discussion. If he votes guilty with the rest, the deliberation (and the movie) will be over. So, he votes not-guilty, and forces the other eleven men to re-think things. But it isn't really fair, if you're on Lee's side of the story. If you're on Team Hank, this might be one of your favorite movies of all time. A truly impartial jury is nearly impossible, as anyone who's ever had an opinion or life experience that shaped their views. Any of those twelve men is entitled to his opinion, but this film argues that peer pressure should be more powerful than individuality. As Hank brow-beats other jurors into voting not-guilty, Lee and a few others remain firm. Will it turn out to be a hung jury, or will the American justice system prevail?One aspect of the film I will compliment is the setting. The movie starts with the jurors walking into the deliberation room, and the entire movie takes place there. We never see the trial or hear evidence; everything is the discussion. It's an interesting style, because the point is not for the audience to get involved in the case or to make up their own minds. The point is, as mentioned, that if the jury has a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. The cast is also a great asset to the film. All professionals, all giving their unique characters their all - although I do wish the original lead from television was kept on for the movie. Franchot Tone can act circles around Henry Fonda, and he has integrity, passion, and class; he was traded in for a monotonous, whiny voiced bad actor.Still, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber, and of course, Lee J. Cobb, are exactly what the film calls for. Lee couldn't have been any better, and it pained us at the Hot Toasty Rag Awards that he didn't take home the newspaper award for Best Supporting Actor. There was enormously stiff competition in that 1957 category, and all the nominees were truly winners.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant cinematic masterpiece !,"'12 Angry men' is not the movie if u have prejudice against black n white cinema, its not the movie if u want Tyre-scorching action.....it is only for those movie goers with subtle touch of patience and want can over look obvious looking simplicity......Story is pretty straight forward of jury deciding the fate of a person who looks to be given a swift verdict.......yet a man comes forward and gives a different viewpoint n challenges every juror in a very subtle way to just 'think again'. This is start of movie which really captivated my attention from start to end, it never required beautiful movie set or location.....the unfolding of story was so good that i was glued to the screen and yet at the end i realized the whole film was shot in a single room, no guns or girls, yet i loved the ending and tell you what at the end you only get to know the name of main 'protagonist' of change of opinion........u just don't need such formalities !Simply put '12 Angry men' showcases 12 'angry' jurors just looking to seal the fate of a person yet 1 person is managed to change perception of all by power of reasoning and convincing all of them one by one to change, what was pretty much done n dusted verdict.....You will love the movie if u really have in you the patience to sit in front without expecting any melodrama and yet in the end you will feel really satisfied as if u have seen a action pack thriller !. There are very few movies in Hollywood who can match the level of '12 Angry men', 'Sleuth (1972)' comes close to it in a way but i won't tell how.........A movie for person who can enjoy cinematic brilliance in a very fine,simple and subtle way and not a movie for ludicrous action-pack stuffed movie goers !",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What a masterpiece from the late 50s!,"This marvelous story from the late 50s, is about a juror(Henry Fonda) who along with 11 other jurors, try to come up with a reasonable verdict for a murder trial. He believes that the accused in this case is innocent and in the beginning, he is the only person who has this particular opinion. Later on in this powerful tale, he manages to persuade the other jurors that the accused might be innocent with his skills of analyzing legal matters.What surprised me the most was this:
Usually, courtroom dramas often begin with a shot of the crime scene that took place whereas this movie starts directly with the jurors' discussion. It doesn't even have a trial but still has a capability to mesmerize people's minds with just ONE shot in ONE room. The heated discussion between the jurors along with the twists and turns in the statements of the witness, makes this movie greatly enthralling. I watched this movie with my family and all of us got so indulged in the movie that we found every scene fascinating. Besides, all the actors did a fabulous job being in a different character's shoe. Each juror had different thoughts and approaches towards the matter and the actors wonderfully embodied it.Thus, I think that this flawless movie is a must-watch for every person who adores trials and courtroom dramas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simple but great,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere.

First time I wanted to rewatch a movie right after seeing it,"Generally I consider one time enough to watch a movie, but this movie has so much depth in the dialogue that I felt I could watch it again right after it finished.It is a deep dive in human psychology and how facts are perceived depending on the social surrounding. How each person sees the world from their own unique viewpoint. We will all recognize ourselves in one character or another and we see people we know portrayed on screen.Now I did read a review about the high morality and feel-good vibe., but that is not really the essence of it. We will have to admit that, even though we want, we are unlikely that one person willing to stand up against everyone else. Probably most of us are like the majority of the group. Only willing to speak when we feel we have been granted safety by someone else willing to stand up against the loud people that overwhelm us. That makes the story feel real and engaging. It shows how quick people get drawn into the argumentation of those who simply are loud and confident. Most people are willing to listen provided they are granted the chance to be heard themselves. You have to dive deep and give them a chance to draw their own conclusions, within their own viewpoint. Forcing your argument only lasts as long as the receiver allows it.

12 Great Actors,"12 Angry Men is one of a few films that take place in, essentially, one location. Such a story requires, first of all, an intriguing Script.  Second, it requires great acting...and that is exactly what it has.Certainly one of Fonda's  best, 12 Angry Men earned every single one of its Oscar Nominations.As this film is nearing fifty years old, it is slipping away from current audiences -- which is truly unfortunate.   Anyone interested in court drama cannot miss this film.  Furthermore, anyone who can appreciate a witty script with real characters and excellent verbal warfare will enjoy this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reasonable Doubt...,"The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so.

I was forced to endure this,"I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college.  Synopsis:  12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients.  I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted.  Also, some of the ""evidence"" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best.  It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk.  The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given ""just one more shot at 'rehab'.""  The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him.

Timeless Masterpiece!,"This, my friends! Is a film that is in my top favorites of my favorite films of all.

But the best thing about the film is the way it builds a world so real, so authentic to affirm that the characters are completely human, there is no hero or villain; There are no implausible situations that could only exist within a movie, thus doing the magnificent job of wrapping us in their world like no other movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Time!,"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous.
The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints.
In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion.
Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it.
Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.
Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle.
Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote.
Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty.
Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes.

The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. Fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ensemble Cast in the Truest Sense,"Most films featuring ensemble casts include up to a handful of 'main characters', alongside a slew of secondary characters that never receive very thorough characterization. I was stunned at how deep and fleshed out every single one of the 12 jurors was in 12 Angry Men. Apart from Henry Fonda, the arguable lead man in the dissenting Juror #8, every character shares the screen equally.Fighting to dominate the screen might be
better phrasing than 'sharing' the screen. This is 12 powerhouse performances, ensuring that there isn't a moment's lull despite being filmed almost exclusively in one claustrophobic deliberation room. The powerfully acted, incredibly written jurors will leave their personalities imprinted in your mind long after the relatively brief runtime is up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great movie about people and guilty until proven innocent.,"This movie was made well before I was born, but the story couldn't be more relevant today. My takeaway from this movie is we all have our own influences based on our lives and sometimes we are way too quick to judge based on this. Even if the evidence is overwhelmingly against someone, they are still innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Something that seems to be drifting away here in the year 2019.Overall, well made movie that makes you rethink how we in 2019 act.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the rare gems of classic cinema.,"12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
And justice for one,"The life is made up of choices we make every single day, from small things like what to eat for breakfast and what movie to watch in spare time to the big things like the vacation plans or mortgage engagements. We are so used to choosing we do it instantaneously, without any further investigations - and that is often the case with the things we think are right because if we are right it means that everyone else who thinks differently is wrong. People were, are and will always be stubborn and narrow-minded because they are a majority and one can only guess what will happen when that changes.1957's ""12 angry men"" is a splendid courtroom drama which was a directorial debut for Sidney Lumet and starred an ensemble cast of great actors - Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and many others. The film is set almost entirely in one room where the jury must decide whether a man on trial for murder is guilty and it showcases all there is to love about the art of cinema: tensions, eloquent and well-thought out dialogues, outstanding performances, masterful camera work and most of all - the presence effect.Together with the jurors we examine every piece of evidence, every statement, every witness so that not only they can come to the unanimous conclusion but also to put ourselves in the shoes of a person convicted and admit that there is a reasonable doubt and to state so in our final judgment, and it's no easy task. It's not difficult to stand out from the crowd but it's so much harder to stoop down to it everytime you're pressured into thinking, doing, believing something or behaving the way the rest is - you have to stand firmly where you are and be a human no matter what and maybe, just maybe, the angry people around you will see the whole picture more clearly.This motion picture tells us not to rush to conclusions despite how convinced we are of our rightness because there's always more than meets the eye and truly good things always take time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Once More Around The Table,"A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, ""12 Angry Men"" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless ""supposing"" not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb).""It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,"" a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.But a lot of ""fancy"" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son.""This kid's been kicked around all his life,"" Davis says. ""He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words.""Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in ""12 Angry Men"" it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding ""them"", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing.""12 Angry Men"" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.But ""12 Angry Men"", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. Maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but ""12 Angry Men"" stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Henry Fonda has never given a better performance than the one he gives in this movie, and all the other actors - Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Robert Webber, Lee J.

Magnificent Movie,"Yep this movie is so great. The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.

Sidney Lumet: Political Filmmaker,"I realized, watching ""12 Angry Men,"" what an intensely political film it is. The term ""ahead of its time,"" is one I try to avoid, since no person, whether artist or businessman, is ahead of their time. They are, inextricably, unavoidably, a part of their time. But this is a film made in 1957--that's a pretty long time ago, culturally speaking--and it's still inarguably timely. The lead character, Henry Fonda (Juror #8), tries to force people out of making a decision based solely on race and personal convenience. The jury is deliberating a murder conviction, a young immigrant accused of stabbing his father, with ample circumstantial evidence that any ""good"" citizen could stand by if they needed to justify their vote. Most of the jury member want to get the decision over and done with hastily; they have personal errands on their minds, games they want to watch, people they prefer to see. And it's hot that day, very hot--air conditioning is not an option. Under these conditions, Fonda asks much of his fellow jurors: he asks them to put aside thier usual concerns for their own schedules; he demands that they dislodge many years of easy prejudices corroding their judgment; he pleads that they take the time to try and reconstruct other people's points of view, something most of these men clearly don't make a habit of. It's poignant toward the conclusion, after the men leave the courthouse, when one man admiringly asks Fonda his name. They exhange surnames, and then part, realizing either that they're incapable of small talk with each other after such a momentous moral experience--or perhaps that they have nothing in common now that they've emerged into the light of day.I don't think Lumet is viewed as political filmmaker as he truly is. ""12 Angry Men"" was his film debut, an astonishing accomplishment. But think of many of his subsequent films: a documentary on Martin Luther King's journeys; ""Serpico,"" which charts the crusade of a copy compelled to question an entrenched system that wasn't working very well; the ""Pawnbroker,"" is another powerful film, about how a concentration camp survivor tries to avoid dealing with the moral complications of the outside world once he's back in it; ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about a character who is fed up with not having enough money for all the human responsibilities pulling at him. The protagonists in these films are all people that confront or have confronted systems of discrimination, be they racial or economic. And there is nothing more political than examining tyrannies. It's a brave body of work, one to be admired, and ""12 Angry Men"" is a great place to start.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Angry Men and How Logic Beats Prejudice,"A story about 12 men who come from different background, a different point of view, different goals, different motive, and different argument to act as juries facing a complicated murder case. When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.Set of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting ""the simpleness"" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics. The most important thing is this film didn't tell us who is the real murderer of the case. But only to decide whether the boy is guilty or not.This is such a masterpiece from Sidney Lumet, the main idea of the movie is to decide someone's life.

"Brilliant writing, directing, acting, and filming!","This film is a must see! No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole ""Not Guilty"" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.Award winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Watch it if have time to waste !,"As a team of film critics, we recently went to the cinema to see a broadcast of the movie ""12 angry men"" and God, what a great film for octogenarians! Maybe to give you our opinion about it, we must put this dud into context.12 angry men or ""12 hommes en colère"" in French, is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and based on the eponymous piece of theatre of 1954 written by Reginald Rose. As Lumet is a filmmaker known for his tragedies and critics of American justice system, we were, as fans waiting for a harrowing masterpiece! But we think that our small introduction made you understand that we were disappointed.The movie unfolds in a jury room in which 12 jurors are deliberating the case of an impoverished 18-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his father to death. Therefore, the spectator follows this uneven trial for not less than ninety-six minutes, which is of course a bit exhausting. However, you may be pleased when seeing the cast with Henry Fonda, which would be normal. Yet, he probably is the reason of the movie's recognition, because there is nothing else that distinguishes it from other courtroom films such as Liar Liar from 1997. Maybe, we are scandalmongers because you probably know Martin Balsam? Or John Fiedler? No, you don't? To be honest we think that Fonda, Mr Davis in the movie, or the juror eight truly makes the film. If the gamechanger, the one who was about to save the young boy by rebelling against the tyranny of the majority, was anonymous for the spectators, would people give the movie that much attention? We do not think so. Nevertheless, the themes addressed in this film seemed intrusting: the justice and the question of morality and values are omnipresent, but they would be the few positive points. In fact, it contains an underlying message about prejudicial actions, the difficulties to be a juror and even racism during the fifties. It provides an interesting perspective on the importance of being a juror and the possible biases that jurors could, and still can encounter nowadays. It is both dramatic and tense, and it is insightful in its depiction of various aspects of humanity. But we were unable to identify with this film as it was impossible to identify with any of the jurors, it felt like they were not communicating any emotion.Moreover, the script may seem ingenious but if you dig a bit it is not really the case and almost becomes boring at one point. It was so hard not to fall asleep while watching it. We were neither surprised nor excited to see the film and after we saw it. Don't you think the story is a bit far-fetched? Twelve brains take ninety minutes to agree on such an obvious case? Of course, he was not guilty. But after all, this movie kind of shows how screwed up the American justice system is. The poor boy is found guilty before all the evidence were even considered. Logic would dictate that he is not guilty until proven innocent, but apparently only one brain managed to take that detail into account, which made the scenario a bit inconceivable.To be the most objective as possible, 12 angry men is one of the films that did not aged well. Overall, this is a good movie if you like vintage (because it is trending again), slow-paced, and closed-door films. You can also go see it if you like films that denounce timeless issues that still occur today. Also, if you like Henry Fonda, you want to watch it because he still plays greatly. It can be a great old school classic, but definitely a waste of time for people, like us from Generation Z. If you are into more dynamic courtroom movies, we would advice you to watch more recent ones, such as ""Just mercy"" from 2019 or ""the Trial of the Chicago 7"" that was released last year!",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
12 Angry Men,"Wow. Many movies don't hold up very well. This isn't one of the movies. 12 Angry Men is about 12 angry men that sit in a court room discussing whether or not a boy should be considered guilty or not guilty. Simple right? Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case. Honestly the only thing that bugged me about the film was the unoriginal soundtrack/score. It didn't fit very well and sounded cliché.9/10 - Amazing. Just watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A timeless classic relevant in any time period,"12 Angry Men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.A story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.Ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Angry Men,"The plot unfolds well, but the part Davis advocates is only vague speculation. In fact, after proving these things one by one, the child may or may not be the murderer. It's just that the initial work of the prosecution has not been done well, the cross examination of the defense has not been done well, and the case should be investigated again, rather than simply acquitted. It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal. Because no matter whether the masses are blind followers or male masters, they are just crushed. Literary and art youth criticized me for pursuing the truth and vulgarity.

No need for extravagant sets, no need for more than one room for the entire history of human race to unfold before our eyes. Looking inside of us, personally and as a species, we can all identify each and every one of the jurors. We all have acted indifferently, got carried away with anger, or with prejudice. We all are (or should be) capable of standing out for just causes like Henry Fonda's character. It's a question of choice, ethic and circumstance. Sidney Lumet, does an excellent job of subtle direction, delving into the very depths of human existence and civilization, keeping the highest entertainment value, succeeding where all the Bergmans and Tarkovskis have failed miserably.

"A riveting, tension filled 'thriller' in the confines of one single room","As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.Furthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.Due to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. Every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. Even Juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son.As one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant direction and performances,"I saw 12 Angries for the 4th time last night. I knew every line and reaction and was still engrossed to the end. The are maybe a couple dozen movies I can say that about.To be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts ""every single"" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says ""You said we could throw out all the other evidence""
Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.A fun exercise is to figure out the juror you most identify with. For me it is Fonda. Thoughtful, respectful, balanced, and cautious. Sometimes to a fault.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

They don't make classics like these anymore!,"I guess the message of this movie is timeless, especially in the modern world, in this modern times. So I am republishing it. For all the Journalism and Mass Comm student, no make it, for everyone who is with even a little but of a democratic mind set, this movie is a must watch.I was doing a case study in my Mass-Communication class, when I came upon an old 1957 movie named ""12 angry men"". Who would have thought that a monochromatic film about a Spanish boy accused of murder, and the dilemma of the Jury could be such an experience? ""12 angry men"" was such a lucid, tense, and strangely realistic thriller.The story is pretty contrived - during a murder trial, one man's (Henry Fonda) doubts about the accused's guilt gradually overcome the rather less-than-democratic prejudices of the other eleven members of the jury. While the film itself points out that democracy and all its human participants are flawed in nature, it upholds the values of democracy, probably in a way which is very much apt to the time. The jurors were named after numbers, very much in sync with ideal democracy, and the photography, being black and white, heightens the tension.Taking place in almost entirely a jury room, the film was very economical, 12 angry men watches as 11 jurors, convinced of the boys guilt, are slowly won over by one man sympathetic enough to at least looking into the matter, and having reasonable doubts before sending a man to die..the tagline of the movie sums it up...""life in their hands, death on their minds"". The screenplay, happening almost entirely in a single room, in a hot summer afternoon, adds on to the claustrophobia, and rather being confining and acts as a tension and drama building measure.The film leaves a tremendous impact, and leaves a person wondering, about the inevitability as well as the futility of democracy.

Excellent Acting with Lessons to learn,"In the movie, 12 jurors were faced with a grave situation, which was to decide whether an 18-year-old should be found guilty of murder and given the death penalty. By watching their struggles in forming consensus, it shone light on the process of negotiations. The movie, primarily driven by the emotions of the jurors exhibit characteristics that impede the course of negotiations. Be it for dramatic effect, the jurors seem to have difficulties separating people from the problem on several occasions, with their emotions overwhelming them. The acting in 12 angry men is terrific, with the men portraying the true and loaded emotions that occur when there are disagreements. There are many lessons to be learnt from the negotiations process. For instance, Juror 10's underlying prejudice and preconceived notions can be observed when he said that slums were breeding grounds for criminals and were 'dirty'. Disapproval of his prejudiced views was clear as the other jurors turned their backs against him and disregarded his opinions, reminding him not to let it cloud his judgement. The movie is a true rleflection of what negotiations could be like in real-world scenarios, and it is important for us to take away some valuable skills from it",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Twelve Angry Men,"The film Twelve Angry Men did not interest me as much as I thought it would. I cannot get myself to pay attention to old-fashioned movies, mostly because the older films are in black and white. With this movie being so old, the audio and sound system had very poor quality. I'm so used to listening and watching new movies with such amazing quality, that when I have to watch an old film, I lose interest very quickly. The actors in this film were not good in my opinion. They did not show different emotions to make the acting seem more realistic. Lastly, it was difficult to follow along during the film because the characters had no names. Even though I disliked a lot about the film; there are still a few things I enjoyed about it. One of them being the main idea of the film, I enjoyed the main idea because it was about a crime. Crime stories are one of my favorite genres. An interesting point that I noticed was that the movie and the written play reminded me of philosophy because the jurors would never know the exact answer or what actually happened. It was also brought to my attention of how often the votes changed throughout the film. This showing that there were good points and examples to cause the jurors to change their votes. Lastly, it's interesting that the only action that was given throughout the movie was Juror No. 10's yelling.

*A Masterclass in Ethical Dilemma and Human Nature*,"""12 Angry Men,"" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, is a timeless courtroom drama that transcends its genre to explore profound themes of justice, prejudice, and the moral responsibilities of a jury. Set almost entirely within a single room, the film unfolds as twelve jurors deliberate the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. What begins as a seemingly straightforward case quickly evolves into a gripping exploration of bias, doubt, and human integrity.The film's strength lies in its exceptional writing and directing. Reginald Rose's script masterfully navigates the intense dynamics within the jury, illuminating how personal experiences, emotions, and prejudices can cloud judgment. Each juror is richly characterized, with distinct personalities and backgrounds that shape their perspectives on the case.Henry Fonda, who plays Juror #8, stands out as the lone voice advocating for reasonable doubt. His performance is both poignant and resolute, embodying the ideal of justice through his unwavering commitment to truth. Fonda's character serves as a moral compass throughout the film, challenging the other jurors to confront their biases and reconsider the evidence presented.The ensemble cast features remarkable performances from actors like Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and Jack Klugman, each bringing depth to their characters. As tensions rise and tempers flare, the claustrophobic setting of the jury room creates an atmosphere of palpable tension, expertly captured by Lumet's direction. The film's cinematography, with its clever use of close-ups and varying angles, enhances the emotional stakes and keeps viewers engrossed.""12 Angry Men"" not only serves as a gripping narrative but also acts as a profound social commentary. The film highlights the fragility of the justice system and the importance of civic duty. It poses critical questions regarding the nature of guilt and innocence, the impact of socio-economic backgrounds, and the significance of empathy in decision-making.Despite being over six decades old, ""12 Angry Men"" remains remarkably relevant, as the issues it tackles-prejudice, accountability, and the morality of judgment-continue to resonate in contemporary society. It invites audiences to engage in introspection while examining their own biases and the importance of standing up for what is right.""12 Angry Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines brilliant writing, stellar performances, and a compelling narrative to create a thought-provoking experience. Its exploration of justice and human nature is as relevant today as it was at its release, making it a must-see film for anyone interested in the complexities of morality and the ethical dilemmas faced within the justice system.Best courtroom drama film ever made 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Twelve men. One room. One masterpiece.,"This is regarded as one of the best films ever made and I see why.12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. Everyone finds him guilty except for Juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions.By the end of its 96 minute runtime, I was completely blown away. For a film so limited in scale, I couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. The majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. As the opening credits roll, Sidney Lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. It's an outstanding beginning that establishes Lumet's talent. Lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. The way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. There is not a single dull moment. As it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. It's especially impressive considering this was Lumet's feature film debut. Could you get a better debut than this?!For a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what I consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. Reginald Rose's script astounds me. Not only am I dazzled by the way Rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. He's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. This is a script that writers will dream of writing and I have to praise Reginald Rose for achieving this feat. Aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. Every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. Henry Fonda stands out as Juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. Lee J. Cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. Bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and Cobb steals the show during those intense scenes.I now see why 12 Angry Men is loved so much.

Unrhetorical discussion,"After ""Pulp Fiction"",this was the movie which I really respect for DIALOGUES.As this is actually a very old movie I only saw it recently--- when my craze for watching old movie started.I had only seen melodramatic old Indian movies and decided to mitigate my broken mind by not watching old movies anymore.But after watching 12 angry men,my excitement for watching old movies bolstered to a great extent! I actually watched it manly for the rave reviews it had received.I realized that this is the movie which inspired,many recent movies based on murder trials.When I started watching the movie,I was actually skeptical about how the movie would proceed,if it were to be confined to a single room!!The development of the first ten min of the movie----- from the 12 jury men sitting in the courtroom hearing the case to how they start the discussion about the case in the jury room----- was actually one of the simplest,but the most realistic sequence I had seen!I mean especially to find it in a old movie was actually surprising.The way the jury members sweating due to the scorching heat,was shown in a very authentic manner.Based on the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose,the story is how one the jury members(Henry Fonda) convinces the rest of the 11 members that the murder trial under the discussion is not as simple as it seems.The movie then develops with conversations about how the case is discussed and sorted out!Frankly my verbiage is not enough to describe the brilliance in development of the plot!!As movie proceeds,the screenplay not just depicts a murder case,but also depicts the beautiful sketching of each of the characters.The way the argument proceeds with the infusion of their mindsets to the case is so realistic that,you at some point might feel that the screenplay was written by the screenplay writer actually sitting in a real jury room!!The camera work is simple,but exclusive especially in depicting various erratic emotions of each person.I personally felt that the performance of Lee J Cobb as the short tempered and intransigent jury member was the best!!His anger depicted was like watching my father shouting at me!!!!!So finally thanks to Sydny Lumet for his thought provoking direction.It is,according to me, his best movie till date.The true meaning of an HERO is very well defined in this film!Henry Fonda not only should be just appreciated for his acting,but should also be haled as an iconic hero portraying aggressive candor and calmness.So please watch this movie mainly for the simple,but taut screenplay.Lastly I do not mean to offend old Indian movies,its just my opinion.If not for the melodramas of those times,I don't think our culture would have been preserved till now.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

OMG I LOVE THIS FILM SO MUCH! ***K YEAH!!!,"I remember watching this movie on one my last lessons in Legal Studies in Australia because there's not much else to do besides the exam prep. I don't understand the appeal of this movie at all. All it is revolves around twelve angry men yelling at each other for the entire movie, in one room. Sure, it tells the story (and I'm seriously stretching the term for this particular live action reel) of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. This works well as a play and I like the acting and dialogue in this, but does not translate well onto movie at all. That's what Parliament Question Time TV show is there for. This movie is so boring, forgettable and torturous that this is the third time I literally fell asleep a half hour in besides Transformers: Age of Extinction and the new version of Independence Day.

The defense attorney was utterly disinterested, so the prosecutor's case appeared clean-cut.

Cobb, Ed Begley, and E. G. Marshall, based on an earlier teleplay by Reginald Rose.The 12 Angry Men referenced in the title are the twelve jurors of a murder trial who are tasked with the civic duty of deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18-year-old young man, accused of murdering his father.The film takes place almost entirely in the jury deliberation room, and while that may sound as entertaining as watching paint dry, the film has a claustrophobic sense of tension that permeates every single frame, and it is an essential and searing look into the American justice system that is still startlingly relevant over 60 years after it's initial release.It's quite simply the best legal drama ever made, and an absolute masterpiece of a film, that serves as a masterclass of small-budget filmmaking (it cost only $337,000 to make in 1957) and features one of the most profound and powerful individual scenes ever captured on film!Everybody should watch this film, at least once in their lives. It's just THAT good, and THAT important!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

My favorite movie of all time,"It's amazing how CGI, special effects, various locations around the world, blood, gore, sex, explosions, etc. don't matter when you have an amazing cast of actors and a very well written script.Too bad some people still have the mentality ""I will never watch a black and white movie"" like I did a couple of years ago. They'll never be able to understand what is it like to enjoy a very well told story.The plot is very simple; one room and 12 men having a conversation about another's life. It starts kind of slow, but once it picks up, you'll be grabbed by the story and the discussion between the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The 12 Quarreling Men,"""Life Is In Their Hands -- Dealth Is On Their Minds!"" A tag-line of 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men had 3 nominations for Oscars and won 13 other awards, but it does not mean that every one will like this movie. While the movie started with the dark and white atmosphere it gave me a tiresome impression. 12 men were just sitting in a room quarreling and sometimes murmuring and muttering. Are movies only providing human acting and talking?Teenagers like me like to have something much exciting, but not sitting dully in a room. Secondly, I wasn't engrossed in the Juror quarreling during the film. I don't think most of you are interested in others' affairs, especially others' conflicts. Also, as the tag-line shows, the life and death of the boy is in their hands, but how about the audience? It seemed that we have already been left out. In addition, Henry Fonda is a good actor, however, when the movie ends, I think everybody would have asked ""Is that all?"" I still had a hope to see anything unexpectedly broken out before the ending, but what a pity that it did not happen.It may be a great masterpiece to most of people but I hardly have a slight interest on it. My comments might have changed if the 'debate' had an unpredictable result.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Classic never dies,"It is not for nothing that the film is considered a classic of cinematography. Everything is perfect in this movie, from excellent dialogues to detective plot development.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
When in doubt,"I give 10/10 to 1 of 100 movies. When they're perfect. And this has no flaws whatsoever, in it's ""easy"" story. Cause it's easy. A murderer, 12 who will or will not centence him. 11 for, 1 against. It's a story about will. Henry Fonda is both irritating and convincing, but in the end, you know he is right. Can you convict someone when there's doubt? Fonda's character refuse to follow the sheep heard, and it's interesting how he sways the others. Some get annoyed, infuriating, cause this is ""only"" jury duty, and doesnt concern them. Others starts to ask questions. In many ways it reminds me of one of my favorite movies, To Kill A Mockingbird, were Gregory Peck does the same thing, only as a defence attorney. I only give 10/10 to a movie so flawless I cant think of any way it could be done better. I rest my case. It's guilty for being a flawless masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Writing is the most important part of this film,"This film deserves its #5 spot on the top 250 best films of all time (According to IMDb). And there is one thing that I noticed about this film. Everything great is because of the writing. The acting, Emotions, Characters, Plot, personal self-enjoyment, and even the cinematography are all vastly improved by the writing. The acting is excellent but without such a great script all of it would seem unrealistic. For example, see some of the scenes in the star wars prequels. I believe that some of the people who acted in them were good actors but had horrible dialogue written by George Lucas that made their acting look awful. For example, I haven't seen it but Hayden Christensen is known for having a great performance in the film ""Shattered Glass"" Made in 2003 but since his most popular films are badly written, he is known as a bad actor. This films writing however made all of these actors well known for being some of the best of their time.The emotional core of this film is driven by the writing and although that might seem obvious to you, other people may still think it's driven by the excellent acting, but don't realize that the acting is driven by the writing.The characters in this film are some of the best I, and most people (who have seen this film) have ever seen. We start the film in a room with 12 strangers and get to know them over time until the point where they feel like real humans and you don't feel like you're watching a film anymore. Once again the writing is the main attribute but this time it's driven by the acting and the writing. I will admit that even with this excellent writing you can still have a bad performance.I've seen a few people saying this is boring, but I have no idea how you could ever think that. The premise might seem boring, you may ask ""Why one room for 99% of the film?"". But trust me and almost everybody else when I say that this is not boring at all. The writing and the plot make this a very enjoyable drama/mystery film. Whenever you see a film, don't assume that it's boring, read the plot, look at the genre, and decide if it will be your thing.Lastly, the cinematography in this film. It's very creative and has a lot of hidden things in it. For example, (SPOILERS HERE) When Juror 7 (Henry Fonda) slowly convinces more people, the camera moves down because he is becoming the boss and he is now above everybody else, but at the beginning the camera is above him, showing how everybody else is above him. (END OF SPOILERS) Now that is really cool and the writing helped make that possible.Overall, as I said at the beginning this is truly one of the best films of all time and it deserves its place on the IMDb top 5. It's a masterpiece and it goes straight into my top 10. This is my longest review yet so I hope you liked it. Goodbye! 9.8/10.Little chart thing to see why I rated it a 10:Acting: 10/10Cinematography: 9/10Plot: 10/10.Self-enjoyment: 9/10Characters: 10/10Emotions: 9/10Score: 7/10Editing: 9/10.Writing: 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"With brilliant acting from the jurors, an engaging script and fntastic direction from Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men knows what it is doing and succeeds masterfully at it.","12 Angry Men is not an extravagant movie. Most of the film takes place inside a small jury room - no extravagant sets in this movie. This gives us incentive to focus on the three strengths of the film - the acting, the dialogue (written by Reginald Rose) and the direction (by first-time director Sidney Lumet).The acting is outstanding. There is a long shot that takes place before any talk of the case, and simply based off this shot, we can tell so much about these characters - which way they will vote, whether they can relate to the boy on trial, and which of them will collide in the future. Special mentions of course go to Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda, the two opposites whose conversations are some of the most interesting in the whole movie. Lee J, Cobb's revelation scene at the end of the movie alone shows how multilayered he can play his characters.The dialogue is spectacular, and I am of the opinion it is one of the best scripts ever written for the movie screen - possibly the best. Every character speaks based on their motivations: Juror 5 speaks based on his experience as a kid from the poorer areas, Juror 3 speaks based on his own son, and Juror 7 speaks based on his desire to get to a baseball game. These motivations color their arguments and distinguish each of them from their peers, and ths is exemplified in the script. This film also contains the single greatest line in film history, delivered by Juror No. 8 to Juror No. 3 after No. 3 threatens his life. When you watch the scene, you'll know the line.And finally, the directing is masterful. The film's limited set means that the director, Sidney Lumet, had to come up with creative ways to frame shots to aid the film's storytelling. He does this by shooting in wide shots at the start of the movie, and slowly bringing the camera closer to the actor's faces, putting more emphasis on their reactions and reinforcing the claustrophobic size of the room. The scene where the men walk into the outside at the end is basically catharsis.12 Angry Men is a smart and engaging movie, and feels like it was made with every element completely fine-tuned to make one of the greatest movies of all time. I think this movie needs to be seen by everyone, not just to enjoy it, but to see how dialogue can be used masterfully to enhance a story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Movie,"Probably a movie that can't be replaced or remaked,a movie that changed everything and strated something in the world of movies. This movie is telling us that there are some great directors whit a different vision. Great actors whit different characters, you can see the chemistry between them while their talking and screaming,you can see how powerful is self expression and the power of convincement and how someone's words can change your mind forever. This movie is about listening and maturity,every character in this movie has a profesion and different thinking about life but they end up being the same as the other guys in the room. Beautiful movie,if you try to understand their sayings and vision you will love this movie, you need to watch beyond the script and belive me you will learn something from this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece Nearing Perfection,"It has been described as ""flawless"", ""immaculate"" and ""supreme"" -and for good reason. '12 Angry Men' is an old Swiss golden clock in the age of Japanese digital watches, a Flemish renaissance mahogany armchair in the era of prefabricated furniture, a handcrafted motion picture at a time of processed film-making. Henry Fonda is the sole dissenting juror in a murder case, who utilizes rational methodology to convince the remaining eleven jurors that the accused is not guilty as charged. Filming almost exclusively in a small, nondescript jury deliberation room, director Sidney Lumet produces a masterpiece of American film-making, reaching the limits of structured cinematic delivery. The opening segment, which rolls uncut for over 10 minutes, is unparalleled, as is the dramatic sequence of the murder recreation. Assisted by an outstanding theatrical script, the film's cast members literally forget to act, allowing their roles as jurors to inhabit their conscience as they perform. Notably, E.G. Marshall (juror #4) splendidly captures the essence of his role as a prudent financier, while Lee J. Cobb (juror #3) writes cinematic history with his phenomenal portrayal of Fonda's leading adversary among the jury. Last but not least, the film's didactic quality is multifaceted, on the one hand illustrating how educated citizens can guide, rather than endure, the democratic process, and on the other hand illuminating how moral purpose and artistic dedication can guide a film's production in ways Hollywood creators often choose to neglect. Overall, a solid film that has earned the respect of successive generations of movie audiences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Law Movie,I Watch this movie in High School and I find it very actual event in 2010 ! It explain the judiciary system very well. I will recomand this movie even in 2022 ! Just wow you need this movie in your collection.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
'12 Angry Men' is a true timeless classic,"The film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour, issues which will forever be relevant. At the beginning, 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused, an 18-year-old Latino from the slums, be executed by the state.Initially this seems unremarkable, you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict. However it's soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts, reaching their damning conclusion because they 'just think he's guilty' - there's even one juror who can't wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game.Only Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is disturbed by the hastiness of it all; he doesn't know whether the kid is guilty, he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death.I've praised films such as 'Killer Joe' for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations. However, compared to '12 Angry Men', 'Killer Joe' is a veritable action adventure - this legal drama never leaves the jury room. Its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer Reginald Rose.At the table sits a spectrum of personalities, all of whom you can identify and resonate with. Some are measured, some are fickle, some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig-headed and obnoxious. The natural, timeless performances allow you to cross-examine them; they are all personalities one has come across before, and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know - this is one of the film's core strengths.Sidney Lumet's debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism. There may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments, but to my relief, I personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility.'12 Angry Men' is a film I truly admire, a timeless classic that deserves the attention of all generations - it will continue to live on as many of its contemporaries continue to date.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Nice courtroom drama, a classic","This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.Most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.This drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.Juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.As the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.The movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.The movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well It's Better Than The Re-Make.....,"Lee J. Cobb singlehandedly could have ruinsed this film with his yelling and overacting and supremely annoying nature. Ed Begley doesn't help out much either with an equally over the top redundant presence. All the other performances are actually quite good although Jack Warden tends to get on the nerves occasionally as well. The story is original and excellent, and despite some flimsy arguments used to acquit the kid, the movie is compelling in parts. Actually it's pretty obvious they let a guilty go free because they looked through rose colored glasses at the facts but that's not the issue because stuff like that happens every day in our system. The exchanges between the jurors were ridiculous at times and believable at others. Inconsistent yet enjoyable. The 9 rating is absurd, especially since it really doesn't hold up over the years as good as some others of the era. I'd put it at a 7 but am gonna rate a 5 to counterbalance the inflated rating here.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent performances that stand the test of time....,"I have watched this movie many times. I finally bought the DVD the other day and watched it again! The level of acting and the intensity of all the performances have, without exception, always taken my breath away. It is a movie that I love and never tire of watching.You forget, as you watch the movie, that pretty much the entire movie takes place in one room. Movies today, actors today, would not be able to maintain the level of suspense that this movie created and hold your attention for the entire hour and 36 minutes. It starts off slowly, and you become part of the jury stuck in that ""jury room"", frustrated as one man holds out because ""he is not sure"".Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance as the one-man holdout but all the actors give tour de force performances, and you sit mesmerized as one by one they are all converted. But it is Fonda and Lee J Cobbs, as they fight for the hearts and minds of the other jurors that keeps the tension going. The movie was a good social commentary of the times, regarding the racial intolerance, prejudices and biases that governed people in that era. And watching it again today, I would say not much has really changed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Angry Men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details.,"Released in 1957, this is about a group of jurors deciding the fate of a young boy who is accused of murder. One man believes he is not guilty and attempts to convince the rest of the jurors of his innocence. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room...it's just so tight!! The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film (at that time) was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty...it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law! Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Compact, vivid, progressive--not a civics lesson, but a study of human nature","12 Angry Men (1957)What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? It isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. The men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. And with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion.It doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). It also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman (see On the Waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. It's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. In other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom.As viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. We might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. Sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. There is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. Why are they voting one way or the other? What makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? Or funny, annoying, selfish?The all white male jury is potentially a problem. It should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. After the Civil War (by amending the Constitution, and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the South). New York City could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown Manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. Likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries. In the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous.Having said all that, I think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. Having one guy be from a ""slum"" and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. So 12 Angry Men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action.Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail-Safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room). And later, in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense.I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). Already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. For now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Unexpected Surprise,"It as been a while, that I wanted to see this movie, but I never was brave enough to see it, since it is a 90 minute movie, where the movie it's all concentrated on a 12 men deliberation. Otherwise, this movie actually surprised my ideas, indeed.This movie is surprisingly brilliant, it is very simple but wonderful at the same time, it just shows how can a simple movie without any special effects can be turn to a real masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing, specially Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb which made this film even more incredible, thanks to their powerful performances. The characters are impressive, there is a wonderful job on that department, all jury's are different from each other, in personality and class terms, which in my opinion made a very good character extension. The dialog was genius, very original and creative. Filmography was beautiful, the camera focusing the juror's faces was really impressive with the black and white picture as well. What also impressed me was the impact that this all discussion between the 12 men can make a perfect impression of our society of today, even though this film was made in 1957.This is really an outstanding classic movie, which is really worth to see, and that I really wasn't expecting for its marvelous success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazingly Brilliant,"There are very few movies that make you go speechless, remain awestruck due to their sheer concept and execution. This is one such movie.12 men, each from a different background, different views and opinions, strangers to one another, come together, along with their personal prejudices, to reach a decision acceptable to all. This line itself shows the magnitude of complexity involved, and to make a movie out of it is a work of true genius and a one that leaves you spellbound.Right from the first shot, till the final one, you are so engrossed that you would even forget to breathe. If the background sound track, screenplay, script, direction are the cake, then the roles enacted by the characters (I say characters here, not the actors, because you believe they are truly the 12 angry men) are the icing on top of the cake.Surprisingly it was only after the movie, did I realize that it was a black and white movie. The movie shows that to make a good movie, you don't need exotic locations or high drama, or superstars. All you need is a good story and good actors who make you forget they are merely playing their parts in the play.The movie teaches you how an analytical mind and logical thinking can make a difference of life and death. It teaches you to be the most responsible when you have a person's life at stake. It shows how our personal prejudices and upbringing can affect our reasoning, how our senses play with our sense of judgment, how we let our emotions take over, at a time when it is required to be fair and impartial, how we tend to be a part of the crowd because we scared to be the odd – man-out. How one man, one true, sensible and empathetic man, it takes to make a difference. How important it is to have an objective and open mind, at any point of decision-making - in life/ death matters. How we are so stuck upon the facts and what we see, that we forget to use our mind, the ultimate powerful tool that we have. And that all it takes is sense and reason to convince someone, not decibels.There are movies that make you laugh, or cry. There are movies that make you wonder and then there are movies that make you think, force you to ponder upon it, understand it, and learn from it (if possible). This is one such movie and a must – watch for one and all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Another vote.,"It's a quiet afternoon here in Nicosia so i decided to sip on my coffee and watch the old time classic 12 Angry Men, I won't go into deep details because i'm still amazed by the performances in the movie. A movie with a minimum budget and filming on the same location it's an exceptional thing to do in the 50's where the film critics and movie people where expecting the 'getaway' film look where they could express themselves and not just watching some guys talking in the same room. But guess what? This is a movie about 12 guys just talking in the same room for 1 and a half hours and that's what makes this movie a complete masterpiece, A jury of 12 man deciding on the fate of an 18 year old boy whether he is innocent or guilty.

Back when Dialogue Mattered...,"Nowadays, it's hard to find a screenplay that's based solely on dialogue. The mere suggestion of locking 12 men in a room, having them debate with each other and making a movie out of it in the 21st century would be unheard of - God forbid people might actually like it!I'll be honest, that was my initial reaction upon reading a brief summary of this movie. But being a fan of classics, I knew that somehow this would work. There is no need for a visualization of the crime; there is no need for fancy props (save for a knife and a diagram), there is no need for special effects.

There are some many things happening in this movie, that it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up. The camera work is first class, starting off with full view of all 12 jurors, and as the movie progresses and the jurors re-asses their decisions, the camera show the jurors looking straight down the lens, giving the impression they are talking straight to the audience. No names are given till the very end of the movie and then it is only 2 jurors, apart from a quick scene in the courtroom and outside at the end, the rest of the movie is filmed in the jurors room on a hot stinky summers days.Although not a long movie, the emotional turmoil felt by the jurors is explosive and the audience are drawn into the same gut wrenching feel. I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
masterpiece! one of the best movie ever.,"I just watched this movie an hour ago.! And i keep asking myself the same question again & again & again.! What i've been doing for all these years?? Why haven't i watched this before? But i am very grateful that finally i have decided to give this movie a shot. And the shot has been well fired! I must say.!! What an Amazing movie it is! Once you start watching it, it will keep you interested till the end. Everything about this movie is brilliant. Cast, Dieection, storyline. Too good! Heney fonda & lee j cobb were outstansing throughout the movie.! A well deserved ratings for the film(8.9) when i was going to watch this movie, honestly i didn't think that this movie is gonna be that great. But the saddest part is that none of the 12 angry mens are alive today.! Feeling very sad abt that! I just have to say you simply cant just dislike this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing characters unfolding before your eyes,"I watched this film for the first time at the age of 18. I must admit that in the very beginning of the movie, I thought it seemed like just another boring ""old"" movie. But as the story unfolds you get to see more and more of the Jury's personality, through the way they behave and what they say. The writers of this movie did an amazing job creating twelve so distinctly different characters, and that's what makes this movie interesting. The setting and the scene is as simple as it gets, and I would guess the movie budget was very low. Yet I got the feeling that it was very professionally made. I must say the actors did also did a really good job, and as in any classical movie, the ending is closely based on absolutely everything that happens during the whole movie.To anyone who has not yet seen this movie I strongly recommend it. I am not sure I would see it again, because knowing the ending will spoil the movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Subtle and Paced Well,"As for the previous man's post regarding the lack of cinematic pyrotechnics in this films, I'd like to mention that I thought the means with which this story was told was actually quite brilliant. Sure, there are dated elements to the dialogue and we've come quite a long way technologically with which to please the visual sense. Further it seems that our ""eyes"" have grown accustomed to jump cuts and when they are lacking, well, it's sort of like the analogy of a fast food meal versus a sit down dinner. While a burger and fries are fine, even fantastic at times, it sure ain't a meal you'll never forget. With films like this you have to slow yourself down and appreciate the manner with which it is told. Thoughtful framing and movement of camera subconsciously underscore the message. And ultimately a good story told well is all I ask for from a movie, regardless of frills and CG. I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Wonderful movie - Gets you thinking,This is a wonderful movie about group psychology and how the behaviour of a group influences an individuals behaviour in spite of his own rationale telling him something else.It is also a great example of how to resolve conflicts and a great lesson of persuasion.Entire film is shot in 1 room apart from a couple of scenes in the court room and just outside the court at the end of the film. The intensity in the film rises with each passing minute and it keeps you hooked on until the last minute. The film makes you concentrate from the start to the end without letting you off the hook for a second.I've watched this movie five times and still cant get enough of it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Boy oh boy, there's always one!""","Hitchcock once said you could stage an entire film in a telephone box; and '12 Angry Men' triumphantly demonstrates the excitement that can be generated just by a bunch of guys talking around a table. (The dramatic highlight simply consists of a closeup of Juror 4's face as the penny finally drops.)When I first saw this film at the age of 13 I knew nothing about it in advance and still vividly recall my mounting excitement when I realised that the action was going to be entirely confined to just the one room.Although failing to win a single Oscar and dying at the boxoffice '12 Angry Men' created enough to be parodied on 'Hancock' and remained the film in which Henry Fonda took the most pride. (He later said he'd commissioned Sydney Lumet to direct this version of Reginald Rose's television play because he knew that he'd be good with actors but that his skill with the camera came as pure gain.)Films set in courtrooms are so common it's become a genre in it's own right, but after nearly seventy years '12 Angry Men' continues to stand in magnificent isolation as the sole film confined simply to the jury.Since I originally saw this film as a teenager I have probably seen it again about half a dozen times and each time I discover something new (it took several viewings, for example, to notice the way the other members of the cast routinely patronise the elderly juror and his often querulous response).It's easy now to sneer that all twelve are white and male; but the film might be discreetly making the very point that the defendant - briefly seen at the very start - whose life is in their hands is obviously hispanic; one of what Juror 10 dismissively describes as 'them'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This movie is excellent build,"I must say that this movie is really well written, directed and performed.The movie starts with evidence that looks like a clear case, but one juror is not sure. It would be wrong, if I said more about the story, but it develops in a very interesting way.Each of the jurors have their reasons for finding the accused guilty or not guilty. You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons. This is perfect character building, it was really made in an impressive way.The concept is very simple, 12 men discussing a case in a room. It does not sound interesting, but it for sure is. The actors perform excellently, each actor creates an unique character, it is simply just amazing to watch their discussions. I think it would be unfair to mention one actor, because all of them do a fantastic performance.You could say that it does not require a good director to create such a simple movie, but that is very wrong. Director Sidney Lumet really understood how to focus on the right discussions at the right time, he builds the characters with the camera, he did an excellent job.""12 Angry Men"" is an impressive movie.

Simple movie with good story.,"First of all, we agree this's old movie. This movie was produced more than fifty years. We can't comparing this movie with any movies made after 2000C or 1980.Second, I didn't like it. Because in first part I felt bored. Just 12 men tolling shot story and make it long. All of them was in one location. It's a small room for all of times with a lot of sweating :). Anyway, I saw this movie in Mr. King class. I think he liked this movie to much. I saw him passion when he a play it to us in our class. But when he do it again and again I see a good part of all parts in this movie. It's a story.

"There are at least 12 reasons why this ""movie"" sucks.....","""12 Angry Men"" (1957), I have heard people go nuts over this ""film"", time and time again. The hype was insane between everyone I've heard who mentioned anything about it or anything related to it. So, I finally gave in and put it on. What a major disappointment! It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top 10 most boring films I've ever seen in my life. I've seen a lot of dull and boring movies, but this ""film"" excels at both of those aspects. This ""movie"" has a boring story, standard to horrible acting and a generic dull soundtrack. As far as the story goes, it's one of the most uninteresting, boring, unnecessary and unbearable I've ever seen. It's only 96 minutes, but it felt like I was watching it for days! The storyline is, 12 jurors argue on whether a person is guilty or not guilty. Seriously, that's the whole movie, just 12 boring characters sitting in a boring room talking. How riveting! Right? You might as well hide a couple of video cameras in a jury room and press record, same thing! Now, I have seen movies before that take place in a single setting from beginning to end. Some were good, some were bad. ""12 Angry Men"" is probably one of the worst examples of how not to make a film taking place in the same location. It was so dull, that I could barely fight to keep my eyes open! Another big issue is lack of character development. The main characters are cast as: Juror 1, Juror 2, etc. Yes, we do find out their names at the end when they introduce themselves. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules when making a movie or TV show, character development. This ""movie"" has virtually none of that. The only positive about this ""film"" is that it somehow inspired a lot of tributes and parodies on TV shows. Those were so much more entertaining than this pile of filth! Before you guys tell me, ""it's realistic, this movie is supposed to be as close to a real-life scenario as possible."" I'm all for movies with realism. When done right, it can be very effective! ""12 Angry Men"" is a little bit too real. Wow, I never thought I'd hear myself say that! Overall, the plot of this ""movie"" is so bad, that describing my feelings toward it as angry is an understatement. That's one of the two worst things a film can do; anger me, or bore me. ""12 Angry Men"" does both! As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad, unfortunately. From the whole entire cast! The only ones who actually seem to be trying are Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Jack Warden. All of the rest of the performances were either bad or just plain boring. It's a real pity, because all of these actors are great in other movies and TV shows. What happened here? Finally, the soundtrack in this ""movie"" is overall very generic and not memorable in the least. There are a couple of parts of the film score that aren't too bad. The opening theme during the opening credits and the ending theme. As for the rest of the soundtrack, it's just a failing pile of trash. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this ""film"". Yes, surprisingly, this ""movie"" has some good things in it. All of the sets/locations and the special effects are good. The only thing that almost cost the sets/locations star is that it is in black and white. That just accentuates the boredom of the environment. But, it suits the story, or lack thereof, in this ""movie"". So, I still give it a pass at the end of the day. Finally, the special effects are good and still hold up to this day. My only nitpick is that all of the words in the opening and closing credits are all lower case. Did a kid write the titles and credits? Or, did someone forget to capitalize? ""12 Angry Men"" has found a place on my most disappointing films list and most boring films list. It's a real shame, because I really tried so hard to like it. But, it did next to nothing for me. I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""12 Angry Men"", it sucks, plain and simple. The sad thing is, that there are schmucks out there who like it, and some even consider it to be their favorite movie! Why? What are you all drinking? God forbid any of you watch an exciting movie, you may have a heart attack! ""12 Angry Men"" in my verdict is guilty of all charges. All it does is remind me of how much I hate jury duty!",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
So simple yet unbelievably effective,"12 Angry Men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. All you need is a good idea, and 12 Angry Men certainly has that.The film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. It's as simple as that. In the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. However, Sidney Lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men.The twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. However, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. Except one. As the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, Henry Fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more.It is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 Angry Men. It is also the first film I have reviewed where I simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. The film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. It is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. Further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. It is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective.Henry Fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. All twelve actors give outstanding performances.12 Angry Men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. There was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. A great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic. Faultless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Another Not-So-Angry Convert,"I decided to give it a few days after watching this film before writing my review, including enough time to watch several other top-rated films from this time period just to get some further perspective.The film was simply fantastic, an absolute intellectual orgasm. Never did I dream it possible that a film over 50 years old could make me physically jump out of my chair, leaping and punching the air with glee, after the end credits rolled. I felt an enormous sense of justification in taking the time to watch this very old film.At the beginning of the film we're presented with 12 indistinct men of no-particular defining characteristics, but by the end of the film we can clearly recall the decisions and personalities of each individual and how they arrived at their conclusions.Except for very brief opening and ending scenes, the entire film takes place in a single room with nothing else going for it other than the script, acting and camera work. It made me refocus on what film really is; a visual story presented to us by a film-making crew and various actors, but in modern times, sometimes consisting of a much weaker script clouded by heaps of visual effects and the use of technology.You've really got to see this film to understand why it's so good, currently rated no.6 of all-time on IMDb for a very good reason.I'd like to delve deeper into the jury's decision, but I can't, without adding spoilers to my modest review. I'll leave it at that then. Reward your intellect by giving this master work a chance to unfold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best film I have ever seen in all my years going to the movies.,"There are simply not enough positive words in the English Dictionary to describe how superbly brilliant this film is.Suffice to say it is my all time number 1 favourite film. It is also in my view, Henry Fonda's best role.I think what I liked more than anything else in this film, is Henry Fonda sticking his neck out from the crowd, standing for what is right and what is just, against the ridicule of others.Directed by Sidney Lumet in 1957, and produced by Henry Fonda himself, this is a masterpiece of cinema and acting.Any half decent bloke watching Fonda play his part, will likely as not relate to Fonda 100 per cent.If you only ever get the chance to watch one more movie your whole life, watch 12 Angry Men starring Henry Fonda, made in 1957.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Thought I would be bored but boy, I was wrong","Sidney Lumet's 12 angry men it's a perfect example of how beautiful a movie can be if it focusses on the story, characters and conflict. Released in 1957, this courtroom drama is about the complexity of human behaviour even though at first it seems to be just a boring black and white movie.The entire film takes place in a room where 12 jurors have to decide the fate of a young man who has been accused of murder. At first it seems obvious that he is guilty but juror # 8, portrayed stunningly by Henry Fonda, forces them to carefully consider the evidence before jumping to a hasty verdict. This is where the film sends the message to stand up for what you believe and not settle just because everybody else is. Being very well scripted and focused on it's conflict, the film manages to make every juror fall into a different archetype.Moreover, 12 angry men makes a commentary about the judicial system and how it's pretty unfair for someone's faith to be in the hands of people of the same race and gender, their verdict being able to be dictated by prejudice or even racism. I think one of the best scenes in the entire movie is the one where juror #10 tries to justify the guilt of the accused by making a racist comment and everyone else turn their backs on him and start ignoring him. Also, another thing that makes this film so gripping it's the attention to details and the way they come up with new ideas, me being a fan of mystery movies I found it really entertaining.Despite the lack of actual action, 12 angry men is a very captivating and fascinating film and I can only conclude this review by saying it's a must see for everybody.

The Architecture Of the Human Face,"I love this film, and watch it whenever it's on. It was adapted from a television play by Reginald Rose, and directed by Sidney Lumet. A deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father. These men are a cross-section of American and in particular New York society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly. The play is so intensely written, and Rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue, that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they're deliberating.At the start of the film, there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe, with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness, in the guilt of defendant. It's the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position, which is one of reasonable doubt. It's here that Mr. Rose, or rather his lead character, plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence, as has been pointed out over the years; and while I'm generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with, especially where medicine and science are concerned, I make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing, and of the movie as a whole.If ever there was an actor's film, it's this one. Every actor gives a superb performance. Some characters are better conceived than others, and thus John Fiedler, as the milquetoast of the bunch, and Ed Binns as the working man, are at somewhat of a disadvantage, no fault of the actor. Ed Begley's character, a bigot, starts out interestingly, then descends into somewhat of a cliche, which is too bad in way, since Begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career. Martin Balsam's sighing self-pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football. George Voskovec is magnificent as a foreign-born watchmaker who challenges Jack Warden's loudmouth salesman. I've never seen Warden better than he is here. His character is a jerk and a joker, borderline Runyon, or rather the way Runyon types often are in real life: insufferable. Warden plays for effect rather than charm, and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him, which tend to be unfavorable. E.G. Marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker, oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness. Not a bad man, just a snob, of the sort one encounters often in the real world, seldom in the movies. Lee J. Cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case, and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain (albeit a pathetic one) of the piece; while Henry Fonda's dissenter more or less wears the white hat. Cobb gives the sort of highly charged, emotional performance he gave in On the Waterfront, a bit quieter here, and not so malevolent. He was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don't know they have demons. Fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious. His character has the thankless job that liberals often take on, which is that of defender of the damned. One senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere, that he's a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing.What I remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face, often in close-up or medium shot. We see old faces and youngish ones, the craggy and the smooth, the granite-jawed and the slack-jawed. There are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes. Some faces smile automatically, others benignly, some not at all. With so much emphasis nowadays on action pictures, it would be good for young directors to study 12 Angry Men, to see just how much action there is in the human face. I'll take this one over Pearl Harbor any old day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It seems to be quite obvious to the majority of the jurors that the kid is guilty, except for one man.

Best Film I've ever seen,"This is the best film I've ever seen. Adding a bit of personal touch, I can say this is the only film I've seen more than 3 times (5 times). I even created this account on IMDb just to review this film.Being accustomed to color films, initially I thought that this film would be quite dull and boring. But I still decided to give try, considering the high rating given to it in most of the movie rating sites.Initially, at least for the first 10 minutes, it was boring. The jurors were chatting among themselves, going to washrooms, cursing the heat... But as the actual arguments began, it became interesting; I mean really interesting. Of course, it was obvious what the final verdict would be: the boy was to be acquitted. But the way the arguments were presented was fabulous. It never appeared like a film. Instead, it appeared to be a real debate- with jurors showing emotions, ego and prejudice- just like in real life. The acting was fantastic with almost all actors performing extremely well( 8 of twelve were very good. Rest four were good enough, though slight improvements were possible. I forgot their numbers so I'm cant point 'em out)There isn't much of a plot to this film. Almost whole of this film is made up of dialogues. In fact the plot is so small that it can be written in less than 50 words( movie is about 100mins long).The entire filming(90%) takes place in just one room (including attached bathroom).Basically, its the arguments that makes this film an all time masterpiece. Traditions may change, style may change, but logic and rationality doesn't.In my opinion this movie is a ""must watch"".P.S.: DON'T WATCH THE REMAKE AT ANY COST. It is terrible. I mean really hopeless. Yes, it is in colour, but the acting is so bad that I couldn't watch it for even 10 minutes. It appears like a sham. The dialogues are almost the same as the original film but lacks the charm. I would prefer watching the old movie again over watching the remake. The jurors appear to be anxiously waiting for their turn to speak out the dialogues they have memorised. The main character appears weak and fragile. The other jurors appear like students acting in school plays: only thinking of when their turn comes, stiff, lacking spontaneity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Timeless Excellence: A Cinematic Masterpiece,"12 Angry Men"" stands as a testament to the brilliance of cinema. Sidney Lumet's direction and Reginald Rose's screenplay intertwine flawlessly, creating an enthralling narrative that unfolds within the confines of a jury room.

Good legal drama,"Good legal drama but the evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. Did they really make the correct decision?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great movie,"The other reviews pretty much sums it up. It's a great movie, that really proves that 12 good actors is all you need to make a top notch movie. It might be old, slow and sometimes really predictable; but for a movie from 1957 it might be the first movie to ever do anything like this. If not the first; it's the first one to nail it.If you are going to sit down and watch this movie, do not expect a movie with a lot of cool movie effects, because it doesn't have any. People nowadays seem to think that a movie is slow and not good if it goes more than 2 minutes without any action. In this movie they, as mentioned earlier, proves that if the movie has a good lineup of actors, and a good manuscript/director; and set your mind to it, you start putting yourself into the mind of the actors as real people and not actors.That alone makes this better than most movies I've ever watched.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Directorial masterpiece,"The whole movie is situated in one room with 12 angry jurors. But still, it managed to be amazingly gripping. There was not a single second in which i got bored. The mystery slowly progresses with details coming out every 10 minutes. It is a punch on the judicious system and shows beautifully how a persons life is dependent on 12 random jurors who do not care at all about him. Acting is superb. Character development is astounding because by the end i knew everything about every character. Overall the mystery is not as great as I had expected it to be,but the story brilliantly shows human nature which has made it one of the greatest movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An amazing movie with a great plot,"This movie is my favorite classic movie that has great plot that really makes you think. Taking place in a courthouse for the entire movie, 12 jury men discuss whether or not a man is guilty of murder. 11 of the men think he is guilty, mainly because they just want to go home. But one man thinks he may be innocent. They discuss the murder throughout the entirety of the movie. I believe classic movies are generally looked down upon by my generation (teens) just because it is old, this angers me that people are that ignorant, this movie is truly impressive and timeless. It is very engaging that kept me glued to the screen. The dialogue is really good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A near perfect film,"12 Angry Men may just be a perfect movie and if it isn't, then it's pretty damn close. I can't think of another film that was simply people in a room arguing for an hour and a half that captured my attention as much as this one did. If you can write a script that keeps people entertained by simply listening to what you wrote then you deserve limitless praise. Watching these men slowly examine every detail of the case they're given and watching them internally and externally debate whether or not the accused kid is guilty is some of the most riveting pieces of cinema that has ever been filmed. This very well could be in my top 10 favorite movies list and I cannot praise it enough. This film needs to be a required viewing for all film fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fine example of the golden age of Hollywood,"Recently my housemate and I had a film marathon involving SCANNERS and TRUE LIES, two films I have seen before and will see again. After these two he suggested '12 Angry Men' a film I had never heard of before and wasn't really in the mood for. I was very wrong. The film itself is excellent and a true calling card for the classic and noir period. A period where anger is displayed through shouting, not shooting, and this shouting is done using the English language...not a flurry of abuse we are so used to these days. I am blathering I know BUT this film surprised me, made me laugh, worried me, interested me and angered me, all the things that a very good film really should do.The fact that all of this came from a film where the characters are in one room for 98% of the run time is an even bigger example of the timelessness of the piece.

"Disappointed! Seem a lot like a made up story, not realistic.","By the time the vote is 1 against 11, we know how the movie would end. The boy's not guilty. It's obvious, right? And there's no trick at all. As simple as that.
The against one was trying to set out the very simple baits and the others carelessly took these one by one. It's too easy. The other juries looked so dumb. They didn't know anything. They weren't good enough to be. They're not realistic. They were just made up, not even so well.
The boy couldn't even remember a thing about the movie he just saw that night. And one of the juries could just say one or two things about the movie he saw 3 days ago.That's not a similar situation.

One of the Greatest of All Time - Beyond a Reasonable Doubt!,"From a distance, 12 Angry Men might look like your customary courtroom drama that Hollywood churns out every couple of years. Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking.Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly ""the hottest day of the year"". A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. The defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. Over the next 95 minutes, 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt.Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. The actors – all 12 of them – are top notch as the '12 Angry Men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen.The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back. If you love movies, you owe it to yourself to see this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Racism, Bigotry, and Stereotypes, Oh My","I know what you're thinking: how in the heck did you just now get around to seeing 12 Angry Men? To be honest, I don't really have a good excuse. Maybe I just got too caught up with another film with ""12″ (Monkeys) in the title.Regardless, I feel ashamed for having waited so long to take this one in. In short, this movie is absolutely brilliant. This isn't a revelation not already proclaimed by a thousand other critics, but I think it's worth noting for the simple fact that contemporary viewers (who might find themselves in my situation and realize they've postponed this for far too long) really owe it to themselves to embrace this multi-layered masterpiece that's just as relevant today as it was 54 years ago.The plot is deceptively simple: twelve jurors must decide the fate of an eighteen year-old on trial for the supposed murder of his father. Everyone on the jury is a male, and they're all fleshed out with nuanced detail. In fact, considering the entire thing takes place in a sweltering deliberation room, it's absolutely astonishing that director Sidney Lumet is able to concoct such a striking character piece that has a lot to say about the presumptions of society (again, both then and now). This, of course, it what makes 12 Angry Men the timeless piece of art that it is.But let's not ignore the flawless acting on display by everyone involved. Whether it's Henry Fonda trying to prove that nothing is ever certain or Lee Cobb bringing a father riddled with guilt to a violent and emotionally draining climax, it's all superb. The directing is clean and efficient, too—this, among other things, gives said actors a chance to fully embody their personalities and draw the audience into a drama that's anything but black and white.It's clear that screenwriter Reginald Rose has a firm grasp on how to effectively use setting, too. As the mood and opinion shifts in the cramped room, so does the bipolar weather just outside the stubborn windows.I don't know what else to say. If you're like me and have a list of certified ""classics"" that you're just now getting around to, trust me when I say that this one should be vaulted straight to the top. Give it a minute or so to get going, and you'll find yourself glued to one of the most engrossing dramas I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This Movie Made me Happy,"12 ANGRY MENAs the rain fell I realized that I wouldn't have to go to work.  I checked through the movies that were coming on and noticed 12 Angry Men. In a film class I took last semester my professor showcased Sidney Lumet and showed us a bunch of his movies.  However 12 Angry Men wasn't one of them. I saw Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Serpico (1973) and was entertained by both of them.  Having the chance to see the 1957 classic 12 Angry Men was right up my ally. It is always interesting to watch a directors first movie.As I began to watch 12 Angry Men I felt a strong vibe that I would be in for a treat.  The movie began only steps away from where the movie would virtually take place in it's entirety.  Character development was illustrated artistically and without the aid of a single name barring the closing seconds of the film. With twelve men in a hot room, Sidney Lumet did everything right. His camera gracefully wheeled around the room capturing the actors as best as possible.  The movie began with an eleven to one vote on sending an eighteen year old kid to the chair.  As the movie progressed the number reversed itself slowly. Henry Fonda was the one that everybody first looked at and felt angst against.  He was the only one holding them away from breaking out of a hot room filled with 12 men.  Fonda showed strength and confidence in his belief that chance is worth a lot.  This takes a great stake in any case but with the life of a man on the line it's the greatest stake of all.  Fonda supported his belief that it was possible for this young man to be innocent with a host of supporting evidence.  As he went through his arsenal he swayed all eleven other men to agree with him that the young man should not be killed. The cast around Fonda was amazing.  The film portrayed a theater like essence and each character took the stage and performed with consistency and great poise.  Each time a character came to a point where they may have seemed to be stumbling they were picked up by another character.Watching this movie did a lot more for me then mostly all the movies that are being released in today's age of movies.  I had the pleasure to see Sidney Lumet speak at Al Pacino's birthday party at Lincoln Center and although he only commented on Al and his ability, I am now fully beginning to realize just how good of a director Sidney is himself.  A tremendous eye and ability to get the best from his actors makes him one of my favorites.12 Angry Men is not a good movie but a great movie.  Shot in black and white and within the confines of a few rooms and a short closing shot outside the courthouse, Lumet mastered what he had to work with.  With two weeks of rehearsal the actors polished their roles and the film eventually turned out to be a success then and now.  This is the type of movie I would recommend to someone that isn't only interested in special effects, sex or explicit violence.  The movie was well written and directed and should be viewed by anyone who enjoys theater. If I were asked to elaborate on why I rate this movie so well this is what I would say.  The movie had twelve men at each other's throats.  Each man began with a vote and all but one changed his mind.  For a man to give up his initial decision a lot must happen.  For some of the men in this movie it wasn't so hard to change their vote.  For other's it came down to extreme matters.  Some of the men were attracted to sending this kid to his death because of other reasons.  The last man to change his mind was obviously torn by the the case because he and his son had gotten into a fight and have since not spoken to one another.  This silently played a roll in his head throughout the movie but was finally captured when he ripped up a picture of him and his son.  As he changed his vote ending the drawn out debate of this kid's fate, he shed his own tears over the loss of his son.Another man who was slow to change his mind, based the case on himself.  He figured in his head that the alibi that the young man had was not sound.  Yet when put under the spotlight by Fonda he found himself in a hole.  He eventually went on to change his vote but was stuck on his own belief for a while.  Once a man decided to think one way he is usually in it pretty deep.  For him to change his mind and say uncle he must be proven wrong or embarrassed. I can't say enough about the characters in this movie.  They all had something unique about them.  They all played an important part and shed new light on the matter at hand.  I wonder to myself just how many characters a movie can have with them all showing importance.  In this movie it was clear that 12 men was right on the money.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Now this is acting!!,"'12 Angry Men' is not quite the astoundingly great film it's made out to be, but it's definitely one of the measuring sticks for ensemble acting to this day. Great acting all around and superb direction from Sidney Lumet, who never made a better film in his career. This movie is basically one long scene, and it never gets boring. Some of the arguments about the trial are really stretching, but in the end, the trial is not even what the film is all about. Fonda is great, as always, but the glory here goes to Lee J. Cobb. Cobb is a powerhouse and probably was never better - 'On the Waterfront' included.8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Unlikely, but it is possible.","12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.Sweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.A lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
all it took is 1 room and 12 people to create one of the best movies I ever watched in my life,"For a film that takes place almost entirely in one room and is mostly made up of dialogues, I must say it was a blast. Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail.What makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. Each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. You will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match.An extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. You are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an American state of the 50's. Something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy CSI method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world).The interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. It is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. This would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. It has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were.There are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. The whole film is made up of only white males. Not a single woman or member of a different race. Although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. That is why I like the 90's remake even more in overall. Although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. And despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way.Not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.""","Take a classic film and strip it down to its bare necessities. Gone are the extravagant sets and sweeping camera-work; removed are the lavish visual effects and epic story lines. What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father.Prior to 1957, director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. Though '12 Angry Men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, David Lean's magnificent 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three Oscar nominations, for Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture. Of course, it was Lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. Lumet's film, adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (Rudy Bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration.What ultimately makes '12 Angry Men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. Central to the story, of course, is Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an ""open-and-shut case."" Fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. The remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others.It would be plain naïve to label any one of the twelve jurors a ""villain,"" but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda's well-meaning dissenter is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, Juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. Equally bigoted is Juror #10 (Ed Begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. In one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. Also interesting is Jack Warden's Juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority.Despite working in an extremely confined space, Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer Boris Kaufman {who also worked on 'On the Waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. Lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'Fail-Safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though Fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {Juror #8's extra investigations  purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door  would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the Constitution, the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. Ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

That's when the camera operators show their greatness.I think 1939 was the greatest film year of all - Grapes of Wrath, Wizard of Oz, and the very special Gone With the Wind.I watch old black and whites whenever I can - Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake (So Proudly We Hail), Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable (my favorite), Humphrey Bogart (Deadline USA'52 is a favorite besides Casablanca), James Stewart (FBI Story one of his best here), they are all the greats.

"Compelling and exciting movie, but legally illiterate","12 Angry men has for a long time been on my list of what I would consider the best movies ever made. When a movie that merely displays a couple of people sitting in a room talking to one another can have you on the edge of your seat, then it's surely doing something right. However, recently my opinion on the movie changed. Why, you may ask? Because it makes no sense legally. The film is about a jury that has to decide whether there is evidence of a murder beyond a reasonable doubt, which means exactly what it implies. There has to be a reasonable doubt for them not to convict the person, not absence of any doubt at all. Evidence is almost never 100% confirmatory, fingerprints or DNA don't say anyting definitive and witnesses can lie. But when there is a lot of evidence and all of it is pointing in one direction (as is the case in the movie), then the standard of reasonable doubt has surely been reached. This movie makes no legal sense and has been misinforming people on the way the law works for decades now.

But why not?,"This film is a must see. One friend once said ""you haven't seen real cinema till you watch this film"". Now I have to thank him because he was right. How to keep someone during 90 minutes in front of the TV without moving? You can tie him to the sofa, or you can put ""12 angry men"" on the screen. This film is the perfect example of how sometimes greats dialogues and better facial expressions can give much more than other kinds of action. This film is 90 minutes of how the character incredibly well performed by Henry Fonda could not just change the whole jury's mind, but also spectators'. So, my question: why did not this film won the Oscar award?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
no argument here: it's still a classic,"An all-star jury deliberates what seems to be a clear-cut murder charge, but each guilty verdict is swayed, one by one, by the reasonable doubt of good Samaritan Henry Fonda. The film was made in defense of an insecure legal system, showing how a jury of one's (all too human) peers, sidetracked by prejudice, laziness and impatience, can still deliver an impartial decision after considering all the available evidence. The drama is played out in real time, and with real emotional power, building considerable tension out of the conflicts between each character (many of whom would likely never have been selected for an actual jury in the first place). Credit Reginald Rose for the elegant simplicity of his original screenplay, and 33-year old Sidney Lumet (making his feature film debut) for the all but invisible direction, maintaining the punch of the original story (a stage play originally written for television) without it seeming at all like a claustrophobic, one-set theater piece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A classic, but needs to be updated for our time","It's a good film to show to kids to teach them the dangers of prejudice and the value of a good devil's advocate.However, it's terribly outdated. For its time, its supremely progressive, but in our time, a jury of all white men would not even get to trial.It's also hamstrung by heavy-handed moralizing. Maybe back in the day, this was considered subtle, but today, this kind of writing would be considered terribly moralizing.Yes, maybe the story and idea was groundbreaking back in its day. I wouldn't know. I watched it today. I didn't have the benefit of being unexposed to films of today (which I'm sure ripped this film off).Removing this quality, the film is laid bare as nothing but a film full of exposition. It's bad filmmaking to fail to make the most of moving pictures and move the story through dialogue. It defeats the purpose of film. And it doesn't excuse this film especially since this film was made in a time when filmmakers where very adept at showing instead of telling. This was just after the era of silent movies. And there are a lot of contemporary films that doesn't suffer from this kind of writing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Taut Legal Thriller,"12 Angry Men is one of those films with a high reputation, high in the IMDb top 250 and a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I too think its a very good film.The premise for the film is very simply, a jury of 12 men much decide on whether an 18-year-old man is guilty of murdering his father. If they find him guilty then the defendant would be sent to the electric chair. The film is set in a small room, on one of the hottest days of the year in a New York Court. The jury at first vote that the man is guilty, all but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He believes there is enough reasonable doubt and it is up to convict them of that, looking at all the evidence, witness testimony and pretty much the whole trial. Juror #8 is a righteous man who is trying to do the right thing, give the man the fair trial he deserves. He gains allies along the way and they are sympathetic characters, but they are rivals, especially the hostile Juror #3 (Franchot Tone), who is convinced of the man's guilt.12 Angry Men is based on a play by Reginald Rose, and it shows with excellent dialogue, a tight plot and great character development. It's writing at its best. The director Sidney Lumet, keeps the film within it play roots, keeping the film in a close, claustrophobic environment, like a real jury would be under. They are some wonderful shots and close ups, especially at the beginning when follow many different conversations in one continuous tracking shot for 5 minutes. Lumet knew how to work the camera, use the script, keep the tension going and gets the best out of his actors. This is a strong debut from a legendary director. 12 Angry Men is also great example of an actor's film. You believe in these actor's performance and all of them are on the top of their game, matching each other. Henry Fonda said this is one of his favourite films. Some of the characters are likable, some unlikeable, but all are real.The film also raises questions about legal ethic, the American legal system, the American constitution and is international in its message to any country that has trial by jury. It shows many different sectors of American society at the time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Saw this when I was a young teen... loved it then, loved it now.","Old movies probably don't get the kind of respect that they should. There was a time when being an actor was more than just a sign you were wealthy, it was a sign you were talented as hell. The whole cast in this movie is nothing short of amazing. Between that and a great story, 12 angry men although made in 1957 is just as culturally relevant and important today as it was back then.The story finds 12 nameless jurors(at least until the end anyway) deliberating over a boy who is supposedly guilty as hell over the murder of his own father. Suffice to say, almost all 12 men(remember, this was the 1950's) want to convict this boy. The lone holdout wants to go over the evidence a little more because something inside him says maybe it's worth it because they're deciding a boy's fate, and that it's not something to be so casual about.The ensuing two hours of the film features some great twists, great turns, and remarkable humanity on display by all these wonderful actors, portraying very flawed but very relatable human beings. In the end, what really makes this movie works is that 12 men understood what responsibility truly means... so I guess this is kind of like Spiderman... times 12.All jokes aside, 12 Angry Men is a classic and is worthy of being shown at film schools not just because it demonstrates compelling acting, great story, amazing emotion and even character growth... by most of the main cast. Show me a movie that has such a transformative narrative(Transformers doesn't count).",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Angry Men,"Rose (w) - Lumet's (d) high theater on attitudes that often bedevil jury deliberation: sloth (J7) and prejudice (10) are well known, but also bias, when a juror acts as co-counsel, here, Cobb (3) for the prosecution, Fonda (8) the defense, both pushing the group think to effectively stop further debate, and then the struggle all empanelled should engage by being objective while ultimately forming a conviction. The men first appear, eleven, anyway, too quick to convict, then fall like dominoes, too easy to acquit, running hot or cold, acceding to whichever advocate has his air of authority turned on high. It's a trying watch in grade below Sidney's 1982 masterpiece, The Verdict (Warden Binns) that opens with a mawkish camera pan in beg of sympathy for a defendant of whom we know nothing, and ends by leaving the impartial viewer feeling that maybe justice was not done after all. But there is plenty of passion throughout with the power to make us think and that's always a plus.And it's worth keeping this in mind when being moved to and fro by the dialogue and dramatics: It's fair to judge the personalities of the 12 jurors, to a point, and workings of their deliberations, but their value as such and any vote they render early or late in the process is completely within their own purview as they in the story sat through the trial and we the viewers did not, excepting the judge's flat closing instruction.

"Selfishness, laziness, and personal bias","Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names.As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time.12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see.Rating: 9/10Grade: A",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good but quite preachy,"A man (played by Henry Fonda) on the jury for a murder trial is not content with the verdict his fellow jurors is heading for. He sets out to show to them what actually occurred and why they're wrong.Good, but not the all-time classic it is made out to be. The plot is not entirely plausible, and dialogue was often quite preachy. So preachy at times I thought the courts could use the movie in their instructional and ""inspiration"" videos on the jury system!Good acting, mostly, though some of the actors playing the minor characters irritated me, by soapboxing.The movie did bring back some memories.

An unexpectedly enjoyable film that I would highly recommend!,"In Sidney Lumet's film 12 Angry Men, the fate of a teenage boy facing a murder trial lies in the hands of a jury comprising of twelve men from varying backgrounds and different degrees of motivation coming into the court hearing. Some are present merely out of national duty, whereas others, particularly Davis, the only juror who in the beginning voted the accused as not guilty, take their role seriously as a life is at stake. I was initially skeptical about how entertaining this film would be given that it is a black and white film revolving around twelve men in a room discussing a case with no change in setting at all. I was prepared to fall asleep, but boy was I wrong. This film turned out to be one of the most meaningful and engaging film that I have watched, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the negotiation process between members of the jury. I am impressed at how the producer was able to raise certain issues about the jury system like prejudice and personal bias subtly in the film, and the film brought out raw emotions like frustration and anger which are realistic emotions that jurors might feel when in the back and forth process of negotiating. The film shows the importance of objective and rational decision- making especially in the context of determining the outcome of a sentencing, at the same time not neglecting the complexity of negotiation due to differing interests that parties involved hold. I would highly recommend this film to my friends and would gladly watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Claustrophobic but compelling story of jury conflict after murder trial...,"TWELVE ANGRY MEN is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a New York City courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father.Gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (MARTIN BALSAM).Most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (LEE J. COBB, E.G. MARSHALL and ED BEGLEY) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. HENRY FONDA, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an Oscar for ON GOLDEN POND.Based on a TV play directed by Sidney Lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players.The tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (LEE J. COBB). Fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument.Extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after Fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors. Gripping stuff, well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Other Side of a Courtroom Drama,"Most courtroom dramas tell the story of a trial, and typically most films of the genre center on the building of the cases, the trial in a courtroom, and the climactic moment the jury renders the final verdict. In ""12 Angry Men"", we see none of these aspects. We don't see the trial, we don't see the lawyers, and we don't see how the case was built. Almost the entire story is told in the confines of a jury room. The indisputable facts and the prosecution's case trickle in as the story progresses. There's a brief ""prelude"" where we see the courtroom, the judge, and a brief shot of the boy on trial for murder.This is the world of ""12 Angry Men"". Except for a brief courtroom shot and one other codetta scene at the end, ""12 Angry Men"" spends about 90 of its 96 minutes running time inside a claustrophobic room where the fan doesn't work and it's supposed to be the hottest day of the year. Twelve men from differing backgrounds and age groups are put together to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder. Fairly quickly we learn that an older middle-age man was murdered in an apartment and his son in his late teens has been accused of the crime. Two witnesses during the trial testified it was the boy, a woman across the street and an older gentleman in an apartment just above the apartment where the crime took place.Without giving two much away, the story begins with an initial poll taken by the jurors. Almost all of them believe the boy is guilty, except one, juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda). The trial occurred over the course of six days and all of them seem a bit worn out. In addition, each juror seems to have differing agendas which start to rear their ugly heads. Juror no. 3 (Lee J. Cob) is one of two jurors who has a personal agenda about the trial. The other is juror no. 10 (Ed Begley) who constantly talks about ""those people"" and repeatedly stands from his chair when he hears evidence which might contradict the probably guilt of the accused. Juror No. 5 (Jack Klugman) is a soft-spoken young man who grew up in the slums, like the defendant. Juror no. 7 (Jack Warden) is a sports fan who cares less about the trial and doesn't want to miss a sporting event taking place in the evening. There's a kindly and wise older gentleman, juror no. 9, who turns out to have unexpected wisdom (Joseph Sweeney). And Martin Balsam plays the foreman of the jury who can't seem to keep the group from going at each other's throats.Juror no. 8 at first can't seem to convince anyone there's any reason to doubt the guilt of the accused. Even when he says he simply wishes to talk about the case, many of the jurors dismiss him. He then takes a chance and asks the others for a re-vote in which he abstains. If the other 11 jurors still vote guilty, he's willing to take the verdict into the court.A brilliantly acted one-scene film about the possibly dynamic of a jury room. Many real-life juries have taken many hours, sometimes days to reach verdicts. Other verdicts have been rendered in seemingly short periods of time. Each actor ""owns"" his character and as the discussion continues, the prejudices and irrationalities of the characters gradually reveal themselves. Interestingly, we have the notion that juries should be objective in their verdicts, but ""12 Angry Men"" poses the question: do verdicts reflect personal prejudices as much or in some cases more than simply reviewing and determining objective facts?",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

No movie has ever cached me as Twelve angry men did. The movie shows the argument of a jury in a murder trial. Their case is a young boy accused of murdering his father. I can't point out one scene or one point in this movie that enchanted me. Maybe it's my addiction for old movies, or my love for Henry Fonda, I don't quit know. I like how every character in the movie has its own point of view in the case. There is though one thing that charmed me little more than anything else.

Masterpiece,"12 Angry Men (1957)**** (out of 4)A poor slum kid is on trial for the murder of his father and it's up to one juror (Henry Fonda) to try and convince the other's that he's not guilty. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Bins, Jack Warden, Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber are the twelve jurors and it's going to be hard trying to find a film with as much great acting as what we see here. I really think this is one of the greatest screenplays to be written for any movie since the movie only runs 96-minutes and we've got all the evidence to listen to and watch them discuss it but we also get to know each one of them personally with just a few remarks, which tells us everything about them. Another important aspect is the direction by Lumet, which might be the best of his career, which is certainly saying a lot considering how many great films he has made over the years. There's nothing getting blown up here and there are no gunshots but this film, in terms of drama and suspense, can rival any action movie ever made for those edge of your seat thrills. The cinematography is also top-notch as the camera just floats around the juror's room picking up pieces of the action. What I love most about movies is when you get great actors going at each other in a great screenplay and I can't think of a movie that does this better than this one right here. There is so much excitement as the men, who all believe they are right, slowly fight and tear away at one another until the thrilling end. All of the performances are wonderful and what better than having a mild Fonda going up against the anger of Cobb. The final sequence is brilliantly handled and doesn't come off as forced or silly. On the top this is certainly a courtroom drama but underneath the film plays more like a lesson of this countries legal Constitution and why it is so great.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I am not into camera angles and lighting and such its the whole effect that I am interested in and the experience of watching this film was spellbinding. When I watch this film I am always drawn to the one voice in the room who isn't sure about the guilt of the accused. Just imagine being in his shoes under those circumstances and you can see how easy it would be to say yes he is guilty can I go home now, after all the eleven other jurors are probably right so I will just agree with them. But this one juror applied a certain amount of logic and was determined enough to resist the jeers and negative comments and demand that he be listened to and of course he gets his concerns over and most people know the ending.

12 Angry Men's message is relevant 60 years on,"Growing up in the 60's my first experience with courtroom drama was watching Perry Mason defending the innocent by uncovering all the hidden facts. The first courtroom movie that I remember was the classic '12 Angry Men' Made in 1957, the same year as the first series of Perry Mason, the film tells the story of a jury that has to consider the innocence or guilt of an 18-year-old boy accused of killing his father. If found guilty the boy would face a mandatory death sentence.95% of the film is shot in the one room to which the jury has retired to consider their verdict. In considering the age of the movie, the first thing you notice is that to be judged by your 'equals' in the 1950's meant to sit before 12 white males. As the jurors enter the room, their flippant remarks and labelling of the male defendant, who comes from the slums, shows a wide range of bias, bigotry and lack of concern for the outcome they are to make a judgement on. What appears to be a simple decision of all voting guilty is thrown into disarray when juror 7, Henry Fonda, goes against the grain and votes Not Guilty. So begins a journey that requires each man present to consider their own status in life and whether there may be a reasonable doubt that the boy is guilty.There is no doubt that the movie has aged but the exploration of each jurors motivation helps each character develop. The decision to only identify each man by their juror number and with no background provided the viewer is free to identify with one or more characters based on their own views of morality and ethics. The room has no cooling and as the heat of the day grows and the men become more visibly uncomfortable the claustrophobic atmosphere helps build the tension. The use of close-ups as characters make statements also gives you a sense of how small the room is as tempers fray.While the movie has aged the premise is not much different to a number of documentaries shown recently that ask people to face their own intolerances such as refugees or indigenous communities. If the defendant was not an abused boy from the New York slums but an aboriginal or Muslim youth from the western suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane I believe we would see 'our peers' struggle with a similar dilemma as the cast of this movie. One by one each character has to question their initial conclusion and determine whether the verdict of guilty should stand.While Henry Fonda is the star of the movie, the cast many of the respected male actors of the period with Lee J Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G Marshall and a young Jack Klugman of Quincy and The Odd Couple fame. To watch the movie now the acting is certainly over dramatic in parts but the idea of giving everyone a fair go, doing what is right when the numbers are against you and facing your own bias when judging others are still important concepts today.

This movie alone justifies there being a film-business.,"Ah, I remember being a kid watching 12 Angry Men on TV for the first time. I was blown away, 13 years old and seeing Henry Fonda for the first time. Nah, forget that, I was seeing every one of these 12 actors for the first time. This was also the first film I watched by Sidney Lumet.I didn't even know who these guys were until they crawled onto my screen and began rattling my brain. This story truly takes you deeper than almost any other story, the acting performances here are absolutely wonderful and seeing as you're getting not one or two memorable performances but TWELVE, this is one special movie.Sure, it's black'n'white. Sure, the sound isn't as good in old movies as it is nowadays. But you know what? If you do not like this movie you do not like movies at all. Period.It's the way Henry Fonda manages to be completely invisible, despite being the lead character, allowing the rest of the cast to completely shine when they're called upon!It's the way the camera is not watching these twelve angry men from a distance, rather that it is AMONGST them, giving you the feeling that you are pretty much the 13th juror. Which prompts you to make up your own feelings on the given issue of the story as well as getting you so aroused and hot-blooded about the proceedings that you feel as if it were you on trial! Never before (or after) has a movie ever inspired such interaction on my behalf as a watcher...It's the way the jurors remain anonymous until after they've reached a verdict and emerged from the room, each going their separate ways. I never would have thought a simple line like, ""what's your name?"" could possibly have such a strong effect on me in a film. But, as with most other things about this movie, seeing is believing.But, enough of the hype already. There's a reason Sidney Lumet is legendary, as well as Henry Fonda, Lee J Cobb and all the rest! There's a reason this movie is on every film-educated man's Top-whatever list of favorites. There's a reason it is such a praised piece.Haven't seen it?

Utter cinematic perfection!,"Sidney Lumet's ultimate masterpiece ""12 Angry Men"" is a paramount in film history and is certainly the most memorable of courtroom dramas, a film that stands true to what intelligent, perfectly-made cinema ought to be.The plot is simple enough. It's about twelve men from different social backgrounds and jobs who make up the jury of a murder trial for an 18-year old kid who has allegedly stabbed his father in cold blood. They (the jury) must now retire to a private chamber and discuss the verdict before sentencing the murderer to either death or freedom. The entire film, then, takes place inside this chamber and follows the arguments and quite heated discussions between these twelve angry men, as they attempt to reach an unanimous vote.From the start, while the men accommodate themselves in the room, we're introduced to them and their personalities, their likes, and basically we gather enough information to discern the type of person each of them is like. Also, they are never identified by their names, but are referred to according to how they were sitting in the trial, with a number from 1 to 12. It is in this setting of anonymity, of a locked room which is practically boiling in heat, that twelve different personalities clash, different points of view are alternately objectified and refuted, and the future or doom of a man is tactfully decided.It's a masterpiece, I tell you. The screenplay is sent from cinema heaven (Reginald Rose is a masterful screenwriter), for what begins as a discussion to eliminate all possible doubts becomes a passionate, gripping and utterly suspenseful probing into a different area of human bias. The ball is bounced back and forth among different subjects, and it's such a harrowing game they play that we watch transfixed through the entire duration of the film, uncertain of anything and equally unsure what to make of it. Is the kid really guilty or is he innocent? No one knows, they merely speculate, and like one of them says, ""Who knows what could be worse: sending an innocent kid to his death or letting a cold-blooded murderer free to do as he wishes?"" The theme is searingly vivisected and analyzed, and you'll find your own morals, ideas and reasonings both questioned and assured in a mind-blowing way.Apart from the terrific screenplay (enhanced by rapid-fire, witty dialogue), Sidney Lumet has done wonders with space and cinematography. The fact that such delicate and controversial topics are being dealt in a stifling hot room by twelve men who are rapidly loosing their patience deals for an emotional powerhouse. Nothing can be avoided. Also, the camera angles, the focus of the camera itself, makes the room even seem smaller and more suffocating by the minute, with increases the heat of the arguments and the sharpness of the remarks. I read somewhere that the first shots in the movie are taken at a high angle and they slowly decrease to a point where, by the end of the movie, they're below the character's faces (I watched the film again and this fact is true). Also, different lenses were used to give the impression that the walls were shrinking. I tell you, it's cinematic perfection.The acting is point-perfect. Henry Fonda delivers a searingly intelligent performance as one of the jury members who poses most of the troubling questions, and amongst the other twelve, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden are equally powerful and entrancing. Overall, the film lasts a little over an hour and a half. But it's an hour and a half of pure delight, of witnessing amazing cinema unlike any we've seen in recent times. I mean, the film was made in 1957, and it's still as fresh and as original as if it had been released yesterday, even with an unnatural quantity of courtroom dramas that Hollywood spews out.I've seen my good share of courtroom dramas, and even in my young age I happily come to discover films like these that even having been done way before my time still manage to be more interesting than many.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

12 Excellent Performances,"Fonda tried his only attempt at producing with this tense, claustrophobic drama.  Though the film was initially not very successful and Fonda did not recoup enough money to draw a salary for it, it was a work close to his heart and has since gained an almost legendary status (only slightly dimmed by the endless mediocre stage versions that pop up everywhere from high schools to church basements.)  The story concerns the deliberation of twelve jury members in the case of a Puerto Rican youth accused of knifing his father to death.  Fonda picked each of the other jurors from among the best actors that New York City and Hollywood had to offer.  Some went on to greater fame.  A few are virtually unknown today, but all do a fine job in the film.  As the film gets under way, the jurors take a vote which tallies 11 guilty and 1 not guilty (Fonda.)  He must attempt to sway the remaining jurors to his viewpoint or risk a hung jury.  Each of the jurors fits a certain ""type"".  Some are meek, some loud, some wealthy, some poor, some ethnic, etc...  Scoring especially well (though their high volume bombast can be rough on the ears at times) are Cobb, Begley and Warden.  However, the quieter ones are no less effective.  Marshall is excellent as a carefully behaved upper crust man.  Webber is at his most handsome as a snappy ad exec.  Fonda underplays his role, allowing the audience to project its feelings onto his familiar face.  There is a lot of the expected discussion and rehashing of the evidence, but the film is also punctuated with a few piercing dramatic moments and somehow manages to create and build suspense in a story where there isn't a lot of doubt as to the outcome.  The film captures a sort of old world class and respect and dignity (even with the underbelly of life that gets exposed in the story) that is mostly absent from today's movies and today's world.  Whenever a man gets agitated, someone politely suggests that he calms down and typically, he does.  Today there would have to be a fistfight and all sorts of extra melodrama to keep audiences watching.  However, for the patient and appreciative viewer, this film satisfies greatly.  An interesting point is made at the end....that after all the deliberation and drama, the jurors never even knew each others' names and from here on will likely never see one another again. It's a thought-provoking and intriguing story with lots to offer.  Should be required viewing for anyone about to sit on jury duty as it illustrates the dangers of preconception and going with the flow.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lumet's Finest,"Lumet's staggering courtroom drama 12 Angry Men mostly takes place in the cramped jury room where a dozen ""men with ties"" decide the fate of Puerto Rican teenager accused of murdering his abusive father. Yet the prologue to their civic imprisonment, which takes place beyond these confined walls, sets the stage for Lumet's overarching concerns about the contradictions of the democratic process. After a few short establishing shots where men, women, and children traverse the plaza steps and interior hallways of the court building, Lumet and director of photography Boris Kaufman focus on a particular door, where one of many cases currently in motion is just about to reach critical mass. The legal arguments have subsided, leaving the courtroom mostly silent and the fate of the accused in the hands of the aforementioned 12 white men. Before their dismissal, the judge looks down at the group and bequeaths them to ""separate the fact from the fancy."" Despite his harsh tone, we quickly realize only one of them takes this statement seriously.That man is Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting voice during the jury's disturbingly jovial initial vote to convict the boy of first- degree murder, which would send him to the electric chair. Juror 8 has questions, a lot of them that he wants to discuss further, much to the chagrin of his fellow jurors. ""There's always one,"" yells sarcastic Juror 10 (Ed Begley), who, like many of his fellow deliberators, desires a quick conviction so that they can all get back to their regular lives. In the minds of the other 11 men, the evidence is overwhelming in favor of the prosecution, so why even bother with debate. But Juror 8's resistance to such mob mentality and manipulation helps erode the devastating moral righteousness of men like Juror 3 (Lee J. Cobb), whose certainty about the boy's guilt is just one of the many red flags to surface during the proceedings. Slowly but surely, Juror 8 forces each man to look beyond their own prejudices—to question the evidence at hand and to become active participants in the judicial process.What's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from Juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion. As this trend becomes more of a factor, each character begins to show their true colors in relation to the case. Whether it's a bit of blatant racism from Juror 10, extreme hatred from Juror 3, or a sobering plea of humanity from Juror 8, Lumet shoots the most important lines of dialogue in close-up, lingering on the characters' faces for extended moments, establishing the importance of proximity and duration when it comes to dramatic shifts in the story. It's almost as if Fonda's character, and Lumet for that matter, believes these men are smart enough to make the correct decision if given the context and time to carefully consider the ramifications of their actions. Despite some crippling character flaws, laziness and apathy are the only real villains here.Aesthetically, 12 Angry Men is a master class in refurbished cinematic space. It takes a confined, almost completely banal real- world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme. Kaufman's fluid long takes track each character as they leave the table in anger and frustration, the men departing for sporadic moments of personal reflection before returning to the heated discussion. Seemingly simple conversations lead to damning assumptions about ideology and purpose, and each man brings their own set of moral baggage to the table. This allows the location to grow in depth as the characters become more fully developed. In turn, the smooth visuals have a strange effect on the narrative itself; they juxtapose a narrative seamlessness of cause and effect with the building uneasiness in each man, creating a volatile and unpredictable feel that rivals the extreme shifts in weather (from sweltering heat to torrential downpour) beyond the juror room windows.Incredibly, 12 Angry Men was Lumet's feature directorial debut, a fact that remains massively impressive considering the film's meticulous craft and pacing. Harboring just as much compulsive energy and momentum as most modern Hollywood action films, 12 Angry Men makes every shot and line of dialogue count. It's a film immersed in the organic relationship between façade and perspective, how each character tries to hide their own weaknesses by lashing out at others. ""Prejudice always obscures the truth,"" one Juror finally says at the end of the film. As the unnamed men depart and walk down the courthouse steps, it's finally clear that some of them understand how that particularly true statement relates to their own conflicted, ambiguous, and flawed life experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
POWERFUL,"It's a simple yet powerful movie about a jury trying to decide if a young man is guilty of murder. The whole movie takes place in one room, but it's incredibly tense and keeps you hooked the entire time.The acting is excellent, especially Henry Fonda, who plays the juror trying to convince the others to look at the case more carefully. The dialogue is smart and the arguments between the jurors feel real, showing how personal biases and emotions can affect judgment. Even though the film is in black and white and doesn't have any big action scenes, it's still gripping because of how the characters interact and change their minds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
