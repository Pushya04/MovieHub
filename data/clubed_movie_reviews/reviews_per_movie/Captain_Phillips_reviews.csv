Near the top of the Hanks ladder,"Based on true events, Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is the rarest of thrillers, the kind that relies on neither distracting special effects nor circumspect character development. Driven by a powerful, soul-baring performance by the inimitable Tom Hanks, the movie never lags, never oversells the plight of its characters, never reduces anyone or anything to mere caricature.Hanks is the titular captain of the United States container ship MV Maersk Alabama, cruising along the coast of Somalia with a full load and heading toward the horn of Africa. Two skiffloads of armed Somalis close in, ready to board the vessel. They're pirates, working for a warlord in their impoverished country, and they smell opportunity.If this were a standard action flick, we might see the heroism of Phillips and his motley crew as they fight the evil pirates and save the world. It's not so here. There are nuances afoot; for once, we get the perspective of the lead pirate (Barkhad Abdi) without falling into the easy trap of feeling empathy toward him.The pirates board the giant ship, clearly pleased with their find. Muse (Abdi) quickly proves himself to be a strong, humanistic leader; he's single minded (where's the crew? where's the goods?) but not sinister. His gang includes a strong man with a quick temper and Muse's own relative, who'd begged to come along on the mission - a mission that, when successful, would go a long way to improving their lives.The movie is told in two distinct halves: the time spent by the pirates on the Maersk as they search in vain for treasure and crew, and the time spent in the ship's lifeboat as they make their way to Somalia. The villains are conflicted and desperate. And armed. But they're quickly immersed in an impossible situation.This is one of the toughest, most naked performances of Hanks' stellar career. It's sometimes painful and heart wrenching to watch. He's an Everyman, per usual, but he's not also a savior or a hero. He doesn't suddenly develop super strength and overpower the bad guys. He's just a guy in charge of a boat and its passengers.Matching him wit for wit while frantically trying to keep his own wits about him is Abdi as the skinny, intelligent Muse, seemingly a veteran of high piracy (though not against huge container ships). Abdi is a wonder to watch; unpredictable and cunning but a little greedy and rapidly running out of viable options. Truly a talent to look out for, Abdi nails this role.The ending is predictable only in the most general sense. Bill Ray's screenplay does not duck some plausible consequences to the actions of each main player and leaves us with a scene that is as emotionally overpowering as anything in Hanks' previous Philadelphia.It seems that every time Tom Hanks makes a good movie, people begin to label it as ""Oscar bait,"" as if the movie were created just as a vehicle to earn an award. Captain Phillips delivers a tight, action-packed story fraught with none of the usual missteps of the genre, and if it is indeed rewarded with the highest of honors, it will be well deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Pretty Damn Good,"It's fair to say that the movies which have been walking away with Box  Office numbers this year have been either big superhero movies or big  sci-fi movies. If you're wondering whether or not you should go and see  this film because it looks like something a little different DO IT!  This is a film, regardless if you already know the story, which  delivers excellent acting, excellent moments of tension and excellent  use of emotion which ,when you leave the theatre, won't be difficult to  feel at all.  Now if you're still considering whether or not you should go and see  this film, let's address the rumours you might have already heard:  1.There's been a lot of talk about Tom Hanks potentially claiming  another Oscar - yes he simply HAS to be up for contention after this.  True in the first half of the film he doesn't necessarily have to be  all out emotional, but he does enough so that when we reach the second  half and ultimately the final act, we are in as much shock and awe as  the character of Richard Phillips through watching his performance.  2. A few people have said ""too much Tom Hanks."" There's two sides to  this: Obviously he's going to be in the story a lot because he is the  star BUT he doesn't give the only good performance here; the Somali  pirates are truly terrifying, not just because of what they are but  because their characters have a lot of uncertainty making them very  unpredictable.  3. Some people are saying it's overrated and we've seen it all before.  I'm not claiming its the greatest movie ever made, but what I am saying  is its definitely worth a look.  So if you're worried about wasting some cash don't be, it's definitely  a film you won't regret paying for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Exhausting, Thrilling and Powerful.","Paul Greengrass has proved his talents with two fantastic Bourne films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, and two impressive real-life dramas, Bloody Sunday and United 93. Green Zone, while being a little like Bourne in Baghdad, was also a worthy thriller. Captain Phillips sees Greengrass deliver another true story to the big screen, proving that he is indeed the current king of cinematic re-enactments.Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. His Captain Phillips is a professional, serious man that keeps his emotions in check while sternly ensuring his crew understands his expectations. As the situation escalates, his emotions begin to creep through. Leading towards a final release that is both heartbreaking and relieving. Hanks' character isn't explored too deeply, but we are nevertheless with him every step of the way.In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate. We're given more access than expected to this character – to all four pirates for that matter. Abdi manages to evoke empathy from a character that could have easily succumbed to stereotypical villainy. His performance provides a complex level of emotion to the proceedings. He knows that the situation has easily ran away from him, yet he naively decides to re-assure himself – and Captain Phillips – every chance he gets.This is no-nonsense filmmaking of the highest order. Paul Greengrass' kinetic camera rises above the sometimes dizzying approach from some of his last films. The hand-held factor works beautifully here, ensuring the you-are-there level of realism is cranked to a ten at every second. As the events escalate, we are always kept aware of what is happening. While skipper jargon and navy terms are exclaimed every which way, care is placed on making sure we still know exactly what is going on. Billy Ray (Breach, State of Play, The Hunger Games) constructs a taut and clear screenplay that compliments Greengrass' filmmaking style.To call this tense is an understatement. Henry Jackman's score pushes every sequence to an almost unbearable level of tension, Barry Ackroyd's cinematography beautifully captures the sweat and intensity of every moment, and Christopher Rouse's masterful editing brings it all home.Exhausting and thrilling, Captain Phillips is all the more powerful with the knowledge that you're witnessing a true story. Paul Greengrass and co. have crafted an experiential film that you won't be forgetting in a hurry.thereelword.net",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Like a time machine to the year 2009, you'd be taken.","That went a lot higher than my expectations. I was thinking an okay movie, but that was more than just okay. Truly impressive powerful thriller.The movie's strength points could be summed up:1. Greengrass's thrillers are really fine, I like his The Bourne Ultimatum with his shaky camera tricks. And here he is doing it again maybe with different techniques. As a thriller, Greengrass managed to make this movie get on your nerves and put so much tension, and that's a success.2. The Somali crew.. Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Some Somali dudes you have never seen their faces in a movie before come and make such spectacular performances, that's something you should admire. It made the movie so believable that you'd sometimes forget it's just a movie. Barkhad Abdi has made a huge step in his career with this movie and that was crowned by his nomination for the best actor in a supporting role. He probably won't get it, but he deserved it.3. Tom Hanks is just a really fine actor. He was driving the whole thing with his convincing performance. I still can't believe he got my tearing in that scene, or let's just say crying. Greengrass has taken him to squeeze some fine acting skills.4. Fair screenplay that didn't make you forget that justice should be done, no matter how the conditions the person lives in, but it also pushed the eyes to take a look into the world that would produce such people as pirates.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Taut, thrilling and surprising empathetic","What a stunning film - the imminent threat of deadly violence tempered with the tragic circumstances that drive people to such desperate actions made for a very human story.If Hanks is nominated for an Oscar for this, then Barkhad Abdi deserves a nomination too, because their scenes together were electric - never once did Abdi appear the junior party, every bit Hank's equal as two cunning foes trying to outfox one another.The best lines in the film were perhaps when Phillips beseeched of Muse: ""Surely there's something other than fishing and kidnapping people you could do?""To which Muse replied, sombrely: ""In America, maybe"".It's a must see, the best film I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Paul Greengrass directs another tension driven film bringing Tom Hanks to the forefront...,"Hours after the World Premiere of Paul Greengrass' newest psychological thriller ""Captain Phillips,"" my heart is still palpating at a hundred beats per minute. Starring the magnificent Tom Hanks in his finest performance since ""Cast Away,"" this edge-of-your-seat thrill ride lands as one of the best films of the New York Film Festival and the year.An intricate and precisely executed thriller written by Billy Ray, everything about ""Captain Phillips"" works amazingly. It's this year's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in tension and features not one, but two fierce performances from Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi. A loose dramatization and not a fact to fact retelling of a dark day for an American captain, the film takes us through the days Captain Richard Phillips' cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The film unravels itself with a narrative intensity bringing our hero from the day of his departure to the end of his journey. Writer Billy Ray's detailed and well-structured script provides Greengrass to do exactly what he does best in his directorial efforts. There are definite elements in ""Captain Phillips"" that remind me of the emotional and gut- wrenching effect that ""United 93"" had on so many of us nearly seven years ago. While you will have a near heart attack, you will be in tears by the end credits.I haven't been this impressed with the work of Tom Hanks in years. Putting every ounce of his charm to good use but digging deep into a character with such raw and emotional fervency. Hanks' dedication and abilities utilized are the same tools used in his first Oscar-winning performance in ""Philadelphia"" I assure you. It's a turn that could make him this year's Daniel Day-Lewis. As his wife, the beautiful Catherine Keener is regulated to one single scene, at the beginning of our film, where Hanks dominates the conversation. Still a cherry on top if you ask me but not something that many will notice nor remember..Breakthrough performer Barkhad Abdi is simply sensational. With a snarky demeanor as he calls Capt. Phillips ""Irish"" - Abdi plays Muse, a Somali pirate that is layered with pride and disdain for the human condition. Billy Ray gives him such a complexity, hinting at a sensitive undertone but not masking the overtly violent rage that embodies his soul; it's a creative formula that equals an interesting dichotomy. Abdi administers these traits brilliantly.As you expect any Paul Greengrass film to be, the technical executions are top-notch including the intimate Cinematography by Barry Ackroyd and the tight editing of Christopher Rouse, both sure-fire Oscar nominees for awards season.One of the amazing things about ""Captain Phillips"" is the final twenty minutes or so. Pent-up emotion that has built for nearly two hours, our hero's last moments with the audience are both triumphant and incredibly vulnerable. This is when Tom Hanks shows his true power as one of the finest actors to grace our screens. I admire the man. He captures the real human condition, both in courage and in the face of defeat. How would you react in what you thought could be your final moments on Earth? Who would you think about? What about if you did make it? Would you be so overcome with emotion that you couldn't focus on the blanket of safety that surrounds you, or would you just crumble into the fetus position, wanting to return to your place of origin? ""Captain Phillips"" renewed my love of the movies. It's what breathes life into my daily routine. It fascinates us and which is why, no matter how terrible our lives are, or how the economy falls beneath our feet, cinema still lives. Free as a bird. I'm in awe of all of this. I feel privileged to share those moments. Not to be hyperbolic or put focus on the Oscar race, which is what I do for a living, but ""Captain Phillips"" showed me what Tom Hanks really means to cinema. Our lives are habitual and ordinary at times, yet someone, every now and again, has the ability to capture those little quirks of our own selves. I think Hanks is this generation's treasure that will be remembered for years to come. I'm in near tears as I write this now. Paul Greengrass brought me personally into a situation that I will likely never be in and examined my frail and defenseless spiritual nature. Connection. That's what cinema is about. Few films do this. Many never will.To get off the somber note, ""Captain Phillips"" is filled with high- levels of tension. Bring your defibrillator and a bottle of Xanex to make it through the picture as your heart will be beating outside of your chest. In so many ways, it's the perfect film. Real life, authentic characters, and a cast and crew that show up to deliver some of their finest works. A dynamite lesson of the human psyche.""Captain Phillips"" opens in theaters October 11.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Challenging Fortitude,"Captain Phillips is a biopic based on 2009's Maersk Alabama hijacking incident, which was an intriguing story and ordeal of the people involved. This film adaptation mostly plays as a straightforward thriller with only brief backstories. In spite of whatever comment regards to the accuracy this film is getting, it didn't hurt how much of an exhilarating piece of cinema this is. Merits obviously goes to director Paul Greengrass and star Tom Hanks. It's quite predictable what you'll get if you put those talents together, but the result is somehow surprising like you've never see it coming.There's nothing much interesting happening at the first act when the film was exploring the personal life of Richard Phillips, but that seems to be the point: the dreariness of the intro immediately presumes that he really is just an ordinary guy. Though, there isn't actually enough detail about his personal life in those scenes aside of his job and his family, same with the Somali pirate leader, Muse. Everything becomes more alive when the actual plot starts going. Lives turn upside down, tension rises every minute passes, and the humanity of both Phillips and Muse are becoming more and more visible. It's a down to earth matter of life and death where both sides aren't too perfect enough to succeed or survive, and their actions could end up causing even worse situations.Even before the release, everybody has already been betting that Tom Hanks will get a nod for this(probably because of the accent or he's just Tom Hanks). Other than mimicking the real Phillips' accent, Hanks really gives his character a palpable sense of fear and pressure. But there is one scene in his performance that will definitely give the viewers a total impact, which it might've made the camera linger. That whole scene could be a trick for some to love this movie even more, but even without it, Hanks is still spellbinding as Captain Phillips. Another amazing performance is first time actor, Barkhad Abdi. Abdi manages to be threatening, sympathetic, and strangely charismatic at the same time as Muse, thus it makes the character more effective.Now for Greengrass, his aesthetics are all there. Shaky camera bringing momentum in every action scene, action scenes filled with nerve wracking suspense, and sidelines taking place in control rooms. But this is his challenging side, such as United 93, when there aren't any much explosions nor fighting set pieces practically involved. The title might give one an assumption that the film is about a captain who fights off pirates. But it turns out, they're just hopeless victims who do not have a single gun to defend themselves from their armed enemies. The kind of thrill here is anxiety. You will always get the sense that there is something wrong going to happen in every step these pirates take, leading the hostages really need to depend on the government and the Navy SEALs. What's smart about this is it's all mind games. They're troubled by complicated decisions, yet have awareness of naivety. At the second half, the excitement is now relied by figuring out which of them is going to be fooled by whose tricks. By the end of the film, you will then realize how limitlessly enticing it was while realistic at the same time.Captain Phillips is almost just a very great thriller, then it eventually becomes more powerful. Despite of calling his achievement heroism, it was more like a test of courage. The movie is wise to make sure Phillips is no glossy superhero, but a regular human being who gets to face a situation that may lead anyone to trauma, just to sacrifice the risks of his crew. Simply, that may tend to inspire which is why it's so focused to his point of view. Otherwise, the filmmaking did an astonishing job, although you already know what these people can bring. But surprisingly, it still defies our expectations. It's amazing how Tom Hanks' talent can still surprise many, and how Paul Greengrass' obvious style feels unique and fresh (in this movie, at least). Rating the film can be somewhat difficult. It's so engrossing and excellent, it's hard to notice any terrible flaws about it. Later on, it doesn't matter. Captain Phillips is a satisfying ride that ultimately does its best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

On Board With Modern-Day Pirates!,"""Captain Phillips"" is the Hollywood retelling of the true-to-life 2009 harrowing story of an American container vessel Maersk Alabama (with Captain Richard Phillips at the helm) being held hostage by Somali pirates. The screenplay by Billy Ray was based on the novel ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Richard Phillips himself.Playing the titular character, Tom Hanks is what this film is all about. He starts off simply, playing Capt. Phillips as a family man and seasoned seaman on a routine delivery. However when the pirates came, you see him transform into a cool-under-pressure leader and shrewd tactician, matching wits with these desperate aggressors. In the last five minutes, Hanks would give us an unexpected display of emotion which may well deliver him another Oscar for Best Actor.The four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. They play with wild-eyed and feral intensity, really scary. Barkhad Abdi plays their skinny foolhardy leader Muse, engaging Phillips in a deadly chess game, toe-to-toe. Faysal Ahmed plays the hot-headed Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the young recruit Bilal, getting himself a baptism of fire on his first time out.When I saw the name director Paul Greengrass in the credits, I understood why the sense of tension and urgency were so well-conveyed. This was that familiar sense of excitement we felt in his previous films, like the last two Jason Bourne films or that suspenseful 9/11 drama ""United 93"". He really knows how to make military operations exciting on screen, as he did for the Army in ""Green Zone"" and the Navy SEALS in this film.I have to admit I was on the verge of getting seasick with the shakiness of the camera, but luckily I held on despite the two-hour length of the film set at sea.Overall, this is a different sort of adventure drama, with a topic not too commonly tackled in a mainstream film. We hear of these events on the news, but this film brings us right in the middle of one. We will feel the tension building as the pirates were approaching. We will feel the fear when the pirates were on board. We will feel the desperation and the frustration of being trapped in the middle of the open ocean with no help immediately forthcoming. If you are up for such a realistic experience, then this film is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Very tense & makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I say B+.,"""It was supposed to be easy. I take over ship, get paid, no one gets hurt."" In 2009 a Somali named Muse (Abdi) is in trouble and needs to get money for his boss fast or face the consequences. His plan is to hijack a cargo ship and hold it ransom until he gets his money. When he boards a ship captained by Rich Phillips (Hanks) he thinks he found his answer to his problems, but things only get worse for all involved. This is a true story. It's always more fun to watch a movie that is also a true story and even better when you see one that you remember the events when it was happening. As far as the movie goes it starts off pretty slow but grows more and more tense as it goes on. As great an actor as Tom Hanks is I found myself thinking that this is really a part that many people could pull off. Then I watched the last 20 minutes and realized why they got Hanks. Much like the movie Apollo 13, when you watch a movie that you know how it ends but still end up shedding a tear it is because of great filmmmaking. This falls into that category. A movie that builds momentum the entire time. Starts off slow but by the end you are hoping for more. I liked it. Overall, tense and makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I give it a B+.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Not Flawless, But Perhaps Oscar-Worthy","The true story of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.After seeing ""Captain Phillips"", I can only call it 2013's version of ""Argo"", with a little bit of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" mixed in. Although, it is not as entertaining as ""Argo"" (with good reason) and not as densely technical as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (perhaps a good thing).While it may be fair to critique the film for historical accuracy, this is one time I am not going to do so. The captain has his story, the crew has theirs, and the military and pirates probably see it other ways, too. But the film is called ""Captain Phillips"" and is based on his book, so the film's only goal was to tell his story, whether or not it matches the facts completely.There are two negative things that must be said about the film. The first is that the shaking camera is all wrong. While I understand that this makes sense for hectic, tense scenes, it is completely unnecessary to use at all times. Perhaps the effect was intended to make the audience feel they were really there, but it came across as more annoying and was ultimately a poor cinematography decision.The second issue is how long some scenes run, and as much as five minutes could have been cut. This is forgivable, however, given how much the suspense pays off in the final act. While the audience may get bored if their attention span is weak, they will wake up in the fast-paced finale (which is far more fitting from a director known for the ""Bourne"" franchise).With regards to the Oscar nominations, I have no opinion on its three technical categories and cannot fairly judge Billy Ray's adapted screenplay without reading the book (though I think his finished product is quite good and likely deserved the nod).In the acting category, it is surprising to see Tom Hanks get overlooked when he was awarded by many other groups (including the Golden Globes). Between this and ""Saving Mr. Banks"", many people saw this as a banner year for Hanks. Hanks is a difficult person to judge with regards to acting because his face is so recognizable and therefore he is seen as Hanks rather than his character. But with the intensity -- and actually getting vomited on for the role -- this was his best work in years and it is unfortunate he was overlooked.Barkhad Abdi has been nominated for a variety of supporting actor awards, including an Oscar. I am torn on this universal praise. While I think he certainly would earn the ""debut"" or ""breakout"" award if one existed, was he the best supporting actor in 2013? Perhaps not. Abdi will never be an A-lister and may not even pursue further acting, so it is great to see the recognition... but to win? Perhaps not.And as for Best Picture, this just is not going to happen. Despite some strong performances and an incredible attention to detail with regards to how the ship and military operate, this is not a ""best"" picture, and its nomination was even questionable. Worth seeing yes, but best picture no. The Golden Globes gave the film four nominations and zero wins; I suspect the Academy will follow a similar decision-making process.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Tense and engaging even if a little longer than needed and perhaps ""Bayed"" the ending in a way it didn't need to do","Although it is basically a true story, I must be one of the few who did not know the ending already, since I had never heard this specific story. How much it matters if you already do or not I cannot say, but for me the film was not really about the resolution until near the end because for most of the time it is about the moment and what is going on there and then. It does this by breaking the story down pretty well into such contained but yet connected moments so that it is effective at the time and also has a flow to it.There are moments where it doesn't really keep that up – some of them it needs, but others it doesn't. In the tension and in the lulls, the film does well to keep things evenly balanced so that you don't completely turn against the Somalis as if they were generic baddies, but at the same time it never pushes anything down your throat about their situation. The one thing I was surprised that it came on strong about was the military response. I'm not sure if the film was trying to make a comment by playing it quite so ""Hollywood"" at the end, but to me it did feel a bit odd in the film to have the music, camera-work and dialogue of a Michael Bay movie occurring in a situation where they were facing down a couple of guys with more feet than shoes. It still worked, don't get me wrong, but at the same time it had a generic feel to this aspect that I could have done without – particularly since earlier it seemed smarter than that.What helps it in these moments (and throughout) is that Hanks is great. He plays it out in a natural and convincing way, whether he is over- confident or in shock. Much has been made of Abdi's performance and I do see why, because it is frequently easy to forget that he is acting because he does seem quite real throughout. The supporting cast perhaps have fewer opportunities for nuance but they are still convincing and play their parts well, particularly those in the confines of the lift raft.Captain Phillips could have been a little shorter and been better for it and, while I don't totally see the film that others did, I did still enjoy it. It is tense and yet nuanced throughout, only really producing some aspects that don't work quite as well in the meantime.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This is indeed Africa,"In the great Leonardo DiCaprio film Blood Diamond, the standard explanation for why the political situation is so screwed up in that continent wherever you go it was simply T I A, This is Africa. And one of the most screwed up places in that continent is Somalia which has not had an effective central government in years now.It's a country totally devolved now with a bunch of warlords, some with ties to Moslem supremacist groups, others have no ideology but profit. With no government to rein them in, some on the coast have discovered that piracy is an effective way of making money.So what starts out as two small skiffs with outboard motors and four men in each boat turns into one skiff with four armed men who get lucky and find a whole in the boat's defenses and board the USS Maersk Alabama, a freighter with a good cargo and commanded by Tom Hanks playing the real life Captain Richard Phillips who becomes a hostage of the pirates as they leave in one of the ship's lifeboats.After that it becomes a battle of wits between Hanks and pirate leader Barkhad Abdi and will the US Navy effect a rescue. This battle is at the heart of Captain Phillips. This man is mister average American, no superhero and doesn't claim to be. His responses to these volatile pirates are a matter of having his training kick in.What I did not understand is why a merchant freighter going into those waters was not armed. Certainly in World War II eventually they were armed. I wouldn't advocate arming our whole merchant fleet but when you're sailing in waters like off the Somali coast it would seem the prudent thing to do.Tom Hanks gives a wonderful performance leading a very well cast film showing sailors and pirates caught up in a bad situation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It's been a while since I have been this tense,First off I would like to say that this is one of my favorite movie of all times and I'm usually extremely picky when it comes to movies. It exceeded my expectation in every single way possible and let's just say I had a really high expectation to begin with.The acting in this movie was stunning. Hank did an amazing job as a likable Captain Phillips while Barkhad exceeds in his character as a scary villain yet someone who we feel like deserves our empathy too. The production design in this movie is really well done and the directing is FREAKING amazing.The pacing of this movie is great and I loved the way they delivered the climax. The way they blend the emotion and tension in this movie was pretty balance without over doing it.My experience with this movie is honestly one of the best two hours of my life. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie through and thanks to the great performance I could feel that I was in the same boat as Captain Phillips (no puns intended). This is truly a great movie and I would recommend it to everyone who likes thrillers because this is one heck of one!,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""They're not here to fish""","While we were fighting terrorists in two different theaters of war after the 9/11 attacks, nobody could have anticipated than an old-world form of terrorism, namely high-seas piracy, would come back in style. But that's what befell the crew of the American cargo ship Maersk Alabama in April 2009, when four Somali pirates took over their vessel, resulting in a three-day ordeal in which the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, was held hostage for a $10 million ransom. That ransom was never paid; and a team of Navy Seals managed to end the crisis by killing the four pirates, who had been holding Phillips hostage in an escape boat less than two hundred miles from the Somali coast. Phillips and his crew, however, all survived the horrific ordeal, shaken but alive. This is the true story told in the movie CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, based on the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" by Phillips and co-writer Stephan Talty.Effectively directed by Paul Greengrass, whose penchant for docudrama was perhaps best established in the much-lauded, and intense, 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stars Tom Hanks in the title role, of the captain who, aware that armed Somali pirates were present in the waters of the Indiana Ocean some six hundred miles east of Somalia, urges his crew to keep a lookout for any skiffs that seem to contain armed men. One such group, led by Abdi, approaches them; but through some skillful maneuvers, they manage to evade them. The next day, however, the Maersk Alabama isn't so lucky. Armed with automatic weaponry and with a better knowledge of American cargo ship tactics, Abdi and his four companions board the ship and hold Hanks and a few others hostage (this while Hanks has managed to get the rest of his crew below deck and out of sight. When one of the hijackers gets his foot badly injured by broken glass, Hanks urges them to get help, and leaves with them in the ship's escape boat. The pirates believe that Hanks is willing to be a hostage in an act of self-sacrifice; but all along, his crew on the Maersk Alabama, are tailing him and his captors; and the decision is made from Washington to end the crisis by the use of the Navy's elite Seal Team Six (the same one that would, in 2011, track down and kill Osama Bin-Laden). It all comes down to a fierce confrontation within a hundred miles of the Somali coastline.The same sense of realism that infused UNITED 93 also informs CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, with Greengrass and his director of photography Ackroyd doing things largely in the same documentary, almost cinema verite, style that had worked for both UNITED 93 and Greengrass' 2002 docudrama BLOODY Sunday. Just as much of the success of the film, however, is also owed to the incredible Everyman performance of Hanks in the title role. His ability to do the Everyman role, exemplified in his portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 Ron Howard classic APOLLO 13, works out quite well for him; and Barkhad Abdi makes for a particularly great adversary. There is a real sense of Greengrass, as he had done on UNITED 93 (as well as Hanks on APOLLO 13) of not wanting to do everything in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS as your typical Hollywood action blockbuster, and the end result, along with an intense score by Henry Jackman (which also interpolates the climactic cue of John Powell's score for UNITED 93) being the icing on this cake, is a tremendous piece—indeed, one of the best films of 2013, in the final analysis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Moderately Entertaining,"This movie left me a little underwhelmed. It was watchable but nothing exciting or amazing. The second half of the movie seems to drag on for far too long. Additionally, I thought the characters weren't developed all that much. Who are these pirates and why do they do what they do? Money, yeah I get that. But I would have liked to see more development. Same goes for the Cap's crew. Who are they? Why should we care if they get captured or killed? The movie doesn't really do a good job of drawing me into the characters or their backgrounds. It plays more like a dramatized news story, or a rescue 911 extended episode. Interesting, but quickly forgettable.I will, however, commend the actors on their fine acting. Especially the final scene in which Tom Hanks really gives a great performance in the one moment the movie actually made me care about anything that was happening on the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Magnificently Brilliant  Thriller That Will keep you on the edge of your seat,"Based on a true story, this Magnificently Brilliantly orchestrated Thriller by Paul Greengrass will keep you on the edge of your seat!This film ticks every box. Tom Hanks is perfect.He knows what he is doing as an actor portraying a captain who is responsible for other lives. I could not see a better person in this role.The action runs throughout the movie.Not a moment to take a deep breath.Although you know how the movie ends ,just like with Argo or Titanic,you still are awaiting the next move and the next scene.The Somali Pirates (although I have not been ""lucky"" to meet any) could not be more closer to reality .Most of them have minimal to none experience in acting,yet they do a magnificent job.

A superb and fascinating thriller with a top-drawer acting by Tom Hanks,"This is a powerful and intensely watchable film , a masterful exercise in building tension . Director Paul Greengrass has established himself as a huge talent . This is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years . The first encounter with the young Somalis who chase and board the gigantic Maersk Alabama is on the shores of their homeland, delving , briefly but significantly , into the poverty that drives fishermen to risk life and limb in pursuit of deep sea big game . As the crew of an American cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates who proceed to engage in escalating negotiations with authorities to get a lot of money . Amongst the men on board are the ship's captain who along with the rest of the seamen are taken hostage in a cynical game of life and death.It's a grade A picture , a gem , absorbing , riveting , highly moving , incredibly tense . This is a psychological drama in which a group of violent pirates demand for a ransom of millions of dollars , it unfolds a battle of wits between the crew of the shipping company and the Somali pirates . This is a smart and sensitive thriller filled with noisy action , thrills , emotion and very entertaining though overlong . Thrilling as well as exciting confrontation of wits between captain Phillips , seamen and pirates , who gradually come to up more and more . This drama about the capture on the high seas of an American ship is doubtless the most exciting one that has ever come down the pike about . This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the relentless sea maneuvers of a freighter pursued by a band of pirates and the captain's subsequent kidnapping . The picture makes up for it with an evolving atmosphere of anxiety and fear .Everything in Paul Greengrass's impressive film looks so real that you might think it's a high resolution videotape of a pirate hijacking . Interesting screenplay , being based upon the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" . And the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and hostage-taking of Captain Phillips were also central to the Elmore Leonard novel Djibouti (2010). The timing of the release coincides with the theatrical release of a Danish movie titled ""Kapringen"" or ¨A Hijacking¨ (2012) by Tobias Lindholm dealing with similar events . Top-notch performance by Tom Hanks as a clever as well astute captain along with a remaining support cast formed by unknown African players . Tom Hanks says the first time he met the actors playing the Somali pirates was when they started filming the pirates taking over the bridge , Paul Greengrass mentioned he did this intentionally to build up tension between the actors on board the ship and the actors playing the Somaili pirates. In ¨Captain Phillips¨ there is the urgent hand-held camera-work, a directorial trademark refined and perfected by cameraman Barry Ackroyd , which lends an air of pseudo-documentary authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions, putting us right there in the huddle of the action . Furthermore , a tense as well as enjoyable musical score by Henry Jackman .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Paul Greengrass who proved his action aesthetics and nail-biting filmmaking as well as he formerly made in ¨Green zone¨, ¨The Bourne ultimatum¨ , ¨United 93¨, ¨Bourne supremacy¨ , ¨Bloody Sunday¨, among others . Rating : Above average , a magnificent film . Essential and indispensable seeing . The picture will appeal to Tom Hanks fans .",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Captivating,Shocked to learn this was based on a true story and kicking myself for not watching it in the cinema when it came out. Captain Phillips is gripping from start to end. Tom Hanks shows us why he is one of the best in the business with his emotional portrayal of Captain Philipps. Some solid performances from the rest of the cast as well. I feel this film is a bit underrated in terms of the exposure and accolades it got.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
darn i hate shaky cameras,"I went to the movie on release day. Primarily to watch Tom Hanks performance and to enjoy thriller. To my surprise it was one of those movies like Chronicle, United-93 etc. It is shot with shaky cam. There should be some suggestion or warning sort of thing to warn the audience that it is a queasy cam movie. I came out of theater with in 10 minutes. I didn't expect Tom Hanks movie to be a queasy cam movie. I felt bad because I couldn't watch Tom Hanks movie. And my money is wasted. There should be a genre for shaky cam movies like we have for comedy, thriller etc movies. I will wait to watch this on my laptop after blue ray print is out on market.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One heck of a boat ride,"DIRECTION Love him or hate him, this is arguably Paul Greengrass' best movie to date. As with all of his movies, you need to get ready to be up close and personal. Greengrass loves having the camera right up in people's faces but it puts you right into the middle of the action and increases the intensity that this movie brings. And let me tell you, it is intense. It's not long before the drama starts to unfold and you get the feeling of ""uh oh"". How Greengrass gets amazing performances out of unknown actors, and even military personnel who didn't know they were going to be in a movie, is beyond me. And it's some of the little things that add up as well. For example, the gun marks left of Tom Hanks' head after a gun was pressed up against it, just so you know the danger is real. The use of the military was amazing, and while it's not too in-depth, it's incredible what they had to do to execute this rescue. Greengrass perhaps took some liberties with some things, but the way he tells this story is incredible and extremely effective.Grade: A+SCRIPT The story here, like Gravity, is pretty simple on the surface. Four Somali pirates invade a cargo ship, kidnap it's Captain and try to get back home to negotiate for a lot of money. However, this story is much more complex than that. Outside of the political game that was played off-screen, it's the relationship dynamics between the pirates and Captain Phillips that bring depth to the story. We learn that these pirates are not working for themselves, but for a Somali gang Lord who is using them to get money and goods for the tribes. And it's the pressure from these gang leaders that pushes these pirates to the brink which ended up being a huge disaster. The U.S. Navy gets involved and they begin a rescue operation, which ends up being one of the more incredible stories you'll ever see. As for Captain Phillips, he's calm at the beginning and is confident when the U.S. Navy shows up. He makes some questionable decisions that really puts his life in danger but at the same time you know he just really wants to get out of there. The dialogue for this script is awesome, believable and ironic at time. Everything flows together seamlessly and it gets intense. You may or may not end up caring for any of these pirates, but in the end it's all about Captain Phillips and the amazing rescue that ensues.Grade: APERFORMANCES This is Tom Hanks best performance in a decade. He's absolutely incredible as Captain Phillips. He has the accent down, all the mannerisms and brings an emotional depth I haven't seen from him in awhile. The scene he has at the end is a reminder why he's an Oscar winner and a beloved actor. While the story from the military side is incredible, this is the Tom Hanks show and he brings it on screen. As for Barkhad Abdi, a first-time actor, let's just say if he is nominated for supporting roles, I won't be surprised. For never acting before, him and his Somali friends are amazing and steal the show in their own right. They have a lot of screen time, some back story, and even put them in a light where you may like them on some level. And it's not just the character writing. The performances make these characters a little likable, a little hatable and bring them to life. There is depth to these performances and for actors who've never done this before, they are almost flawless. When you combine that with Tom Hanks, get ready for an amazing boat ride thriller. Also just to note, Greengrass used real military personnel that didn't know they were going to be in a movie, but you can hardly tell. Just wanted to throw that out there. Grade: A+SCORE The score here was done by Henry Jackman. Need I say more? Jackman is the Peyton Manning of movie composers. Or maybe that's Hans Zimmer? If not Manning, he's the Aaron Rogers of movie composers. He's always reliable and is incredible with anything he puts his hands too and he doesn't disappoint here. While not the most memorable of scores by Jackman, it brings an amazing intensity that the movie needed and has some great musical elements. I love Jackman's use of drums in the action elements to really bring it when needed. There's some African vibes to some tracks and it's the type of score that is perfect for this movie.Grade: AFINAL THOUGHTS Captain Phillips is one of the most amazing films of the year so far and is driven by incredible performances from Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. The story, while maybe not 100% accurate, is still amazing, intense and one that you'll love to see. The military rescue is unbelievable and the execution is almost hard to believe. It's like this story played out in a way that was meant to be a movie script. And the movie was very good.Overall Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Another Oscar for Tom Hanks ?,"Just came back from the screening of Captain Phillips.Directed by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Ultimatum) with the same non-stop action and intensity he is known for.I was glued to the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.

The night scenes gave the move an eerie look of reality.The interaction of Hanks and his crew felt so real life.Tom Hanks is simply an amazing actor.

Interesting story but slightly boring.,While I did like this movie I thought it wasn't very consistent. There were moments when I was bored and moments when the story was heightened with suspense. Obviously you can't go changing the boring moments of a true story but maybe they could have condensed the movie down to an hour and a half. The story would have been told without stretching it out for no apparent reason.Aside from the storyline the actors were really good. You expect that from Tom Hanks but the hijackers were the ones who really stole the show for me. They were very realistic and believable.

Exiting and engaging the whole way through!,"I find this movie truly engaging the whole way through. The excellent performances, screen play and production team made a masterpiece of a movie that is deserving of a perfect score.One of the best traits of the movie is the way they personify the villains through the dialogue. They are not portrayed just ""bad guys"" but are humans pushed into a corner and are trying to make ends meet.It's one of those screenplays that shows you things for what they are in a very pure and objective way. Allowing the viewer to question what they'd do in their shoes.The music selection is perfectly tame, it never pushes scenes forward they simply underline the moods in very subtle ways. In some instances the use of pure silence causes some very impactful moments without the need of a ""wow this just happened"" sound effect/music movies often use. Truly a breath of fresh air. This movie will be relevant for many generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A missed opportunity but two great performances.,"Paul Greengrass has nearly made a very good movie. Tom Hanks puts in a lifetime best performance as the captain of a ship subjected to a fairly inept Somalian Pirate hijack. The concluding scene is arguably worth the ticket price alone but we have a rather unevenly judged journey to traverse before we get there.The opening scenes as the captain leaves his wife for a month at sea are unconvincing and not really very believably scripted but the film quickly settles into itself on board the Maersk container ship that Phillips has to steer Southwards along the Somalian Coast and around the Crook of Africa.We are then, in cinema verite style, (ie shaky camera) introduced to a band of Somalian mercenary pirates, brilliantly cast by Francine Maisler. The chief protagonist in this motley crew is Muse played by the raggedy and waif-like Barkhad Abdi. Throughout he engages us with his his mix of vulnerability and venom. It's another great performance.Inevitably the pirates board the ship (well obviously - so hardly a spoiler) but both the build up and the time on board are strangely unexciting.(Dare I say it, almost a tad dull?)Without spoiling the plot the movie moves significantly through the gear box in the second half as things get a lot more claustrophobic and significantly more epic.It nearly excites.But it doesn't really.This movie feels like a missed opportunity. Despite Hanks and Abdi it's not a gripper and it needs to be. It has no real political insight or judgement. The 'baddies' are, aside from Abdi, caricatures; at times resonant of the Islamic terrorists portrayed so hilariously in Four Lions. American imperialism is celebrated rather than challenged.It has its moments (not least the magnificent closing scene) but overall it's no more than a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Great Duel between ""Captains""","In 2009, Captain Richard ""Rich"" Phillips (Tom Hanks) of the US-flagged Container Ship Maersk Alabama is navigating in international waters near the Somali coast and he notes that Somali pirates are following his ship. Captain Phillips tries to escape but four Somali pirates reach the deck and hijack his vessel. Phillips hides his crew in the engine room and the Somali pirate Captain Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the violent Najee (Faysal Ahmed), the teenager Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) and Emil (Mahat M. Ali) come to the wheelhouse and find only Phillips, his First Mate and another crew member. Muse demands money and Phillips offers him US$ 30,000.00 that are in the safe. Muse decides to seek out the crew, but the situation is reverted and he is captured. The Chief Engineer proposes to exchange Muse per Phillips and they offer the lifeboat and the money to the pirates. However Muse kidnaps Philips and takes him hostage to the lifeboat. The duel between the American and the Somali captains has just begun.""Captain Phillips"" is a dramatic thriller based on the true story of the first American ship hijacked by Somali pirates. The story is engaging and holds the attention until the last scene, despite the 134 minutes running time. The characters are well developed and the duel between Philips and Muse is excellent. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Capitão Phillips"" (""Captain Phillips"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Stunning, taut, nail-biting. First serious Oscar contender this year?","Films are frequently, cruelly judged by their final twenty minutes. Movies live and die by the impact the final scenes have upon their audiences, regardless of the immense power or utter guff that went before. By those rules, Captain Phillips clears ten stars effortlessly. The audible expressions of emotion last night were testament to that. However, unlike many 'feel-good' films that merely satisfy at the end after hollow beginnings, the film that just might win Tom Hanks his third Oscar surfs a wave of near perfection from first light to setting sun.Yes, Captain Phillips is that good!Based on actual events, though how accurate is open to much speculation and a substantial lawsuit, Captain Phillips depicts the hijacking of the American container ship Maersk Alabama in 2009 by pirates off the coast of Somalia. When two boats are spotted heading at speed directly at his vessel, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) attempts a futile defence with fire hoses before instructing his crew to hide in the ship's bowels while he negotiates with the Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi).What follows is a battle of wills against circumstances with Phillips desperately trying to save his ship and the lives of his crew and himself, while Muse argues and threatens for a multi-million ransom, knowing that failure means imprisonment in the USA or death at the hands of his bosses.The trailer suggests an action-packed join-the-dots drama where good must surely triumph over evil and where right and wrong are clear-cut, but with Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum, Green Zone) at the helm, there is nothing predictable or cheesy about Captain Phillips. The opening scenes with Phillips and his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener) simply establish the man and his character while eschewing obvious references and strands to be alluded to and tied up at the conclusion. But beyond the initial five minutes, the tension rises, agitation sets in and terror scrapes at the nerves.There are many clichés that could be used (nail-biting, edge of the seat) to describe Captain Phillips. It is a film of true horror where we watch with fingernails digging into our palms and buttocks clenched tightly. A small part of the mind thinks ""Thank God it isn't me,"" while the bigger part is too caught up in the events to give a damn about anything else. Greengrass has excelled himself (again!) with the nerve-jangling events that are far too realistic to be comfortable viewing.This is no gung-ho, ""America, f*** yeah!"", Act of Valor propaganda bilge. Captain Phillips is raw, real and difficult viewing at times. We are so used to the SAS, Navy SEALs or Marines bursting onto the scene in a barrage of gunfire and explosions to save the day that the quiet, arrival of the SEALs is unnerving. There's no panoply, just a cold, quiet, calculated arrival. They do the job and depart so silently and matter-of-factly that they could be plumbers gathering their tools after mending the sink. It is chilling to see such a perfunctory display in the midst of harrowing circumstances.Captain Phillips is Hanks' film through and through. He dominates with a presence that commands our attention and shakes us into a numb silence. The odd Larry Crowne aside, Hanks is a solid actor worthy of (most of) his plaudits, but his performance as the titular character has greater intensity and completeness than we've seen from him since The Road to Perdition, or perhaps even Saving Private Ryan. Phillips' terror at the hands of his abductors and the dread of probable murder are palpable enough in Hanks' performance, but the emotional maelstrom he suffers in the final act is too convincing, too real to suppress the throat lump and dampened eyes.But Hanks is so convincing in part because he has fine performances to play against, not least of all former taxi driver Abdi in his acting debut. The lines may be lost sometimes, the delivery occasionally stilted, but we never once forget that he is the man holding the gun. We know his Muse is in the wrong; piracy is a crime. Period. But he conveys Muse's own rising panic that this job might just go south and, if it does, that the repercussions will be far more serious than his village simply going hungry.Henry Jackman's (Man on a Ledge) score intensifies the tautness crafted by Billy Ray's screenplay and honed by Greengrass' superb direction. It never overpowers us but adds depth to the visuals and heightens the emotional state.Captain Phillips works as a companion piece to the little-seen Danish film, Kapringen (A Hijacking) earlier this year. But where as Captain Phillips takes us deep into the frantic mechanics of the hostage situation from the crew's point of view, Kapringen is a slower, quieter film that covers many, many weeks from the 'safe' perspective of the shipping company and negotiators. It, too, is intense and puts the viewer on edge but in a quieter, moodier way than Captain Phillips. Regard it as preparation before the main event.There is a slight possibility that Oscar may nod at Kapringen, and a nomination might be just, but it's far less of a risk to predict that Hanks will earn yet another nomination. If the Academy does see fit to award him his third Best Actor Oscar, to match Daniel Day-Lewis, rest assured, he will deserve it for substantially more than the final twenty minutes.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An overlong middle hour ruins a potentially great film,"Captain Phillips - ** 1/2* Based upon a real event, Captain Phillips recreates the hijacking of an American Cargo ship by Somalian pirates in 2009. The film was slow and tedious in parts while being exciting and effective in others. Unfortunately for me the tedious far outweighed the exciting, and I found this film to be somewhat of a disappointment.The film sets it's premise excellently; the short scene between Phillips and his wife humanizes the Captain and gives Greengrass space to develop. We soon come to see Phillips as a hardworking, capable Captain with a very strict handle on his crew. The tension then begins to build as the plot begins to develop, and I was very much involved with the film at this stage.It is once the film gets right into the thick of its content that all the good work at the beginning is undone, and the tension begins to evaporate, causing the film to be incredibly tedious in some parts. Especially through the middle hour, I would have been quite content to fall asleep - it really was that slow.Despite some of the film's weaknesses, Greengrass does an excellent job of developing his two central characters, and the pirates are depicted brilliantly; neither villains nor heroes - just men doing their job. Billy Ray's screenplay also provides for some fantastic interaction between the two men, and some of the film's best viewing comes through in the intelligent, effective conversation between the two.Hanks does an unsurprisingly excellent job, and newcomer Barkhad Abdi's gritty portrayal of the head pirate is really quite astounding, more so considering that this is his Hollywood debut. If it were not for an overlong second half which completely eases the tension, Captain Phillips could have been a much better film. Despite this it is still decent - if not boring - seaside viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Pass the Popcorn review,"Captain Phillips is a movie based on a true story, and on the book Richard Phillips himself wrote after the events that occurred in 2009: his cargo ship was attacked by Somali pirates, and after that he was taken hostage in a lifeboat, while the pirates awaited ransom and the US Navy tried to save Mr Phillips. Apparently, this movie is an Oscar contender, and many hail it as the best this year. I'm definitely not these people: Captain Phillips is a good movie, but it should have been better to be worthy of an Oscar. On the other hand, since the Oscars are often given to every Tom, Dick and Harry with no apparent reason, we might have a winner here – which, compared to some other movies this year, may truly be one of the most worthy of the award.There's not much to say about the story that I haven't already said. The movie starts by depicting Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) as a family man, traveling to the airport with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) whom he loves very much, talking about their grown-up children and how it's never easy to part. It would have been nice to see Phillips' family again later in the movie – that would have added even more emotion to the story. Also, this is a lovely sequence, and I think people in a long-distance relationship will appreciate it the most. Mr Phillips reaches the Sultanate of Oman in the next scene, and gets aboard the MV Maersk Alabama – a cargo ship – with his crew. They know they will have to travel close to the coast of Somalia to get to their destination, so they are ready in case of pirate attacks. Unfortunately, after a first failed attempt, four Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), manage to get on board and take part of the crew hostage – and so a battle of wits begins.First of all, it's nice to get a true story that's really interesting and worth watching, once in a while. Too often do directors seem to think that, if they put ""based on a true story"" somewhere before the opening credits, the movie that follows will be able to grip the audience and make it automatically feel for the characters. The director Paul Greengrass is really working hard to make you feel the tension, the fear and everything else the characters are feeling – as if you were there with them. For example, the scenes in which the pirates try, and eventually manage, to get aboard the ship are able to make you so nervous you need to take a pill to calm down. Therefore, it's really baffling how such a movie, with such a story, can get so boring so often. Apart from the fact that it's unnecessary long – over 2 hours! – some scenes are obviously lengthened for no apparent reason (except to make the movie longer?). Generally, it's very difficult to stay focused for so long, and it's even more difficult when you have nothing to keep you interested. And since even Escape Plan managed to be constantly entertaining and interesting, Captain Phillips' boringness can't be justified.While, like I said, I don't think Captain Phillips deserves an Oscar as a movie, Tom Hanks just might get a well-deserved one for best actor. I've never liked him in particular, but here he proves to be a great actor, as he carries the whole movie and is impressively spontaneous and believable in his main role. Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, the pirate gang leader, is amazing in his first-ever role as the main antagonist. Perhaps the best characteristic of this movie is that it doesn't separate people in 'Americans and good' and 'Somali and bad'. It acknowledges there's so much more: the people who choose to be pirates don't really have much of a choice, in their anarchistic, warlord-controlled country. While we want captain Phillips to get home safely, it's cruel to leave those pirates to their fate – we know that if they go back to Somalia they will keep on living a tough life and perhaps will even be punished by the warlords that gave them the order to attack the ship. And yet, they have broken the law and nobody can really help them. In real life, Mr Phillips developed Stockholm syndrome after getting home: this shows clearly what a complicated subject we're dealing with. In conclusion, aside from the flaws I pointed out and because of its good sides, this is a good movie you should definitely see.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Review: Captain Phillips Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,"I'm not sure if there is some sort of unwritten rule in Hollywood to pump out glorified films of American icons or a quota for the ""Based On A True Story: American Hero"" genre. With the likes of Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down, and G.I Joe: Retaliation, there is only one way to distinguish these films from the likes of Captain Phillips, and that's the talent behind, and in front of the screen.Captain Phillips is a clever, beautiful and meticulous piece of American propaganda. Brought out by its studios Columbia Pictures and Sony, it tells the story of a Captain of an American cargo ship being taken over by a small and young band of inexperienced Somali pirates.Think of it like this; the film is directed by Paul Greengrass, the same director of United 93, a film that recounts the efforts of average American passengers foiling the plans of foreign terrorist plans during 9/11; it stars our generation's own Humphrey Bogart, and arguably the most recognizable American actor right now, Tom Hanks, and its produced by the team behind other contemporary American classics like The Social Network. So why is Captain Phillips sinking right out of the water?I know that, for the most part, I will be in the vast minority with my viewpoint on the film, already gaining critical praise and reception from early festival screenings and talk, most noticeably for Hanks' performance. But what about the performances of the practically unknown, amateur and first time Somali actors who, not only hold their own beside the masterful Hanks, but at times tower over time like a freighter ship beside a life vessel. Pirates Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) stand out more than the other two pirates, but as the award season nears closer, I am sure neither of these names will be announced as serious award contenders when the time comes.What is most disappointing about Captain Phillips is its massive potential. The film starts off, giving the audience equal screen time to both the protagonist and antagonist, showing the lives of these two very different men and the 'jobs' they must perform in order to survive. One individual is a captain of a cargo ship who steers heavy waters to get shipments into port on time; the other is a fisherman who is violently forced to become a Somali pirate for a larger, more corrupt entity. Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray briefly touch upon the incongruencies of both men's worlds and different upbringings as well as viewpoints, but, shortly after, is drowned with scenes of unapologetic American patriotism.As for Tom Hanks, well, Hanks does what he does best throughout the course of the film. There is no denying Hanks as a powerhouse actor and fine entertainer, just not with the presence of other actors. Some of Hanks' most memorable and recognized performances (Cast Away, The Terminal, Cloud Atlas) are ones when he is interacting with only himself. Captain Phillips is a testament to that notion; delivering his best and most emotional scenes in either a lifeless life vessel or disoriented and unresponsive to an aiding nurse, Hanks delivers his signature Tom Hanks characteristic, just with a different accent.Unfortunately for Greengrass and company, Captain Phillips is an unaware, self-reflexive, continuing practice of the ""home of the brave and land of the free"" stretching its muscles. Just last year, making its premiere at the Venice and Toronto film festival circuit, a Danish film, titled A Hijacking made its rounds internationally, and then shortly after, in a limited theatre bout. The film never found footing after its critical praise and strong reception from audiences. The trailer is also oddly familiar to the style and narrative of Captain Phillips. Yet again, the Hollywood studio system just goes to show that with the right actor and precise director, no idea is safe of Hollywood's ongoing obsession of being uncreative.Emotionally charged, suspenseful and paced brilliantly, it is hard to ignore Captain Phillips as one's familiar, unsteady first boat ride–it may be a bit nauseating, rough, and hard. Making you reconsidering jumping on again.Night Film Reviews: 5/10 Stars",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The Performance Of Tom's Career,"This is the best movie I have seen in my life! A must watch...an absolutely riveting performance by Tom Hanks. In fact, this is the performance of his entire career. It is by far his most raw performance ever. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and my heart never stopped racing at 100 beats a minute. The tension was non-stop, and I was engrossed from the very opening. The ending was so raw, human, gritty and emotionally charged, the impact it had on me was equivalent to having the wind knocked out of you. I was torn between overwhelming relief, tears, chills, awe, heartbreak, with a massive knot in my stomach, and so stunned I couldn't even move in my chair...I sat literally frozen in it, with emotions running the gamut, but I was too immobilized by what I had witnessed to do anything but sit there and relive the final stellar moments I had just witnessed. I was ripped to the core. Tom's roles in Philadelphia and Cast Away were absolutely outstanding, but he surpassed them by massive leaps and bound with this role. This is a movie I will NEVER forget, and it likely won't be forgotten by others for a very long time...if ever. From director Paul Greengrass, I would expect no less than this masterpiece. The supporting cast, while being people I've never heard of, were outstanding as well, especially Barkhad Abdi...while being the lead pirate and a hostage taker, he showed moments of compassion, concern and a liking for Tom, but despite that, I felt no empathy for him. His performance was top-notch. He seamlessly shifted between human compassion and being downright callous. It was an honor to watch his performance. I will be sure to keep an eye out for him in future films as he nailed this and was brilliant. Out of the 3 hostage takers, Abdi stole the show hands down. My only regret? Seeing it 5 years after it was released. Ignore the bad reviews...this film is nothing shy of spectacular. Anyone who gives this a bad review doesn't recognize this for the magnificent work it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Tom Hanks at his best in a terrifyingly realistic true story.,"Let me begin by saying that Captain Phillips, as an action film, turned out to be much more than I had initially anticipated. I was expecting half drama / half moderate action film with likely a good dash of political hopscotch. It's probably a good thing then, that I knew next to nothing about the actual story, because I love a good surprise. Captain Phillips is two hours of absolutely intense and absolutely uncompromising physical and psychological anxiety. At the end of it, I literally had to sit for a minute and just breathe, because this story gripped me by the throat like few films in recent memory have.For those still unfamiliar with the story – this is a retelling of a historical event; the first US cargo ship in 200 years to be hijacked by pirates. During which, its captain Richard Phillips is taken hostage by the pirates, on his own lifeboat no less.I got the sense that, somewhere in between the lines it was the director's intention to perhaps create an opening for a different story to be told: that of the Somali pirates, and why they do what they do. We are told that they are fishermen, and sheer poverty has driven them to these desperate acts. However, I don't know for sure if I'm supposed to feel any sympathy for these men, if I was supposed to 'understand' their motives – if this was Paul Greengrass' intention, it didn't work. Because no matter which way you swing it, these pirates are the bad guys and that's as clear as day. No degree of poverty or despair should be held as an excuse for such gruesome acts. Then again, if this was at all the point, I'm glad it wasn't hammered down in any way. It was merely a thought, and one conveyed subtly enough for anyone to make up their own mind about this issue.What is clear here, is that these men (only four of them, surprisingly) committed a terrible crime. Not even so much the piracy itself, but the kidnapping and abuse of one individual. This individual is played by Tom Hanks, and he delivers one of his most eloquent and restrained performances to date. Here is a man, a captain of a large cargo ship, who is usually very much in control of his life and a clearheaded leader of his crew – but who, in the heat of reality, is just as human as any of us and simply does the best he can, even when (in spite of overwhelming protocol) one simply doesn't know what to do. Because protocol doesn't apply to the emotions that take control of both the captain and his captors, when they face a situation none of them anticipated. This is immediately one if my favourite performances by Tom Hanks, whose strength here lies mostly in the quiet moments in between all the chaos surrounding him. You can tell that he never stops thinking, never stops analyzing his situation, no matter what the pirates do to intimidate him. He conveys it all in the eyes – all the fear and anxiety, while constantly staying calm and collected, trying to talk to his captors, never losing his head. Even when fighting for his life, there is an assertive calmness that comes across so strongly that you can do nothing but admire this man. Hanks' performance is so convincing, it almost doesn't look like acting anymore... and that's a huge compliment.The same goes for the other actors, especially the men playing the Somali pirates. Before being cast for this film, none of them had any acting experience, which makes their performances all the more impressive. Then, it also makes one wonder how much of a compliment it actually is when a director literally picks you off the street because apparently he thinks that you're perfectly fit for the part of a menacing pirate, but that's food for another discussion, another time... In any case, he was right about them. These men ARE absolutely convincing and authentic. Especially the leader of the gang, played by Barkhad Abdi, is right on the money. He needs nothing more than the look in his eyes to convince you that you're right to feel absolutely terrified of him.From a technical standpoint, Captain Phillips is very well made. My only grievance is Greengrass' typical trademark: the shaky handy-cam. Here and there it's almost enough to make you seasick, and I really wish he would ease up on this gimmick, because although it adds to the feeling of suspense and chaos, that doesn't weigh up to the headache it causes. Steady-cam was invented for a reason, mister director. Use it. Still, the other qualities of the film are easily strong enough to make up for this one point of critique. The pacing is excellent, it grips you like a pitbull and never lets go until the credits roll in. Colouring and lighting effects are perfectly used for an incredibly realistic feel and claustrophobic atmosphere. Everything feels very real and absolutely no sentimental plot devices are exploited here. Top-notch screen writing.I can do nothing other than strongly recommend this film. It is very intense and at times very violent, and definitely one of the best films in its genre. And if this doesn't convince you, see it for one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Quite good,"Based on a true story, this film is a dramatization of the 2009 hijacking of an American ship by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean. The title character is played by Tom Hanks.The beginning has its flaws. It takes a while to get used to the busy hand-held camera work. It also gives the impression of being yet another ""us vs. them"" / ""good guys vs. bad guys"" scenario that has been done hundreds of times before, particularly those based on true stories.Last year's ""Argo"" advanced this genre from its superb directing despite its great stretching of the truth. While ""Captain Phillips"" does not advance the genre, it also does not set it backward.Once the adventures begin (and there are two of them), the film is very engaging due to the skills of director Paul Greengrass. He is especially adept at portraying the detailed level of teamwork in military operations.The last half hour could have been cut a bit as it seemed there was a bit too much drama at that point. But Tom Hanks's final scene displays so much vulnerability and humanity, it's no wonder he is one of moviedom's greatest superstars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"SERIOUSLY, watch it","I went into this movie with no Expectations at all, i didn't know it was nominated for Oscars and it was a coincidence i Saw it really. but boy how it blew my mind! This movie Will keep you on your toes through it all, without being spooky as horromovies or overly dramatic. Now i read some Of the reviews and it angers me that no one mentions how good muse was, cause his acting, along with Tom hanks Of course, was what really made me love this. I later found out he was nominated for an Oscar and i calmed Down again, aha. But seriously watch this movie, it strangely made me cry, because the idea Of it happening in real life, which it did, really frightens me. I'm not from the United States, I'm from denmark, who were also part owners Of the Alabama maersk ship. But i still Got to proud Of the US's accomplishments, and the lenghts they were Willing to go.

"The poor ones on the bad side, again","It's kinda racist movie. When you talk about people making bad thing you should ask yourself about reasons. Why a gang of human beings choose piracy against any other option? In the background exists a very deep social problem where everyone, European, American, and even us are guilty. If you told just the consequences, like they made here, then you have created another American superheroes movie and have told just a half of the human story. Just a half of the misery.

Gripping and real - exceeds expectations,This true story of 4 Somali pirates attack of a cargo ship is gripping and terrifying and totally believable - allowing you the feel the vulnerability of the unarmed crew and the tragedy of the doomed pathetic pirates against the mighty navy.The acting from the Somali pirates is top notch. Their emaciated look makes them so authentic. Tom Hanks as the titular Hero is suited to the role. I thought he looked tired and puffy in Da Vinci movies but here he is just right. His acting during the last part of the movie is so convincing.Direction is top notch. Shows you everything you want to see without any cheap shock tactics or unnecessarily ugly images. The production on the ship and in the sea are good too.Wish the subtitles for the Somali dialog had been clearer - sometimes hard to see the white words against the background.A must watch - the 2 hours just sped by.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Everything I hoped for,"""Captain Phillips"" is an exciting story of piracy. Its highlights include great acting by both principal actors (Hanks and Abdi), an incredibly intense showdown between two boats, and a strong ending.The scene depicted in the trailers, with the skiff boarding the freighter, is one of the best individual scenes of 2013. It ratchets the intensity to such a high degree that it is somewhat disappointing that that scene is so early in the movie. Because everything after it seems slow paced by comparison.Great exchanges between the two main actors. Tom Hanks was his typical greatness, even though this role was probably not juicy enough for an Oscar. Barkhad Abdi, despite never acting before, was also stellar. He looked and sounded the part perfectly.The film lags a bit after the pirates take the captain hostage. That section of the film could probably be trimmed by 5 or 10 minutes without losing much. When watching it I became afraid that the one great scene from before would be the only highlight. I was proved wrong by the strong ending. I don't want to give away too much, but the last 10 minutes or so are the other highlight.Pacing issues in the middle of the movie (the hostage part) is the only issue I have with Captain Phillips. It was an intense story of piracy. Every movie has a few parts that it needs to get right in order to be a good movie, and Captain Phillps gets a 10/10 for those parts. Its only issues are in the other, less significant, parts. I strongly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It was supposed to be easy. I take ship... ransom... nobody get hurt.,"They wanted $10 million ransom for Captain Phillips. I would imagine that the US Navy probably spent $10 million dollars putting all those ships ans Seals in the water to rescue him. Unfortunately, that leaves nothing for the pirates.Did they really think that the US was going to let them win? It's inconceivable to us, but they were just fishermen. They had just as much chance as the teabaggers. Terrorists never win in the end. They can't see the big picture.The efforts of Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips was a compelling story from the beginning. He was head and shoulders above his enemy. He saved his ship and all his people. This was the real story. Everything else was just a matter of time.When our military is allowed to do their jobs, they are a formidable force. We can sleep well tonight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Take a bow 'Captain Phillips',"I had no clue about the film till i entered the movie theater. I didn't even know it was Tom Hanks who portrayed 'Captain Phillips' . I didn't even know it was a true story. Strange but all these are true. I was desperate to watch a movie, and tickets for no other movies not being available i chose 'Captain Phillips'.With no expectations i stepped into the steep movie theater, stumbled for sometime to find my seat, took some time to adjust myself and finally looked onto the screen.There were some African people speaking in their own language(Of course i had to see the subtitle. Oh gosh i hate 'em). I thought i made a wrong decision choosing this movie. Then the man entered 'Tom Hanks' with his big beard and phenomenal voice(Ah! This movie is going to be good). After some 10 minutes I was totally spell bound and was glued to the seat. The pirates taking over the ship was spectacularly shown(Take a bow Paul Greengrass).The pirates, whoever portrayed those characters, though it was their 1st movie those people acted so well(I'd have believed them to be real pirates as well!). Tom Hanks was as usual at his best. After SEAL starts their operation each and every scene was so well pictured. The execution of those 3 pirates was superb.Tom Hanks did spectacularly well after that. I now really admire the original 'Captain Phillips'.

A Great Inconsistent Film,"My problems with Captain Phillips when I first saw it in an advance screening was the shaky camera-work and unnecessary jerky editing. I saw the Bourne movies and United 93, had no problem with Greengrass' work, but in Captain Phillips I found it to be distracting. Upon my rewatch I actually grew to accept and even, love the editing. I think it's part of the effect of the film, Greengrass makes us feel like we're inches away from being seasick. Being used to that method, I saw how closely sewn the cuts are connected. Greengrass' direction is the best of any of the films he's made; he pumps the fear into our systems. He makes the film ""click-click- click-click.""While I still find Abdi unremarkable, Hanks' acting is better than remembered and I praised the heck out of him before. It's a heroic, realistic, terrific piece of acting. He's stolen the win from Matthew McConaughey for Best Actor in my opinion and I never thought McConaughey would be dethroned. It's a performance that will go on to be one of the decade's finest. The quality of the screenplay stood out more and the development of Captain Phillips himself. I got this strange vibe that Phillips strangely cares for the pirates. The most pleasant surprise was the score, I was touched by its balance of tenderness and intensity. Captain Phillips is a throat grabbing thriller that I have grown to love.Updated Rating- 8.0",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Amazing thriller,"It's never an easy task when performing a true story, but when you have actors this talented.. it's always a promising one.Tom Hanks is very known for his well-done performances and he did an amazing job acting as Captain Phillips; but the surprise was Barkhad Abdi's performance along with the other guys but him especially since he was the captain of his own crew, he offered an outstanding act.Not all thriller movies succeed in giving you the chills that you wait for, but this one came packed with all the chills you could ask for and the best part of it all that it's a true story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Technically an 8,"A good movie.Technically an 8.But its subject matter is something one wouldn't watch a bunch of times.Movies about historical events, that aren't epics - are always plagued by this fate.The best they can be in the scheme of things is a 7.But if you're not a cinephile and only watch movies once, this is an easy 8.

Why it's not a 9 or 10:
The last hour is very repetitious.But that was the story being told.I don't know what they could have done differently, to change that fact.Maybe from the very beginning, incorporate the navy vessel that ended up finding them. Have some established characters that it could go back to. Or maybe even develop the characters of the crew more, so some scenes of them talking after he had been taken - to switch up the monotony.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A tense fight for survival,"Although it was very positively reviewed and Tom Hanks and Paul Greengrass have done some great films in their respective careers, there was the uncertainty as to whether 'Captain Phillips' would be my cup of tea.The good news is it very much was. Although it does stray from the facts quite a bit, 'Captain Phillips' takes a remarkable and harrowing true story and tells it in a way that's utterly gripping and full of tension and emotion. It won't be for all taste-buds, especially for those who don't like shaky cam, but it is very easy to see why 'Captain Phillips' was and still is received so positively. It's not quite a masterpiece or flawless, it does go on a little longer than necessary which occasionally bogs down the pacing (15-20 minutes shorter would have made a difference) and, although there has been far worse abuse of the shaky cam technique, some of it does get excessive and leaves one feel a little sea-sick.However, 'Captain Phillips' does more right than it does wrong and boasts some of Greengrass's best directing in one of his best films and one of Hanks' best performances in recent years. Greengrass keeps the tension levels high, maintaining urgency and the more violent moments are explosively powerful. He is particularly good in showing the increasing desperation when things go wrong as well as the horrors of the situation. Hanks is at the height of his powers here, boasting some of the most powerful acting he has ever given, particularly in his very poignant final scenes.One mustn't overlook Barkhad Abdi, who brings intensity and vulnerability to a character who seems like a villain at first but turns out to be much more than that. The rest of the acting is fine, though Hanks and Abdi are the ones that dominate.'Captain Phillips' is well made, while some of it is excessive there are other instances where the shaky cam heightens the drama and dizzying intensity. There is an audacious grit throughout. The music pulsates thrillingly without being repetitive or overbearing. The script is thought-provoking and has tightness and also nuance that stops things from being patronising.Story-wise, 'Captain Phillips' is riveting, there is a heart-pumping urgency throughout and the tension, claustrophobia and desperation escalates and increases to nerve-shredding effect in its best moments. The emotion of the final act crescendos thrillingly and heart-wrenchingly and it is enough to bring tears to the eyes. So much its honesty, pathos and power, Hanks gives it everything to these scenes. The characters are hardly neatly black and white while motivations and character decisions are clear and logical.In conclusion, tense and powerful, highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Superb,"The endless Ocean. On the one hand the Somali street fighters trying to make a living and on the other an American commercial vessel transporting cargo. To the young Somali's, hijacking a ship is just another day's work but the company who owns the vessel will go a long way to protect it.These worlds will collide on our big screen although every effort was made by the ship's crew for this encounter to not take place. However, sophisticated western systems of protection will constantly be challenged by the street smart attitude of the pirates, something that will be a constant theme throughout the film.From the moment their paths meet, the film enters a stage where tension is ever present all the way to the final scenes. Paul Greengrass does a fine job in keeping us stimulated without the usual Hollywood sensationalism. At any moment, there is a worry that anything could go terribly wrong: from pirates losing their cool or accidentally pulling the trigger or the hostage totally reach a stage where he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.Captain Phillips made every effort to protect his crew and took charge of the situation from the onset of the crisis and try to buy time whilst the invaders aimed to earn the most before any assistance arrived.With the help not arriving in time, the captive captain is on his way to Somalia and the climax turns out as an outsmart battle between the American navy and three pirates.Finely performed, emotive and intense this is one big maritime adventure of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Exceptional Hanks in Tense Thriller,"Captain Phillips (2013)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Intense thriller about Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) who finds his cargo ship being attacked by Somali pirates and must try and find a way to survive the ordeal and this includes trying to strike up a relationship with the main pirate (Barkhad Abdi). Even if you know how this true story ends, don't let that keep you away because director Paul Greengrass and star Hanks have really created an incredibly intense and well-acted nail-bitter that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I've you've seen the theatrical trailer then you might think that the majority of the action takes place on the cargo ship but that's actually not the case and I'd say this here is perhaps the weakest aspect of the film (although it's still incredibly good). The real story happens once Phillips and his captors are out at sea; them demanding money and Phillips wanting his freedom. The director does a marvelous job at not only building up the suspense but also making us care about the characters and hate them. The Phillips character is obviously someone you're going to root for and especially with someone like Hanks in the role. The bad guys here are given a lot of character development, which was excellent because we get to understand and see why these men do this type of thing even if it might cost them their lives. There's a terrific sequence where the main pirate talks about his ""dreams"" of America. Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career and there's not a single second in the picture where you won't believe him in the role. This is especially true as the film goes on and the situation grows more tense. The way Hanks' emotions just start to break was something remarkable to see the actor pull off. Abdi also deserves a lot of credit because you just can't help but hate this guy while at the same time hope that he will smarten up so that some sort of peace can happen. The other three pirates are masterfully played as well. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is a film about survival and there are some terrific action scenes but the movie also has a heart and the character development is something we don't often see in movies like this.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Decent film, decent actors!","Just like usual, Tom hanks as a big Hollywood star gives the best out of it and for me its a good act from him. The starstruck effect from him doesn't change much since he got 2 consecutive Oscars.On the other side, all actors in film also give something special for the film, seriousness, tension, deadpan (this for Tom Hanks), and also grief.I also give a good credit for the Somali actor who plays the main antagonist here, Barkhad Abdi, and the rest of his henchmen. The one thing that make this film just a film (it doesn't show the actual event...in my opinion) is how mushy the the robbers in the film, they fights each other, debates each other, and blames each other, they are too mushy to the crew of the ship. It's like the avarice they have just for a showcase in the film, not the actual event. They yammers the group until they are all shot and died, except the leader. But again, this is just film, so there is no use too regret that part.And.....the last note.....is it anyone there just like me.......Have more sympathy to the bad side than all of those NAVY people???",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Perfection - don't expect any Oscars tho--it is too good for that,"A lesson in filmmaking excellence. When so many movies feel it necessary to lecture us about politics and/or the environment (Avatar), or try to Be Significant and Important (too many to mention, but can start with The Fifth Estate), what a blast of fresh air is Captain Phillips. What makes this film special is that everyone involved is primarily interested in telling a great, dramatic story and not with lecturing us on their own particular viewpoints. That said, there is plenty of rich subtext here about wealth, poverty, work, and other matters--this is not just empty action a la Michael Bay or even Blackhawk Down.Director Greengrass has a gift for making us feel with his characters by dramatic action and gesture and not via empty dialogue. The 'villains' here are 3 dimensional--they have motives, fears and are not stupid. It is really nice to see black actors not being pandered to but rather represented as actual human beings with complex minds and emotions.The true star of the movie is Tom Hanks, who I don't particularly like or dislike. But here, his acting is on another level. I do not know how he is able to convey multiple emotions with a single glance--fear, scheming and pity all at once. If you are not either in tears or on the border of tears at the end, then you may not be human.Taste is taste and cannot be explained, but some critics find themselves in a quandary here. This movie does not exalt the military--it only presents the facts (perhaps dramatized of course). But we are so used to seeing the military demonized that many critics don't know how to react. The same is true of the Somali's here--again, we're used to seeing Africans being pandered to, to non-Africans vilified and blamed for all matter of things (slavery, imperialism, the high crime rate, you name it). Here, the Somali's are presented as they are--poverty stricken, desperate, and struggling. When we see their small boat up against a huge shipping freighter, this speaks volumes without saying a word. Of course what they do is wrong, but it is hard not to understand why they do it.All that said, this movie works just as plain old action/drama. It belongs up there with films like Deliverance, Goodfellas, the Godfather- -movies with action, bite and substance. And Hanks delivers a performance that is really remarkable.I suspect this movie will be ignored come Oscar time. Because while it will certainly be the best movie of the past 5 or next 5 years, it does not follow any particular political belief nor espouse anything at all. And for Hollywood, you'd better engage in Groupthink if you want an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Captain Phillips,"Tom Hanks works particularly well in this gripping story of a real life pirate! Muse (Barkhad Abdi) is leading two small skiffs on an attack on the eponymous officer's freighter as it sails off the coat of Somalia. A certain degree of bravado and legerdemain sees the bigger ship thwart their first attempt, but next day they are back again and the powerful hoses prove poor defence against machine guns. Most of the crew now take refuge in the gunnels leaving the captain to face their captors and for the next two hours these two men play an increasingly perilous cat and mouse game that sees them ultimately taking refuge in a lifeboat soon in the sights of an unforgiving US Navy. It works on quite a few levels, this film. The Somalis themselves are not religious zealots, and from what we see of their home lives are living a fairly subsistence existence where their acts on the high seas are to make money to escape poverty rather than t make political or religious points. As the drama plays out, both men begin to understand a little more about what makes each tick and drives them - and the intimate camerawork delivers well the claustrophobic nature of the denouement in a darkened and confined space with tension high, fear and panic never far away and a political agenda from the military that nobody watching is quite clear of. Hanks may take top billing, but it's the effort from Abdi and his boat crew that really steal the plaudits here as their efforts work on both dramatically and on the thought-provoking front, too. Certanly one of Paul Greengrass's better efforts making sure we use just about all of our senses to share their experience and maybe also to understand it all a bit better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
1/2 A4 script stretched to 133 of US propaganda,"Let me start by saying, one thing about Somali people is they are know for being very handsome. I leave it there. And we get to see the Western take on poor Africa crop up in the politics of this film. I mean these 4 little boys against the Entire US army/military and Seals and one Capitalist ship that did not contain any food for Africa, only products made from African raw materials that our silly leaders buy.(off topic) people in the West don't like those kind of films.This film only needed to be 15 minutes long. And even then the story is so weak and without any real tension. Those baby pirates are scary like Santa Claus. Where are the Real Bad Boys? 1/2 the film is in some life boat.What I am confused about is the rating, and the hype from the critics. I think they buy them off, because we did not see the same film. No way we did just watch 4 little pirates vs the US whatever in a little yellow boat and said it was ""Amazing"", ""Thrilling"", edge of my seat--not.I wonder if Hollywood would be interested in my script which features all the pirate ships that actually get paid and America loses?",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Film of the Year,"Wow, this movie is magnificent on so many levels. Here's why.1) It takes place on the water, so we already know it's going to be visually stunning 2) Tom Hanks is flawless as Captain Phillips and will be, at the very least, nominated for another Oscar 3) The portrayal of the US Military is unbelievableIn my opinion, the movie never lets up. I've read other reviews with people saying the exciting parts are in the beginning and the end. Well I felt like I couldn't breathe in the theater because I thought I would miss out on something.After seeing prisoners and gravity, I was already content with the quality of movies this year.

No Oscar nomination for Hanks? How is that possible?,"Very intense film based on a true story. VERY intense. I can't believe it too me ten years to finally getting around to watching this. It was incredibly well down, made by the same director as United 93, the 9/11 story. I loved the way they didn't make it all rah rah America. Instead, it gave some depth and background to the Somali pirates; what kind of lives they lead that brings them to this.Tom Hanks gave one of his greatest performances ever, particularly during the last 20 minutes.

Special mention go to Barkhad Abdi, who plays the front man of the Somalian pirates, for playing a truly engrossing and nuanced villain. But the biggest accomplishment of the film is that it goes to show that everything can go absolutely according to plan and something could still go wrong, as showcased in the pirate's invasion of the ship. I really don't know what else to say about it. It's just really good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Worth watching .... once,"I am ITCHING to write about how good the acting is in Captain Phillips(particularly tom hanks) . But most of the reviews here have already mentioned about this. In this review, i will take a look at areas where it COULD HAVE been better.The movie was very thrilling up to the part where they entered the safe boat. After that, it became a little less absorbing and quite predictable. OK, so there isn't very much they can do to improve the story. But here is my problem. I never really felt threatened by the pirates. Their acting was great but for me they didn't do enough to make me fear for the lives of the crew members. My instincts were right as none of the crew members got injured which was a bit disappointing. Personally, it would've been a good idea to make the pirates a bit more fearsome by hurting some of the crew members.Overall, this is a good movie, a 7.5/10 in my opinion.

Tom Hanks is a capable actor and he portraits cap Phillips as wimpy corporate overseer perfectly. Normally this leads to inability of viewer to connect with the character. What I've found the most amusing part of the film is how four Ak-47 armed Somalis in a skiff were able to capture freighter of hundreds of tons operated by at least couple of dozen crew members, the true representation of Western social decay.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What a journey...,"Wow, this film takes you on an amazing journey as you experience many emotions throughout it such as happiness, terror, thrill, sadness and shock.

I really didn't think he would pull it off like he did.The film was very intense and terrifying and this was captured perfectly with the music and camera angles, sending your heart rate through the roof. The intense moments where the right length but the drama was a bit dragged out as the story continued.As the film progressed the feeling of helplessness became so clear to the viewer as they were in the middle of the ocean with little help available. This feeling added to the thrill and terror, and i have no idea how the crew would have been feeling during this experience as it was scary watching it.The camera at the beginning of the film was very unstable and quite dizzying to view, I'm not sure if this is what the director was intending or they didn't realize it was an issue.This film is an excellent film and one of the most thrilling films i have ever viewed and it kept you on the edge of your seat.

Tom Hanks: The Pride Of Hollywood.,"Why do people you admired in you youth grow old with the passage of time? I wish that all the actors and actresses I admired could stay young forever...Tom Hanks is a man I admired and one of my favorite Hollywood actors. He has won a special place in my heart with films like Splash(1984), Big(1988), The Burbs(1989), Turner & Hooch (1989), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), Philadelphia(1993-Won Academy Award for Best Actor), Forrest Gump(1994-Won Academy Award for Best Actor), Apollo 13(1995), You Got Mail (1998), The Green Mile(1999), Cast Away(2000), Road to Perdition(2002), Catch Me If You Can(2002) and The Ladykillers (2004 Remake). If you are his fan, these films should be the core of your DVD collection.Back to this film. Captain Phillips is based upon the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, an incident during which merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage by pirates in the Indian Ocean led by Abduwali Muse.At the start of the film we see Phillips(Hanks) making last minute preparations for his departure to Oman. From there he boards the Maersk Alabama and embarks on a cargo transport route through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, round the Horn of Africa. Due to pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, the Phillips orders strict security precautions on the vessel and carries out practice drills.During the practice drill Phillips sights Somali pirates in two skiffs. He then plans to outrun them by giving orders to turn the engines to maximum power output - at the cost of accidental over-heating and engine shutdown. He succeeds, but the pirates do not give up. The following day they catch-up and board the Maersk Alabama.From then on, what happens is for you to find out. Rent/watch online or download/or go to the cinema when the time and price of the ticket suits your budget.The photography, atmosphere and script is brilliantly done. Paul Greengrass does a good job in the director's seat. He previously directed United 93(2006) based upon the 11 September 2001 hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93.Tom Hanks gives a very real portrayal of the terror of being kidnapped. He shows the true leadership quality of a Captain by protecting the bulk of his crew from the Pirates.In conclusion: one of the better films of 2013. And in parting might I add that the image of Tom Hanks in my memory will always be how he looked like in the film Big(1988). God bless you Tom Hanks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
No way to maintain suspense,"Well, the actors playing the two main characters, Tom Hanks as Richard Phillips and Barkhad Abdi as Muse were excellent. Particularly Mr. Abdi, as a non-professional actor. I expect that he will find a dearth of roles in the future, however. There was very little character development or exposition on any other character. Outstanding cinematography on the ocean, the port, and the giant ship. Quite a contrast, taking the action from the huge cargo vessel to the claustrophobic enclosed lifeboat.But there was really no way to create or maintain mush suspense, which the film really needed, since the ultimate outcome was known to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Movie....,Another wonderful movie with Tom Hanks. I just saw this movie today and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting was terrific by all and the story was interesting. It brings to light a subject that not too many people are aware of. The fact that its a true story makes it even better. What I like about it is the peaks of humanity and feeling that both of the main characters show despite the situation. You feel sorry for both characters. This movie makes you think about why people do what they do. I think it should be one of the best movies of the year and Hanks should be nominated for this. Great suspense throughout!

Our reach,"Here we have a simple world where unseen wheels turn and bring men (on both sides) out to sea. We have simple emotional urges; get there or get out of there, and just physics of space. Standard tension carries the day in the story: will the pirates board the ship? okay, but will they find the crew? okay, but will they make the hostage switch? okay but will they make it to the coast? and so on, bobbing us up and down. We have that dry and solemn tone of procedure that movies take on when they deal with the US military in the area, Bigelow's films come to mind—we're meant to see the quiet commitment to get our man back, the everyman Hanks.Boring. But within those limits there is a pretty lovely spatial play, as lovely as the plot is unremarkable. Simple contrasts: in and out, close confines against open vastness, ship mechanics against the abstract sea, Somali chaos against American precision. But within that, some great eye motion, one to relative distance, to the unfolding of space.If you look, what the filmmakers were looking to manipulate were our intentional threads reaching out to this man who we want to see saved, have the reaching and anticipation as visual as possible. So what they do is they try to avoid as much as possible framing omnisciently, and stretch that eye to intentional distance by having the next action fire its trajectory in that vision, and cut before completion so the motion pulls our own intentional tethers taut. My favorite bits are the view of the ship from the approaching Somali skiffs, a flare fired from the ship and seen through beams of water, and all that last part with the towing of the lifeboat towards the lights, the tether bringing back our man against dark waters.Essentially, it is the same expertly calibrated cinematic machine as that which is able to swoop from the horizon and find the protagonist in the middle of nowhere. Anyone who merely reads 'shaky cam' in a film like this seems to me to have boarded the least adventurous cinematic boat: the touristy one that does a tour of the bay instead of the one that sails out to deep sea. It's still not very fulfilling once you pull back to the whole picture, but get up close and perception is its own art and richness—there will be more to say about this in a comment about Gravity.So anyway, we have all that tension mounting, gears snap and whir into place. It builds up all that energy, the last part with snipers getting in position and the ship towing the boat. So the question is: do you cleanse? do you let out a little and in what direction?You'll see what they did in the film. Hanks wonderfully makes his own part work, letting out just little enough for us to know that all his gears of self have snapped but his wife is there in that room after being saved. But this is because he is first given room for it, he is the hero.How would it be to give the same room to the Somali captain? No politics here, not putting them in equivalent ground, just find that man in the moment of stepping into what is essentially the future, the front part of the train of civilization to his last that he leaves behind on the coast. And mine the irony of his going to America, and have the Somali actor layer on that his own journey there. It would be an exceptional thing.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
All aboard but no pirates allowed,"Paul Greengrass is a political writer and director with his roots in journalism.This film is based on true facts of the hijacking in 2009 of the MV Maersk Alabama and the book written by Captain Richard Phillips himself which makes the film itself slanted.Captain Phillips himself has commented that the film makes himself out as more of a hero than he really was.Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips who is a company man. His job is to get cargo from one part of the world to another as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is how modern shipping works.He discovers probably because he got too near Somalia that he has attracted the attention of fast boat pirates.Captain Phillips first tries to evade the pirates but when they board his ship he plots to get them off as fast as possible without his crew being harmed.Barkhad Abdi is the leader of the pirates who soon finds when the US navy intervenes that he might have bitten off more than he could chew.The film is intense when the pirates board but it never totally engaged me, especially when it is let down by some silliness such as Phillips when told to sit still by a trigger happy pirate lunges for some pen and paper instead.It is as the screenplay had to be boosted to make it more exciting, which makes you think the real life tale, although terrifying for the crew was not thrilling enough to be made into a film in the first place.An efficient thriller that lacked heart and soul.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Greengrass Struggles Aboard the MSV Maersk Alabama,"Paul Greengrass of Bourne fame ventures into the semi-true story of Captain Richard Phillips and his encounter with the not-so-bloody not-so-terrifying pirates of the Somalian coast. When the MSV Maersk Alabama, loaded with food for the poor, starving children of Africa (rolleyes), embarks onto its course to the port of Mombasa from the Oman coastline, they are full aware of the dangers posed by pirate activity in the area. With Somalian kidnapping on the rise, the loaded cargo ship is but another prey for the rag-tag band of yellow-toothed AK47-wielding outlaws. Normally a crew would back down and hand over the ship peacefully, but not this yippee ki yay band of die hards (with glass traps to boot). Led by the scrawny Muse (Barkhad Abdi) this band of hijackers has met their match!!!Achingly overwrought ""Captain Phillips"" intends to thrill, together with manipulative background music attempting to heighten the tension, where there is none to behold. Somehow, most people seem to have fallen into the trap set up by Tom Hanks and Greengrass' shaky cam, but when the foursome of motley pirates are set to collide with the navy and seals the attempt to keep tension high is as ludicrous as the outcome is inevitable. The fearless Somalian fishermen-turned outlaws versus the entire might of US military excellence - never has an action thriller been so lopsided in favour of the so-called 'good guys'. This is one movie where I actually found myself rooting for the 'bad guys', despite Greengrass's best intentions to have Phillips and the overbearing force of the US Navy being perceived positively.Riddled with unnecessary focus on detail the movie irritates with its trite dialogue, often inserted to add some skin-deep expansion on the plight of Somalia, but never offering any attempt to flesh out any of the characters. Lacking any meaty commentary Greengrass basically offers a straight up action film, which however lacks the ingredients to make it interesting. The conclusion is foregone from the outset and the lack of depth fails to really emotionally involve with anyone. With the story basically devoid of tension from mid-way (when the terrorist kidnap Captain Phillips and use an escape pod to head for the mainland), the last hour is overbearing to the point of excruciating cries for the story to just end. The realistic fly-on-the-wall never really helps, as it struggles to imbue a sense of purpose of proceedings, making you almost wish for the crew to just dump Captain Phillips in the water, so the movie will finally end.With an overwhelming sense of patronisation of the plight of Somalians, ""Captain Phillips"" also barely treads on the right side of the moral landscape. Not to say that Somali pirates are justified or noble, but the story has been literally whitewashed with the fearless 'whites' saving the day and outsmarting their opposition (I believe not a single talking part from the 'good side' was offered to a coloured person). The ""Smiling Pirate"" Muse has been vilified, not one mention being made of him actually being underage, with absolutely no focus being placed on 'his side of the story', apart from some banal shopworn tag-lines about his fisherman roots. The beginning was actually promising, when Muse was introduced, but soon focus shifts away from him and suddenly we become overpowered by American patriotism coupled with overblown music intended to force a sense of tension. Single lines of dialogue are afforded to wider ranging issues with Rich Phillips supplying an opening comment about the rat-race juxtaposed with the conditions of life of ordinary Somalians one of the few high points of the drama. Apart from that its an pompous mess of action overly focused on the title character and his emotional responses than to actually posing any serious questions.Tom Hanks acts his heart out, but with such a divisory persona it's hard to really connect with him. The best acting is therefore on the side of the worn Somalian naturals like Abdi, who deserves Oscar recognition much more than Hanks. Nonetheless, the secondary cast of the cargo ship crew was mostly terrible and laughable in their execution, offering a few hardy laughs with their picturesque poses and worried mimicry.Within the cascading amount of Somali pirate movies, this is by far the worst. ""A Hijacking"" is hardly a great movie, but shows how deficient Greengrass's storytelling is. Just around the corner: ""Fighting without Nets"" will premiere at Sundance and hopefully present a movie with more than one layer to it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Increased respect for actor already at the top,"I came into the film having only seen Hanks in the Toy Story series and Forrest Gump (you could say I'm sheltered when it comes to watching films). My respect goes even further for Tom Hanks after watching this film considering that Forrest Gump is my favourite of all time.Captain Phillips is thrilling, emotive and leaves you gripping the seat as if on a boat on the cusp of a wave. Hanks is exposed to give a very 'naked' performance - the camera is nearly always in his face and in saying that this film certainly isn't for the faint-hearted. The Somali pirates recruited for the film were particularly impressive given their limited (if any) acting experience, as well as the music which, if repetitive at times, added to the tension.I urge you to watch this film as it will almost certainly be either your favourite Tom Hanks film or your film of the year.

All aboard!,"Captain Phillips is the latest nail-biter of a film by director Paul Greengrass, who continues his frenetic style of filmmaking that he showed off in the final two Bourne films and United 93. Like United 93, Greengrass is putting us on board with another real life hostage situation. This time, we are crewmates on a freight ship that's being attacked by Somali pirates.Tom Hanks, everybody's favorite everyman, is our captain for this voyage and; as usual, he's on top of his game. I'd say this is one of Hanks' finest performances in years, possibly ever. Gasp! It's so true though. Hanks does a great job of portraying a person that has the responsibility of dozens of lives on his hands.He stands up to the pirates with a mixture of fear and courage, savvy and naïveté. Hanks perfectly balances these aspects of Phillips, exhibiting the strength to stand up to the pirates and the ability to gain their trust.The film does a great job of not portraying the Somali pirates as blood thirsty savages hungry for murder. Instead, they're just plain thirsty for water and hungry for food and nourishment. Their faces are gaunt and skeletal. Their clothes hang loose from their bony bodies. They resemble the ghosts of a once healthy person or grown up versions of the children we've all seen in the ""starving kid"" commercials. By humanizing the Somali pirates, we're able to sympathize with their plight and understand why people might be forced to do such a thing.The pirates are played by first time actors and real Somali people who actually fled from Somalia trying to avoid the very hardships that are portrayed in the film. Casting the Somali actors added another layer of realism. The captain of the Somali pirates is played by Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse. Abdi holds his own as he goes toe-to-toe with one of the most legendary actors on the planet. Muse seems dangerous, but you can't help but feel bad for him. You can see the desperation and fear in his eyes, but there is also a childlike innocence.One of the major themes of Captain Phillips is the clash of culture between the Somali pirates and the Americans. There's no better example of the haves and the have nots than seeing the Somali pirates approaching the massive ship in a tiny wooden boat. When they finally break into the bridge and confront Captain Phillips and his crew, they might as well be from another planet.Paul Greengrass has a very distinct style that might not be for everybody. His use of shaky-cam, which has often been imitated and overused in the industry, works very well in Captain Phillips. It gives the film a more natural feel and works perfectly with the natural ebb and flow of the ocean.Muse and the other Somali pirates are clearly the villains of the film, but the true villain is circumstance. The cruel reality that people have to do such things not because they are evil people, but because there is truly no other way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
As Real As You Could Ask,"This is a film of relentless tension and believable action, crowned by a masterful performance by Tom Hanks as the title character. I won't presume to compare the film's authenticity to what may actually have happened when Captain Phillips' freighter was hijacked off Somalia. It is usually a bad sign when the military provides its hardware in films such as ""Top Gun"" and similar action epics. Here, there is no macho, stupid dialogue or over-the-top heroics. The Navy is portrayed as professionals, and the camera work stays close to all actors and keeps the adrenaline pumping. Tom Hanks' portrayal of Captain Phillips is that of a thoughtful, humane individual trying to protect his crew. The unpredictability of his situation is truly frightening. A film that is a masterpiece of its kind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Very well made, and very linear, straight forward movie about a wild true story","Captain Phillips (2013)Straight up excellent movie making about a true story with superb pace and clearly etched characters. It's hard not to like, and to appreciate the main character, played by Tom Hanks, as he does his best to keep his ship and crew safe from pirates.If that's what you're looking for in a movie, this is top notch. The director, Paul Greengrass, is really expert at this kind of action thriller—he did the 2nd and 3rd Bourne movies, which are sizzling. ""Captain Phillips"" is by its nature more limited in its plot. It has to stick to the reality of the world at that time, and more or less to the facts. There have been some objections to the actual details of the movie, but I think Greengrass is right when he defends it as true to the big points, which you see (with some astonishment) here.If you want some further element of surprise, or something to make you think, or discover aspects that rise above simply telling a riveting plot, you won't find it here. Except, for me, in the last two minutes of the movie. Here, at last, we not only see the depths of what the captain had to discover in himself, we see the movie take a turn in deciding what to show us and how.

Four new star actors are born,"""Captain Philipps"" is an American action-drama inspired by but not closely based on actual events. The real Captain Philipps acted a lot less heroic and more ignorant than in this movie adaption that simply tries to do what many recent Hollywood movies do. They portray the hard but honest everyday life of a seemingly normal American citizen who suddenly faces big challenges and becomes a national hero. In times of governmental shutdown, economical problems and a slowly progressing decline as the world's most important nation, the people needs a few new heroes to believe in American society again.In this movie, you see how democratic institutions, dominant military forces and social cohesion defeat corruption, exploitation and selfishness in the worst among the developing countries. The film presents the United States of America and Somalia as complementary antitheses which feels a little bit like lazy propaganda.While the main villain constantly expresses a positive opinion about the American dream and how he could have a better life in that country, I must though admit that the movie also shows us the dark sides of some typically American values as individualism and weapons happen to be completely useless to resolve this movie's issues. Diplomatic elements, earthiness and shrewdness are the key elements leading to a predictable happy ending instead of a loner's brute force.Apart of its minimal propaganda tendencies and the predictable ending, I didn't like the character of Captain Philipps at all. I'm not sure if Tom Hanks wanted to portray an arrogant and unsympathetic old bourgeois but if this was the intention of the makers, his acting is simply perfect. If the intentions were to create a sympathetic main actor, he completely failed though. It's hard to tell but usually, this kind of movie tries to create an emotional connection between the main character and the viewers and this movie just doesn't manage to build this up. From the beginning on, I had no connection with the main character and didn't really care about his fate.Another small but important element I didn't appreciate was the fact that the main villain's English was so good. It's more than just a surprise that a pirate living in a desperate country ridden by a bloody civil war for more than two decades is able to speak English so well. I'm not sure if a young man like this ever had the chance to go to school at all. That's why this little detail and the general profound interactions between Captain Philipps and Muse feel a little bit too fabulous to me.The movie's strengths are elsewhere. First of all, this film is filled with incredible tension and especially the claustrophobic and uneasy last third feels very intense and real. The acting is only one part of the gripping formula. The great soundtrack, the efficient light effects and the out-thought camera positioning create this nervous feeling.The movie starts as a documentary in the first moments, slowly turns into an atmospheric thriller towards the middle, then it gets a refreshing action boost between the second and last third and it ends as an oppressive chamber piece. This mixture is very well balanced by the makers and the movie never gets boring in my opinion. Even though the content of the script is sometimes flawed, its general segment linearization is of the highest quality.The film also has its dramatic and philosophic elements as the villains aren't just brutal criminals but four very young and sometimes naive men who have no choice but to go through this hell to stay alive and take care of their elders and own families. The acting of the four Somalian pirates is simply outstanding and especially the performance by Abdi Barkhad is absolutely authentic and intense. Sometimes, the movie doesn't feel acted at all as if the real persons were replaying the tragic events that really happened in a slightly transformed way. This is where the movie almost looks like a documentary of the most intense kind.Despite its little flaws, this movie is truly intense and feels authentic. The first third has a few lengths but the last two thirds will keep you on the edge of your seat as almost no other movie this year. While the story itself and Tom Hank's acting aren't very good, the claustrophobic atmosphere and the incredible performances by the four young African actors are worth a few Academy Awards. I hope to see more from these four actors in the near future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Definition of Over-dramatization,"4.5 of 10. From the beginning car conversation to the end, this feels like an over-dramatization made worse and more artificial with voice overs. To make it worse, it's far too long for this kind of story.What should be a heroic tragedy is little more than a military-industrial, flag-waving, propaganda film.

A nailbiter!,"Simply put, Paul Greengrass is a brilliant director. His United 93 is one of the great films of the first quarter of this century, even though many have avoided it due to its content. This isn't quite up to that, but it is a relentlessly riveting true life saga of a cargo ship attacked by Somalian pirates. It was also a cargo ship that was not allowed to carry weapons. Tom Hanks plays the title role and he provides some of the best acting he has ever done during the last 20 minutes or so of this fine film, but somehow he has met his match with Barkhad Abdi in his film debut. They have some riveting scenes together and while the Abdi character is the enemy, the way this is presented you cannot help but feel some compassion for a man caught in a web of no way out. One of Greengrass' great talents is making such suspenseful films out of true life stories in which much of the audience knows the ending before seeing the actual film. He also doesn't need true stories to make such tension as the Bourne films have proven. He is a master of his craft.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

This is an amazingly intense retelling of a Sudanese pirate attack on an American freight liner.,"The tension was so well built in this film, that even though I knew from following the news how it all ends...I still wasn't sure watching this film what was going to happen! The acting was amazing. I can speak from decades of experience in a trauma center that Tom Hank's performance in the medical station was spot on for trauma victim survivors.This tells the real life story of American container ship captain and Maersk employee Captain Phillips' harrowing ordeal as his container ship was boarded, while traversing the Sudan Straight on the way around Cape Horn, by a band of armed Sudanese pirates.The tension is built so well it is nail bitingly intense as we see all of the maneuvers that Captain Phillips employs to try to keep his crew safe.I would put it on the should see list. It is not billed as a suspense film...but the tension was there for one. I think fans of suspense, history and just really good cinema will enjoy this film.

Makes a Better Yahoo News Story Than a Movie,"I first saw this movie a few weeks ago out of pure interest. The high ratings and rave reviews intrigued me enough to give it a look see. I knew nothing about this film apart from it being based on ""actual events"". Now, like any film based on real life events, there's always two sides of the story being told. What those who experienced it say, and what we see on the big screen. Nevertheless, I went into this film with an open mind. Tom Hanks once again proves his range as an actor, although for this film it wasn't as extended as in other roles he's portrayed. The reason I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10 has nothing to do with any of the performances in this film. Everyone was excellent, including Barkad Abdi, who does incredibly well for his first time on screen ever. The reason for the low score, the story is bland. I understand that not every film needs to have guns blazing, cars exploding, or CGI in every scene to be a good film, this movie is just bland. There are a remote few times where your heart gets racing about how a scene will play out, then you get dragged on for extended periods of time where nothing happens. I mean no disrespect to anyone in this film, nor those who went through this ordeal, but this is just not the type of story you turn into a major motion picture.

Power Politics,"So, America is this powerful, rich, great country full of educated people with humanity, and this little third-world poor country, Somalia, is just so uncivilized, so pathetic, therefor they are dirty and ugly, they have to have big yellow teeth, and they are cruel, they are disordered, they are just doomed to be so hateful?! What the F is this! Just because you are powerful, so you can manipulate the poor however you want?! Make yourself a hero, and other people just a bunch of rats? I really felt so shameful for this movie. Yes, I know ""its based on true story"". BlaBlaBla I just hate you rape people all over to make yourself look so good. My heart hurts for Somalia.

But if you hate hegemonies and power politics like I do, don't go see it and get upset. Make a donation to Somalia instead.

Captain Phillips Drowns in its Pace,"Paul Greengrass is the creator of one of the most exhilarating and outright brilliant action trilogies out there (The Bourne Trilogy), and now, he has taken the helm behind a production, centering on a shocking true story in which an American cargo ship was captured by Somali pirates in 2009. I'll reveal nothing more because the whole thrill is not having any knowledge of what lies ahead. Now, I'll be real straightforward this time around, and it really pains me to say this, but I just was really disappointed with the film altogether. Yes, I'll give the film its props for the splendid technical aspect of it all, and I guess I'll delve into that area first before I proceed with a more negative tone.As usual, Greengrass's filmmaking techniques are in a league of their own as he prefers to cut the theatrical and cinematic appearance to a minimum and immerse us in a perilous setting by engaging in fast-paced, fairly shaky camera-work. Some might complain about this method, but I find it excellently unique and applaud him on that note because it essentially is what keeps the film so tense. Vividly displaying shots of various sceneries and movements, coupled with intense music, strongly contribute to the picture's finest moments. In addition, you have the quick-cut, frenetic editing- again, at the top of its game. Greengrass has basically perfected all of these elements already in his past projects, so it's no surprise that Captain Phillips fully delivers in that department this time around as well. The production, overall, is a very wild one since the director famously casts real individuals (in whatever job positions he desires to implement into the story). You'll see actual navy officers and army nurses throughout the story, and unlike previous movies with such gimmicks, these people feel utterly convincing in their roles.Then, there's Tom Hanks whom everyone knows and loves. He's definitely one of the greatest actors of our time, and his incredibly impressive resume unquestionably backs that claim up. Tom Hanks takes on the role of the captain (Captain Phillips!), hoping to lead this cargo ship to its destination until it unfortunately encounters terribly aggressive conflict. In the last ten minute alone, there's no doubt in my mind when I say that he absolutely delivers one of the best male performances of the year, and I'm excited to see him receive a lot of credit once everything is said and done this year. On top of that, we have the Somali pirates with their own captain, Muse(played by Barkhad Abdi), who also provides us with an exceptional performance, which I'm definitely not going to forget once I start considering the best supporting actor of this year. There's that abundance of menace and unpredictability in his eyes the entire time, but at the same time, we feel some form of pity and sadness towards him due to these circumstances and background that force him into this predicament and pit him against the best of the best.Judging from the trailers, you feel this unimaginable detest towards the villains already, right? But seeing the film- for those who consider philosophical theories like Cultural Relativism- you suddenly and unexpectedly find yourself slightly sympathizing with some of these generally despicable and horrendous human beings (if you can call them that), but then again, you'll always be rooting for Tom Hanks' character and all those aboard the MV Maersk Alabama. The villains' objectives and determined actions, however, bring up a decently relevant point: if people have the opportunity, they'll always want more and more money in the end- that greed that unfortunately has consumed most of mankind. With that being said, all the actors involved for that matter, no matter how small their screen time, succeed in building the intensity and believability of the disastrous situation. The soundtrack, itself, is another excellent attachment, fueling the pumping suspense with that Bourne-like flavor. Whenever you want one of your scenes to completely pack a large punch, the easiest way to do so is include thunderous and beating music, which is what ultimately compliments the film's shining sequences.Aside from that though , there are certain flaws of Captain Phillips that really detracted from the experience and left a bad taste in my mouth- actually a taste that truly saddened me in that I wished I would've enjoyed the film so much more like many apparently did. All in all, the feature doubtlessly suffers from pacing issues. Honestly, I can't understand how such a great amount of people found films like Gravity and Captain Phillips tense. Yes, there were particular segments that felt remarkably tense, but contrary to popular opinion, the film did not keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time, but I guess I must have ADD problems, right? Because I found myself zoning out plenty of times, and that's clearly not good in the slightest. The film didn't capture my attention the way some of my favorites this fall season have: Rush and Don Jon, specifically. I know, I know. Some will blast me for preferring those two over Captain Phillips, but I stand by my statement; the film feels dragged out, and it's simple as that- the latter half especially. And in it being stretched out is the reason why I felt it wasn't nearly as tense as many considered it to be (my bad). Some films (over 2-3 hours) pass by like no tomorrow, but this one's length certainly seemed obvious. There were some minor issues I had with the film such as the presence of some scenes being a little exaggerated in their dramatic delivery (an overly, exhausting amount of screaming and yelling) for the fullest Hollywood effect, but it's the undeniably noticeable pacing that remains the greatest trouble for the film and what sadly restrains Captain Phillips from the potential heights it could've reached when I announce my own picks and movie awards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I love it!,"""Captain Phillips"" is a movie directed by Paul Greengrass that tells the story of a 2009 incident where Somali pirates hijack an American cargo ship. The movie is not just an intense hostage thriller, but also a macro-economic narrative that explores systemic financial inequality in the maritime domain.The film begins by portraying the ordinary life of Captain Phillips and the poverty-stricken Somali village, introducing the determined Muse. The story then reveals two men with different jobs defined by circumstance rather than character intricacies. The script avoids manipulating sympathy or demonizing characters, allowing the audience to acknowledge Muse's humanity without undue efforts to sway emotions.The movie generates relentless tension from the moment the Somali skiffs appear on the radar, filmed in Greengrass' trademark handheld style aboard actual ships involved in the incident. The director skillfully navigates complex spaces, offering a visually coherent experience that engages the audience in anticipating each party's next move. The film's suspense surpasses that of ""Gravity,"" leaving viewers emotionally moved by the traumatic journey.Despite its intense narrative, ""Captain Phillips"" is not just about escaping one situation but about being perpetual victims of another. While some reviews label it as a portrayal of American exceptionalism, the film subtly challenges this notion. The overwhelming force of the U. S. Navy, depicted with morbid comedy, highlights the economic disparity that propels individuals into extreme choices. The disparity is evident as a 16-year-old pirate faces off against a well-equipped military force, showcasing the absurdity of the situation.The film concludes with a reflection on the inability to address deep-rooted economic disparities despite advanced military capabilities. It suggests that while Americans excel at crisis management, the fundamental issues persist, creating situations where children become soldiers and men turn to piracy. ""Captain Phillips"" raises awareness about the futility of certain solutions and underscores the need to address the underlying problems contributing to global financial stratification.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Seriously?,"Another Hollywood hijacking film. I find it hard to believe that IMDb has this film rated ahead of other films such as Munich, which was clearly in my mind a much, much better hijacking film that was also very predictable,(Both being true historical stories of course). Munich worked, even despite its obvious predictability of the true event it documented. Captain Philips on the other hand, I knew less about the true story, but yet it seemed even more predictable, so predictable in fact that Jason Statham should have been in it. This film should honestly be rated a lot closer to the old Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin hijacking film The Delta Force, rather than being rated anywhere near Munich. Seriously, its ridiculous people, check yourself. The worst part of Captain Philips was that it insulted its audience and the hijackers at points in the film with its overt obviousness. To me, this film had some good moments, but overall it's a 6 out of 10 at the very best. The also very predictable but good Apollo 13 even built far more suspense than this film did at any point. The biggest highlight here was the lead hijacker's role, other than that, this is mostly a pretty bland and overly cartoonish Hollywood drama. 5.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"A Story So Compelling, it is More Than Worth Telling","A story so compelling and worth telling, Captain Phillips is the biographical account of one Captain Richard Phillips' actions in response to a hijacking by Somali pirates on his cargo ship in 2009. Despite accusations of the film's depiction of real events as misleading, as a standalone piece, Paul Greengrass' thrilling direction and Tom Hanks' phenomenal performance combine for one of 2013's most surprising, intense and breathtaking cinematic offerings.The less you know about the factual events going into Captain Phillips, the more enhanced the experience of seeing a recreation of others' experiences will be, due to the surprising turns and uncertainty of the film's climactic moments.The severe intensity and feeling of insecurity shroud your senses throughout the 134 minute duration of Captain Phillips. Like watching Breaking Bad, the sensations that the film evokes in you are indescribable, plentiful and so miscellaneous, causing you to become a servant to Greengrass' masterful filmmaking. This is how a biographical drama should feel: real, regardless of the fact that most watching will never experience the actions represented on screen.An area in which the film arguably lacks is in its treatment of the sensitivity of piracy as less of a one-dimensional issue as it can often be perceived. While the themes around the social issues of Somali piracy are present, they are not entrenched into the narrative as the most memorable aspect of the film. More so, the film emphasises and brings attention to piracy more broadly as a global issue to be taken seriously. Prior to the intense hijacking sequences, Hanks, as Phillips, is consistently undermined in his concerns about the threat of piracy upon the MV Maersk Alabama, until of course the ship is successfully boarded by the four pirates. Captain Phillips favours thriller over drama, intensity over the propensity of piracy for many, but this by no means is a downfall for the film, just an observation I've spent too long writing about so let's move on.Hanks' portrayal as the seemingly heroic Captain is not only one of his most memorable, but one of the most unforgettable performances in recent history. It is literal insanity how tremendously the actor clutches us all in to his character's palm, in order to give us an almost POV seat into the tribulations of his character. In addition to the film's perfect pacing, Tom Hanks' portrayal completely makes you lose track of time as your awareness is at one with the film's pace; you go wherever the Captain or Captor Abduwali Muse (brilliantly played by Barkhad Abdi) go. The film's concluding scene alone is a triumph in cinema, in acting and in emotional expression as Hanks delivers a heart-wrenching, throat- lumping and tear-inducing performance, so powerful it almost makes his acting throughout the rest of the film seem like a school play, but not quite...or at all.Though not executed perfectly, Captain Phillips brings to light the darkness and seriousness of piracy. With a heavier concentration on Richard Phillips and its thriller genre, the biography based on the book by the Captain is a heart-pounding survival film that leaves you sweating, in awe and only able to reclaim your breath once the credits begin to scroll. In spite of the numerous bodily functions the film's wonderful score, masterful direction, talented actors and overall experience have you performing, they are functions worth having. Exhaustingly intense, Captain Phillips is an undoubted contender for the year's most outstanding feature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Ends up being too much all over the place,"Captain Phillips shows us primitive, aggressive Somalis and badass Americans saving the day in overkill fashion - for the greater good, ostensibly. And sadly this all probably isn't very far away from how things have become in some parts of this petty planet. In other words, this is a film about cynics in every respect, relieved by the goodness and heroics of the title character, who - with all due respect - seems to have been subjected to a little overdose of hero-worship by director Paul Greengrass. Other than showing off his captain, however, I'm not quite sure what Greengrass wants to do here. A fine matter-of-factly opening turns into an intense and interesting middle-part (even if the cameramen seem at least as shaken as the ship's crew by what's going on), before we get treated to an overflow of good captain, inept pirates, and overpowering American forces in a protracted finale which runs out of steam well before the end. The film wants to be full of message, alternating between applauding and denouncing the old US of A, but ends up being too much all over the place. Still, there's fine acting and quite a bit of tension all the way through, for those who enjoy old-fashioned action formulas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the real world.,"Paul Greengrass new film welcomes us into the lives of two different characters with one common purpose, that is survivor. A responsible and decent captain of an American cargo ship and a poor pirate from Somalia. Their journey begins when these two men meet. Captain Philips becomes a hostage from a group of pirates with their goal to take him to Somalia in order to receive a huge ransom. A true story, a powerful thriller personal, political and moral tensions, a stocky protagonist gives recitals interpretation. The big question is who's site are you with. Both characters struggle for their own lives. On Captain Philip's site to keep his family financial satisfy. On the other hand a pirate following orders to hijack cargo ships with weapons and earn a small amount of money so he can feed his own family. Its a thin red line between both sites. It is obvious who wins at the end. And its always the powerful and the ""good"" in circumstances like this. Excellent direction by Paul Greengrass with a documentary-like shooting, an absolutely realistic atmosphere than will take your breath away. In my opinion this is Tom Hanks best performance since Cast Away, and probably the best film of 2013.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Really?,"I really appreciate Tom Hanks as an actor, so when I go to the Redbox and look for something to rent that could be a decent film, I can kind of count on anything he's in to be at least watchable and worth my time. However, this film frustrated me. Mostly because this actually happened in real life and it didn't need to happen. Then, then they add insult to injury by making a movie out of it.Here's why I am scratching my head over this...The shipping line, the US Navy and US government are aware there is piracy constantly happening off the coast of Africa. Yet, these large cargo ships head out there without any protection. They cannot expect the crew to be guards/mercenaries/troops, etc. Fair enough. However, why not avoid a hijacking in the first place by hiring a few trained professionals to handle a potential problem? Seems so simple to do that. All the time I am watching two motor boats with about 8 guys go after a big ship I'm thinking, ""what? can't they take care for his situation easily? Aren't prepared for this? Don't they have someone on board to take these peons out?""Apparently not. Instead, the Navy et al have to get involved, potentially jeopardizing lives, spending tax payers money, etc because those in charge did not take precautions. It made me more angry and annoyed than sympathetic. About 1/3 into the film I had to stop watching because I thought the whole notion they DIDN'T hire anyone to safeguard them was the dumbest move ever! I lost all interest at that point.Note to shipping lines...hire a few key personnel to safeguard your ship so something like ""Captain Phillips"" doesn't have to happen.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
better than expected,"Since this was based on a true story, I didn't think it would be that great since you already know what happens. But, it was better than I expected. The writers made the movie thrilling and intense. The pirates first try to board the boat but are successfully driving away. This part was entertaining. Then the pirates make a second attempt and manage to board. Captain Phillips manages to keep most of the crew safe and is double crossed on a deal. Then it is him that the navy and US Seals must rescue. I also thought the dialog between the pirates was done well. It seemed legit with the arguing but they had to throw in the one crazy one that just wants to kill. That was so Hollywood.

The story also doesn't rely on CGI or anyone saving the day to make things more exciting although we do get a huge section with Navy boats, SEALs and a helicopter but I suppose that part is true.Tom Hanks character is subdued until the end when he's in shock, that's when I enjoyed him the most. He does a good job, he's Tom Hanks. We also get things from the pirates POV which was great, I felt sympathy for all of them.

Solid film in all aspects,"I keep wanting to rate Captain Phillips as 8, but keep coming back to 7. It is a solid film, with a few minor items holding it down. I remember this event, but didn't follow the details of how the capture went down, how the escape took place, and how it all played out in the end. Knowing that Phillips lives to write this story takes a little drama out, but not too much.Because the acting is inspiring. Tom Hanks is terrific, especially in the 2nd half of the film where you see him disintegrate before your eyes as his situation falls apart. You really feel his hope fade as drug- crazed pirates start to realize the same disintegration is happening to their hopes. The clash of desperation from both sides is what makes this a superior thriller, again, especially in the 2nd half.The actor playing Muse was terrific, as was his band of pirates. Hard to believe he was like a taxi driver taken off the streets to play this character - he was terrific. The cinematography was outstanding, with breathtaking vistas of Somalian beaches, wide open oceans, and a huge tanker. The Director does a great job of getting the story accurate, and keeping it taut, though, the final chase scenes took a little longer than you'd like.

A very competent thriller with a great lead,"Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is an effective commercial thriller with a great lead by Tom Hanks. The movie tells the ""true"" story of a US ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009, and its captain who gives the movie its name. Being this story true or not, manipulated for Hollywood or not, Captain Phillips works as a movie, even if it is nowhere near the Bourne series. The way Greengrass works his limited set is very good, and he proves once again that he is one of the few masters of the shaky camera technique. If you are looking for a well directed, entertaining and legitimately suspenseful thrill, this is definitely the movie for you, but certainly nothing more than that.

Riveting real-life thriller with Tom Hanks at his best,"Not a lot hinges on whether you know the outcome of Captain Richard Phillips' true-life run-in with a small crew of Somali pirates in 2009, as, like director Paul Greengrass's other tale of real-life heroism in the face of a terrorist threat, United 93 (2006), the film gathers up enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat. It's not as good as United 93, as the film often struggles to keep things exciting in the long moments between the action, but Tom Hanks has more than enough presence to carry the film, and here gives possibly his best ever performance. Which makes it all the more surprising that Hanks - usually a darling with the Oscars with sentimental drivel such as Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994) - has missed out this year.Captain Phillips (Hanks) is waved off at the airport by his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener in a one-scene cameo) as he flies to Oman to take command of the Maersk Alabama, that he soon realises will take him around the Somali Peninsula. Sure enough, on the Somali coast, they are chased by ambitious pirate Muse (Barkhad Abdi) in a skiff, with a crew consisting of hot-head Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman), nervous Najee (Faysal Ahmed) and young first-timer Elmi (Mahat M. Ali). They protect the ship for as long as they can, but the pirates are soon on board demanding payment. Phillips offers them $30,000, but it won't be enough for the ruthless warlords who employ Muse, so they take Phillips for ransom.One of the main reasons why Captain Phillips works so well is that Phillips himself comes across as a true hero. Not a gun-toting, vest- wearing action hero, but an everyday guy who probably enjoys a comfortable suburban lifestyle with his family when he's not at sea. He's over middle-aged, slightly portly and not particularly handsome, but most importantly he's real, and a underdog to truly root for. In the time spent in the lifeboat as Muse and his crew head back to Somalia with their prize - with Navy SEALS in tow - allows Phillips and Muse time to slowly share experiences. Muse, fabulously portrayed by the Oscar-nominated Abdi, is a simple guy as well. It's just that in his country, poverty doesn't allow for any legal trades to be a wise option, so rather than plundering the sea for the fish that American ships have already hoovered up, they steal and kidnap.But Greengrass is wise enough not to over-egg these scenes, or even allow us to sympathise too much with the pirates. But he allows us to understand them, to see things from their perspective. What they do is wrong and evil, yes, but when your country is governed by violent warlords and your life depended on coming back with something of real value, it's no surprise that they do what they do. And as the gravity of the situation dawns on the pirates, the film becomes a treadmill of heart-pounding small moments, where every second could either offer up a small opportunity for Phillips to escape or fight, or it could mean that he will never see his family again. Muse and his crew have done this before, but they are ill-equipped, desperate and twitchy.As exciting as all those moments are, the film's most powerful scene is at the end, as Phillips breaks down whilst being medically treated by the American military. Up to this point, Phillips is kept at a distance, seeing very little of his true character before the pirates arrive. Hanks gives a devastating, improvised performance in this moment, as he struggles to process and comprehend the ordeal he has just been through. For an action film especially, this is an immensely powerful scene, and it re-enforces the human tragedy of the story. A riveting film overall, and proves again that Greengrass can't be matched in portraying a real- life incident with such heart, realism, and thrills.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
These High Review Scores Are Fake,"I tend to write comprehensive reviews but for this movie there is simply no need. It's plain boring and the high scores it's receiving are clearly just due to marketing, in the same way that Justin Bieber has more fake twitter followers than real ones.The acting is just fine but the plot is practically non-existent. Between pirates getting on a cargo ship and Navy Seals shooting some faces, what is in between in not an exposé on the unfortunate causes for this piracy problem (only 3 lines are said on the topic) nor is it a tense thriller (unless you think listening to Somalian men rant, fueled by claustrophobia and general cluelessness every other minute is a riveting way to spend 2 hours). The script is garbage, the pirates are absolute morons and Tom Hanks does little but mumble or sit quietly. This is a 15 minute short stretched into a feature length that gives you the hope of something interesting happening until you realize it's building towards nothing and you've just wasted your time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent Action Adventure; Why It Is Not a Ten; Clash of Civilizations,"""Captain Phillips"" is an excellent action-adventure film. It is riveting, suspenseful, exciting, and very well-made. There are no off moments; no built-in ""bathroom breaks."" Somali pirates capturing an American ship off the Horn of Africa is a timely and fraught topic.The film's verisimilitude is so powerful at times I really did drift into thinking that I was watching a documentary. There's a lot of money up on the screen: cargo vessels, beat-up pirate skiffs, ports, open ocean, Navy warships. Even so it was the performances and the pacing that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I found every last character so well played and gripping, right down to the medic who appears toward the end, that I wondered if Director Paul Greenglass had not hired real corpsmen, or real pirates.Sound is used masterfully. Loud, pulsing music suddenly stops at key moments. Yeah, it's an old trick, but it works especially well here.This is the kind of film I am grateful to have seen in a theater, and I am eager to recommend to friends. Even though action-adventure is not my genre, I'd re-watch this film, and that is high praise.This film is so consistently excellent that one must ask why it doesn't raise to the level of a ten-out-of-ten star film. ""Captain Phillips"" touches on some of the biggest issues of our times: the collision between the First World and the Third World, poverty in Africa, jihad. ""Captain Phillips"" assiduously avoids addressing any of these issues.From this film, viewers would never know that the millions of dollars in ship ransom that pirates claim goes to al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that attacked a mall in Kenya. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) offers rationalizations for piracy: Western nations stole Somalia's fish, and piracy is the ""tax"" for that. Pirates made millions of dollars through piracy. Those millions were not pocketed by the pirates themselves, who work for others. No reference is made to Somalis, in 1993, dragging an American soldier through Mogadishu's streets. Americans were attempting to help Somalis after a famine.Phillips does mention that his ship, waylaid by pirates, was carrying food aid for hungry Africans.None of this is gone into in any detail in the script, and it could have been.Rather, the First World - Third World clash, and the clash of civilizations and religions is communicated solely through images, and, in the absence of a complex script, the images speak very loudly.Somalia is depicted as a dusty, dry, hellhole. Somalis are depicted as chaotic, unproductive, violent, angry, greedy, and lawless. Somalis are dressed in discarded Western clothing and plastic sandals, or simply barefoot. They live in huts. They only things they possess that give them any power is the guns that they got from Westerners. Somalis hold life cheaply and are ready to kill and die.Americans are depicted as orderly, disciplined, skilled, courageous, and productive. Americans devote massive amounts of money to saving one life.When the Somali pirates manage to get their ladder against the Maersk Alabama, the image suggests the pirates as invasive parasites attempting to assault a larger, more successful organism. Whereas the Westerners have built a civilization that creates ships and commerce, the Somalis have created only violence, chaos and greed. They must take guns that they themselves can't manufacture and invade more productive peoples in order to survive. It's an ugly picture, and I can completely understand if Somalis are enraged by this film.Andrew O'Hehir, Salon's film critic, apparently was enraged by the film, and he lambasted it. It was distressing to O'Hehir to watch ""corn-fed, gym-toned"" Americans struggle against ""malnourished"" Africans. That the thin Africans were holding guns to the heads of the Americans did not disturb him. O'Hehir calls the film ""unpleasant and uncomfortable."" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage. What a sick dude, you want to say. But his view is all too common.I greatly enjoyed this movie. It could have been an all-time classic if the script had offered some insight into the issues the images depicted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Roller coaster of emotions and intensity,"Nowadays it is obvious to see movies which were made to make money and hit the charts for couple of weeks thanks to the rumors spinning around about how good the movies and how hot the chicks are. Vampire movies, Kardashian butt maneuvering episodes appeal the audience to the auditoriums and leave the real movie fans frustrated.It is even more frustrating to see terrible movies from renowned directors and actors.I knew for sure this movie was NOT going to be one of the other movies which are nothing but waste-of-money. One word to summarize this movie is INTENSE! If ever there were a lesson on keeping an audience captivated by taking them through a roller-coaster of emotions look no further than Paul Greengrass's latest thriller, ""Captain Philips"". Inspired by true events of March 2009, when Richard Philips, the Captain of a cargo ship was taken hostage by Somali pirates, this film has everything: drama, suspense, heroics In truly nail-biting fashion, Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Philips and executes these emotions flawlessly.So convincing is his performance that you would be forgiven for almost believing that you were on the journey with him, sharing his pain, courage and at times total anguish. Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse - the leader of the pirates - is riveting, going toe-to-toe with Hank in terms of wit, and carrying out the role of 'the villain' to perfection but not in your stereotypical way as he evokes an element of empathy amongst viewers.As the story unfolds, it keeps you wondering and guessing right until the very end. Underlying questions keep you on the edge of your seat: what will happen to Captain Philips? Will Muse's unpredictable nature take a turn for the worse? How much longer can they survive? Nowadays, it's all too easy to leverage special effects with an A-list cast, throwing in some loud bangs and call it a thriller. I'm a firm believer that the point of Cinema is to communicate the story whilst keeping the audience captivated. 'Captain Philips' not only achieves this with ease but delivers a story rich in dialog and accurately reflecting the events of March 2009 through the lives of relate-able characters. Somali pirates' exploits are well documented in our news, however this story is palpable to such an extent that it brings you as close to the real life event as possible whilst avoiding all the associated dangers.The feeling of fear setting in as pirates approach the ship, the anguish felt as Captain Philips is taken hostage, the unpredictable violence of Muse, may all be cinematic: however, as you watch the story unravel these feelings will be anything but cinematic. The words ""must watch"" are overused in our industry but if you are after an intense ride, with a wave of emotions and character depth in abundance, 'Captain Philips' is definitely a must watch. It is great to view this movie on bluray as the picture is unwavering , effects are vowen in depth . Worth every dime !Evren Buyruk, Plano,TX USA",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Hanks is back to his best, Abdi's debut is as good as anyones","If you thought Pirates died out in the 1700′s and only reappeared in Jack Sparrow's adventures then your very wrong.Piracy is very much still a huge problem, so much that in 2011 there were 151 reported attacks on ships off the shores of Somalia. There is an estimated 3000-5000 operating out of Somalia. In 2009 a group of these Somali pirates boarded and attempted to hijack the MV Maersk Alabama.The film Captain Philips follows the events of the attempted hijacking of the container ship off the coast of Somalia. Tom hanks plays the captain of the ship Captain Richard Phillips. Hanks is back and back with a bang in this movie as he is simply flawless throughout. The film is filled with suspense and tells the story in such a realistic way, if you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be held hostage by terrifying Somali pirates armed with AK47′s then just watch this movie.Surprisingly the stand out performance does not come from hanks even though he is magnificent. The stand out performance comes from Barkhad Abdi. Abdi plays the leader of the pirate group. His performance is worthy the Oscar nomination its received.""Look at me, Look at me, I am the captain now""One line from a performance that will stand out for a very long time.Director Paul Greengrass as made a fantastic portrayal of this story that deserves to be told.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Watch how the Navy responded is reassuring and praise to their executed plan.

Based on facts... Loosely based on facts,"This is a pretty good movie, but if you are looking for a documentary of what really happened move along. There is a whole lot of Hollywood taking liberties with the story. Half the crew of the ship is currently in lawsuits with the shipping line because they say the captain put them in danger in his quest to maximize profits. There is no question that this whole saga was a political showcase for the United States and this movie maintains this showcase. It could be used as a recruiting tool. In summary, I found the movie entertaining and interesting, but I was annoyed with how much it veered from the truth. It would be much better if it were more factual.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Victory at Sea,"This film is highly recommended.The talented director, Paul Greengrass, has successfully tackled the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and his 2009 ordeal in the new docudrama, Captain Phillips. The film tells the harrowing story of Somali pirates, armed with automatic weapons, boarding and hijacking an unarmed American cargo ship and holding its crew at ransom.The director's trademark pseudo-real, in-your-face photography is front and center with his jittery hand-held camera-work and multiple close-ups used to build the tension of a hostage situation, a technique that he used so famously in United 93 and two of the Bourne installments. Using a cinéma vérité style of filmmaking, there is a quasi-documentary approach to the story which works so effectively in this film.The script by Billy Ray tries to present both of of the hijacking. He shrewdly begins his narrative with some background scenes of Phillips' typical ordinary day with his wife (an underused Catherine Keener) in his suburban community and contrasts that with the squalor and poor living conditions of a Somali village, where the desperate men are forced into making a criminal choice, all this prior to the violent act that will bring both parties together.Desperation is the running theme in Captain Phillips. Men with no hope and no options, forced into illegal acts of brutality. An innocent man placed into a life-and-death waiting game. The results between these two dissimilar types are catastrophic as we watch the battle of captor and captives unfold.Casting is foremost if we are to believe in this situation, and Greengrass has done a exemplary job by having Tom Hanks in the title role. This is one of Hanks' best performances ever. He plays this Everyman with an earnestness and directness, trying to outwit his kidnappers one moment and sensitively understanding their plight, although the character, as written, seems a bit too heroic and courageous at times. The actor underplays the fear and carefully sidesteps the selflessness of Phillips, making him less virtuous and more human. Hanks' definitive final scene packs the emotional wallop needed to register to the audience that this is a common man placed in unusual peril, not a superhero. The lingering aftermath of this traumatic nightmare and the film's parting image of Hanks is highly emotional and gut-wrenching, distilling all of his bottled-up anguish and misery into one memorable scene.As Muse, the Somali leader of the kidnappers, Barkhad Abdi (in his first acting role), brings the perfect degree of menace and tragedy to his character. His physical leanness and intense stare only adds to the suspense and the overall horror of this terroristic act. Playing the hijackers are Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysai Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, all of which bring major support to their characters and their volatile relationships.Unlike most films today, Captain Phillips is more substance than style, sans gimmicks and intrusive visual sleight of hand. The film is an old fashion drama (and I mean that in the best sense), well-crafted and sensitively told, with strong narrative drive, superb direction, and a commanding performance by Hanks as Captain Phillips. This is a great film. GRADE: A-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Claustrophobic and uncertain; a tense thriller that ultimately lacks depth.,"Regardless of how closely it sticks to the real-life events upon which it is based, 'Captain Phillips (2013)' focuses on the claustrophobia and uncertainty that comes about when a ship's captain has his boat commandeered by modern-day pirates, placing most of its emphasis on the tension caused by the ever-shifting relationship between the boat's constantly scared crew and their unpredictably dangerous captors. While Greengrass' signature 'shaky' style fits the source-material and lends a realist feel, it does occasionally become quite over-bearing. The generally slow pace and lack of real character development - both of which ultimately prevent full audience engagement - also reduce the feature's overall impact. It generally knows what it is, however, right up until its explosive and, frankly, gut-wrenching finale. It focuses on doing its thing as well as it can throughout and, in the end, it's this that allows it to work as well as it does. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

An unusual cargo ship with no security measure.,Captain Phillips had very poor navigational skill and technical ability.Claimed to be based on true event but it had lot of glitches. Frankly reviewing Somalian pirates acted better than captain and were as good as Caribbean pirates(fancy pirates).The pirates were better navigator even with low technical resources. American cargo companies should recruit Somalian pirates for their services because they(pirates) made desperate efforts to take possession of the ship than to rescue the ship by captain.Story-based on true event-no comment acting-watch for Somalian pirates than captain. direction-Very good sound-good focus-good Cinematography-good could have been better.

Might Have Worked Better With An Unknown Lead,CAPTAIN PHILLIPS tells the story of the MV Maresk Alabama which was the first US cargo ship ship to be hijacked in two hundred years . I haven't bothered to research the history of American cargo ships being hijacked but I'm making a very educated guess that last time it was common place it was the British Royal Navy who were doing the hijacking which led to the war of 1812 . Therefore it's ironic that an American story is being told via a British director in this case Paul GreengrassGreengrass is a former producer of the ITV flagship current affairs show WORLD IN ACTION . Afterwards he got lucky with the Bourne sequels which had shaky cam and elliptical editing . It some ways CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is an uneasy amalgamation of realist cinema and social comment and the director wastes no time in showing the difference between America and Somalia . Captain Richard Phillips and his wife get in to their car and on the way to the docks discuss their son's career plans . Cut to Somalia where Abduwali Muse is woken from his corrugated iron shed by armed khat dealers . You can see instantly the point Greengrass is making with life in America being boring but stable and life in Somalia being dangerous and potentially short but I felt this point was a little bit too obvious to be successful in any wayAs the film continues so does the cinema verite style . The Somalians decide to hijack a cargo ship and like the Somalian plan as a film some things work and some things don't . I always wondered how it possible for a handful of pirates to hijack a cargo ship but this is easily explained by bringing a set of ladders with them ! Simple as that and the story is simply told which isn't necessarily a criticism as a game of cat and mouse is played out . It's fairly tense even if you know the outcome but one thing that constantly left me puzzled is why if you're making a real life story filmed in a realist style we have a Hollywood big hitter in Tom Hanks playing the eponymous captain . I never got the impression I was watching a character undergoing trauma and Captain Phillips was Tom Hanks being Tom Hanks which does drag the story down . As it stands I can understand why the film picked up six Oscar nominations which ended with the movie winning none of them,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Keeping it real (?),"This is based on a real story, but the crew from back then did not get tired trying to tell people that Tom Hanks version of the captain of the title is made making him look better than he actually was.

Whatever the case, this is not a documentary and the movie does a good job creating a very suspenseful environment.The villains might feel a bit over the top and there is another movie (more a documentary) that actually paints a better picture of how pirates operate or what their thinking and general life is, but this has no time to deal with that either.

The performances are quite solid across the board but I didn't find them as compelling as a lot of critics seemed to.

More interesting from the pirate's perspective...,"Paul Greengrass seems to live in his hectic shakycam aesthetic. With dull hues of blues and browns, he likes muddy stories of self-preservation and perseverance and tries his best not to sugarcoat the feeling with his style. While the inevitable tragedy of United 93 was more compelling and free to dodge developing characters, Captain Phillips does not have that luxury as it puts its ending on the poster. Argo has the same problem. We know how it ends yet the journey offers us no particular insight into a debate or a way of life that leads me to be bewildered at how anyone can possibly find these films exciting or tense. Tom Hanks has been receiving raves for his performance which is being called worthy of a comeback. He was good, especially in his hyped final 10 minutes, but I do feel as though he was underwritten. Hanks has always been notable for his portrayal of the ordinary man and here in Captain Phillips he's able to shed off his star persona and take on that role once more. But I don't think that's enough.Sometimes I feel like perhaps the writers did too much of a good job of making Phillips unsympathetic and the main antagonist pirate Muse, played admirably by Barkhad Abdi, sympathetic. In fact, its approach to the story feels so routine and uninvolving that I found myself more compelled by the idea of looking at it through the opposite perspective. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Phillips was a villainous character, you can look at any film through the eyes of its bad guy and call Indiana Jones the villain, but that doesn't make it a more interesting film. Captain Phillips is an exception as Muse's hypothetical 'hero's journey' hits fascinating story beats as Phillips constantly gets in his way through lies, manipulation and betrayal. Not that Muse's desire is justified, but his escape from his home certainly is. And in traditional Greengrass sense he gets the ironic tragic end. But then this perspective is more of an add-on if anything and not a deliberate alternative.Even so, Muse's henchmen are definitely bad and Phillips' crew are definitely good, and that's Hollywood's way of making the roles clear. It's just incredibly difficult to invest myself in Phillips' survival due to his behaviour and knowing how it ends. The only heroic act I found was protecting his crew, which he did, for a little while, then the film separates itself from that tension. In the second half, it just feels like military propaganda in the navy's near-perfect execution of a rescue mission. Fact or not, but this is the sugarcoating I know Greengrass doesn't want. Perfection is boring, flaws and obstacles would be more interesting. Muse has all the impossible-seeming obstacles. As usual, the technical aspects are reliably great, perhaps Greengrass' finest use of his shakycam which has had to grow on me over the years, but unfortunately they facilitate a bland film, redeemed slightly by its 'villain.' Really hope this doesn't end up as overpraised in awards as it already is.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gripping film that will take you hostage to the very end...,"You got to admire film directors and producers who take a gamble. With this film they could have played safe and stuck to clichés. Yet instead this film is a brave portrayal of its characters in a tense situation that is as fascinating as any piece of great fiction.We have Tom Hanks playing the captain, portraying the title role with a mixture of emotions without the need to force feed the point to the viewers. Courageous but frightened, intelligent but still feeling lost. It's an intriguing position.The protagonists are Somalian pirates, who rather than being written as some set of simple Bond villains, they instead are shown to be again a mixture of characteristics: loathsome and greedy, but really chancers who are ill-prepared and desperate, in over their heads. To the immense credit of the director, he has avoided some cheap simple and racist creation, and you feel you get an insight into these men's mentality.This was a tense thriller, a very frightening film too. This fact based film based on true events does leave the viewer on edge wondering what will happen next. It does surprise and all will find this film engrossing despite the discomfort they may feel through many points of the film.I'd recommend it highly. It's a truly great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Tom Hanks in Danger on the High Seas,"Tom Hanks gives an economical, terse performance in Paul Greengrass's dramatization of a true story about a cargo ship whose captain is taken hostage by a group of Somali pirates.""Captain Phillips"" did not have the nail biting punch to my gut that Greengrass's excellent ""United 93"" did, but that might be due to the fact that I didn't have as much invested in this story. The adjective terse applies to more than Hanks's performance -- Greengrass is an expert at cutting out any superfluous information and laser focusing his film on the events at hand. The film is refreshingly free of the usual action movie heroics; Hanks is a regular guy who has some training in how to deal with a pirate situation but who's never really been tested until one such situation actually arises. Nothing brings this point home more than the film's concluding scenes, during which Hanks, who has held up stoically through his ordeal, completely breaks down the way any of us would. This emotional punch makes what would otherwise have been a good action movie a really good one.There's something almost tragic about how misguided the pirates are in thinking that the United States would ever consider bargaining with them. Phillips the character and we the audience know that Phillips' life is expendable in a worst case scenario, and that knowledge adds an element of suspense to the already tense situation.I didn't respond as warmly to the film as so many others seem to have. I thought it was perfectly fine while watching it, some scenes were excellent, but little of it was memorable.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An impressive film with many flaws.,"'CAPTAIN PHILLIPS': Four Stars (Out of Five)Director Paul Greengrass's Oscar hopeful based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking of 2009, which was the first American cargo ship hijacked in 200 years. It's told from the point of view of the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, and based on his book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea'. The events of the story have been greatly contradicted and detested by Phillips' crew, creating a controversy around the film. I doubt the movie is a truthful telling of what actually happened in any way but it's still a good film. Greengrass's direction is once again masterful and the script by, Billy Ray (who's also co-written films like 'THE HUNGER GAMES', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'HART'S WAR' and 'BREACH', which he also directed), is intense and involving. The film is too long and drawn-out and filled with Hollywood clichés but it builds to a breathtaking conclusion and Tom Hanks, as the title character, gives one of the best performances of the year (and his career).The film takes place in April 2009, off the coast of Somalia, onboard a container ship called MV Maersk Alabama. We first meet it's captain, Richard Phillips (Hanks), as he's driving to his ship, in America, with his wife Andrea Phillips (Catherine Kenner). We know little about him other than he's worried about how current times have gotten much tougher for younger generations. We next see him at sea with his crew as he prepares for the worst and is then attacked by Somali pirates. They're led by a skinny young Somali named Muse (newcomer Barkhad Abdi). We also meet Muse at home, first, where he's barely surviving (like everyone in his community) and is forced into piracy. Phillips is able to ward off Muse and his men momentarily but they later board his ship and terrorize his crew. The captain does his best to protect his men and get the pirates off his ship.Captain Phillips' crew say they were highly offended by the film and that it was ""just horrendous"" to see a Hollywood movie depicting the arrogant and reckless Phillips, that jeopardized their lives to save time and money, as some kind of a hero. He was actually anything but and received several e-mails warning him of the piracy in the area but kept them from his crew and went off-course anyway (into pirate areas, despite his crew's cries not to). I usually don't have a problem with filmmakers taking creative license, and changing source material or true events, but in this case I do think it was distasteful. To make a film about a seemingly immoral man, who put his crew into such a torturous life-threatening situation and present him as a hero is morally wrong and offensive to the people involved. Just judging the film as a fictional movie though, and not based on any real people or true events, I do think it was a well made film. Flawed in pacing but strikingly moving in character development and, like I said, the ending is amazing. Hanks is truly astonishing and the film does do a good job of depicting the Somali pirates in a sympathetic way and showing how they were forced into a horrible situation they couldn't get out of (just like a lot of us). The filmmakers also casted inexperienced Somali actors in the pirate roles (through a worldwide casting search) and they were all good and convincing in the film (especially Abdi). The movie is an impressive film with many flaws, and can be seen as offensive, but it's still worth the watch in my opinion. It probably doesn't deserve all the Oscar hype (or future award recognition) though. Except for Hanks.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Motion Sick,"My wife and I were looking forward to seeing this movie. We love Tom Hanks, and the trailer looked good and the story was compelling. But we had to leave after only 30 minutes, because the shaky camera BS made it too hard to watch the movie, and my wife got sick. Ready to throw up sick. I just don't see the point behind this kind of film-making. This wasn't the Blair Witch Project. It wasn't ""ostensibly"" filmed by an amateur with a hand-held video camera. This ""technique"" doesn't even make the scenes more ""realistic"", because the human eye doesn't see action in a shaky camera way. It's just annoying. Really annoying. I wish they'd stop making movies this way. If you get motion sick at all, don't waste your money on the big screen version.

Good But Emotional,Captain Phillips is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It has incredible acting. It will always be amazing to me. It is one of the most emotional and intense movies I have ever seen. And I actually found myself shedding a few tears by the end. I knew all of this happened in real life but I did not know it was going to be the way it is. I'm not saying this is a bad thing but I'm basically trying to say that it is very packed and takes up a great 2 hours to 2 and a half hours of your time but it is worth it. I highly recommend you go see it while it is still in theaters or buy it when it comes out on home media.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Tom Hanks and Mr Greengrass,"Without any doubt, this could be an award movie. The subject : Pirates of Somalia, a hot topic and I have to say  very good put in scene. I believe Hollywood is spoiling us. I am European and the US movies always have that kind of hero theme ( sorry because of this feeling ). But lately we have very honest movies without that hero theme. That is good news for the cine critics. So, a hot news topic handled with care. Mr Greengrass keeps the tense in the complete movie, you won't turn away your head. Even the origin of the problem is touched when a scene recalls the fishing problem in Africa caused by the richest industrial fishing ""countries"". Even that issue was handled. Mr Hanks and Abdi are doing a great acting job, really outstanding ! Hanks even doesn't have to have lines to say, he is just a good actor you feel the situation. To the end of the movie he is marvelous, just outstanding. It is a thriller, but not just that; at the end you get that feeling, that feeling even you get pity about the situation of these Somalian people, these pirates, and we have to feel pity. In one way, we have caused the their situation they are in. You understand the situation the pirated ended up, the ""why"". You understand the Hank's situation and to the end he is fantastic. Just a great movie. Of course, I couldn't imagine a Hanks doing the job of Mr Costa, the captain of the cruise ship sank near Italy. This must be one of the best roles of the Hanks''s career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A must see movie!,"This movie surprisingly kept me at the edge of my seat. When I saw the trailer I thought that there was going to be non-stop violence throughout. I was wrong. However, parents that are reading, it is very violent despite its PG-13 rating. It is rather disturbing and bloody. You have to remember though that it is about pirates who try to take over a ship. This movie was astonishing though. Quite honestly, I believe that it is Tom Hanks's best performance yet. The pirate leader was great too. That was surprising since his current job other than the movie is a cab driver in Chicago. He had won the audition. I would not recommend this movie for someone under the age of 14. It is a very mature concept for kids. The end was very disturbing and little kids would not sleep for a while. It is definitely worth seeing and I will definitely be buying it when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Emotional Roller-coaster,"This movie is about decisions and actions of a civilian ship captain in hostile waters doing his duty as her understood his orders. Tom Hanks gives a very exceptional and emotional portrayal of Captain Phillips. Although you may know the details of the incident, seeing Hanks put words into actions was very emotional. Yes, you do see a great deal of this exceptional actor, but he is playing the title character of the movie so I would have been disappointed with anything less. The supporting actors worked very well in their roles as they looked the parts and the ship's crew expanded their parts as expected. I will let the politics of the Oscar committees play itself out, but I would recommend this film for many awards and for the viewing publics support.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Movie is better than a slightly miscast Tom Hanks,"First let me say i am a big fan of Tom Hanks.However i have to say i felt him slightly miscast in this movie,not that it spoils the movie in anyway at all,i just think he got the role because of who he is rather than what he could bring to the role.Don't however let this put you off what is a fine movie.You will be entertained by the whole experience but may be not bowled over by it. Its well made in all aspects as you would expect from those behind the project.Not in the same league as many of his other films but nevertheless a worthy effort and well worth a watch.This is my first review i think it may be boring but hopefully they will get better with time.Thanks to all other reviewers they really help to find the odd gem that sometimes slip under the radar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Everything gonna be OK,"That's the phrase which Muse (played by newcomer Barkhad Abdi) repeated four or five times. And indeed, everything went OK (well, awesome actually) for this film.The truth is despite the good critic I had read, I wasn't very sure if it was a good idea to watch it. However, the result was unexpectedly good, a fact that partly improved my opinion for modern Hollywood.The film offered great direction, screenplay and cinematography. It had a really good tempo, even though some people might get a little bored near the ending. Nevertheless, I believe that 'Captain Phillips' is a must just because of the performances. Tom Hanks reaches another peak in his career (perhaps another Oscar nomination?), while the four Somali pirates added a lot. Especially Barkhad Abdi delivers a compelling portrait and I hope this is the beginning of something beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good, but not Great...no Castaway here.","I liked the movie and the last 45 mins made it good. Up to that point, it was pretty uneventful. Just because this is a true story (critics seem to be the actual crew) this does not make it a great movie experience.True or not, I just could not get past how four men in a broken down boat could board a massive freighter. You telling be the massive Maersk company knowing there have been raids could not have a few armed guards for this territorial trip? That the crew who followed protocol could not at least try to pull the ladder at it latched onto the ship? Maybe I have watched too many movies where one guy takes out a crew, but this was hard to swallow...real or not. It took me out of the movie.This really was a kidnapper movie and the premeditated method of HOW to get the ransom money never discussed. It was all action without reason. After a while, how could you not ask these questions? Hanks played the role in subtle manner. No over acting here. The best acting was by the pirates...first time actors it seems. United 93 was far better as both an accurate film and entertaining by the same director.So, it was good, but not great.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Beautiful is the word,"Went into the movie hall, feeling a little sick and tired. I even thought of sleeping through the first 5 minutes into the movie after which the Somali pirates started to appear.Their desire to earn money, prove their people and boss what they are worth of and the scenes where muse, the captain of the pirates, confronts Tom hanks are killers. The pirates definitely put up a good fight, both in the movie and by performance with Tom hanks.Another mention to this movie, is the Music that helped build the momentum.I can keep talking about the movie, which simply means, I loved watching it. but, also I don't want to spoil the fun by letting out information on important scenes here.Watch the movie and I am positively confident you will love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Be it the emotional outbursts of the captain or the desperation in the eyes of those Pirates, this movie is so substantial that it will occupy your mind for the next few days. The best part of the movie is that it takes off so quickly that you hardly wait for the matter to start. But even an interesting or unfortunate incidents like these, if not presented well may loose all of its substance. That is why, apart from acting one has to appreciate the effort of Paul Greengrass for the wonderful direction of this movie.

A Phenomenal Film,"Ripped straight from the 2009 headlines, Captain Phillips tells the story of the Maersk Alabama cargo freighter that was taken over by Somali pirates, off the coast of Somalia. The titular captain, is the real-life captain of the Maersk Alabama, Richard Phillips, portrayed in this film by Tom Hanks. Often a movie star can ruin a film that is trying to be as real as this one, but in this particular case, it's that anomaly where the movie star portrayal actually makes the film.Captain Phillips is shot in a very gritty, realistic way. The lighting is often underexposed and the camera-work is shaky, making it seem like you're watching an observational documentary of the real-life event, with only occasional Hollywood flourishes of subtle soundtrack to amp up tension. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking this was a documentary, relaying the brilliance of director Paul Greengrass, making the material seem more real and not so Hollywoodified. As such, though, that is why the inclusion of a movie star, like Tom Hanks in the main role, was so important.As an audience, we already have a pre-existing relationship with Tom Hanks. By having an Everyman like Tom Hanks on screen, it allows us to understand who Richard Phillips is without having to really tell us much about his personality or how he got to this point in his life. It's one of those cases where a film takes place entirely in the present, with no flashbacks or long monologues to create character, so we needed a movie star, and Mr. Hanks knocks the role out of the park. He's not so good looking it's distracting, and he is made up like a guy you could see on the street or walking around your local grocery store. That's what makes him immediately believable. Then, there's the simple fact that this role could have easily been one that a lesser actor would have chewed up all the scenery to try and realize, and you start to really appreciate the subtlety of the performance more and more. While the supporting cast of relative unknowns and seasoned character actors are believable in their roles, this is Hanks's movie. Though, newcomer Barkhad Abdi does get a few choice scenes as the leader of the pirates, Muse, even if that's the most any of the pirates get to do other than shout and point their guns.While many of the characters in Captain Phillips lack much depth, in particular the pirates, the documentary-like approach to the material, and the sensational performance from Tom Hanks, make this film an intense cinematic experience. As well, with a film such as this, where it's more about the now and the horror of the situation at hand, any detours to beef up characters, would have felt forced and untrue to what the goal of this film was. This is a movie meant to give you the experience that Richard Phillips and his crew went through, and it excels in that arena. This is why Captain Phillips is a film that should be experienced by any and all looking to have a little bit of thought provoked. This is a serious endeavor that should be taken seriously.I give Captain Phillips a 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
More exciting than expected,"This is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and his ship MV Maersk Alabama captured by Somali pirates in 2009. Director Paul Greengrass has used his realism style like 'United 93' (2006) to good use. There is real excitement in this thriller even though we all know what the outcome will be.The movie starts off slowly. Tom Hanks getting ready to captain a cargo ship is about as exciting as Tom Hanks getting ready to captain a cargo ship. It lasts for about 15 minutes with some interruptions by the slightly more interesting Somali story.This is more compelling than one might expect. It doesn't try to whitewash the captain ignoring warnings. And the Somalis get as much screen time as anybody else. The leader is played by Barkhad Abdi who does a forceful job. He's more than a match for Tom Hanks. When he says ""I've come too far. I can't give up."", you can see his desperation. The movie is more than docudrama. It is a big time thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Edgy and Energetic Thriller,"Captain Philips, based on a true incident, narrates the story of the eponymous captain of the US merchant vessel Maersk Alabama that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. On a voyage from Salalah in Oman to Mombasa in Kenya, the ship finds itself inexplicably isolated off the Somali coast and thus becomes an easy picking for some amateurish pirates looking to make big ransom bucks. In a heart stopping sequence the four teenage pirates come in a flimsy skiff and board the gigantic cargo ship. But when US government responds by dispatching two warships, the youthful enthusiasm of the pirates turns to desperation as they realize that they are being out-gunned and outwitted. The demeanour of Captain Richard Philips (Tom Hanks) also morphs from bravado to fear as he is taken hostage in a claustrophobic lifeboat, that becomes the centre of much of the action in the latter half of the film. Our sympathies also tend to waver, which may not be the intention of the director though.Director Paul Greengrass extracts outstanding performances from Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips and débutant Barkhad Abdi as Muse, the leader of the pirates. The camera bobbing up and down on the ocean might induce seasickness in the weak of heart, but is primarily responsible for holding you on the edge of the seat for most of 134 minutes. In the final analysis, it is the very human and humane performances of both Hanks and Abdi that prevents the film from degenerating into the tired and familiar heroic American formula. Captain Phillips shies away from delving into the uncomfortable questions that could have transformed it into a greater film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"As thrilling as his Bourne movies but more significant and poignant in its portrayal of everyday heroism, Paul Greengrass delivers one of the most compelling films of the year","Even before he checked into the second and third instalment of 'The Bourne Trilogy', British filmmaker Paul Greengrass had already proved himself the master of cinema verite with his dramatization of the events of September 11 on board the ill-fated 'United 93'. And in 'Captain Philips', based on the remarkable true story of four Somali pirates who hijacked the American freighter Maersk Alabama and held its captain on board a lifeboat for five days, Greengrass repeats that same feat by taking a story for which the outcome is already known and turning it into a gripping, harrowing, and deeply emotional thriller.In adapting the ship's captain Rich Philips' own memoir of his ordeal, Greengrass and his screenwriter Billy Ray respectfully retain their titular character's perspective of the situation; but beyond that - and also what makes it even more compelling - is how their movie goes beyond his amazing display of everyday heroism to explore the poverty, desperation and cynicism that drove four Somali fishermen to become high sea pirates.And so the opening offers not just one but two perspectives - the first sees the middle-aged Philips packing in his Vermont home and driving to the airport with his wife (Catherine Keener); and the second, set on the beach in the pirate city of Eyl, Somalia, has leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) recruiting his crew for their next mission which would be Philips' cargo ship. Greengrass demonstrates his commitment to tell both sides of the story throughout the entire movie, refusing at any one point to demonise Philips' captors; instead, he depicts them as ordinary men driven by political and economic circumstances to end up at odds with Philips.There has always been a kineticism to Greengrass' storytelling, and this is no different. With assured economy, Greengrass brings his audience right into the heart of the crisis, as Philips is quickly confronted with the threat of two rapidly approaching skiffs bearing hostiles. What follows unfolds with immediacy and urgency, with Philips forced to adopt evasive manoeuvres in order to thwart Muse and his crew's attempts to board his ship but eventually being forced to do what is necessary to preserve as many of his crew's lives as possible. It's hardly any secret that Philips will end up on a suffocating lifeboat as their hostage, but you have to hand it to Greengrass for staging the action with such fluency and white-knuckle thrill that you'll still be caught by surprise by that turn of events.Collaborating once again with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, Greengrass hews to a familiar visual style that combines hand-held photography, quick edits and a propulsive soundtrack. Unlike lesser filmmakers which botch the use of shaky-cam, Greengrass' previous experience in shooting documentary features has honed his ability to shoot long unbroken sequences on handhelds, and that trademark style here works wonders in capturing the verisimilitude of the characters' predicaments. From the open sea to the interior of the cargo ship and finally to the claustrophobic confines of the lifeboat, Greengrass' shooting technique pulls you deeper and closer to Philips' life-and-death circumstance.But this is as much a Greengrass movie as it is one of Tom Hanks. The Academy Award winner of such classics like 'Forrest Gump' and 'Apollo 13' has seen his career languishing in recent years, but as the seaman thrust into an impossible situation, Hanks registers one of his career- best performances. Putting his Everyman persona to excellent use, Hanks invites you to identify with and believe in his extraordinary struggle of courage and mettle. It's a masterful performance, one full of nuances that evolves ever so subtly as his character is forced to react with the changing circumstances and hits a peak when finally he is called upon to re-enact the captain's succumbing to post-traumatic stress. Hanks is on excellent form here, portraying Philips' fear, bravery, and anxiety in a perfectly calibrated minimalist act.Much has also been said of Mogadishu émigré Barkhad Abdi's spellbinding debut, and it is indeed extraordinary. Despite possessing zero acting experience, Abdi proves a perfect foil for Hanks, especially as Greengrass turns his focus in the latter half of the movie on the edgy relationship between Philips and Muse. Ray's sharply written screenplay slowly but surely allows both characters - and us - to realise that they are mere pawns in a larger geopolitical context not within their control, and while Abdi is never less than forceful in his display of skinny bravado, Hanks complements that with his earnestness and empathy - a scene towards the end where he sits in despair recognising the inevitable fate awaiting his captors after failing to convince them to surrender is simply humbling to watch.Yes, there's no doubt Philips is a heroic figure, and Greengrass diminishes none of his amazing courage even as he adds to that portrayal the humanity of Philips' captors. It is a richly textured story, told as a blow-by-blow procedural of how Philips ended up in that calamity, how he managed to save his entire crew under extreme duress and how eventually after five days he emerged against all odds with his life intact. That Greengrass can direct a taut and captivating thriller is something we already know from the 'Bourne' films, but 'Philips' easily qualifies as one of his best, because it possesses an emotional intensity that goes to the heart of the human spirit, a pure and elemental struggle against adversity for survival. Together, Greengrass and his excellent leading man Hanks make you feel up close and personally engaged through and through with Philips through his ordeal, and it is an experience you won't quite soon forget.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Excellent, Engaging and Entertaining","This is based upon a true story.Commercial shipping seaman, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) takes his ship, the Maersk Alabama, into the Somali Basin in the Pacific Ocean and wants to have the crew perform security drills in case Somali Pirates come around. Later the Maersk is boarded by the Somali Pirates and it's up to Captain Phillips to protect his crew and the cargo.These days we see too many true stories, or stories inspired by true events made into movies and the key to an eventual good movie may be to wait things out until something happens. How much of these true or inspired by actual events movies are actually true we have no way of knowing. If we are entertained, we really don't care, do we? Well, the purists do, I suppose. But, this true story was reported via TV news, newspapers and magazines, worldwide and a book written, too, by Captain Phillips (A Captain's Duty), so we have some idea that most of what we see actually was true.Whether most of what we see in here is true or not, this is an excellent, engaging and entertaining movie. The photography, dialogues, editing and acting performances were unbelievably good. This movie lived up to all the hype Hollywood put out.Many reports of this incident said that Captain Phillips wanted to do security drills in case the Somali pirates showed up, but what we see in the beginning of this movie is that Captain Phillips was in the process of having those drills performed, BUT just a couple minutes into getting those drills ready, the Somali pirates show up. Okay, so maybe most of those drills were cut. We were waiting for the Somali pirates anyway.You may ask why the Maersk crew didn't have guns to ward off the pirates. This wasn't addressed except for one conversation within the crew that some complained they didn't sign up to be a mercenaries. Still the owners of the Maersk knew the possible dangers. I thought some statement at the end of the movie would address this concern. Didn't happen.One thing I didn't understand. Captain Phillips, at one point, gets away from the Pirates and goes into the water and didn't swim toward the Navy Destroyer and the pirates get him back. Did I miss something? You tell me. Or was this something that really didn't happen and poetic license ruled. Huh?Yes, it's a good story, well performed by all, but it's the photography that really captures you. It is outstanding. Combine all that with the Editing and you have something really special.The most exciting part of this is when the Somali Pirates take Captain Phillips hostage in the lifeboat and then it is here that we see the U.S. Navy and the Navy Seals come into play. You will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. Again, I cannot credit the photography too much. The photography and the Editing made this movie into something more than what we expected.The movie is up for Best Picture and Tom Hanks is up for Best Actor and some of that may happen.

The Somalian characters are fairly standard stereotypes - the brains, the hot-head- head, the youth etc - and their amateur acting status gives these an extra ring of authenticity.BUTThis is a Tom Hanks movie, and he delivers the finest performance of his illustrious career.

Fighting Irish,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Paul Greengrass seems to thrive on finding the line for unbearable tension and hectic, claustrophobic action. He gained fame for helming The Bourne Supremacy and The Borne Ultimatum, but this one has more in common with his excellent United 93. Somehow he keeps us gripping the armrests despite knowing full well how the story ends. That is a talented filmmaker.What adds to the stressed-filled fun here is that the world's greatest everyman, Tom Hanks, meets his match with fire-eyed Somalian pirate Muse, played by first time actor Barkhad Abdi. The scenes pitting these two against each other are fascinating studies and the perfect example of vastly different worlds colliding. Hanks plays Captain Phillips, who is charged with guiding the cargo ship Maersk Alabama through the pirate filled waters. Phillips is not the warmest of guys, but seems to be a competent captain with respect from the crew.Most of us remember watching on TV in 2009 as the 5 day sequence ended thanks to yet another perfectly executed Navy SEALs rescue mission. Greengrass does a terrific job of reenacting this moment. The other two moments that are sure to leave an impression both involve Mr. Hanks. The initial scene on the bridge as the pirates assume control of the ship ... when Muse tells Phillips that he is now the captain, we see a flash of surrender in Phillips' face. A stunning scene for both Hanks and Abdi (and congrats to Abdi for going toe to toe with the acting legend). The other scene worthy of discussion occurs after the rescue as Captain Phillips is escorted to sick bay to be checked out. His ""in shock"" actions are startling and very brave for an actor. Some may argue that Hanks took it too far, but I would encourage you to put yourself in that lifeboat and determine just how courageous you would be. Abdi also has a scene where he first discovers this is an American ship. He reacts as if he has won the lottery.Some scandal surrounds this story as there is a lawsuit against Maersk and Phillips brought by members of the crew. The contention being that Phillips knowingly steered the ship too close to the pirate waters in order to save time and money. Phillips went on to write a best selling book recounting the ordeal and he also returned to his job as ship captain. Hanks was the perfect choice to play Phillips as the story is more about a regular guy being thrust into an extraordinary situation. Phillips is no superhero ... he doesn't disarm four pirates. Instead, he uses guts and a will to live ... things we all hope we would exhibit should we ever find ourselves in such an awful situation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Movie But Queasy Cam Alert,"Let me start off by saying that Captain Phillips is a great movie. My husband and I thought the acting was incredible and the story well written. We gave it 9 out of 10 stars. What needs to be posted online and at the movie theater is that this movie uses shaky camera techniques which can make you nauseated if you are prone to this. I got a severe headache and nauseated to the point of dry heaves due to the jerky camera technique. This is called shaky cam or queasy cam. About a third of people who see a shaky cam movie will feel nauseated. That said, I think this movie will be a heavy contender in the Oscar race. Tom Hanks will probably be nominated for Best Actor and Barkhad Abdi for Best Supporting Actor. I think the other main characters, Barkhad Abdirahman who played Bilal, Faysal Ahmed who played Najee, and Mahat M.

A Stunning Movie,"The film is about the hijack of a ship named ""Maersk Alabama"" headed by Captain Richard Phillips. The film starts at a slow pace.The role of Captain Phillips portrayed by Tom Hanks who's one of the best actors in Hollywood, is depicted very well. The fear of the Somalian Pirates travels around the crew members in a gradual manner but one can see the tension steadily rising with the Captain Phillips who orders a security drill just in case. Two skiffs of pirates start out towards the ship but one heads back believing the false alarm raised by the Captain. The other skiff with 4 pirates advances.Once the pirates come on board after a little struggle, Captain does everything to keep the crew members out of sight leaving out himself and couple of other guys to the pirates.The fragile bond between the Pirate Lead ""Muse"" and Hanks starts there which would go long way in the film. This is where the film increases its pace and moves on.Tom Hanks would nail any character and that's well known to everyone but the role of Pirate Lead played by Barkhad Abdi is so intriguing and natural. The role fits him very well and also made him get nominated for the Oscars,BAFTA,Golden Globe under the category of 'Best Supporting Actor'. Hanks has done a great job in bringing out the fear and tension that surrounds him in each and every situation of confrontation. The aftermath of the hostage situation is where Hanks gets to prove his real talent of acting.The screenplay could have been better and there were situations that needed sharp rise. The climax might have been a bit short but nonetheless, it maintained the grip. The reaction of the ship's crew once the Captain is taken off could have been enhanced. The bridge between the first half and second half should have been better cause one tends to forget the fact that the Pirates came for the ship and took the Captain as an accident implying the fact that it focuses more on the hostage situations in the 'Life Boat' involving Hanks and the pirates.Overall verdict : Captain Phillips is DEFINITELY worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Back to film school with you, Greengrass","I understand it may be his ""thing"" as a director to film every single shot in a hand-held fashion but it makes Captain Phillips an incredibly unpleasant and frustrating thing to watch.There is simply no excuse not to use a tripod, none at all. It is pathetic how this pointless and infantile fad spreads to other films too.Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. There are far more sensible things you could be seeing.Sorry Greengrass, but it seems you've still got a lot to learn about the fundamentals of filmmaking, the use of a tripod being your biggest oversight.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Thriller, Adventure, and Action all into one","Great movie based off of a true event. Yes, the real captain was not as heroic as the movie, but Tom Hanks does a terrific portrayal possibly (Oscar nominated).

I highly encourage people to see this movie. Tom Hanks never disappoints and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie was nominated for other Oscars like best sound and cinematography. Regardless of awards the movie has a lot of ups and downs and accurately portrays the feelings of fear and even courage among this attack.

Captain Phillips was a good depiction of a recent real-life event that didn't take sides,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This is the one in which Tom Hanks portrays Captain Rich Phillips, who was kidnapped by Somali pirates in 2009. The narrative was quite absorbing and while my friend did clap a few times when some rescues of the main character was attempted, he did not feel the need to boo the pirates as if they were irredeemable bad guys. Neither did the rest of the audience so on that note, the film did a good job in presenting the areas of gray in the characterizations. I, myself, was simply intent in paying attention to how the whole thing was presented and managed to feel quite relieved when the end came though I wasn't too emotional when that happened though I did feel some, no doubt about that. Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Captain Phillips.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Much more than a drama. Viscerally and emotionally engaging --- and never lets go.,"In the trailer, Captain Phillips comes across as a drama. That's what I was expecting, and it is certainly that. And Tom Hanks, in the lead, does what he so often does. You will totally forget that he is Tom Hanks. Surprisingly (to me, at least), Captain Phillips is also loaded with action and suspense. Once it gears up, it runs nonstop to the end and never lets up. Add to that one of the best recent soundtracks I've come across (you cannot appreciate this film without theatre surround --- it takes place on the open sea, and it's NOT a small screen movie). Finally, Captain Phillips makes an honest effort to tell all sides of the story. We understand exactly why the pirates do what they do, and their story is told as well as that of anyone else. This is a really, really good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Tom Hanks is Gold,"Man, this is an eye opener on dangers of Somali pirates attacks that we only hear on the news.

A bit too much focused on one man and lopsided place of action,"Tom Hanks apparently likes to star in movies where he saves the world/other/himself - apart or en suite - and he does it always well, irrespective of the script's quality. The movie in question has a solid basis in the form of biographical book, but the narrow venue and 2 hours 10 minutes combined make several scenes slow and dull to follow. And if you know the story behind, including how the hostage situation ended, there are now twists and you have to follow the events mostly taking place in small and half-dark premises - not so interesting if the scenes are long or recurring. However, dramatics in still in place, events seem realistic, and the conglomerate Maersk obtained free publicity (or was in the list of funders?).As for performances, Barkhad Abdi as Abduwali Muse, pirate leader is also worth mentioning (well, in the beginning, I had difficulties to discern the Somali actors, but soon Abdi stack out). But the other characters-performances were uninviting to me, partially due to brief appearance on screen.The movie is definitely worth watching if you like action taking places in a limited space of vehicle. Otherwise, you may experience decline in attention or would like to use fast forward function.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The most thrilling biopic of all time!,"Captain Phillips is a true story about Captain Richard Phillips(Tom Hanks), whose ship, the Maersk Alabama, gets hijacked by a group of Somalian pirates consisting of Muse(Barkhad Abdi), Bilal(Barkhad Abdiraman), Najee(Faysal Ahmed) & Elmi(Mahat M. Ali). Now, it is up to Captain Phillips & his crew consisting of co-captain, Shane Murphy(Michael Chernus), Mike Perry(David Warshofsky) & the others to rescue themselves & stop the pirates from stealing the goods & money from the ship, at any cost.This movie had me on the edge of my seat, almost all the time. The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie may feel a little dragging however, the movie gets extremely engaging soon enough. What's even more interesting about this film is that, it's based on a true story. It sends shivers down my spine thinking, that Richard Phillips actually went through what he went through in the film. Almost the entire film takes place on water. That doesn't mean that we should compare it to Life of Pi(2012) or Titanic(1997). This movie has a completely different genre & there is no need for unnecessary comparisons even though, Titanic is based on a true story as well. The action is subtle & not too gory or graphic. Your heart actually goes out to the crew of the Maersk Alabama, because they go through such a horrifying experience. The performances, especially by the newcomers is what makes the film. Tom Hanks gives a solid performance as Captain Richard Phillips. Barkhad Abdi is mind blowing as the main antagonist, Muse. Barkhad Abdiraman is great as Bilal. Faysal Ahmed is impressive as Najee. Mahat Ali is spectacular as Elmi. Micheal Chernus is effective as Shane Murphy. Catherine Keener is fantastic as Andrea Phillips. David Warshofsky is adequate as Mike Perry. The supporting actors are good too. Captain Phillips is worth a watch. If you're a fan of Tom Hanks then, it's a must watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Highly recommended thriller,"Pirates named ""Blackbeard"", big men with beards and cutlasses cutting a swath as they board galleons, stealing gold doubloons and anything else shiny to hand.Long gone, consigned to the history books? Change the protagonist to a thin desperate Somalian man named ""Muse"", with a motley crew of young men in high speed skiffs, armed with AK-47's and a penchant for hostage treasure and we are bang up to date.Instead of three masted treasure laden galleons, the rather more prosaic merchant cargo ship is the target, if the vessel is American flagged, all the better for the ransom demand.Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is an ordinary man, attempting to make ends meet at home and worrying how his kids will find their way in the world. His day job is commanding the American flagged MV Maersk Alabama. Effectively a delivery truck on the high sea's, moving goods from here to there.In this case, that journey traverses arguably the most dangerous sea in the world, not weather related but with the inherent risk of boarding by pirates operating out of Somalia, ""run"" by lawless warlords.Captain Phillips checks the ship, kicks the tyres and sets off, safe in the knowledge that the risks are low and the maritime emergency team is ready to protect and assist if required. The crew are less enthusiastic, he calmly reminds them they signed up for the trip, if they want out, he can sign papers when they arrive at Mombasa.Captain Phillips is a decent man, looks after his crew, does not want trouble and tries to always act in a professional manner. Once Pirates are encountered he takes initial steps that may be enough to repel the boarders.Once the later scenes unfold, ""Muse"" (Barkhad Abdi) proclaims ""I'm the captain now"". Using the moniker of ""Irish"" to describe the demoted captain, they search for the ships crew who have been well drilled for just such an eventuality.The film plays out as a cat and mouse game with high stakes, with Phillips presented with situations he cannot rationalise in the usual way. He wants to help, negotiate and find a way that ""Muse's"" repeated mantra ""everything will be OK"", will actually come to pass.When offered the safe contents of $30,000 the new captain declares, ""Do I look like a beggar?"" A decent man is out of his depth in such circumstances and Director Greengrass puts his leading man through the ringer, taking his nail bitten audience along for the ride. Both protagonists are completely believable, there is sympathy on both sides with a screenplay that does not pander to either predicament or attempt to preach in anyway.Phillips is just doing his job, as are the pirates in their own way, each with their own bosses and performance expectations. Nobody is likely to win and real world sentiments are perfectly judged by both director and screenwriter.As always, Hanks anchors the film with a superb every-man performance but is comfortably matched by the first time performer Abdi, who in physical appearance and acting ability, personifies who you might expect in such a situation.The later scenes are intense, with closing situations that stretch naturalistic acting ability to the limit. There is nothing to dislike here if the subject matter interests you and it should, as here is a metaphor for the wider world and the harsh new realities we all face.It is clear from early on, that ""everything will really not be all OK""SummaryHighly recommended thriller, based on the true story of the first American cargo ship taken by pirates in two hundred years.Intense, completely believable and with pitch perfect performances from all involved. Coupled with an intelligent director and screenplay, this represents one of the best films of 2013.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Life in a nutshell,"There are some who say that the most important part of a film is its ending. Examples of films which have been all but destroyed by the way they end are legion. Much rarer are the cases of films that really come into their own at the very end. Luckily, Captain Phillips, based on the much publicized case of the 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship off the Somalian coast, is part of the latter, considerably smaller group. After his rescue, Phillips (Tom Hanks in his strongest performance in years) is taken in by highly efficient and well-trained Navy personnel who perform routine checks, ask routine questions, follow routine protocol. Phillips, however, who we have just watched for two hours working like a well-oiled survival machine, a master at adapting to any change of situation, a great tactician and relentless fighter, has turned into a zombie-like shell: words fail him, simple movements and motions become impossibly complicated. The puzzled bewilderment, the gaping hole the instinct to survive has left, contrast drastically with the self-congratulatory air of everyone else to who this has just been a successful operation. To Phillips, this is his life.And so the ever-moving hand-held camera, efficiently industrious, full of unchecked energy clashes with the image of a soul that has come to a brutal halt, a personal world that has stopped turning, a heart that has skipped a beat. And all of a sudden, the same look that has just been supportive and empathic is now voyeuristic, indecent, intrusive. For the well-made thriller has revealed something existential, something essential to human nature. A primal fear and helplessness that we are so good at covering up. This ending, this emptying face will remain when everything else about this film has disappeared. And there is quite a lot to this. For the previous two hours Captain Phillips has been a gripping thriller, a claustrophobic clash of human desires and fears and needs whose space grows ever tighter: from two separate locations to a ship, a bridge, a cellar-like engine room to a tiny closed lifeboat that looks grotesquely pathetic compared to the war machinery the Navy has brought.Yet inside, all of human drama takes place: there's power and powerlessness, brutality and fear, despair and hope, the first world and the third, all enclosed in literally, a nutshell. And pretty evenly distributed among the hijackers and the victims, the guilty and the innocent. There is no black or white, only the gray, the pale, ghost- like hue of the indifferent sea and sky, a vast unthinking universe in which life is merely an afterthought. They have to deal with each other: the confident, experience, smart Phillips and the aggressive, skinny, helpless Muse (Barkhad Abdi in a haunting, memorable performance). Two lost souls whose final bewilderment in the face of deadly efficiency reveals them as inhabitants of the same planet without unduly shifting guilt. Yes, the highjacker turned kidnapper is guilty, yes he is a criminal deserving of punishment, but first and foremost, he is human, just like his prisoner. There are no monsters in this battle of wills in which both are pawns as well as actors, swept around by the tides while taking responsibility and making decisions.The camera is always close, hardly ever still, reflecting the hectic twists and turns of this duel, this frantic battle to survive. Captain Phillips thrives on Paul Greengrass' excellent direction, his impeccable timing, the documentary-like camera work, the hypnotic rhythm and gripping editing, the clear, pale, matter-of-factly imagery. Yes, it is a thriller and a highly efficient one. But it is one that moves from outward suspense to inner drama, just as the space narrows the inner battles come to the forefront. No matter if captain or crew or kidnappers: in the end, they all want to survive, their own worst enemy is fear. Which is ultimately the film's chief protagonist: Captain Phillips is a film about fear, about what it does to people, no matter on what side of the processes that create the fear they appear to be. Its destructive force as well as its ability to bring out a strength hitherto unsuspected, have never been more visible, its angels and devils never clearer, the key role it plays in all of human existence, never been more obvious. And its power to be at its strongest when it seems to have been overcome. It may be paralyzing, shutting down all normal processes, putting existence on stand-by. Yet it will reboot, Phillips will go to sea again, Muse will find a way to survive, to continue. And so will we. Not less fearful, but, maybe, just a tiny little bit wiser.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
These waters run pretty deep.,"""It's gonna be alright, Irish.""That's what the leader of a frightening gang of Somali Pirates, Muse, keeps telling the Captain of the ship he's just hijacked, when in fact, it's his own need to keep hearing those optimistic words, again and again. He's a man, one of the many, who is doing things he does because he doesn't have any other way around it. There is no time to question morals for him, and yet he is still miles away from what you may call an amoral human-being. ""We are not going to hurt you. We are not Al-Qaeda."" , he keeps reminding.As these pirates have boarded the ship and captured Captain Phillips on gunpoint, one of them asks about the ship's nationality. ""It's an American ship."" , replies the Captain. One of the pirates shouts gleefully, ""America! Yes!"" There are such subtle snark and commentaries throughout the film which makes it much more than an average thriller. At a certain point in the film, as Captain Phillips and Muse are building an empathy for each other, it transcends into one of those Michael Mann-esque moments where there is no individual sense hero or villain, just two guys, on very opposite sides, finding much more in common between themselves than they might have thought earlier. ""We've all got bosses.""Tom Hanks could not have had better opportunity to show the subtlety of his performance than the arc of the titular character in this film. He embodies and introduces us to the character as a confident, alert and pragmatic guy, but as the things get more dreary, you can sense the breakdown and hopelessness on his face. I wonder about the sequence of shooting the final scene with Tom Hanks. It feels perfectly natural collections of emotions the character goes through after all the actions that went before. It also marks as one of the best moments in the actor's career.Paul Greengrass has developed a certain flavor of hand-held cameras in his films. I guess it's one of the things he has kept from his experience with Documentaries. It does help in creating a sense of realism in the film, but ultimately it was because of bravura performances and intensity of the screenplay which got me absorbed in the film than the Documentary aesthetic.The film's editing is jarring and urgent just like all of the director's films, but it needs a certain clarity and grace. The film's weak moments are those when we are broken from Captain's or Muse's perspectives. While I can understand the need of keeping the story in clarity about the rescue operation, it's cringe-worthy when these scenes are presented in stylization that reminded me of Bourne films. In a way, it takes the realism away. For some moments, anyway.What starts as a slam-bang action thriller about a hijacking situation turns subtly into the play of ambiguous duality and parallels with relevant political undertones. It asks the questions it should ask, but also never taking one side or turn preachy on audience. It's one of those films that take more depth in post-contemplation than during watching the film itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"One of the better ""based on true story"" films I've seen","This film is the true story of the 2009 hijacking of a US container ship named Maersk Alabama off the Horn of Africa. Tom Hanks plays captain Phillips who is taken hostage during the event. The American military comes to the aid of Phillips as the his hostage takers make a run for their home country of Somalia. The story is told from both sides and obviously takes over a Hollywood feel. What the crew and captain had to go through is beyond rational thought.

A Must-See!,"I just got home from watching this movie, and I'm still at awe.Although the trailer does give away most of the plot, I think that it didn't ruined it. The last scenes of the movie are simply breathtaking, and the most wonderful thing of it is the transparency of each character's emotions, and the mix that there is.And it is still in this last scene where you can actually see the timeless acting from Tom Hanks! His versatility to play out very distinct, but huge rolls is incredible. Whether it is from Andrew Becket to Forrest Gump, or Captain Miller.It is a fact that he does appear a lot on the screen, but that's just all about the relevance of the character... The movie is about the experience in first hand of the Captain, so no wonder that he's the one that ends up showing his face more often on the screen. If something like that would happen in real life, I would believe that that was how it went down.Besides being a great story, the problematic that it addresses is still recent, and well portrayed and ends up getting in touch with a reality that it is not that known to much of the audience.In the end, I would advise you to go watch it on the cinema if you can. Even if you're not, I would recommend you to watch wherever you can! It is smart, well-written, with an amazing acting (not only from Tom Hanks, but from the Somali Pirates as well) and a very recent and interesting theme.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

great movie,"I don't write many reviews, though I watch a lot of movies (working in the movie industry for the last 2 decades). I like to think I know a good movie when I see one. Sometimes I like to go to the back end of IMDb reviewers and read what the haters have to say. I will confess I am often amazed (and somewhat irritated)at what some people have to say about movies they don't like. They whinge and whine about the reasons why they don't like a movie, as if the film was made as a direct personal insult to them and them alone. So you didn't like Captain Phillips. Fair enough! But to claim that NOBODY should watch this movie because YOU didn't like it (you know who you are), in my humble opinion, is ridiculous and selfish. Out of 7 billion potential viewers globally, you are only 1. I like to watch each movie as if it is a stand alone feature. I try not to make comparisons to other movies of the actor/directors/genre etc have made, and then I ask myself a series of questions. Did I enjoy that? Did it evoke the appropriate emotional response? Would I watch it again? For Captain Philips the answer to all those questions (for me) is YES! YES! and absolutely YES!!! I thought Captain Philips to be a trilling true/story DRAMA. I personally have no issues with the shaky cam style of filming. For me it just adds to the realism. I thought the acting was great (kudos to the casting team), and FOR ME I found the tension throughout to build to a very satisfying conclusion, re Captain Phillips' eventual release. So in summary, I thoroughly enjoyed Captain Phillips and I would absolutely recommend it to other people. So to all you haters of Captain Phillips, or any other movies for that matter, just chill out! When did the point of ENTERTAINMENT become so personal. So you didn't like this movie. So be it. You have every right to express that opinion, however I feel it is unfair to try to influence other peoples choices with your staunch and negative opinions is just unfair. Even some of the stinker movies that I have watched (and there has been a few), I always try to pick out something good about it.

Once the US forces engage them, their only bargaining chip is the captain's life. The pirates have their AK-47's but they never seem managing enough to even consider pulling the trigger. The fact that the pirates speak English is a problem for the movie. A hostage taker is far less intimidating when you can communicate with him. Captain Phillips manages to seem very casual as he gives his captors a tour, and even offers them food from his kitchen.You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks as the virtuous 'good soldier' who represents American model citizenship wherever he goes.

Thrilling raw drama,"What's with Tom Hanks being stranded in the sea and giving a stellar performance for a character to root for? An edge of the seat thriller defying the conventional runtime with a very strong antagonist character having layers of depth that even the Dark Knight's Joker could have a run for his money. While majority of today's action thrillers rely on massive set pieces, special effects, explosions etc, it is good to see a fulfilling raw human drama between very original characters.Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is your average captain of a merchant ship MV Maersk Alabama with a thinking cap and practical attitude. Muse(Barkhad Abdi) is a volatile young Somalian pirate with a devil- may-care attitude and lots of enthusiasm to out perform his peers. When Muse's hunt for prey encounters MV Maersk Alabama, the crew throws everything they have at the pirates to keep them at bay. but Muse's determination and the ship's under preparedness to handle such a situation leads to the capture. What stays in between is Phillips composure, perfect study of the situation (though initially) and his practicality.Barkhad Abdi is not your typical antagonist with his petite appearance and a not so captivating voice. But his unpredictability and a misplaced courage and stubbornness makes him more than difficult to handle. Tom Hanks shows his masterclass throughout the movie saving his best for the climax. Now what comes to mind about Paul Greengrass? The man who popularized the frantic camera movements and exhaustive editing skills that we have seen from 'Bloody Sunday' to the spectacular 'Bourne Ultimatum'. But he did show some promise towards handling complex human emotions in 'United 93' that does spillover to this one too. What works for the movie is its simplicity and for good or bad, doesn't lose focus from the main subjects like dealing with their back story or the perspective of their family.

Pretty good horror picture,"Nice and scary. But I don't get why they didn't just blow them out of the water. The pirates had barely held together dinghies, they should've sunk them as soon as they saw them. That's why ships like this carry artillery.

One of the Better Films of the Year,"Directed by Paul-ShakyCam-Greengrass of the Bourne films fame, ""Captain Phillips"" is a straightforward tale of brave actions of the captain and the crew of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama when hijacked by desperate Somali pirates.The pace of the film is relentless and the run-time of over 2 hrs never seems long. The shaky cam is at an acceptable level and the cinematography is quite good overall. The efficiency of the US Navy SEALs is always impressive and is showcased as such here. Like with all Paul Greengrass films, the focus is more on the action and less on the backdrop or the characters. It is terse to a fault and perhaps less fulfilling in that sense, but Tom Hanks makes up for that with his acting chops as the titular character.Overall entertaining fare, and definitely one of the better films of the year. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Overall terrible,"Hanks Plays Richard Phillips, Captain of a cargo ship that's been taken hostage by a group of Somalian pirates. Right from the start the movie feels awkwardly amateurish in both the acting, writing and camera work. Hanks just looks lost, trying to find the set he was supposed to report to, but finds himself already there. The conversations between him and the crew borders on parody, not a single line sounds even remotely believable. The acting of the supporting cast was downright laughable. The utterly predictable story progression is repetitive and the terrible hand-held camera work in every scene nauseating and annoying. Greengrass should have let the tension of the moment do the work. In stead we get this overblown action movie approach that completely ruins what could have been a very decent film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Beyond Expectation,"I watched this movie without going through the cast in the movie (which is usually done before watching any movie.)All I knew was, this was something about Somali pirates hijacking a Ship. I was doubtful about depth of the story narration and the movie.When I saw Tom Hanks in first scene, I was convinced that there is something about the movie.The very opening scene depicted travel details and the Captain so well that I got impressed by the Direction.Paul Greengrass is an excellent director.Tom Hanks is one of the all-time-best-actor and he proved it again. Especially in the end scene he looks so natural yet intense.And Somali actors, especially Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman showed absolutely remarkable acting.Ever scene is packed with thrill.

Fantastic Film - Tom Hanks is Superb,"Having not read any of the back story to this film, I settled in to watch something that my fellow IMDb'ers had rated pretty highly, after watching this movie I am in agreement with them.Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actors, as a kid I must have watched BIG about 10 times and in his role as Captain Phillips he simply excels. The movie builds the tension gradually, Hanks enjoying a battle of wit with the pirates before the inevitable confrontation, the journey in between is tense, fraught with emotion and even my other half who is not a film fan found herself engrossed from beginning to end.This movie is a solid 7, but Hanks, with the latter scenes elevates this to an 8.

Prepare to have your emotions boarded - Captain Phillips is certainly worth seeing.,"""Captain Phillips"" works well as a dramatic piece rather than as any terrific character study or deep, involved piece of story-telling; it is a picture-perfect exercise in execution of suspense - nobody ever really feels safe and it is difficult, due to it being of no real fixed genre or possessive of a stone-wall story, to entirely tie down as to where it will all end up as you watch it unfold. As it roars towards its finale on the open seas of the Indian Ocean, all four of the feasible possibilities that I counted pertaining to who lives; who dies and what anybody gets away with are still open to happening.Paul Greengrass' film, based on the true events which befell poor Captain Richard Phillips of the container ship Maersk Alabama and his crew in 2009, may very well be entitled as such, and indeed sold as a film depicting the events which involved said man, but it is really about three captains: an ordinary captain of a container ship; a pirate captain and then later a Navy captain who commands a gunship. By the end, when Phillips has been forced onto the side-lines - relegated to a supporting act in his own supposed film - the battle has moved on from its beginnings and into the uncharted territories whereby the pirate goes up against the soldier who is himself forced into his own series of predicaments and moral cul-de-sacs pertaining to who potentially lives and who potentially dies.Tom Hanks is the eponymous Philips, an uncomplicated man whose life story to this point the film does not seem to think important. Aged around fifty, he and his wife live in an affluent neighbourhood in the wilderness of Vermont. They drive around, worrying about the world they live in, which is becoming a more desperate place to live and apparently changing too dramatically. Are they referring to the then-recent economic crash? The spread of terror in spite of a war on terror? We cannot tell. One thing they do admit to is a worry for their adult children, whose prospects in a swelling job market appear gloomy.Meanwhile, a million hypothetic miles away, a Somali terror cell rapidly concoct a gang of misfits to engage in some piracy on the open waves - their target is a freighter of some kind. The Somali strand moves very quickly; is causality driven - its golden brown tones are a stark contrast to the chilly blues of Vermont. Eventually, we witness our Phillips traverse to Oman, where he will commandeer a freighter ship and take it to port in Asia.Eventually, when both sides are out and on the waves off the coast of Africa, there is a coming together when Phillips' ship seems to drift away from the beaten ground of the shipping lanes and the pirates' crude radar systems reveal such a thing. One of them makes the observation that it has 'wondered away from the herd' and we realise they might just as well be back in their native land hunting some sort of animal. In a genuinely sharp piece of direction, Greengrass kept the actors portraying the crews of the container ship and the pirate boat away from one another so that their initial contact is the first time they all meet anyway... Whilst the pirates have the guns, they are clueless as to the layout of the boat, which of course the crew know inside out - this is a dynamic executed perfectly and entertainingly without being exploitative.The film allows for a basic degree of characterisation between the two crews, dialogue from the pirates outline where they are coming from and why they do what they do. They are quick to stress that they are not terrorist affiliated - most likely, they couldn't give a damn what America fund the Israelis to do to Palestine: it is strictly business, but does the film dodge tackling something a little more substantial because of this? At one other point, the film affords a member of either crew synergy through thematic when one of Phillips' points out that ""...we (I) didn't sign up to the Navy"" when it seems conflict with an armed group is inevitable, while a pirate who cuts himself on a trap made form broken glass points out he ""...didn't come along for this"" Both are getting more than they bargained for.Greengrass' approach to the material is to essentially begin the film as a heist picture, one wherein things do not all go according to plan for those attempting the heist; throughout the middle act, there are echoes of ""Die Hard"" as the victims of a very sudden, potentially violent, assault must use their wits to get out of it. Amusingly, this develops into a final act which seems to borrow heavily from ""Dog Day Afternoon"" for reasons I will not reveal. Not knowing a single thing about the events depicted in the film may have helped in it being as affecting as it was, but this is still a very well made drama with excellent attention to aesthetic and pacing. If you are unfamiliar with the true-story, or indeed the book ""A Captain's Duty"" which depicts the events of those fateful few days, you will no doubt enjoy ""Captain Phillips"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Intense, thrilling film","This is my first review here on IMDb and i will honestly say that I'm not that good in writing English.Director Paul Greengrass create again another thrilling film based on a true story.

Another First Rate Performance From Tom Hanks,"Once this gets going, it keeps you glued to your seat. ""Captain Phillips"" is based on the story of the Mearsk Alabama, which really was captured by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2009. As the title suggests, the movie (based actually on a book written afterward by Phillips) focuses on what happened to Phillips after he was taken hostage and held for ransom, which negotiations being conducted by the U.S. Navy.After a brief introduction, which serves primarily to introduce us to Phillips as a family man, most of the movie is set either on the Maersk Alabama, or in the lifeboat the pirates use to escape and in which they take Phillips. Perhaps it's merely because we know what's going to happen, but even as the scenes aboard the ship start out slowly and calmly, with Phillips merely taking command, there is a sense of tension. There are warnings of piracy activities in the region, and as the Maersk Alabama begins to track the pirates on radar, that tension builds, leading up to the takeover and hostage taking.The experiences of Phillips on the lifeboat are harrowing. Hanks does a superb job with the character - his most powerful scenes coming at the end, as he's released back into U.S. custody and gets taken to the warship's sick bay and begins to break down as he's examined by a doctor. Those scenes are rife with emotion. It's impossible not to be drawn into the character at that moment and to begin to wonder just what the experience would have been like. It really was a brilliant performance by Hanks, who built the character slowly but surely over the course of the movie, leading to that final scene.Some of the Maersk Alabama's crew members have challenged the accuracy of the film. Some have suggested that Phillips was not as much of a hero as the film suggests and that he was, in fact, to some extent to blame for what happened by not listening to warnings to stay 600 km off the coast of Somalia (the Maersk Alabama was only a little over 200 km off the Somali coast when this happened.) I can't vouch for the history, of course, except to note that it's obviously filmed from Phillips' perspective, being based on Phillips' book about the incident. As a movie though, this is in fact quite gripping, and it's one of Hanks finest performances. The movie even manages to take a fairly even-handed approach to the pirates, not portraying them as evil but rather more as desperate people living in a desperate part of the world.

Thrilling and Gripping,"Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy fame) has directed two films on important historic events, ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93."" ""Captain Phillips"" is also based on a real story (a kind of story which you would likely read in Reader's Digest under drama in real life section) where an American cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates and the captain is held hostage.The film on a whole captures the action sequences familiar from regular Hollywood movies and is overlong, which somewhat loses the impact of the film. Besides, the film somewhat lacks the novelty of 'United 93"" in filming the events or narrating the story and isn't very different from the regular movies. Despite the over length and the familiar premises of action, the film is thrilling, gripping, and exhausting. Tom Hanks as usual makes a remarkable performance through his wit trying to deal with the pirates and save his crew. In the climax, he just excels and makes you numb. I'm a little shaky about the film's or director's chances of getting an Oscar as story wise, the film is doesn't go beyond normal; but Tom Hanks surely is a deserving nominee for best actor this year. Had the film been trimmed a bit, the film would have been a very tight thriller of the year. On a whole, I liked the film and I'm sure you would find it entertaining.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Generally Well Paced High Ranked Movie - Minus a Few Stars,"From the beginning the movie kept my interest. You quickly determine Tom Hanks is a Merchant Marine Captain and his wife sadly drops him at the airport for yet another assignment in some far off land. They hug and kiss and perhaps a tear is shed. So far, a decent drama turn thriller unfolding.Even if you don't know the true story, you sense their will be trouble, fueled by the subtle foreboding provided, starting when the Captain boards ship and notes several security concerns, which then is confirmed when you see the Somali pirates haggling to get the job of hunting down one if the many freighters in the nearby trade lanes.From that point anticipation and dread set in keeping the viewer biting a nail or a slight squirm in the seat. The crew doesn't know yet but you know what's likely coming. When they finally realize they are being followed, the dread and tension increase until finally they realize these guys are in fact pirates and an orderly panic sets in.There is great disappointment when it becomes apparent that not one single weapon is on board. A few rifles or hand guns would have made the difference in this case. This is not a movie fault if this follows the true story. Also not sure why they separated from the mainstream freighter traffic as pointed out, making for an ideal target.So the anticipation and pace of the movie keeps the viewers heart rate elevated. The pursuit, capture and occupation keep the pace. The reticent reaction by the Maritime Traffic Monitoring upon the report is disturbing and you hope this is not a repeat of Benghazi. But, alas, the Navy does show up, eventually. Three or perhaps two and a half cheers here for timing. Loud applause for Naval professionalism! Some great scenes and action here.Without giving away much more of the movie plot, the remaining action and resolution of the conflict is protracted to the point of a yawn or a few winks and a nod, despite the loud, riveting score. The final moment of resolution was exciting if brief in relation to this long extended sequence. Lose at least one star here, maybe two (total out if 10)A quick point here. They should have had the wife on the phone with the Captain at least once to amplify the tension, dread and potential loss of loved one. She disappeared after the airport drop. A hint in an email but no real contact. Subtract a half star here.And to sour things a bit at the end lets just say here that the Captain (Hanks) who had been steadfastly level headed, brave, even guardedly cool while naturally scared, goes through what I consider to be a melodramatic meltdown of character that I didn't find consistent, even given the situation. I felt it was gratuitous opportunity to demonstrate Mr. Hanks acting latitude, with all due respect for this great actor. My kids didn't agree here. They thought he was in character. You decide. I take another half star here.Often Mr Hanks films have a political statement. If it were here it was subtle. He had some pity for the pirates lot and plight, in dialog with the young boy and within the ""captain to captain"" relationship with the better of the two lead bad guys. ""Isnt there something else you could be doing"" asks Hanks. ""Maybe for you, Maybe in America, but not here,"" the pirate laments. Hank's character does point out to his nemeses that they could have gotten away scott-free earlier with some modest booty, but Hanks and his antithesis agreed that we all have ""bosses"" with expectations and are not free to make the call.Bottom line. Pretty good true dramatic thriller, devoid of gratuitous sex, violence, and computer animations (sorry Grand Theft Auto fans), with good pace and tension. Subtle political undertone but minimal. Lose a a few stars for protracted resolution, melodramatic meltdown and no family communication. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Desperately in need of a tripod,"1) Redefines the word ""shaky cam"" and I'm not even talking about action scenes. I'm talking about the whole film, even those scenes filmed on land. It seems that all the money went to pay Hanks and they didn't have enough left for a tripod. After the first 4 minutes of this film I needed a brown bag.2) Speaking of brown bag, the opening scene is so stilted and forced, I knew that the rating of this film had to be skewed. And Tom Hanks' accent - what on earth was it? A New England or Boston accent? The word ""suck"" does not even do the atrocious attempt justice. Hanks does a good job doing Hanks - that's it. He's not a great actor - just great at his one dimension playing himself.3) The story is based on a true story.... loosely. What makes me positively ill is that this hero tripe is passed off as if it was the real thing, which it isn't and wasn't. But Hollywood needs to have a hero who is greater than life, passing it off as if it was true and that ""based on a true story"" means it's basically the truth but a summary of what actually happened.So if you value your time and keeping your food down, this movie may not be for you. It's really not very good and extremely amateurish. But with Hollywood tossing out dreck every month and redoing every prior film, musical, superhero and idea they can get their hands on, even this tripe looks good to the sad masses.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

No Need for Popcorn! Captain Phillips = Nail Biting Thriller!,"One word, INTENSE! If ever there were a lesson on keeping an audience captivated by taking them through a roller-coaster of emotions look no further than Paul Greengrass's latest thriller, ""Captain Philips"". Inspired by true events of March 2009, when Richard Philips, the Captain of a cargo ship was taken hostage by Somali pirates, this film has everything: drama, suspense, heroics In truly nail-biting fashion, Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Philips and executes these emotions flawlessly.So convincing is his performance that you would be forgiven for almost believing that you were on the journey with him, sharing his pain, courage and at times total anguish. Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse - the leader of the pirates - is riveting, going toe-to-toe with Hank in terms of wit, and carrying out the role of 'the villain' to perfection but not in your stereotypical way as he evokes an element of empathy amongst viewers.As the story unfolds, it keeps you wondering and guessing right until the very end. Underlying questions keep you on the edge of your seat: what will happen to Captain Philips? Will Muse's unpredictable nature take a turn for the worse? How much longer can they survive?Nowadays, it's all too easy to leverage special effects with an A-list cast, throwing in some loud bangs and call it a thriller. I'm a firm believer that the point of Cinema is to communicate the story whilst keeping the audience captivated. 'Captain Philips' not only achieves this with ease but delivers a story rich in dialog and accurately reflecting the events of March 2009 through the lives of relate-able characters. Somali pirates' exploits are well documented in our news, however this story is palpable to such an extent that it brings you as close to the real life event as possible whilst avoiding all the associated dangers.The feeling of fear setting in as pirates approach the ship, the anguish felt as Captain Philips is taken hostage, the unpredictable violence of Muse, may all be cinematic: however, as you watch the story unravel these feelings will be anything but cinematic. The words ""must watch"" are overused in our industry but if you are after an intense ride, with a wave of emotions and character depth in abundance, 'Captain Philips' is definitely a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Captain Phillips,"Swashbuckling pirates, the kind with gold earrings, long hair and parrots, possessed of some of the greatest names in history—names like Blackbeard, Calico Jack, and Black Bart—are a staple of moviedom. Savage murderers and thieves though they were, what with cutting off people's parts and all, we love to watch them and like to think of them as living by some code of pirate honor. After all, it is the movies.""Captain Phillips"" the story of a real life hijacking by Somali pirates, this time toting AK-47's rather than sabers and without the flashy nicknames, of a cargo ship plying the waters off East Africa. Captain Richard Phillips, (Tom Hanks) is a competent and conscientious captain who knows his ship well and runs it tight. Hanks is, as always, Hanks. He's just not a transformative actor. Competent and usually engaging, not hard to watch, but never impressive—more of a star than an actor. But here Hanks should be given some leeway—his character just isn't very interesting and some of the dialogue is notably awkward. (Scriptwriting credit goes to relative newcomer Billy Ray, whose only other credit is ""Hunger Games."" Draw from that what you will.) One of the more blatant instances of this comes in one of the establishing scenes, in which Phillips and his wife are driving to the airport, where he will board a plane to Oman to pick up his ship. It's a transparent effort to write that particular type of random, streaming, conversation between a husband and wife—and it doesn't work. That type of casual dialogue, the most common in real life and yet the hardest to write, almost never (outside the hands of Robert Altman) works—and Billy Ray ain't no Robert Altman. However, awkward as the dialogue is, we do get some sense of Captain Phillips. He's hard working, loves his wife, is concerned about his kids finding jobs after college And once the action starts it becomes apparent that he is a resilient and resourceful man, remaining resolute in the face of a very real threat. And that's about it. We never see anything of the interior of the man. What makes him who he is. What are his weaknesses? His foibles? What is his internal conflict? It's not there.The real star of ""Captain Phillips"" is the camera of director Paul Greengrass. Best known for The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, this is just the type of production that Greengrass does best. Most of the action takes place in confined spaces with lots of steel ladders, stairwells and places to fall from—things that could give you anything from a nasty bump on the head to a broken femur. He teams up again with editor Christopher Rouse and, like the Bourne movies, the action is non-stop and the pacing is spot-on. The camera is frenetic and close, the editing is fast and sharp, and the tension never wanes.The problem is that it's not much of a story, rather; it's a sequence of events. Expertly filmed and edited events, yes, but not much more than that. It is, essentially, a good guy/bad guy movie, with Phillips squaring off against the leader of the pirate band. Like all movies of the type, the two principles butt heads and match wits, first one on top and then the other, until one of them prevails. But, although the captain and the pirate leader are the primary characters, at least some of the supporting cast needs to be developed and brought to the forefront, for at least a moment or two, in order for any movie to work. ""Captain Phillips fails miserably in this department. Nary a one of the crew stands out from the rest. They all perform admirably. There are no backsliders or hysterical cowards. Nobody gets angry. There is no conflict about course of action. Nobody is even a diabetic whose insulin has been made unavailable, for crying out loud. They are absolutely interchangeable. Same goes for the Navy Seals, the other three pirates, the naval officers—not a single memorable character among them.The standout here is Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the pirate gang, a sinister, erratic and sleep deprived Somali named Musé. He is, by far, the most interesting character in the film. Ordered to do what he does by the local warlord, Musé is not a pirate by choice. One of the best scenes in the film is a brief conversation between him and the Captain in which Musé spits out that if there were still fish in the ocean and Somalia was still what it was generations ago, he would be a fisherman in a fishing village, which his home used to be. Musé was not born a pirate.He was made into one, and he knows it and he laments it. Captain Phillips suggests at one point that Musé release him and take the thirty thousand dollars in cash that had been in the ship's safe. Musé replies that he has gone too far to turn back—an observation that could be applied to his home as well as himself. Has Somalia been broken too badly to be repaired, to ever return to what it once was? Suddenly, this chillingly dangerous man shifts from villain to victim. However, other than that subtle comment by Musé, the script sticks to the action, never waxing blatantly allegorical and, in this pivotal scene, Abdi plays Musé as a resigned and very young man faced with a life without prospect, deftly avoiding preachiness or martyrdom—a refreshing change from so much of what is out there. He is not a swashbuckling and proud pirate captain. He is a broken man with not so much as a parrot on his shoulder.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Incredible acting makes it feel so real,In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It's a movie that can be classified as an action/thriller without requiring huge fight scenes or special effects to captivate you. The acting by Tom hanks is awesome as he almost always is and he is very convincing as his character progresses through many emotions and feelings as he starts out as a confident captain but by the end of the movie he is traumatized and scared and Tom hanks displays it beautifully. The authentic simialian actors were very impressive too for not having much acting experience they were able to portray charectors anywhere from insane men focused on money to a young boy caught up in a life of crime he has no hope to escape. It is beautifully shot and directed on an accurate set and the use of a shaky cam for many shots really makes you few like you are in the movie on the ship and especially the lifeboat.

"Listen up, we have been boarded by armed pirates. If they find you, remember, you know this ship, they don't. Stick together and we'll be alright. Good luck.","The film from Paul Greengrass, who is known for Bourne Series & Green Zone, is about the real life incident where Richard Philips , captain of a merchant mariner, was kept hostage by a bunch of Somalian pirates. Now the film is all about the survival drama which is portrayed in a realistic manner that suits to Paul's style in films like Green Zone.The positive side of the film is that rarely we see films which belongs to the category of thrillers that doesn't possess a single cinematic moment. Now this can be seen as a negative by the usual action-thriller fans expecting loads of biffs n bams. Even-though the film carries lesser drama of strategy behind the walls like ""Zero Dark Thirty"", it does convey similar feel, especially the navy operations implied to rescue. From the title, its extremely clear that the movie's focus point if Captain Philips and nothing else. Billy Ray has structured a script in a character driven mode. Its about how he pacified the situation and took charge at points in order to save his vessel as well the crew followed by his struggles when he was kept as hostage. Now since its a portrayal of real incident with zero moments to trespass beyond realism, Paul's smartness to narrate a thriller with an emotional quotient is the highlight of the movie. The climax scene filled with tension and the manner how navy team displayed their professionalism in finishing off the matter was a treat to watch.....especially the ""execute"" scene.After watching this movie, I felt only Tom Hanks can portray Captain Philips. The manner at which he tried to pacify and negotiate smartly with the Somalian pirates was simply outstanding. Barkhad Abdi as the captain of the Somalian pirate group conveyed a fear in the minds of the audience though his performance. The rest of the cast comprising of the other members of Somalian pirates, Merchant vessel crew and Navy team delivered outstanding performances.Barry Ackroyd's cinematography reminds you of those shaky realistic shots mostly seen in such kinda films. Christopher Rouse editing kept the movie tight and at an even pace. Henry Jackman's score wasn't exceptional so as to be noticed but did maintain the mood of the film.Its a survival drama with bits of thrills here n there captured in a realistic manner with Tom Hanks delivering yet another outstanding performance.I'd be amazed if Hanks doesn't get another Academy Awards' nod.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"An engaging tale of survival, based on a real incident!","Captain Phillips is one of those intelligent yet simple thrillers, which without much gunpowder or even brains, get you hooked in just a few minutes. Such films are a rarity these days. But there is more to it than just a survival thriller.Captain Richard Phillips is a merchant merchant mariner, whose ship is hijacked by 4 Somali pirates. Captain Phillips unsuccessfully tries to negotiate but end up being a hostage.Global capitalization is a topic which hasn't been brought up in many movies. As I said, Phillips is not just a survival tale but it questions the effects of global capitalization, and the countries' drive and greed for power and control. Countries like Somali try to survive the death race started by other superpowers.The story not only lets you feel what Rich is feeling, but also the pirates' perspective. Which makes us wonder, where they really bad? Why won't they just give them the money? Muse's character is so intelligently crafted that the viewer only empathizes as much as Greengrass wants him to. Barkhad Abdi compliments this by a splendid acting performance.This film is the perfect example of 'acting with expressions and eyes'. Tom and Barkhad, compliment each others' performances throughout the film, and their eyes do the talking. Tom really outdid himself by portraying a shocked and traumatized captain at the end. It is very disappointing that he didn't get nominated, but I guess it was due to competition, all the nominations for best actor are simply marvelous. I guess its time the academy needs to extend the number of nominees for major categories other than best picture.Direction: Greengrass is great, a strong narrative and a strong hold on the film. He easily gets us hooked in just a few minutes. I haven't seen any of his previous works as of yet, thus the hand held camera really gave me a few headaches and dizziness, maybe it was done to give the viewer a more 'seasick' effect.Script/Story: Superbly written, minimal dialogues. A simple screenplay, but the film is more about expressions than dialogues.Acting: Tom is back, and he is at his best, he deserved a nomination. Barkhad Abdi was good for a newcomer with no experience whatsoever, though I don't see him wining the Oscar. Rest of the cast was equally good, especially the Somali actors.Music: The score had a striking resemblance to inception's score. I mistook the composer for Hans Zimmer, until I checked it. But further reading, I came to know that Zimmer was involved but remained uncredited. Nevertheless an amazing score, if not Oscar worthy.Overall a nail-biting and strong believable thriller. As it isn't a mind twister of a thriller it can easily be enjoyed when you want to rest your head after a long day of work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Boring drab movie, shaky and devoid of details cinematography","This movie has been shot using the currently faddish ""realistic"" way.Actors look like everyday persons, without any spark nor charisma.The picture is drab, devoid of details, shot too close with a shaky camera, making it look as some news coverage rather than an actual movie.The movie itself is slow paced, with very tepid action (sometimes), and mostly very unlikable characters.Tom Hanks is good, of course, but him alone cannot save a movie which is a big yawn from start to, well about 75 minutes which is the point I gave up, not being able to take any more.Maybe it gets marginally better on the end, but it's so flat and uninvolving that I did not want to waste any more time with it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A pulsing, slow-burning, and emotional thriller","Captain Phillips, which came into theaters on Oct. 11, tells the true story of the eponymous captain whose cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates masquerading as fishermen back in 2009. Directed by Paul Greengrass, it starts off rather slow, taking a while to give all the background information and set up the story. Once it gets going, though, the film turns into an intense rescue mission and moral quandary that is impossible to turn away from.Greengrass does a fine job at directing, but his hand-held camera-work is incredibly shaky and at times nauseating. That being said, almost the entire film takes place on the ocean, so the direction does do a fantastic job at immersing the viewer further into the situation at sea.Tom Hanks, who stars as the titular character, gives his best performance in over ten years. He portrays Phillips as an average, slightly arrogant man thrust into a highly unusual and stressful situation. Phillips—who the pirates nickname ""Irish"" due to his heritage—is never directly referred to as a hero. Rather, the lengths he goes through to keep his crew safe are presented as completely natural, and are not particularly highlighted within the film.Throughout the entire film, you can literally see the fear in Hanks's eyes—this isn't acting, this is more than that. While terribly afraid of the pirates who take him for ransom, he definitely feels sorry for them, and goes to lengths to help them settle the situation calmly. At one point in the film the film, Phillips asks the pirate leader, Muse, ""There's got to be something other than being a fisherman or kidnapping people."" To that, Muse replies, ""Maybe in America, Irish, maybe in America.""Moments like this present the pirates as actual people, simply doing their jobs and trying to bring money back to their villages and leaders. Barkhad Abdi, who portrays Muse, comes out of nowhere to give the standout performance of the film. He holds his own against Hanks the entire time, and while he certainly makes Muse into the villain of the film, it's clear that he really has no choice but to occupy this position. He gave empathy to a character that could have turned out be just another stereotypical villain, but instead was elevated to a complex, desperate human being.Both actors are definitely in serious contention to snag an Oscar nomination come January, and I suspect the film will get a few more as well. I'd also like to point out the brilliance of Henry Jackman's score, which serves as an intense, pulsing backdrop for the action that takes place on screen.Overall, while 'Captain Phillips' takes a while to get going, the wait is well worth it. The film turns into a complex moral thriller that, despite potentially knowing the ending due to the fact that it is based on a true story, remains very intense throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Superb,"Holds u tight in ur chair, hanks and others have done a great job. It's all about this the pirates attacks the ship cruising through the ship and it's captain tries to save it's ship and fails. The matter becomes serious where the government had to deploy the seal team to retrieve ship and it's captain back safely. It overall doesnt have any high profile scenarios or anything to woo the audience. It's all basic and logical which is a nice part about the movie. The movie has been based on the real life which shows the actual trauma that the captain went during the whole trip and he comes back alive fighting bravely, which is great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Tom Hanks is superb,"Two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks is the face of the 57th BFI London Film Festival, as the maritime thriller Captain Phillips and the biographical comedy, Saving Mr. Banks bookends the 11-day event.British director, Paul Greengrass has built a reputation for dramatising events of terror (United 93, Bloody Sunday, Green Zone). He remains consistent with Captain Phillips, as he presents us with an adrenaline-charged rebirth of a real life hijacking.Based on true events and the book A Captain's Duty, co-authored by the real Captain Richard Phillips, this biographical blockbuster is an intricate dramatisation of the 2009 capture of the U.S container ship Maersk Alabama, by a crew of Somali pirates – the task was to transport food and drink from Port Oman to Mombasa, Kenya. However, the vessel's course was set to travel through the pirate-infested waters of the Somali Basin.At the very beginning, we are introduced to the security-conscious Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks), an experienced seaman who sets out to navigate a cargo ship round the horn of Africa. Soon after, the narrative shifts to Somalia where we meet a clan of pirates who live under gang rule. Muse (Barkhad Abdi), a fisherman-turned-pirate who dwells in little village on the Somali Coast, occupies a cold-hearted demeanor and his general icy glare earns him the title of pirate captain; with his visceral behavior, Muse is close to meeting the same screen magnetism as our beloved Jack Sparrow. Skinny and feeble but with a mindset that's as strong as steel, the Somali- American newcomer pulls out a performance that forces even our front-man to raise his game.Greengrass' intentions were to offer a fair and balanced account of the events and although Billy Ray's screenplay seems to be weighted in Phillips' favour, the director stated during the LFF press conference that, ""We haven't created characters that didn't exist; we haven't created great sways of the story that didn't exist."" He continued, ""I am very comfortable that this is a fair and accurate account of this event and I will stand by the methodology I used.""The piracy situation rapidly plummets into a kidnapping, as the bandits make off in the Alabama lifeboat with Cpt. Phillips as their hostage. Now a tactical military operation, the USS Bainbridge intercepts the lifeboat and Navy Seals are called in to execute a highly strategic rescue operation. Although this may seem like an unfair fight with the US Navy taking on an armed quartet of buccaneers in a lifeboat, Greengrass, together with cinematographer Barry Akroyd, keeps us in suspense as to which way the tide will turn.Amongst the chaos, the cinematography finds time to linger on the beauty of the everyday, which effectively juxtaposes the brutal editing and maintains its strong sense of urgency. Akroyd allows the spectator to get so close to the action that they themselves are at risk of suffering seasickness.This typically Greengrass affair doesn't afford in-depth characterisation as it would impede the relentless pace of the action; we are full steam ahead. Its music is extremely evocative; It heightens the emotional dimension and encourages Captain Phillips to reach its well-crafted and overwhelming climax.Tom Hanks' performance as an average Joe, who demonstrates extraordinary fortitude and resilience, is focused, powerful and emotionally attached; we are privy to an acting tour-de- force that's sure to be in the Oscar's trajectory. Ultimately, Captain Phillips is a triumphant, albeit dizzying tale of human resolve, which by-the-way showcases both military and acting excellence.Enjoy your coffee!www.moviematrix.co.uk",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Greengrass's direction guides movie to a built-up tension.,"Paul Greengrass has directed two of Hollywood's best action movies when he sat in the director's chair for The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum. This time around though he tackled a real life situation and the result was something quite phenomenal. I would say most of the movie is good, but due to the incredible shots by Greengrass's camera the film only gains quality. Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips, a man who in 2009 was captured by this Somali pirates and faced a life threatening equation. The experienced Hanks handles the character well and gives a very human side to him. This isn't a particularly hard role, but let's just say that besides Tom Hanks, there are only a handful of actors who could have pulled off what he pulled here. The revelation is obviously Barkhad Abdi, who puts some so called ""Hollywood"" actors to shame. He shows a lot of maturity in a demanding role for someone with his inexperience. My favorite part of the film was without a doubt the directing approach by Paul Greengrass. It is the kind of work that I believe should have been nominated at the Oscars and it is truly a shame. Captain Phillips is a very entertaining thriller and overall it delivers. Dramawise however the movie lacks a bit since I don't believe it to be the best worked angle. It is dramatic but not to a great extent.Rating 7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Well done, generally realistic thriller","We were pleasantly surprised by this film. Even knowing how it ends, the suspense wore us out. It stuck fairly well (by Hollywood standards) to facts, except for the extreme time compression of a film story, and some unnecessary bits (""If you want to shoot someone, shoot me!""). Tom Hanks was capable as always. Neither he nor the crew appeared heroic, so much as people trying to make the best of a bad situation. The captain's awareness of danger and decision to stay only 300 nm offshore was depicted, along with his conviction that ""further out wouldn't make any difference"". Also, the desperate situation of the pirates, their being bullied into piracy, their conviction of being robbed by illegal fishermen, their personal lack of resources and gain (those millions go to the bossmen) from piracy all were described. The deep social pathology of Somalia's current anarchy is evident, but not highlighted. I imagine the US Navy loved this movie, but they had overwhelming force available. The hostage could lose, but the pirates could not win. Many of the reviews say more about the viewpoints of the reviewers than the movie itself. Barakhad Abdi and Faysal Ahmed were brilliant in depicting the intelligent, conflicted, and deeply messed-up characters they portrayed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

An Adventure With Pirates!,"Captain Phillips (2013) -I found it really hard to enjoy this film, purely because the content was quite horrible to watch. I've never been one to enjoy conflict, but when there are lots of people all shouting over each other in a language I can't understand, it makes me feel quite claustrophobic, because I just need to get out of that moment. There were quite a few instances of that here, which made it even harder for me to watch.The whole thing induced anxiety for me, I'd have been less than useless if I'd been on board that container ship.What I will say however, is that it was a well made film. I don't think that the shouting, Etc was out of character or wrong at all, which in turn upset me more, because I hate to think that there are really people like that out there (I live in a pretty pink bubble that doesn't let the news in). But the story was interesting and worthy of a film.Mr Hanks in particular definitely deserved more recognition at the Oscars for his depiction of the title character. I can only think that he was omitted due to issues surrounding how genuine his role was.And this is another thing that, you may have noticed, annoys me about films. Why don't they show what really happened instead of glorifying people that, while unfortunate and mistreated, weren't necessarily in the right in the first place and should have heeded the warnings they were given before entering dangerous waters? This was what the real Captain Phillips appeared to have done based on the Trivia section of IMDB that notes many cases where the crew actually sued the man for his incompetence. Of course I am not saying that he deserved to suffer for his behaviour, but don't make him out to be a hero if he wasn't one. I actually think that it's a shame that he wasn't the man shown here.In some ways though it was a different role for Tom. Something new for him, that I don't think I had seen before. Its certainly a long way from 'Big' (1988) and even his more serious roles in 'Bridge Of Spies' (2015) or 'The Post' (2017).This film had a bit of a fly on the wall documentary feel to it throughout, which was quite enjoyable as a new way of filming a scripted story.Even the camera moved around in a way that made me feel sea sick, which wasn't quite so enjoyable, but added a touch of realism.The Somalian's were terrifying right from the start and I'm sorry to say that I never felt sorry for them at all. I believe that it was the intention of the director that after a while I was supposed to see things from their perspective too and to sympathise with their cause, but I could only see them making more and more bad, angrily charged decisions in a way that showed them to be quite monstrous in my opinion. You certainly couldn't claim that they had an innocence based on their circumstances.The end couldn't come quickly enough for me. I was counting down the minutes to be able to say that I'd watched it all the way through, despite the fact that it was a trial for me to endure, almost as much as it was for Phillips. I didn't want to leave it unfinished, but if the last half an hour that I'd recorded had turned out to be adverts after the film, I would have been very pleased.I still love you Mr. Hanks, but this is not something I would choose to watch again.600.99/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"It's A Thrilling Tension-filled Film, But It's Haphazard Priorities Leaves The Audiences Clueless As To What To Feel.","When a talented Director (Paul Greengrass) and a brilliant Actor (Tom Hanks) collaborate, you can't help yourself but be excited. Maybe I expected too much from the maker of 'The Bourne Ultimatum' because the overall effect 'Captain Phillips' had on me was good, but a little underwhelming. The movie is a thrilling Biodrama with appropriately-built tension and terrific acting, but the screenplay meanders a lot in a lackluster pace.One of the two main protagonists, Captain Phillips (homonymous with the movie's title), is supposed to be the heroic lead of the film. Other than a few evading efforts against the pirate boat and a couple of astute tactics used to trick the on-board pirates, in the first half of the movie, he stoops into lame and unwise attempts of escaping when he's aware of the presence of already-at-work Navy seals. Moreover, his character was quite underdeveloped. Even the climax scene, where he cries out loudly after being rescued, had people reaching for their handkerchiefs, when it had the least bit impact on me; I failed to make any connection with him, or even feel sympathy for him. Though I have to say, Tom Hanks has done an impressive job, at least with whatever was given to him; his character's lack of impact can be blamed on the screenplay.To me, it was the other lead protagonist, Muse, the leader of the Pirate group, who had more character and was more ""empathizable"". He was evidently switching between two emotions, one to follow orders and not go empty-handed to his elders, and the other to feel sympathy for his hostages. Barkhad Abdi's controlled and nuanced performance makes the character raw, fierce, emotionally-vulnerable and relateable. If it were upto me, I would have named the movie after him.I certainly appreciate how the storywriter and director have portrayed the story in such an unbiased way; we get both sides' account. And the funny thing is, maybe the whole US rescue mission is supposed to be seen as a heroic deed, but to me, as the whole story turned out, the whole system (the cargo ship - navy seal team) seemed dumb. First of all, when such a big cargo is being transported through those dangerous waters, I don't understand the logic behind having no security. Then when a ship is in threat or hijacked, they spend so much by deploying the Navy seals and everything. To me, the way the four skinny Somalian pirates hijacked an entire cargo ship on their tiny boat seemed more admirable.All in all, it's a thrilling tension-filled film, but it's haphazard priorities leaves the audiences clueless as to what to feel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Requires big screen viewing,"Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum) knows how to build suspense. His latest action/adventure Captain Phillips, based on the true 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship for ransom by four armed Somali pirates, is no exception. The movie creeps, crawls, rises and falls throughout its 2h15min running time. Tom Hanks delivers but the Somali pirates are the real stars of the film.What I liked: Greengrass goes from 0-100 in a matter of seconds. The movie has a brief and awkward start but with one flicker on the radar and a hand-held camera we are engulfed in foreboding. The action gives the movie a frenetic pace but the performances win the day. Hanks is the everyman we can all relate to and be terrified for but it's the Somali pirates who offer us more than stock villains, even with stock dialogue. Newcomers Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman are smart, devious, famished, suffering and wilful. They tug at our heartstrings even as we root for them to fail. They are the driving force behind a film whose conclusion made headlines.What I didn't like: Why did they cast the wonderful Catherine Keener if she was going to end up on the cutting room floor? This frustrated me to no end when the movie was over. I can also understand why the Navy hasn't exactly applauded the film because despite their oppressive presence they don't actually seem to do or accomplish anything. I understand the need to draw out action in order to build a climax but I couldn't help but wonder if some of the sequences were just add-in plot points to embellish the drama rather than actual events.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Nothing to do with reality,"The real captain philips' crew has denounced this movie as pure nonsense, as the real philips was both arrogant and fooling as HE insisted to sail near the somalian coast despite warnings. He never tried to save his crew like the movie depicts.In this movie however, he is some bleeding heart hero who spends his time bonding with pirates who are more akin to bumbling fools , holding no ressemblance to the real deal. In fact, the movie is designed to make you feel bad ... for them!The real deal however, was a different story - when this happened pirates tried to bring 54 hostages from around the world as human shields. They had no respect for human life and would have gladly murdered everyone on board AND the 54 filipinos & thais citizens (which are never seen in the movie) if it wasn't for the action of Mr Perry who was the true hero (he single handedly strongarmed the leader).... but I guess Perry didn't sell his life story for millions like Philips did.As for the movie itself, it's the usual hollyweird propaganda - 'terrorists are just misunderstood and kinda funny in a weird way', 'all authority is bad', etc.Terrible, abject and sadly well recieved by gullible audience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A true story thriller that truly thrills.,"The first time I saw the trailer for Captain Phillips, my thoughts were racing on how this movie, starring Tom Hanks and based on the true story of the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in over 200 years, would fare under the pressure of retelling such a tale. My original thoughts were quite skeptical, it didn't seem as though the film would be able to provide the type of real-life thrills that the actual hijacking did. Boy was I wrong.Right off the bat, I am going to give the obvious gold star of the film to lead man Tom Hanks. Portraying the title character, Hanks is the sole elite level actor in the cast and because of this, he completely and rightfully steals the show. We first see Captain Phillips as an everyday family man, worried about is children and wife and by the time he reaches his vessel, the MV Maersk Alabama, we can see that the thoughts of possible pirate attacks are also running through his head as he runs drills and reads instruction guides to help prevent from pirates. This lead me to believe that upon the eventual attack, the Captain would be a stress-ridden mess but the exact opposite transpires, as Hanks portrays the calm and collective manner that a captain should have. Hanks continues to display his award-winning acting talent throughout the rest of the film, which clocks in at just over two and a half hours long. Every emotional string is pulled as the movie progresses, and Hanks is the center of nearly every one. From sadness, to frustration to pure heart-racing moments and in the closing minutes of the film, Hanks gives an emotional performance rivaling that of his beloved performance in 2000's ""Cast Away"". Tom Hanks proves that age is just a number when it comes to his raw ability to evoke numerous emotions in his viewers, and could be on his way to another Oscar for Best Actor.Every great thriller builds itself up for the eventual finale, and Captain Phillips does just that. The movie starts off slow, letting you get to know the crew and ship just enough to not bore with nonsensical back story that a movie such as this doesn't necessarily need. We see the ship's eventual hijackers in Somalia gearing up to move out on their mission to bring back money to their leader Hufan. The film doesn't provide to much information on exactly why these pirates are seeking out the American vessel, and this is both good and bad. Bad because it could leave viewers slightly confused on what is going on, but good in the sense that it leaves mystery and fear behind the pirates. The movie continues to build anticipation, and when the first gun shots are fired, the movie really kicks in. Eventually the NAVY Seals get involved with the situation and even more intensity is added as the movie gets into its final moments. The say the least, the action is defined by the pressure built between the Captain and Muse and his crew, and less on hundreds of bullets flying across the screen, and because of that, the genre ""thriller"" is put to use perfectly.As I say, a movie is only as good as it's villain, and newcomer Barkhad Abdi plays antagonist Muse, the leader of the pirate group. Muse and his crew are relentless and scary, and the surprising smarts of Muse force Captain Phillips to adapt to the situations much faster and it makes for a wonderful and exciting game of chess between the two leaders.Director Paul Greengrass, best know for his work on The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum, deserves a shout out for his ability to produce and capture intense and thrilling moments that give this film a sense of realism that many true-story movies fail to do. I was highly excited when I discovered Greengrass was directing and he did not fail to deliver.When it's all said and done, Captain Phillips is defined by it's edge of your seat moments, relentless antagonist, emotional prowess and phenomenal performance by lead actor Tom Hanks, all built on the fact that this film is based on a true story. This is a film that will undoubtedly help Captain Richard Phillip's story be remembered and stored away in the books of American history.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Yes Captain!!!,"Look at me, look at me (well maybe you can't) but I am the pun captain now. Because I am going to hold you hostage with a plethora of puns in yet another film review voyage upon my pun-man ship. Please don't jump off!! OK, I am going to bring you my insight of the masterful movie ""Captain Phillips"". The film is based on the real life 2009 incident where cargo ship capitan Richard Phillips was taken hostage on a cargo lifeboat by four Somali pirates. Tom Hanks pitch-perfect starring performance as the title character was on board as one of the best acting efforts of the year. It's too bad the Academy rocked the boat when they left Hanks off the Best Actor Oscar nominee list. Newcomer Somalian actor Barkhad Abdi's freshman effort as the Somalian pirate leader Muse was a gem. Abdi's facial expressions alone were worthy of all the acting accolades his performance has received. Director Paul Greengrass has once again proved that the green is always richer on our side when he is orchestrating suspense action films based on true stories. Greengrass anchors ""Captain Phillips"" quite swiftly, just as he perfectly piloted ""United 93"". Billy Ray's screenplay was very compelling and included what probably is the movie catchphrase of the year ""I'm the captain now"". So whether you pirate this movie or not (recommending the latter of course), you should take a look at ""Captain Phillips"". ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Dreadful.....so slow it hurts!,Thought I'd give this a watch due to good review'sIn two words........don't bother.A story that could of been told in an hour tops.Sorry Tom never seen a bad film from you up till today.If you read the real story its better tha this Hollywood take off and is worth a read as the real event changed attitudes to Sommallian piracy due to the court case brought by members of the crew against Cap'n Phillips et al.Out of court settlement but piracy is now finished in that part of the world.All in all a real damp squib of a film.Glad it was freeview,2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Outstanding,"This is an outstanding film, from start to finish. It's a masterpiece of acting, pacing, editing and with a perfectly-pitched soundtrack to boot. It benefits from being based on a pretty dramatic true story in the first place, but Paul Greengrass and co have treated the material intelligently to create a tense, believable and truly thrilling movie.While I have no doubt that they've taken some liberties with the facts and added a good dose of Hollywood magic, at no point do things feel overdone or cheesy.Hanks is predictably brilliant in the title role, with the final scene being particularly noteworthy. Barkhad Abdi, Barkad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed and Mahat Ali - all first-timers - turn in solid performances as the Somali pirates. The story is balanced and never tries to either paint the pirates as out-and-out evil, nor as hard-done-by cuddly bunnies. It simply shows, in a believable and nail-biting way, the outcome of an extraordinary set of events.I only wish more movies coming out of Hollywood were so well executed, as this just goes to prove you don't need explosions, overdone CGI or ridiculous plot twists to create a piece of truly engaging cinema.Very, very, very good indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A masterful, towering movie of excitement, drama, suspense, shock and ultimately, intense emotion.","I wasn't particularly looking forward to watching Captain Phillips as the subject matter didn't really appeal to me, but almost from the opening credits, I was completely hooked. It is a masterful, towering movie of excitement, drama, suspense, shock and ultimately intense emotion. In my humble opinion, it is far and away finest performance by Tom Hanks. Based on a true story, the film is about a gigantic, ocean-going container vessel being hijacked by a tiny band of desperate Somalis, and the immediate aftermath of this daring but utterly criminal act. We get to know the two main protagonists: Captain Phillips, (Tom Hanks), who is the strong, silent and incredibly brave master of the vessel, and the Somali hijack gang leader, Muse, (Barkhad Abdi).I cannot write much about the plot without spoiling the story for those of you who haven't yet seen it, but suffice to say that it romps along at quite a pace and things develop in dramatic and unexpected ways. I can guarantee that you will never become bored for one millisecond while watching this exciting and brilliantly acted movie. All the cast are totally believable in their roles, and there are no one- dimensional or 'plastic characters' – not even in the US Navy. The cinematography and direction (by Paul Greengrass) is so realistic that sometimes you think you are watching footage of the actual event.Even though we in the west deplore these hijackings and hostage taking, the film manages to perform an incredible task – it actually succeeds in evoking a measure of sympathy for the plight of the Somali perpetrators, and in particular, their leader, Muse. In the end, few watching can fail to be moved by the physical and emotional torment of Captain Phillips and if you leave the cinema dry-eyed and also without a feeling of being uplifted by the turnout of events, then you are not human.I note that the user reviews on IMDb are almost 100% unanimous in their high praise of this very worthwhile and 'must-see' piece of entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Feel every moment with Captain Phillips,"Before I watched this movie someone spoiled the ending for me in 2016, so I didn't watch it then. But this year after 4 years, I watch it (while remembering the ending). But when I watched it I was thrilled in every moment in this movie, make my jaw drop, it's a biography but it feel like a documentary (so realistic). Probably the best acting I've seen from Tom Hanks, his performance made me cry and feel the shock that he's feeling. Well directed, well acted, must see biography film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Entertaining take on real-life drama,"The great risk for this movie (based on a true story) was to be overly grim and rough on the audience. The potential for two hours of anguish, nightmare and psychological torture was there. Instead, Greengrass is very good in balancing drama, action and thrill, also with the great merit of humanizing the pirates (victims themselves) and focusing on the relation between them and Tom Hanks.
Hanks delivers his usual deep and friendly interpretation, and he's a great part of the success of this movie.
Overall, two hours of action and thrill that will keep you entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Hijack sea drama lacks original context,"Other comments, above, describe the film production as an exciting drama based on the events of a real incident. After seeing the DVD, several things have impressed me. There are appear to be three levels to this story; first, was the actual event that occurred off the Somali coast, second, was the book publication that referred to the event, and, finally, there was the film, produced from the book.Each of these levels captures less of the story. The actual event included all the crew and pirates in real life, and was proceeded by the surrounding history of the government and people of Somalia. The book version had to be a condensation of the actual event. The film version was the result of further editing, and possible revision for dramatic effect. A previous review (tieman64) above, added background and context to the actual events that were missing from the film.""But as everyone knows, to the point of being smugly annoying, that is not ""all there is"". The Somali pirates are largely a result of Western companies dumping nuclear and toxic waste off Somalia's coast, coupled to severe illegal over-fishing by foreign super trawlers (300 million dollars worth of seafood stolen from Somalia each year). The United Nations would itself release numerous reports blaming toxic waste for mutations, deaths, diseases and illnesses within Somalia. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN envoy for Somalia, would say: ""There is uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury, industrial, radioactive, hospital and chemical waste killing Somalis and completely destroying the ocean."" Why can companies do this? Because Somalia's government has all but collapsed, thanks to Western Empires deliberately destabilizing and developmentally arresting the nation, funding warlords, dictators (Siad Barre et al) and instigating proxy wars with border nations. This has been going on, uninterrupted, since the late 1950s; any local government body not beholden to Western corporate interests, and which attempts to nationalize resources, will be destroyed. 'Not knowing the book, I cannot comment on its version.The film version may have been good drama, but was deficient on history, and for this viewer, disappointing. Nobody should mistake the film for the actual history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What If It Happened To You?,"There are many unique aspects that make ""Captain Phillips"" a Best Picture-nominee: incredible acting, high tension, and a plot that one wouldn't think could occur yet in the 21st century. To me, however, the hallmark of the movie was its ability to make viewers ask themselves the question ""what would I do in a similar scenario?"".For a basic plot summary, ""Captain Phillips"" tells the story of Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks), captain of a shipping vessel that is boarded by a gang of Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abi). Looking to strike a a huge payday from an American ship, the pirates take Mr. Phillips as their hostage. However, despite their best efforts, the pirates are constantly set back by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips and his crew.The most striking experience of this whole film to me was this: Here we are in the year 2014, and we are still dealing with pirates! When people use that word nowadays, they are mostly referring to fictional characters with eye-patches flying the Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones. The Somali pirates, though, are not of this variety. They are both ruthless and calculating, producing a visceral sense of fear that they could begin taking lives at any time.Thus, while watching the movie, I was constantly thinking ""how would I handle this situation?"". At the same time, I was amazed by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips in the face of a very, very frightening situation. Being based on a true story (although I honestly know nothing about the real Captain Phillips, so I can't vouch for accuracy whatsoever), this movie has a sense of ""real- world gravitas"" to it, while at the same time producing incredibly high drama due to the unique situations it presents.As far as the acting is concerned, ""Captain Phillips"" showcases some of the best. The tension between the Hanks and Abdi characters is palpable throughout, while the final few minutes of the film may be the best work Mr. Hanks has ever put up on the big screen (and what a statement that is!).Overall, then, ""Captain Phillips"" is the film I would vote as ""Best Picture"" at the 2014 Academy Awards. It is a film that can be enjoyed by all, not just appealing to a particular segment. Even if you ""know what is going to happen"", so to speak (being based on a real person's experiences), the tension between Phillips and the Pirates will still have you on the edge of your seat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good drama & Emotions,its a good movie as usual tom has given his best but i must appreciate the pirate his acting was quite nice in my opinion he beat hanks on few occasions he was able to deliver more through his eyes its a true story so i guess director has done a good job because you can not make something on your own beside i was expecting a photo of real phillps at the end of the movie with his family . music could have been better at times it was very loud but not emotional for me its a good movie over all good time pass and a family movie do watch it when you have time one role only . i don't see any Oscar for this movie in any category though people have been talking a lot about this project please rate if you like my review as this is my first review for any movie. regards,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Captain Phillips   Shaky Cam?,"Captain Phillips. I tried several times to sit down and watch this movie. Three times on a plane with nothing else to do. Each time I only lasted ten to fifteen minutes before getting a headache. The camera appeared almost entirely hand held on a long lens and was constantly shaking and jerking around all over the place. Even during important dialog.(My friend in the seat next to me managed longer and when ever I glanced at his monitor throughout the film, the picture was always jerking around.) At times I had to look away to avoid getting dizzy. How on earth anyone can watch this is unbelievable. I'm sure it's a good film so I am told.Paul Greengrass, get a tripod!",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Another 10/10 film starring Tom Hank's!,"Unsurprisingly this film was amazing, as is typically the case when Tom Hanks is cast. The suspense was evident all the way through, and the acting was brilliant from all actors! Literally couldn't fault this film. The long length of the film was necessary and it did not feel draining or slow at any point. Thoroughly recommend to everyone, particularly those like me who for whatever reason has been putting off watching this film (I reckon I was put off by the idea of the continued boat setting - I now regret not watching this earlier).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What a Story! It Draws You in From the Get Go and Never Lets Go!,"This movie is amazing! It is really cool and has a ton of action and is based on a true story. I wish I had this movie so I could watch it again!This movie is based on the true story about a guy named Richard Phillips who is a captain of a ship. Pirates come and take the captain as hostage. Eventually he is stuck on a life boat with the pirates and the captain just wants to see his family again. Luckily the navy comes but they don't want to hurt Captain Phillips so they try to trick the pirates. The movie is very intense and I was on edge the whole time. The main characters in the movie are Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Bilal (BArkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmen), and Elmi Mahat M. Ali). My favorite character in this movie is Captain Phillips because he is really nice and he would rather sacrifice his own life for his crew. That shows how much he cares about other people. It really made me think about what I would do in this type of situation.My favorite part in the movie is when they capture the captain because that's when the action really starts. It's not good that he gets captured but you see a lot of action after that. You see the navy show up, you hear threats from the pirates, you see helicopters in the air. Everything goes crazy! But that's what I love about these kinds of movies.I recommend this movie for ages 12 and up because this movie is really scary and has a lot of violence and parts that are bloody. It is rated pg-13 so I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Anthony A. For more youth reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Fantastic Film,"Captain Phillips is by far one of the best films I've seen in the last couple of years. If you're questioning whether or not you should see this movie, DO IT! It had me on the edge of my seat the entire duration of the movie; the tension and emotion throughout this movie is almost overwhelming, and Tom Hanks' performance is impeccable. While watching Captain Phillips, I just could not fathom the traumatic experience those men on that cargo ship, especially the captain, went through on that day. The actors in this film performed so flawlessly that it almost felt like the experience was happening right in front of your eyes. By far one of the best movies I've seen in a few years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"decent film, hanks at his best","I'm not a huge hanks fan i do like him in some films but in this he was terrific,especially the last half hour or so. It is so far the best film i have seen from 2013. Taken the material it folds out like a thriller and a drama - a very unflinching and tense one.Hanks plays Rich Phillips captain of a cargo ship delivering food to poor countries in Africa. But the pirates were after money and lots of it! Overall i give this film 8 and hope Hanks gets a nod for an Oscar maybe, unless i see a better performance from 2013.Worse things happen at sea so the saying goes and this is a confirmation on how scary out at sea can be especially in pirate waters. Bandit land. The Somalians were the ultimate villains and played their parts just as convincingly as Hanks did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A precisely excellent piece of cinema.,"Captain Phillips is raw with a clear focus and has strong foundations. The ending is emotional and stunning. Two captains come together with completely different backgrounds with similar reasons, a livelihood. With mind games this unique relationship grows with tension flowing throughout. Captain Phillips is simple yet clever. It feels pure yet effortless, as a series of events unfold which are truly believable making it thrilling but moving at the same time. Tom Hanks is flawless, whilst Barkhad Abdi provides an unnerving edge.

Pirates,"If these are real pirates, they are very different from the ones depicted in other movies. They don't Urrr and have no idea where the treasure is. The captain tries to deal with them according to what he knows of pirates but it doesn't work and a tragic end becomes necessary of the situation. Still the journey is a thrilling one at sea with very scary Somali pirates but the differences between the pirates in this movie and the ones often depicted in older movies are noted. It is like the world has not dealt with pirates before and the situation gets out of hand. The pirates code does not exist in Captain Phillips. The navy seals turn out heroic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I'm the Captain,"Captain Phillips was a really good and entertaining story. It was a fun ride throughout and had drama and kept you engaged and on the end of your seat. All of the actors did a great job making it feel like real life and not just a movie. There were also some really notable scenes and quotes like ""I'm the Captain now"" that have turned into globally recognizable memes. It was just a little too predictable and was just lacking something that takes it out of the usual upper tier of Tom Hanks movies. But regardless it's absolutely worth watching and a movie any movie lover should experience. IMDb needs to remove this minimum character limit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Hollywood Sinks to New Lows,"It looks like the whole movie is filmed with a cell phone by a teenager. It belongs to YouTube, not big screen. Extremely poor acting and camera work. Though based on a true story, it is hard to take it seriously by looking at some kids awkwardly pretending to be evil pirates.Strangely, the movie got quite a few awards and nominations, which clearly shows that it was not not accessed on its merits. Is it Tom Hanks bias? His presence in the movie does not make it any better - he just looks like he does not belong there.It is a mystery why Tom Hanks is a part of this home made video. Is he really so desperate?",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A realistic and suspenseful movie,"Captain Phillips is a captivating film. I've grown accustomed to seeing hostage situations in movies end with super-human characters using martial arts or something like that, so it is almost refreshing to see a regular guy just try to survive one. Plus, this film gives the pirates some humanity without making them too sympathetic. All of these elements, along with the excellent acting, make this a realistic and suspenseful movie that is well worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (Paul Greengrass, 2013) **1/2","Nominated for 6 Academy Awards in the upcoming Oscar ceremony (Film, Supporting Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing), the based-on-fact hijack drama CAPTAIN PHILLIPS somewhat surprisingly missed out on Best Actor (some critics claimed this was double Oscar winner Tom Hanks' best-ever performance) and Best Direction (Greengrass is credited with inventing a new style of kinetic thriller with his BOURNE movies). Although I have watched – and suffered through – both PHILADELPHIA (1993) and FORREST GUMP (1994) in the past, I have yet to watch the director's previous Oscar nod, the similarly-sourced- and-themed UNITED 93 (2006) or, for that matter, any of the reinvented Ludlums.Whenever I read in the news of an international ship being overtaken by African pirates, I could not help thinking that anyone who unwisely ventures into such all-too-obviously dangerous waters deserves whatever fate he encounters. Watching this movie only reinforced that notion – although, to be sure, Hanks is shown doing his utmost to ditch his pursuers and, once they successfully board his vessel, trick them; thankfully, we are also spared any teary-eyed flashbacks to Hanks' domestic life on land when he is individually kidnapped and beaten up.Admittedly, the film is both gripping (the initial game of cat-and-mouse between the hiding crew and the advancing Somali pirates) and moving (when Hanks breaks down after being saved by the Navy Seals); however, apart from being overlong at 134 minutes, my enthusiasm for the partly- shot-in-Malta CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (Hanks was constantly ""tweeting"" about his stay over here last Summer) was decidedly marred by two of the most obnoxious villains in screen history (including Oscar nominee Barkhad Abdi – whose role seems to run out of steam in the film's latter stages anyway and, incidentally, his constant referral to Hanks as ""Irish"" is just unbelievableas I doubt anyone in Somalia has ever even heard of the country!) who are not only unattractive to look at (if that sounds racist, sue me!) but their constantly hysterical and (no doubt, for veracity's sake) unsubtitled declamations got on my nerves long before the fadeout!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Competently done, highly serviceable account of real life drama","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCaptain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the US flagged MV Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship cruising around Somalia towards the Horn of Africa. Whilst the mission is underway, Phillips receives a lengthy e- mail warning him of the dangers of Somali pirates striking in that region, which his crew all too quickly become aware of. And sure enough, from a tiny, impoverished village in Somalia come a group of desperate men, who take over the ship, plunging Phillips and his crew in to a desperate life or death battle that will test him as a leader to the very limit.Only a few months ago, I noted how a big budget, glossy Hollywood production was in motion, on the subject of Somali pirates seizing cargo vessels around the Indian Ocean, in my review of a smaller budget, Danish production that had impressed me. There may be something of an arty film snob brewing in me that had me convinced this film wouldn't match that film's quality, and in a way, it doesn't. But that's because it's simply an impressive film in and of it's own. While it's inevitably on a much larger scale and has received much more publicity, it's in the hands of United 93 director Paul Greengrass, who manages to still keep something of a down to earth look to it by using a shaky cam. The way the drama unfolds does have a little more of a Hollywood feel to it than the Danish film, what with a big dramatic build up to the hijacking, rather than in the European film where we just see it happening without much fuss. But that doesn't make how it unfolds any less ominous, as there's an unnerving claustrophobia to the scenes where Phillips is on his own, glancing at the long e-mail or as we see the little ships on the radar and from the ship's deck, hurtling towards their target.After all this about the similarly themed Danish film, I feel it necessary to mention at this point that this is not a remake of that film, and is an account of a completely separate real life hijacking, that being the first at sea hijacking of an American vessel in many years. Hanks is pretty much the go to guy for this kind of role, and has done his research and rehearsal as reliably as ever, getting Phillips's accent right and enveloping himself in the role and the drama it invokes. But he's playing it off against a host of young Somali talent, who may struggle to find work as high profile as this again, in key roles as the hijackers, who sadly suffer the Hollywood effects of the film by being portrayed as more hissable and ruthless than they were in the Danish film, which probably more realistically showed them as only slightly less desperate and scared than their captives, but that's not to say Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman don't get quiet, soulful moments to reason with Hanks and show their more human side, even if there's nothing like the borderline Stockholm Syndrome there was in the Danish film.It would be easy for anyone who'd seen the Danish production to let out their cynical side and frown at a Hollywood stab at what it was trying to do, but the talent involved are professional enough to ensure it doesn't descend into anything overly glamorised or corn fed. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Superb Thriller !!!!!,"Another movie by Greengrass with On the edge of your seat thriller, highly intense & engaging! As always, great direction by Paul Greengrass.

One of the better thrillers of the year.,"The word ""realistic"" is one of the most misused in all of film criticism, being attributed even to CGI spectacles such as Gravity. Early reviews of Paul Greengrass' Captain Philips have praised it for its realism, but a more accurate term to explain the film's appeal would be ""believability"". The film is very much a Hollywood thriller (down to text on the screen informing us as to the differing locations of various scenes), but is to the credit of Greengrass and his cast that it manages to be genuinely exciting whilst remaining within genre parameters.The film casts Tom Hanks as Richard Philips, the captain of the Maersk Alabama-the first US cargo ship to be hijacked in over 200 years. Hanks proves an excellent choice for the role, with his familiar screen persona of normality making it easy to see Philips as an ordinary man forced into a nightmarish situation through no fault of his own. It's easier to believe that a middle-aged man with grey hair and beard might be terrified and fear for his life in the face of Somali pirates. The casting of unknown Somali American actors as the pirates hijacking the ship adds to this sense of believability, with Barkhad Adbi being particularly impressive as their leader Muse. Adbi does an excellent job with a role that could easily be a caricature, hinting at the desperation which drives the poor into piracy. This desperation is mirrored on the American side, with the film wisely maintaining a focus on the claustrophobia and paranoia which develop from being trapped on a ship hundreds of miles from civilization. The dynamic between Philips and Muse is what makes this film compelling, with their mutual dedication to their thankless tasks being visible throughout and hinting at the similarities between how the two captains handle their crews in crises.It is when the film moves away from this to include events happening away from the hijacking that it lags,with cutaways to Navy bases distracting from the tension of the main plot and the frequently thrilling action sequences(the boarding of the ship by the pirates merits particular praise, with the ingenuity of the pirates making clear why the Americans fear them so). Whilst some sense of the bigger picture about piracy is probably necessary to grasp the context the events of the film take place in, it's not what makes the film work. What lingers in the memory instead is the sense that both sides were as scared and vulnerable in real life as depicted here,making this film one of the better thrillers of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Another great Tom Hanks performance!,"I think many of us who enjoy film agree that Tom Hanks has been a continuous shining beacon throughout his years. This film is no different, Hanks' ability to be completely believable in all of his roles is mind-blowing and his portrayal of Phillips is captivating. The tension throughout the first half of this film is palpable and there is an ongoing, genuine fear of the events unravelling before our eyes. However, i feel the film loses this tension throughout and certain sections are given too much attention meaning the genuine fear created in the first half slowly dissipates throughout the second half.

Account of a true story told realistically w minimal embellisments,"Based on the true story from 2009 of a cargo ship captain being hijacked by pirates.Based on the true story from 2009 of a cargo ship captain being hijacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia, Captain Phillips is film full of suspense. Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips as he prepares the best a person can prepare for the inevitability of pirates attempting to take his ship ransom.Quickly the movie sets the foundation for Captain Phillips background, a captain who is doing a dangerous job, despite his wife's wishes, because there would be a line of men willing. Simultaneously the foundation is set for the pirates, boat loads of Somali men volunteering to hijack a ship, because this is a somber reality of life with no true alternative for livelihood. The crew, Navy, and audience wait as Richard Phillips is put in the perilous position of negotiator and hostage. The pirates are never as brutal as they have to be and the American crew members are never as heroic as they need to be.Hanks does a more than adequate job as a sympathizer to the pirates, trying to get everyone out of the situation intact and alive. This selfless and heroic character is probably not accurate to the real Captain Phillips persona, but necessary as a counter view to the pirates' story. I found myself identifying with the pirates, hoping they would have some sense, despite knowing the end to the story. This is thanks in part to the main Somali pirate, Muse, played by Barkhad Abdi. I am thankful he has received as many accolades as he has, though not a trained actor, he turns out a multi-layered character under tragic circumstances.This movie easily could have been a one-sided telling of the brutalities of the pirates, instead you get a multidimensional story that is more about the current effects of globalization than the thrilling encounter.More reviews can be found at our website.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Best film of 2013,"Many great films came out in 2013. I loved gravity, 12 years a slave, the wolf of Wall Street, and her; but captain Phillips is the best. Amazingly intense. As soon as the pirates are on board you are on the edge of your seat. Hanks is amazing as ever, and I have no idea how he didn't get an Oscar nomination for it. Barkhad Abdi who did get a nomination for best supporting actor is brilliant as well. Consider it's his first film performance. The performances are tense and believable and a genuine sense of fear is created throughout. The dialogue between the pirates becomes extremely scary, and the finale is perfect. I saw it twice just to make sure it was that good. Brilliant 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Runs out of steam,"Tom Hanks is game as always and he has his moments of flexing his acting chops.There are some moments of unintentional comedy that come at the worst possible time and it could be because the movie spent so much time building up to the eventual rescue scene which is genuinely well constructed and very very tense.Credit is due for humanizing the Somali pirates rather than what could have easily just been making them cardboard cutouts. Barkhad Abdi deserved that best supporting actor nomination for the conflict and despair that he gives his character Muse.Greengrass and his team are experts are ringing tension out of a scene through quick cuts and camera work and he does an exceptional job here as always.Catherine keener is sadly wasted. She has about five lines and isn't in the rest of the movie which is a shame. It makes you wonder whether they shot scenes for her and had to cut for time, which is. It's true, there are definitely some scenes we could have done with her and less with the pirates or Captain Phillips.The movies narrative propulsion runs a ground when it encounters the mountain of clipped military lines that supplement for dialogue. You have to have it in a movie like this, but it does start to wear out. Its welcome, particularly when you did have some good moments on either boat with between Captain Phillips and the pirates.Overall: worth a watch. Perfect Saturday afternoon cable movie.

"Pirates have taken over his ship! Time for Captain Phillips, ex-special forces & Navy SEAL, to kick some ASS! Not quite, but this is still an awesome movie! Read on for more!","Does anyone remember Dragnet, Big, Turner & Hooch, Splash, The 'Burbs??? All the silly but great movies I used to watch Tom Hanks in as a kid. That's who he was in the 80s, a comedy actor, doing quirky light-hearted movies. I guess there's no way we'll be seeing a sequel to the awesome Dragnet with him now being a celebrated thespian and all.Somewhere along the lines of Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan (1998), his career shifted gear and he's been producing acting powerhouses pretty much ever since. We can't really complain when they come as good as Captain Phillips.I'm not going to do a comparison of the movie and what happened in real life, there are plenty of other sites out there doing that. All I can say is that this is an excellent movie with enough reality and Hollywood magic to keep any movie fan happy.The story sounds almost like a sequel to Under Siege but thankfully there is no Steven Seagal anywhere in sight.Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is tasked with guiding the cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama to Mombasa around the horn of Africa, a known pirate hotspot. It soon becomes clear that Phillips was right to be apprehensive. Despite their best efforts, the ship is attacked and boarded by a band of Somali pirates.Although the pirates are few in number, they are armed and deadly, intent on getting a large payout. Under the expert guidance of Captain Phillips, the crew hide in the ship's engine room but things take a turn for the worst when Phillips himself is taken hostage in the ship's lifeboat.The Navy as well as a SEAL team are soon in pursuit but whether they can save Captain Phillips or not is a different matter altogether.This is another excellent movie and is easily up there with the likes of Gravity as one of the best movies I've seen this year.It's damn tense with Hanks turning in yet another outstanding performance which really has to be seen. It's testament to his skill as an actor and dedication to his craft. The research he did into the character obviously payed off big time. This of course would be nothing if not for the great performances of his supporting cast, including Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the pirates and of course expert direction from Paul Greengrass who ensures that the action is tight and on point. Thankfully, there's no shaky-cam rubbish here for which Greengrass was previously infamous for.There are no lulls, no laggy moments, just a tense, emotion and heart driven thrill ride from start to finish. It makes you appreciate your loved ones and value the time you have with them, much in the same way Gravity did for me.People complain about the US meddling in other peoples affairs, acting like they are the police of the world, but for what it's worth, when crap like this goes down, I'm glad they're out there trying, not always succeeding, but still trying to do the right thing. When the Navy and SEAL team arrive on the scene, even though I'm not American, I felt grateful that there is someone that can come to the rescue when stuff like this happens.I've been intentionally vague about the story to avoid spoiling the experience for you, but let there be no doubt, this really is a great film which I highly recommend to everyone.Don't expect Under Siege 3, or your typical one-man-army action hero type flick. This is as close to reality as most of us will ever want to get.Rating 9 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good, Solid Entertainment","Based on truth, pirates off the Somalian coast hijack cargo ships and hold ships captive for insurance money. Sad, but true - it still happens now, it is often cheaper (in money) for the ships to pay the Ransom than sail out of the way. The owners of the ships, crews and pirates all know this creating a very dangerous environment.Tom Hanks plays the captain of such a ship. A normal guy trying to fight off young kids who are given AK-47's and a few pennies for their efforts. Since the merchant men are unarmed, it's an unfair battle, but Cpt Phillips uses his wits and what few resources he has to save his crew and ship.I found the movie to be balanced - it presents all sides of the problem; the crew who are put at risk, the Capitan and even the pirates. The ending is rips your heart out. Hanks really did an excellent job there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good,"Say hello to the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years. Hanks carries this movie and saves it from being a disaster. The film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. The trains of righteousness can't be stopped and their movement brings about reactive forces in the people they affect. A masterful work that imbues you to it through its realism. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Greengrass strikes again,"British director Paul Greengrass delivers the goods in this taut and terrifying true-life thriller centred around Somali pirates and the innocent civilians they put at risk. Greengrass shapes a true story of hijacking on the high seas and turns it into an incredibly suspenseful story that bears all the hallmarks of the likes of UNITED 93.The thing about Greengrass is that he knows how to build suspense, and he knows how to deliver thrilling intensity. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is full of incredible scenes in which the tension is ratcheted up stage by stage, until things explode into excitement. This is a film of two halves, with the hijacking taking up the first half while the second half turns into a single-location thriller along the lines of Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT. Both halves complement each other and prove a satisfying whole.I'm no fan of Tom Hanks, but CAPTAIN PHILLIPS sees him deliver a strong performance as the testy, unlikeable captain put through his paces by the Somalis. The Somali actors are excellent in their roles, and I particularly liked the differentiation of character in the pirate gang - you feel like you've got to know them come the end. The cat and mouse games between crew and pirates are expertly staged and the pace never flags despite the lengthy running time. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is nothing less than a modern-day classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Harrowing but true,"Despite several people telling me not to bother going to see this film as it was predictable, I went anyway and thought it was quite brilliantly done. True, it was predictable if you knew the story, but to see the re-enactment of the whole sorry situation was a very great experience. The staging was brilliant and the acting by those portraying the Somalis was an eye-opener...the scenes in the lifeboat were harrowing (maybe a bit too drawn out insofar as the film was concerned) but the movie certainly showed how Americans rightly protect their own. Tom Hanks really had to act brilliantly in the last half of the film, after a very standard sort of role in the first half. I felt it was 15 to 20 minutes too long, but also a very good film",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Thrilling movie.,"Based on true events about the first American cargo ship to be overtaken by pirates in a long long time. The ship was under Captain Phillips control, the pirates were Somalian. The event is somewhat recent, taking place in 2009.Now the movie premise is simple enough, ship gets taken, hostage situation, negotiations etc. The execution of it all is great. The movie slowly builds up tension and it continues to do so till the very end. The last hour or so was really tense, I was just keep wondering what will happen, who will survive etc etc.Acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. He was exceptionally great at the last scene, I really felt that moment. The pirates were great too. You actually feel for them as the movie shows you their background (somewhat) and its not a simple good vs bad guy scenario, it could have been more fleshed out though.The soundtrack was good, cinematography was great.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

However, perhaps in the pursuit of realism of military action and of prolonged hostage situations, there were definitely a few times during the movie when I wondered whether it needed to be so long.The runtime should have been cut down by about 20 minutes - then this would have got an 8 or 9 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Average,"Paul Greengrass, who did a great job with ""United 93 (2006)"", once again gives us a movie based on real events.

It's just OK - and like most movies nowadays, it's over 2 hours and a bit too long.Good score by Henry Jackman is the main reason for keeping the movie intense and interesting for so long.Too much shaky cam (annoying especially in the beginning of the movie).The cast is good.

A taut tense thriller that hearkens a return to form for Tom Hanks,"Without a shadow of a doubt Paul Greengrass's take on the true story of Captain Phillips and his horrific ordeal is as fully formed and well constructed a tale as you'd ever get on film, and acts as one of the most tense and atmospheric thrillers of the year. It must be said though that the true life tale acts as a limited source material for a silver screen adaptation therefore limiting the praise that can be heaped upon it.When one talks about praise concerning Captain Phillips all due comeuppance must be paid to the aforementioned Greengrass who again proves with this film that he is a true auteur at creating and constructing taut thrillers, this is even more evident in the truly flawless and heart pounding United 93. The other form of praise must go to the welcomely back in form Tom Hanks who delivers a performance that reminds us as to why he was at one stage one of the worlds most powerful and believable actors, scenes towards the films end with Hanks particularly displaying a rare on screen breakdown that many actors could only dream of. Hanks award-deserving turn is matched by Barkhad Abdi as lead Somalian pirate Muse. Abdi's turn is filled with raw and unnerving intensity and acts as a great example of natural acting talent. The material these actors and director work with here however allows for a gut wrenching first hour and a much less effective last act.The way the story of this abduction unfolds as per real life events is a blistering white knuckle affair that is portrayed so well here in the film that the standard set can not last when the ordeal ventures into the small surrounds of the ships life boat, where the pirates plus Captain Phillips make there way to land and hopefully to a bounty that will suffice their criminal needs. This necessarily drawn out act of the film has some unquestionably lull scenes and one feels with a shortened length the films ability to race the heart would of been significantly sustained.Greengrass' film is virtually a technically flawless constructed movie with equally matched acting ability from all involved from main players through to bit players. Despite it's filmattic limitations due to subject matter, Captain Phillips is well worth seeking out and hopefully a stepping stone for Tom Hanks to get back to quality roles he was once so renowned for.4 water cannons out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
a mainstream production from the Hollywood assembly line,"A Hollywood-produced, politically correct, big studio vehicle, helmed by a world-class action artisan Paul Greengrass, stars the most revered actor of his generation, Tom Hanks as the titular captain, whose screen image is a paragon of an orthodox ordinary Joe alike American hero, in this seafaring hijack inspired by a true event in 2009 at Somali waters. It is a retaliation of the vicious circle from the poverty-stricken to the hegemony which sardonically offers them the alms and simultaneously capitalizes on their natural resources and weaponry merchandising, so it is not easy to hold a phlegmatic perspective to watch the man-made terror without deploring the sad truth how things have ended up like this, for sure we should inveigh against the piracy felony, all the same we should also see through the phenomena and ferret out the nitty-gritty which induces the atrocious tragedies. We have both parties to blame and need a soul-searching examination on our own conscience.Greengrass adopts an engaging procedure to re-enact the white-knuckle happening of how the ship is seized by four Somali pirates (leading by a scrawny Muse, played by the first-time actor, now Oscar-nominee Abdi), parallels the narrative from both sides, playing mind games and a hide-and-seek inside the vessel, this is the first half, culminated with the pirates take captain Phillips as the hostage in a lifeboat, floating back the Somali. Apparently from the hindsight, it is a preventable incident, considering it is a US cargo ship, no one on board is equipped with any firearms at all? From a gun frenzy country where campus shooting is rampant, it is quite implausible, but sometimes the truth is as simple as that, the pirates' boarding process is rough and ready, clearly the affluent corporate which owns the ship skimps on its defense system, although they are fully aware of the potential peril could happen anytime. Otherwise, there would be no big deal to defeat four sea marauders (one is barely a child) even they're equipped with AK-18.Anyway, the second half, Captain Phillips is held captive within a lifeboat with the pirates on the billowy sea, since then, the film heavily hinges on Hank's performance to emanate the brewing desperation during the so-called ""negotiation"" between US rescue team (SEAL, frogmen are all standby) and the cornered pirates four. It is a precious platform to let Hanks finally have something extraordinary to offer, he completes it with consummate precision and sublimates the predictable fallout of the false hope. Unfortunately due to a crammed year with sterling candidates, Hanks is left out of the nomination list, quite an upsetting snub, but he plays a real person who lacks for a distinctive character except he is under an extreme situation, not showy enough is the detrimental disadvantage. Abdi is the MVP among the pirates four, not as irritable and impatient as the hackneyed short-fuse Najee (Ahmed), he is a human being with flesh and blood, he is the one captain Phillips can relate to under such circumstances, all diversities aside, basically they both work for their respective bosses and want to finish their jobs with minimal casualties. His bold final move can be interpreted as a smart judgment call, his American dream ironically fulfills in a different way, at least he can be plumb free of his ill-destined fate.Nominated for 6 Oscars including BEST PICTURE (both Hanks and Greengrass are brutally snubbed here), CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is at best an unbiased recount of a man's individual struggle during a hanging-by-a-thread ride, and at worst, it is an unimaginative hostage story with jejune perpetrators wield weapons and demand unrealistic ransom, no one can beat the principled USS army, do you get the message?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Realistic, powerful and engrossing","Captain Phillips took me by surprise. I'm not too much into these dramatic takes on real events, so I wasn't really looking forward to this film, to say the least. Sure, reading reviews, I'd seen that it had got some good wraps. That didn't make my anticipation for this film any greater.Fortunately, when I did manage to see this film, I was quite surprised. The writing, acting, camera work, use of score all made this into a really incredible film.The film is centered around the real life story of the hijacking of the American cargo ship, Maersk Alabama, by Somali pirates. We follow the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, an intelligent and quick thinking man, who has to protect his crew from the pirates, led by a man named Muse.In terms of acting, Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi both stole the show. These two men gave performances of a lifetime within Captain Phillips. Hanks is a real, average man here, and whilst watching him, all you see is his character Captain Phillips, and not Hanks himself. He transforms himself into this man, and pulls this performance off perfectly. Abdi is equally as good, if not better. He's menacing in his role as the Somali pirate's leader, yet still human. You can't necessarily look at this man and call him the bad guy, because in reality, he has perfectly legitimate reasons for doing what he's doing.The writing here, like what I just touched on, doesn't allow for characters to be simply black and white. There are no good or bad guys here, all we have are perspectives. This is something not so commonly seen in film nowadays, and I'm happy to see it. The script on the whole is masterfully constructed, and allows for good pacing, which makes this an enjoyable ride.One of the faults I had with this film was the camera work. Whilst there are some amazing shots of the ship and some incredible takes with Hanks and his captors, there are also shots which feel a little too chaotic, a little too shaky. At times, it feels as if Greengrass is shaking the cam simply to remind us that Phillips is still in a state of peril, and we're still in an unpredictable circumstance! These shots are few and far between, luckily, and for the most part, I enjoyed the direction and cinematography.Captain Phillips has it's faults, but for the most part, this film is brilliantly crafted, though not for the faint of heart. It's powerful, emotional and full of real characters, all who are complex and interesting to watch on screen. Certainly a recommendation.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

It's good to report that Captain Phillips sees him back on the top of his game!!The film follows the true story of a cargo ship captained by Richard Phillips through the pirate waters of the Somali coast.

The Vidiot Reviews,"Captain PhillipsThe best part of being a sea captain is getting to preside over all those same-sex marriages between crewmembers.Unfortunately, there won't be any ceremonies aboard the container ship in this thriller.After navigating the Horn of Africa, a US cargo ship is attacked by a Somali pirate (Barkhad Abdi) and his posse.Ordering his crew (David Warshofsky, Michael Chernus, Chris Mulkey, Corey Johnson) into hiding, Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) leads the thieves on a wild goose chase.Eventually, the pirates set adrift in a lifeboat with Phillips as their hostage. But a no-nonsense Navy SEAL (Max Martini) is steadfast they'll never reach the shore.Based on true events, Captain Phillips is an edge-of-your-seat adaptation of the real captain's harrowing account that delivers both credible performances and white-knuckle excitement.Incidentally, to deal with Somali pirates just airdrop a dead Beluga on the ship's bow and let Green Peace loose.

Everything gonna be okay,"""Captain Phillips"" is a biopic of a true piracy story that happened to the captain of the same name. Hats off to Tom Hanks -this was his prequel to Sully and he perhaps fell in love with performing heroes. These real-life heroes are truly better than the marvel heroes. The trauma scene at the end felt so unbelievably real. Along with Hanks, the actors for the Somali pirates were memorable and impactful. I loved that they gave equal screen time to them and truly made them have an impact as a villain of the story. The unfailing optimism (or delusion depending on how you see it) of Muse, his remark on the impossibility of fishing, and the film's brief glimpse into their life before piracy make you wonder if this major crime was their only alternative. Overall, the film brough these pirates to life who could have otherwise been very bland characters.Screenplay was great and tension remained throughout. I enjoyed the camerawork because it actually felt like we are in the middle of the ocean. The opening scene of driving to the airport was short but it was the most efficient method to establish the emotional connection of Captain Phillips to his family. Crew is initially seen as not perfectly disciplined, which also adds tension when the real conflict begins. Although the movie takes place in the vastness of the ocean, it still is mostly confined to the ships themselves and boy they are terrible creatures. I also enjoyed the fact that there was a unidirectional language barrier where the Americans could not pick up any of the Somali and the Somali could understand some English. This classic use of dramatic irony felt very effective in adding more to the confusion and the chaos of a pirate attack.However, due to its nature (movie wouldn't have been made if any tragedy occurred), there was a bit of a lull and predictability during the midpoint of the movie. Regardless, ""Captain Phillips"" was a solid movie and a great addition to the wonders of Hanks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Some people there decided to become pirates and attack merchant ships saying they have the rights to charge them fee (ransom) for using their waters.Completely illegal on international law but totally right on the eyes of the people there who tends to blame the western world for all their problems.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Amazing,"The film's success is due to several reasons. First, directing himself, showing the sequence of events deft cinematic sweep and clarity screenwriter. Greengrass knows how to create a movie, and it makes use of sophisticated high points of the plot without having to be dragged showmanship balance. However, perhaps because of this, the result is very exciting, even if you know how the affair ended. For a long time I was not given so much tension while watching a movie like this.Another reason for the success of the film is the appearance of Tom Hanks, to Captain Phillips ""makes one of the best roles in his long career. This quality is due to acts of restraint that is being conducted throughout most of the film's attempt to connect and ""Captain Phillips"" as a whole is expected to avoid the kind of heroic and commonplaces. Hanks plays the movie guru who does his job. He demonstrates efficacy but also some cold, but it reveals an essential component of professional effectiveness, especially in times of trial. Since Hanks conducted so throughout most of the film, the exposure of humanity and the fragility of the character he plays is so effective. I assumed the role of being the best player not notice the work and effort he invested in them, and to Captain Phillips, ""it's just a good movie, this ability comes from one of the peaks, even when restraint is replaced with emotion erupts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

i held my pee for the entire because i didn't want to miss a second of it,"I knew tom hanks would deliver his role well, but this time he plays his character perfectly; smart, witty, and real. This movie was one of the most realistic movie I've seen. The emotions were real, the intentions were made clear for even teenage viewers can understand, and the acting is superb. The pirates were fiercely intimidating throughout because of their seriousness and lack of fear. The pacing is exquisite. Tom hanks serves his role. He doesn't develop powers or knew martial arts to kick their asses, but relied on hope and his quick thinking. I was pulled into the movie from start to finish. I didn't want to leave.

A Film Bolstered by Two Key Performances,"Director Paul Greengrass has carved out a nice little niche for himself in Hollywood. While occasionally delving into the imaginary trappings of action junkie heaven, the majority of Greengrass's movies are retellings of real life situations. They're movies where action has been imposed on ordinary people instead of the common trope of extraordinary people put in extraordinary situations. They're suspense films that require no suspension of disbelief because they are stories we know. They're uncomfortably topical yet while being as predictable as a Scandal Maker's-type made-for-TV movie, they're also engrossing.It started with his lukewarm freshman project Resurrected (1989) the true story of a British Soldier during the Falkland Islands War. His predilection with real stories and current events continued with Bloody Sunday (2002), United 93 (2006) and Green Zone (2010) all of which had a contemporary feel about complex problems not yet solved at the time of their respective releases.In comes Captain Phillips (2013), based on the harrowing adventure of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and his brush with modern piracy. His journey starts in Oman where he is assigned to deliver cargo to Mombasa. He's aware the horn of Africa is a hotbed for pirate activity and takes every precaution but a scrappy crew of Somali pirates is desperate to make bank and set their sights on his ship, the Maersk Alabama.Even if I promised no spoilers, I'm guessing you as the reader know how it ends; even if you didn't see it on the news in the spring of 2009. Still, the entire movie hinges on your ability to suspend everything from prior knowledge of the incident to prior knowledge of action-movie mayhem and just go with it. I went with it and found the movie to be thrilling and intense. Much like all of Greengrass's movies, the film was a self-contained hyper-reality that showed its audience exactly what we needed to see and nothing more or less. In the words of Joe Friday, the film gives you ""Just the facts ma'am."" The film is buoyed by two remarkably different performers playing remarkably different roles. Tom Hanks is arguably the best actor of our generation playing everything from a gay lawyer with AIDS in Philadelphia (1993) to a wise-cracking party animal in Bachelor Party (1984) to a child's plaything in the Toy Story films (1995-2010). Add to that a charming personality and you've got the closest version of a male Meryl Streep as you're willing to find.In Captain Phillips his heroics didn't come from a special ability or a John McClane-esque capacity to improvise; no his instincts were drilled in him by what looks like years of training. He accepted the reality of pirates approaching his ship and does everything in his power to mitigate whatever damage they're likely to do. Yet what sets the Captain apart from any of Tom Hank's other characters is once he's past the Worst Case Scenario Handbook his mind is always at work yet doesn't know where to go. He's unsure of his actions and tormented at the thought of what the pirates might do to him and his crew. In that sense we see a person who is a hero because he has to be but otherwise is a normal Joe.Barkhad Abdi's performance as the lead pirate Abduwali Muse is a whole other beast. He plays him with scary realism, a down-and-out Somali with a strong need to prove something to the world. His world-weary face, pigeon-toed introverted mannerisms and surprising physical strength underlines a contemplative mind and desperate cunning. In another life, Muse could have had the craven fortitude and industry to become a successful business leader but due to geography he has to pay his dues by ""fishing"". Captain Phillips is Abdi's first full-feature experience acting and joins the ranks of Jennifer Hudson, Julie Andrews and Jaye Davidson as a first time Oscar nominee. Before becoming an overnight sensation, Abdi was no joke, a limo driver with little interest in acting; here's to hoping he follows up Captain Phillips with something worthwhile.As with all Greengrass films, there are some slight third act problems. There's only so much you can do with five men stuck on a lifeboat and Greengrass doesn't have the considerable skills of Hitchcock to keep the energy going. There are some arbitrary images of Seal Team 6 jumping out of an aircraft in darkness and while I understand the principle belligerents in this tale are men couldn't there be more than two female characters? It's a minor sticking point but it's irksome when a talent like Catherine Keener is relegated to one single pointless scene.There are three reasons why you should watch Captain Phillips and they are the names of Tom Hanks, Paul Greengrass and Barkhad Abdi. Abdi's freshman performance is vibrant and uninhibited and brings to mind the intensity of other first timers like Lou Castel in Fists in the Pocket (1965) and more recently Dwight Henry in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012). Paul Greengrass's intense, grabbed from the headlines style has served him well over the past decade and Captain Phillips further raises the bar for the action director. Finally, Tom Hanks once again develops a character so real and genuine that it's hard not to admire the actor who got his start in a little seen horror movie called He Knows You're Alone (1980). And I know I'm not alone in my disappointment that Hanks wasn't nominated this year for his stunning performance in Captain Phillips.https://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gripping,"""Captain Phillips"" is a compelling and remarkable movie making from the opening frame to the very last. The movie is a gripping, dramatic and harrowing true life story about modern-day piracy and understated heroism on the high seas. The drama keeps you literally on the edge of your seat.Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his entire career and deserves an Oscar for his role in this. He was the perfect choice to bring the emotion needed to carry this traumatic experience to life and make you totally believe. The whole cast were phenomenal, the pirates were perfectly cast and delivered impeccable, intense performances The action scenes won't be beaten this year. My only criticism was the annoying shaky cam in the early scenes. Overall, this is the most impressive and well-executed movies of 2013. Awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Would be unbelievable - if it weren't true,"""Captain Phillips"" is the true story if the hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama cargo ship in 2009 by Somali pirates and is based on the the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Phillips himself. It tells the story of the hijacking of the 17000 ton container ship with a crew of 20 by just 4 Somali pirates in a skiff and the subsequent dramatic rescue of the kidnapped Captain by the US Navy. It was the first hijacking of an American ship for over 200 years. If it were not all true it would be hard to believe and could look like a typical American film with an unlikely plot where the US military come to the rescue and all ends happily. However, the fact that this is a true story and the excellent directing by British director Paul GreenGrass (of Bourne Ultimatum and United 93 fame) make this a film that is definitely worth watching. Add to this some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Captain Richard Phillips and newcomer Barkhad Abdi as ""Muse"" the leader of the Somali pirates.I was amazed that 4 poorly equipped pirates in a small boat could so easily board and take such a large ship. The ship was equipped only with water hoses to fend off the pirates and also used flares. I was amazed that given the known threat that the crew were not armed as with suitable weapons it would have been easy to deter the pirates. Only on subsequent research did I discover that at that time Insurance companies did not like cargo ship crews being armed as it led to a greater perceived liability - however now most such ships do hire private armed security teams. On first impression the rescue finale by Navy SEALS would also seem like typical American nonsense - but check it out - it is true - it is actually what happened and how the crisis was actually brought to a close. What makes this film better than average is the excellent directing where the Captain is portrayed as an ordinary man - not a hero. The interplay between the Captain and Muse is superbly done. Muse is not your typical baddie either - it is clear that his (and his associates) are driven to this way of life. He calls the Captain ""Irish"" after he reveals he is American Irish and there is an excellent line where Phillips says to Muse ""There's got to be something other than being a fisherman or kidnapping people?"" to which Muse replies ""Maybe in America, Irish, maybe in America"". This sums up the disparity between the lives of the Captain and his crew and the Somali pirates.I am not always a fan of Tom Hanks but there is no doubt that he is a fine actor and this is one of his best performances. And credit must go to Barkhad Abdi in his first film and being nominated for best actor in a supporting role. The US Navy is very impressive but not overplayed in the normal heroic form but rather as an effective and coordinated force. Apparently it is a requirement of the US military that if they take part in a film then they are portrayed in a positive manner so perhaps Greengrass was a little limited in how he could portray their role. The finale is very dramatic and the effectiveness of the seals cannot be understated. However, what we see if an effective disciplined force and not the usual gung-ho nonsense we see in many US films. I believe that many of the Navy roles were actually played by actual Navy personnel.One issue is that it does not make it clear that Captain Phillips may not have been as good as he was portrayed as he had apparently ignored directives to keep at least 600 miles from the Somali coast and was just 250 miles out when hijacked. One of the crew member subsequently brought a legal case against the Captain. But again, given that Greengrass using the Captain's own account of the hijacking to base the film then it is understandable that this fact was avoided. Overall I would recommend this film for some fine acting and well directed drama. The plot would be full of holes if it were not all true so there is little negative that can be said there.After the hijacking Muse was taken to the US and tried for piracy where he is now serving a 33 year sentence. All 4 of the pirates were between 17 and 19 years old.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A brilliant flick!,"""Captain Phillips"" is based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips. Who was taken hostage when an act of piracy on his ship, in the middle of the Indian Ocean, didn't go exactly to plan.The true story in itself, is interesting. But when you look at some of the people who are involved in the movie. You Will understand why it has turned out so great.Tom Hanks gives yet another amazing performance, in a movie that's full off them (If you don't believe me, at least wait till you've seen him in the last 15 minutes or so) Plus the First time actors playing the pirates are all great too. Being genuinely menacing looking, and also believable in their parts.These guys all bring to life what is an engrossing, edge of your seat kind of movie. Some have complained that it tweaks the truth a bit about what actually happened. But from what I've read since. I think I saw bits of the film touch on a bit of everything that was relevant. Its a brilliant flick either way. Another one that almost makes up for all the rubbish I had to sit through during the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Tom Hanks gave an excellent performance, except for his accent which drifted around throughout the movie. His performance in the final 10 minutes of the movie is just incredible.As the writer J.

A movie that is well worth the price of admission,"I'm sure Tom Hanks will be up for an Oscar with this role. But man I'm telling you that capt of the pirates deserve an Oscar or at least a Oscar nominee for best supporting role or something. I've never seen him before until this movie but I'm telling you he really is the reason this movie is like a fun roller coaster. Hanks is brilliant as well and his character play in the last 15 minutes is sure to make you jerk/hide a tear. Just a great movie through out and if you are about to have a movie date or outing and you are looking for a movie that is worth admission this is the one without question. One that will get off to a suspenseful start pretty much 10 minutes into the movie, and from there will just lure you in more and more with action, suspense, and drama. And occasionally or maybe I should say about 5 or 6 times the entire movie you will chuckle at what really is not meant to be comedy it just comes out that way given how the characters appear. But trust me this movie does not in anyway need to be funny to sustain its high level of suspense action and drama. It is just fine with all it offers.

You can really feel the emotion and mental stress that real people would be in, in that situation. Really great acting, and not just from Tom Hanks.

Great movie,"(Note: There are two very slight ""spoilers"" herein but not at all able to spoil your enjoyment of the film, maybe just the opposite).I just don't get it why in the IMDb.com quotes from the movie they missed the best one:CAPTAIN to Pirate: ""Kenny, what do we have in the safe?...Thirty thousand dollars? ... In the safe we have thirty thousand dollars. It's yours.""PIRATE: ""Thirty thousand dollars? What am I? Do I look like a beggar?!""When you watch the movie you will know why this is the best quote.In summary: they rarely make movies of quality like this anymore. Fast paced, well acted (impressive work by the Somali actors!), good camera work, no unnecessary F-words, not one.It is over two hours but you will not notice how the time has passed. This is not some cheesy Hollywoodish made up hostage movie. It is based on a true story. The film is impartial, yet kind, in telling a story where one can even feel empathy for the pirates, the human side of their misery bringing misery to others by attacking ships and their crews. Yet, not for a second the over-the-top, annoying preachy leftism, so typical for Hollywood flicks.Another question that I kept not finding an answer to was why are these crews unarmed when they cruise in such dangerous waters? Could not come up with any really reasonable answer.Highly recommend it. You will not be sorry to have watched this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A truly boring story,"What's the point? Shooting a personal monument to Captain Phillips? The story is really not worth a movie. Actually Somali pirates are not a very interesting antagonist group in terms of action, but the movie does depict that well. A bit too well when comes the final part and the U.S. of A. unleashes hell to handle the situation.Maybe one can appreciate that it is not a dumb Hollywood actioneer with cliché bad guys kicking everything around until the empire strikes back. But what difference does it make in the end when the Navy firepower comes into play? True story may be gripping. I'd say they are when it is more about character than about action. Here in Captain Phillips - as in United 93 - it is about action and true to life action is somewhat weak. Honesty never was a prerequisite for a good movie, but I guess Paul Greengrass's talent has been wasted on the false perception that his ability to shoot action sequences was rooted in an efficient 'honest-documentary-style' approach. On the other hand I guess Greengrass himself is attracted to real-life characters which unfortunately lead to weaker all-around action than with a movie-calibrated hero.I hope Greengrass finds a hero with substance who also happens to be caught in a vortex of action. In a nutshell: some Jason Bourne with a memory and a conscience.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Absolutely speechless,"Yet again Tom Hanks delivers best performance of the year. The movie is inspired on true events and that's where this guy aces on his performance. He has got innate acting skills which makes the script mend easily and deliver a award-winning performance. The most significant factor in this movie is its realistic approach and no sloppy violence or blood shed. Just the right amount of everything necessary for the script.From the start to the end the movie has the grip on the audience and one would expect some kind of heroism just for those kind of audience, but the director does seem to be pretty confident with the screenplay that he just lets it talking and actors are merely placed in the right places at the right time.With some racy action sequences and troubling music the movie would have been a commercial entertainer but none of that is added and so forth maintaining the original flavor of the bitter episode in real life.You don't have to be a Tom Hanks' fan to watch this movie, but i am sure at the end of the movie you might just become his ardent follower. Much said about the hero of this epic, the villains sure make a important contribution to this ordeal. If not for their serious looks and sharp dialogues the movie wouldn't be such a huge success.

"Thanks for nothing, Siad Barre!","Paul Greengrass's ""Captain Phillips"" emphasizes the battle of wits between the title character (Tom Hanks) and the Somali raiders. The movie makes clear that the raiders aren't evil people; living in an impoverished, war-torn country, they get forced to work for a local warlord. As main raider Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi) reminds Phillips, the opportunities in Somalia aren't the same as the ones in the US. Siad Barre's destruction of the country's economy and foreign countries' fishing in Somali waters didn't help matters.If Abdi becomes the first Somali to win an Oscar, then he'll deserve it. He shows Muse as a desperate man, seeing Phillips only as an agent of Somalia's impoverishment. I recommend the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Hard to review because, it's so factually wrong!","I usually give very low scores to films that are intentionally misleading. But I can't with this one because it is very well done and Hanks and Abdi really do a great job, especially Abdi, he was cast for a number of good reasons, one is for authenticity, something that Hollywood blockbusters fail at miserably.I also give this move a bit of break because of how the piracy problem of the coast of Somalia was presented...very black and white, and yes that a pun. The reality of the situation is quite strikingly different. And for me this is rather offensive to discredit the plight of the Somali people and to show captain Phillips in a good light. Phillips was very self-interested trying to make a bonus at the cost of the entire crew, and the company that owned the boat encouraged zPhillips' decision to avoid dangerous waters...how about that for a truth bomb?You can look up the facts on your own, but if the same was done by other nations of the coast of America, I promise you that there would be a serious reaction and the Coast Guard and the NAVY would get involved immediately. But since Somalia has no NAVY or an ability to have an weight in negotiations with the EU members, the Western World just crapped all over the poorest and most defenseless country in Africa...or close to it.So, I don't appreciate create a case of heroism in this film, where it was mostly self-interest, negligence, and completely no information given about the politics which created this dangerous situation.Lastly, I'm not defending the pirates themselves, I don't know anything about them, and I'm sure to do pirate work you have to be a morally compromised person...at best.

"Not up to par with ""A Hijacking""","With favourable reviews, buzz from friends, a fine lead actor and director, I may have fallen victim to high expectations for this one, but in many aspects this under-delivered.Firstly, a year before, Tobias Lindholm's ""A Hijacking (2012)"" did a much better film on the subject. The Danish drama had better tension, storytelling and all around acting. It also capitalized on the situation back in Denmark, not only on the boat to give it a real multi-layered, multi-prong approached that worked.Secondly, the running time doesn't work for me, as there is a considerable time focused on the US assault team planning to attack the highjakers while the core subjects of the film (the captain, crew and hijakers) lose focus. It is also too Hollywood American gun-ho a la ""Zero Dark Thirty (2012)"". Time and pace was much tighter in ""A Hijaking"" at 103 mins or even Greengrass' better film ""United 93 (2006)"" at 111 mins vs this longish 134 mins. So the beginning and middle of ""Captain Philipps"" were engaging enough, but I could have cut down 15-25 mins easily and even take more time in the epilogue if any thing. Not sure why this movie was nominated for editing or even best adapted screenplay, especially when ""Prisoners (2013)"" only got a cinematography nod.Thirdly, I just saw ""Cast Away (2000)"" again and Tom Hanks' talent is mostly unutilized here comparing to his skill and range. The only redeeming feature of ""Captain Phillips"" that saves it from average is the incredible scene with the nurse when he is in shock. That scene alone is almost worth the hit-and-miss movie, but it doesn't quite save it either.I am not sure why this movie is so well received and regarded, but I dare anyone to compare it to ""A Hijacking"" and still find it better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A detailed and realistic hijack-survival film I've ever seen,"Based on the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Richard Phillips, the film Captain Phillips tells the story of MV Maersk Alabama hijacking incident, which involves the captain's capture and hostage-taking by four Somali pirates in April 2009.Although the film may be inaccurate (some of the crew members of the ship accused the film of being inaccurate in facts and does not tell the true story), but it's the most detailed and realistic hijack-survival films I've ever seen. The film successfully shows the constant struggle for survival in a life-or-death situation.As usual, Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances in this film, after realizing that the pirates are just poor and desperate Somali fishermen, he feels despair of his failure to convince them to surrender after knowing the inevitable fate awaiting his captors. In the emotional final scene, I find myself in tears during Hanks' powerful portrayal of a man experiencing post-traumatic stress.However, the story is predictable, progressively slow and takes some time to build up to its climax. The details of the hijacking and subsequent hostage taking feels overly long and might put off a lot of audience. The shaky-cam technique, which is typically used in most Paul Greengrass' films in an attempt to make the film more realistic doesn't help much...even making it worst at times and hurt the film.Overall, it's not the greatest drama film ever made, but it's worth a watch to those who want a realistic, detailed, emotional drama which is 'based on a true story' (we can never know how true it is, are we?). It's not for those who seeks simple hardcore Hollywood action entertainment (otherwise you'll be disappointed).",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Captain Phillips"" is tense, incredible, and worth seeing!","WOW.The only word we can think of to describe this film is gripping. To be honest, we didn't really remember how the situation with Captain Phillips and the Somalian pirates played out in real life. This was only a few short years ago, but how quickly we forget.Regardless, we were on the edge of our seats watching this tense drama being played out on the big screen. Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips was marvelous, as always, but the true show-stealer was Barkhad Abdi, portraying the pirate Muse. You truly feel for his character throughout the film, who at one point proudly exclaims that he has hijacked expensive ships successfully in the past; it's obvious that he still lives in a rundown dirt-floored home in Somalia with no bed and no riches. This movie really makes viewers sympathize with not only the kidnapped Captain Phillips, but with the perpetrating pirates as well. We understand their role as villains and though we don't ever root for them, we know that they are also victims in some way.It's actors like Tom Hanks that keep us interested and excited to watch movies each and every week. You really believe him as the characters he plays, and you feel like he has the best intentions at heart for every role. He is so, so good. He is captivating to watch in this, well, in each and every movie, really.This will be one of the best movies of the year and we won't be surprised if it garner multiple Oscar nominations.-Lolo Loves Films (lololovesfilms.blogspot.com)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A U.S cargo ship is hijacked by ruthless Somali pirates, taking the captain hostage","Tom Hanks embarks on a tense hostage-captor battle with Somali pirates. Enough said. That sentence summarizes the epic proportions this 'based off a true story' movie has. However, due to the intricate substance of this movie, it requires some more elaboration. Tom Hanks stars in his most thrilling role yet as Captain Richard Phillips. He is a captain for the cargo ship the Maersk Alabama heading to Mombasa. The film's realism is what really captures the essence of this amazing true story. The ship used in the film is identical to the real Maersk Alabama, which gives it an authentic and genuine feel.To top that off, this film was actually shot on the open water, no studio set was used. You can't get more authentic then that. Bravo to director Paul Greengrass and the cast for taking on such an arduous task. This film relies on several close up shots of the actors, which intensifies key moments in the plot that again contribute to the realism of the film. Hank's accent in the film wavers a little bit, which is usually common for actors. The Somali pirates pulled off a wicked performance as merciless pirates who stop at nothing to get what they want. The Somali pirate captain, who was played by Barkhad Abdi,gave an 'edge of your seat' performance. He gave a lot of depth to his character. It is a 100% guarantee your heart will be racing during this film. Fast paced, high intensity and overall insanely epic.The bonus features on the DVD version of this film offers you an inside-look into the story of Captain Phillips by none other than the real Captain Richard Phillips! If you are a fan of dramatic true stories and love Tom Hanks, this is definitely a film for you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Too long, too predictable","The excellent Paul Greengrass comes back 3 years after his lukewarm Green Zone, and still, the expectations for Captain Philips are as high as the English's reputation, who directed some of the best action movies ever.He is a master at delivering incredibly captivating and most importantly ultra dynamic movies, but paradoxically, this is where the problem lies in for this one.The beginning is suspenseful, but as soon as the captain is abducted into the lifeboat, the rhythm drops badly, the script becomes very redundant, and the only thing you're wishing for is the movie to finish especially as the final outcome / it is totally predictable.The film suffers from no real flaw but you can't help but feel a bit disappointed and be under the impression you just saw a longer, less suspenseful, less good maritime version of United 93.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Lol his crew didn't die,"Posted by JakeThe movie was pretty interesting, however the lack of inhumane violence really upset me. I was kind of hoping this would be a Chernobyl Diaries (My favorite movie) style film, however I was pretty disappointed by that. However, the rest of the film was pretty interesting. I do like Greensgrass's style, I was a huge fan of his work in Barca, which in my opinion is his best movie (And the only other one I saw). In all honesty, I would say this movie didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it is still a pretty solid film (Or liquid, cause, you know, water, and the film takes place on water, and, you know...)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"The script has a couple of issues, but it's still good.","I did like this movie, I suppose. It's pretty well acted, VERY well directed, and I really liked that we get some brief moments of sympathy with our antagonists. The introductory scene showing the Somalian's way of life right after we're shown our main American character's: clever. Some throwaway lines here and there makes you realize what our protagonist is going through is what these people go through on a daily basis and I applaud this movie for humanizing terrorists instead of making them evil for the sake of being evil. AND begin subtle about it. That's not something you see every day in a Hollywood movie.Now, I do have some problems with the script... The story needs the protagonist to be an incompetent genre-blind idiot. Otherwise, HOW THE HELL WOULD 4 PIRATES ON A MOTORBOAT YOU CLEARLY SAW COMING TAKE OVER A CARGO SHIP? You mean to tell me that an American crew, American, you know, the kind of people that would blow up their own buildings as an excuse to justify blowing up other countries, HAVE NO GUNS WHATSOEVER? Knowing that getting attacked by terrorists was a possibility in Somalian waters?And then we have an opportunity to make a hostage exchange and the captain is not smart enough to realize that these people aren't satisfied with 30000 dollars and will try to kidnap someone, so he just jumps into the freaking boat WHILE THEY STILL HAVE LEVERAGE like a moron? If you're dumb enough to fall for that, sir, you DESERVE it.And finally, TWO army ships, with an operation involving at least 70 people and all sorts of fancy military tech, just to rescue ONE GUY? It's not like he's a diplomat or a minister or anyone important, just some guy. Are you kidding me? Children die by thousands in Africa, women all over the world are being kidnapped for human trafficking but we need 70 trained professionals and at least 100000 dollars in fuel and equipment just to take one guy back from some terrorists because he was dumb enough to get caught, against all odds. Oh that's right. Because he's white and American, people care.Again, it isn't a bad film, far from it, but the script needs our main character to be an idiot and the US army to be willing to spend a small fortune to get said idiot back, otherwise the film would end when people did the sensible thing and just didn't let the Somalians board the ship to begin with. It kept bothering me and ruined the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Don't see this if you like your knuckles!,"With 'Captain Phillips', Paul Greengrass does what he clearly does best, bringing to life the events surrounding the hijacking of the Mearsk Alabama in 2009. As with all true stories, the question often asked is how close to reality are the events on screen. When it comes to this film, in terms of specifics, this is going to be a hard question to answer; there is a law suit ongoing and there seem to be some questions surrounding the supposed heroism, or lack thereof, of certain people involved.It is good, then, that Greengrass has not made a film that feels like it's going for the truth, but rather a balls-to-the-wall thriller which happens to be inspired by true events. Setting up from the outset with an approach that is immediately Greengrass, we see the titular Captian and the Somali pirates preparing for their respective jobs, and the word ""jobs"" is key here, on both sides. The approach begins a motif, which returns at various points through the following two hours, of a mirroring of circumstances; as the film moves on, we see more and more that both Captain Phillips and Muse, the pirate leader, are victims of a wider issue, neither man much in control of anything. Much has been made of this humanising of the ""bad guys"", and whilst it is true, it is also fair to say that Greengrass never pushes the point to the extent that we feel forced to sympathise specifically with them. Rather, and more importantly, we are encouraged to consider, along with Phillips, how and why these emaciated men are driven to commit such crime, and how such a sad state of affairs is allowed.Perhaps it may have been beneficial for the film to have explored the globalisation issues a little more, and it features a soundtrack which, whilst effective, does come across, at times, like a lazy rip-off of Hans Zimmer. That said, if it wasn't for the trademark voice of a director with whom we are now quite familiar thanks to the 'Bourne' sequels, we could be easily forgiven for thinking this is Ron ""Apollo 13"" Howard at his absolute must-see best. The performances from the pirates (first time actors) seem unabashed by Hanks' presence, and in fact the reality that they never met before filming only creates a more palpable sense of fear and confusion. Indeed, Barkhad Abdi does not seem to be acting, it is more like he has just wandered into the film; he plays Phillips' equal and opposite with an apparently unshaken conviction. As for Tom Hanks? This is his most impressive performance since 'Road to Perdition', a film which itself let us see a side of Mr Hanks we hadn't seen before. From the moment he steps aboard the ship and begins running drills, we are sold; Hanks disappears and the stern Captain Phillips emerges. From here, the performance becomes increasingly compelling; this man can do so much with so little and it seems effortless, which so often results in us forgetting it is a performance. Here, the gradual breakdown of a proud and pragmatic man is perfectly pitched throughout, and the final scene sees the actor do something quite incredible, finding a gut-wrenching truth and hitting notes I don't think I've ever seen him hit so perfectly before. Yes, Hanks reminds us, at a time when perhaps we needed reminding, of why he is one of the greatest actors alive. Let's be honest, we do tend to forget.Greengrass makes the wise choices to never get melodramatic and to never leave the action, which never really lets up; events just keep escalating. From an early scene of pirates boarding the vessel, to a final act that makes the last half hour of 'Zero Dark Thirty' look fairly amateur, you frequently remind yourself that this must have been a logistical nightmare to shoot; the fact it has come out looking so great and edited so well is testament to a very controlled film maker. On nearly every level, 'Captain Phillips' is most certainly one of the films of the year. It is shot with energy, it is perfectly paced,with a knuckle-chewing level of intensity which rarely wanes. It is hard to recall the last time I was this completely engaged and ""with a character""; I WAS that guy in the bathtub at the end of 'The Truman Show'! As well as the full throttle thrills, it offers a tragic human drama that leaves you some food for thought.It may prove questionable as a documentary of fact, but as a thriller it is one of the best we will see for some time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A perfect pairing of director and actor makes for smooth and suspenseful sailing,"Tom Hanks, it's good to have you in the captain's chair.The two-time Oscar winner hadn't quite found his footing since turning 50, but ""Captain Phillips"" proves that with the right role, there aren't many actors you'd rather have playing the good guy. This titular role lets Hanks' average joe qualities shine, not to mention his strength of presence and demeanor.Captain Richard Phillips is a cargo freighter captain with a no-nonsense attitude. While maneuvering the Maersk Alabama down the coast of Africa, two small boats of Somali pirates show up on radar, and despite everything Phillips does to shake them, one of the boats, led by the utterly determined Muse (Barkhad Abdi), manages to get on board.Seeing as it's based on a real-life 2009 hijacking, ""Phillips"" could have no better director than Paul Greengrass. Here's a filmmaker that made ""United 93"" an emotional, captivating and suspenseful at a time when everyone felt a September 11 movie was too soon. Again, Greengrass brings that palm-sweating play-by-play account that keeps the audience on edge despite a known outcome. Even if you don't know how the story ends, you know the ship gets boarded from the trailers, and even that first set of sequences remains totally gripping. And it's real-life suspense; very little of what Greengrass does manufactures tension in a Hollywood-like way.Billy Ray's adaptation of the real Phillips' book also doesn't overstep at all. There are a couple Hollywood moments, and some scenes in which Hanks and Abdi frame the events with some food-for-thought dialogue, but ""Captain Phillips"" feels especially down to earth. Even the way the film depicts the Navy doesn't glorify what they do very much.Narratively, ""Phillips"" is a straight line with an upward trajectory and maybe two lulls in the tension. There is no trickery or plot twists, but we remain blind to just how the events will unfold, analyzing who has the leverage in this hostage crisis at every turn. So simple and straightforward, yet so captivating.Hanks does in fact give his best performance in years, though the role is tailored perfectly to his strengths. Phillips is an unsung hero who with courage and resolve attempts to do whatever he can to manage the situation, including making some risky, dumb moves. He doesn't just flip his bravery switch and he flinches time to time. Hanks does this kind of humanity effortlessly.""Captain Phillips"" sticks mostly to a suspenseful retelling, but Ray's script doesn't lose sight of the value of this story. Most films of this nature are content to leave the ""foreign aggressors"" faceless and nameless, but their conflict, their objectives, their feelings are a significant part of the film. This isn't a piracy situation for the sake of an entertaining plot, there is a motive here; real Somalis did this because it's what they felt they had to do.Rarely do non-fiction and suspenseful entertainment cross paths, yet Greengrass usually finds them both in his crosshairs. ""Captain Phillips"" proves once more that history and current events don't have to be boring while giving Hanks the vehicle he deserved.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Damn The Terrorists, Full Speed Ahead!","I watched this movie against the advice of a few friends who work in Maritime occupations.

Captain Phillips is on route...most of the time,"There are moments in Captain Phillips that are truly suspenseful. When the Somali pirates board the ship for the first time is edge of your seat like tension. There are many moments like that that showcase Director Paul Greengrass's ability to create tension effectively. The Somali pirates are truly terrifying, even after learning that they aren't that experienced hijacking ships and kidnapping captains, in fact it makes them all the more frighting because they don't play by the book.Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips is gripping to say the least, the fact they haven't tried to make him John McClane in Die Hard on a boat helps us to relate to him as a human being face with a life or death situation. Hanks manages to convey a sense of cunning, trying to out- smart the pirates, and fear, when he knows he's out of his depth and simply gives in for a few moments. Its this back and forth nature that makes us root for Captain Phillips when he's winning and when he's almost admitted defeat.Its sad then, that Captain Phillips simply vars in to unnecessary boredom a couple of times throughout the film. This is caused by Greengrass simply holding on to the tension of the scene to long and giving us no relief. Understandably, this is supposed to be s non stop, intense film, but with no relief we simply start to not care, the tension simply withers away because you aren't moving the scene forward. I feel the 2 hour and 18 minute runtime could have been trimmed down to 2 hours because of the amount of times Greengrass does go past the breaking point.Overall, Captain Phillips is a fantastic film. Greengrass does jump the shark, trying to squeeze as much tension from a scene as possible, many times throughout the film. But Tom Hanks gives such a realistic portrayal of a man faced with impossible odds and the fact that the film is tense and thrilling for the most part. Captain Phillips manages to work on so many levels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

There are no balloons and fireworks for every victory in real life! Tom Hanks really outdid himself with this one.

An intense adventure,"Paul Greengrass, known for ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and for ""United 93"" brings us a really intense thriller about the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US- flagged MV Maersk Alabama. With a really intense atmosphere and a powerful story, ""Captain Phillips"" it's definitely a must-see for everyone. Another excellent movie that after grabbing your attention, will leave you speechless until the credits role.With ""Captain Phillips"", Paul Greengrass manages to provide the same intensity level of ""United 93"" adding a much more powerful story. Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi have done terrific jobs by interpreting really difficult characters. It's impossible not to feel moved with Tom Hanks performance as Captain Richard Phillips. The other three actors that portrayed the pirates that hijacked the ship, have also made really remarkable performances, giving a sense of realism to the movie I was not expecting to see.This adaptation of the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" by Captain Richard Phillips himself will therefore bring you some really strong emotions and feelings.So if you want to watch a movie with a powerful and remarkable story with brilliant performances and intense action sequences and experience this realistic adventure that will get your attention right from the beginning, ""Captain Phillips"" it's my suggestion for you.

I can't believe I waited so long to watch this,"First let me say that I really like Tom Hanks as an actor. He is, I believe, one of the small band of actors whom I've never seen turn in a bad performance.Now the film, based on true events. This film is SO much better than so many other films that have been raved about recently (I'm talking about you, Black Panther!). As others have commented there is documentary-style ""shaky"" hand-held camera work which - if done badly - can be bloody annoying but which works really well here. It helps to build and maintain the tension. Even if you know the story, which I was aware of but didn't know the details, the direction and camera work help to suspend disbelief and draw you in, maintaining the suspense (but is not overdone).Tom Hanks, as always, turns in a solid performance, ably supported by the rest of the cast, especially Barkhad Abdi, whom I remember from ""Eye in the Sky"" (if you haven't seen this film, watch it).There were a couple of scenes that rang so true when trying to contact officialdom: the first time the ship tries to contact the US Emergency Maritime Response number only to get no answer; and when Hanks get through to the UK Emergency Maritime response number he is told by someone sitting safely at a terminal that ""they are probably just fishermen""!!?!I looked up about the real hijacking after watching this film and found that the US government despatched 3 warships, a P3 Orion and a SEAL team to rescue ONE American citizen. One thing I found depressing about this is the knowledge that if Richard Phillips had been British the UK government would not have taken any active measures to rescue him. My government would not have used any Naval or Military forces because bleeding-heart liberal lawyers would argue that the possibility the pirates might get shot would infringe their Human Rights; and the Foreign Office would - at most - have sent the pirates a note saying ""You've been very naughty, now please can we have our citizen back"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

An ordinary movie with Extraordinary acting..,"I am a die-hard fan of Tom Hanks. So i was planning to watch this movie for last 2 weeks. I had to skip my office to watch this one and i was not disappointed.It is always difficult to make a movie on true incidents because there is very less freedom a director can take. This one is no exception. But It was the Paul Greengrass's direction and Billy Ray's screenplay which makes it possible to convert it in an interesting movie.It is a story of Captain Phillips, Captain of a cargo ship , navigating it through the horn of Africa. As a Captain he is well aware of the dangers of these waters. And he was not wrong.This movie starts like a normal Hollywood movie. In starting it's a bit slow pacing. The Background sounds, camera angles, military operation scenes are very ordinary and we have seen them in many crisis movies. But the acting of Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi makes all the difference.Tom Hanks is, as always, extraordinary. His acting is so natural that we forgets Tom Hanks... and only remember the Captain throughout the movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie are awesome. We can feel the inner-self of the caption and that is certainly because of Tom Hanks. As a pirate's group leader Barkhad Abdi has done a great job.In all other departments the movie is an ordinary Hollywood movie.

"Enthralling, nerve-racking and affecting all at once.","Carving out a one-for-me (United 93, Bloody Sunday), one-for-them (Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum) directing career over the last decade, Paul Greengrass has never failed to meet audience expectation, whether with his refreshingly inventive action fare or nail-biting dramatic pictures. Captain Phillips doesn't buck that trend. Narratively both compelling and nerve- racking, the (based on a true) story of what Richard Phillips went through when the freight ship he was captaining was boarded by Somali pirates is one you won't soon forget. Knowing the outcome prior to viewing won't affect the impact of Greengrass' movie; his heightened filming style, the unshakeable performances and the masterful score from Henry Jackman imbue Captain Phillips with edge-of-the-seat tension and emotional wallop. Tom Hanks delivers his best work since 2002's Road to Perdition - he's utterly gut-wrenching in the final scene - and he's given remarkable support by newcomer (and non-actor) Barkhad Abdi as the all-too-human leader of the pirates who, although committing despicable crimes, never turns into a monster. When Hanks and Abdi share the screen it's electric; the Hollywood heavyweight and a complete unknown craft out one of the year's most enthralling and combustible yin and yang relationships.

Engaging and tense with very good acting,"Tom Hanks carries this movie. I don't know how, I think it's his humanity. He's vulnerable but not weak, clever but makes mistakes, professional but afraid and he takes risks. His life doesn't seem exciting but it seems real. He doesn't want to die, he doesn't want his ship to get taken over or stolen from. We see the struggle between his rationality and emotions. He's in most scenes and makes them worthwhile. Gives us a lens to see them through, or something like that.I was worried the movie might be boring, the same old formula I've seen too many times. A tense hostage situation, culture clashes, people crying and shouting and arguing, making dumb decisions, jumping between extreme emotional states. Why do we even watch this kind of stuff? And the whole thing's on a boat? How is that going to be entertaining for a whole movie? Well, somehow it works pretty well. I think mainly because it feels completely real and it's sincere. No phony emotions or speeches or moments. It's generally quite exciting because the stakes are high but there are so many different possible outcomes. You don't know where the film is going or how it will turn out. The situation changes over time. There's often good news and bad news.Was Captain Phillips reckless for going through areas known for the presence of Somali pirates? Maybe, I don't really know. It does seem unnecessarily risky. Is the movie about his braveness or toughness, his ability to survive? I'm not sure. I think it's more about the experience itself. It's an intense ride that doesn't stop. Sometimes scary, sometimes more calm. It gives a new context to your regular life. Shows what you're made of, brings out a different side of you. Maybe you'll like what you'll see and maybe you won't. You might not have known you had that inner strength. You might have deep regrets about what you did on that fateful day.The final scenes are the most powerful, after things have been ""resolved"". We finally get a break from the highly strung events of the past couple of hours. We start to see it all in context, the reality of it, that it wasn't a dream or a nightmare. We realise how intense it all was. I often find I sweat more after I stop exercising. Similarly, it seems the shock only really hits the characters after the events of this movie are over.The camera work does it's job and isn't distracting. There is no preaching or forcing of us as to what to think or feel. The focus is on characters, choices, arguments, escalating tension, hidden motivations, lies and attempts to uncover them. The 4 pirates are all new actors and they do incredibly well. They're just people but they're edgy. They are certainly human but perhaps from a casually violent background that is difficult to comprehend and understand.Anyway, the movie achieves what it sets out to do.

Top class acting from Tom and Barkhad,Gripping and immense acting from the lead cast. Has you at the edge of the seat almost all the way through . Only doesn't get a 10/10 because in a few places the screenplay and directing sunk to Hollywood cliches. The film could also have been a bit more profound and meaningful by leaning a bit more towards the Somalians side of the story as opposed to how almighty the US navy is.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Terrible Shooting Job & Effects,"I am sure many will dislike me for rating this movie 1 star. I wish there is a minus; if there is, I would have given minus rating. I love Tom Hanks, I have enjoyed his movies for many years. The problem here is not the actors; they did a great job. The problem here is not the story line, I read the story line and I enjoy this kind of movie (especially when it's based on true story) but I have to say that a story is only as good as how it is shot when it comes to movie-making. I don't know how to make movies; I don't know how to handle a camera; but I don't think the person shooting this movie knows how to handle a camera, either. Movies are designed to be watched by human eyes; this movie is extremely shaky and my eyes can't seem to handle it. I stopped at minute 51 and I have no intention to continue watching this movie despite the fact that I love the story line. I don't have any intention of getting a vertigo after watching this or eye problem. People like us who do a day job sitting in front of a computer screen wish to have something enjoyable when we reach home to enjoy our evening watching a good movie. The way this movie was shot is worsening my eyes & head after long day staring at screen. I just wished the people in charge of the camera and effects did their job the way it is supposed to be.

Captain Philips Review,This was a really good film. There may be a lot of talking but the action makes up for the talking. I like how they show where the pirates come from and how they live. It makes one feel sympathy for the actions the pirates are committing. I like the actors they chose to represent all the main characters. Something that I felt was very overkill was how many american soldiers they needed for one little boat.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent: 9.5,"It seems that director Paul Greengrass has a singular gift that hugely benefits his decision to stay exclusive to the thriller genre. That is that he uses a shaky-cam style of cinematography with traditional cameras to create the illusion that Hollywood (and by extension, us) is there in the middle of the events. It draws you inextricably into the film, almost making you part of it. It's a trick that has never failed him. But what makes Captain Phillips such an extraordinary thriller is how much attention is paid to the villains. Newcomer Barkhad Adbi delivers a great performance as Muse, the leader of the pirates. He is shown as being out of his depth, and once the hijacking of the ship goes awry, he is not angry, but afraid. There are those back home who would see him dead if he returns anything less than filthy rich. So when Phillips offers him the entirety of cash on the ship ($30,000), Muse knows why that is insufficent. This leads to a relentlessly intense film that escalates to a standoff between a small US Navy fleet and the four pirates in a lifeboat. It is the best thriller to be released in years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I think the tagline for this movie should definitely should have been CAPTAIN PHILLIPS: Everything going' be OK.,"So Captain Phillips is based of a true story of a man called Richard Phillips whose cargo ship he was on was boarded by Somali pirates and bad things happen. Now to start off with this film has an epic feel of realism too it; the shots and atmosphere of this film are just very real, it shows you engines of the giant ship humming which if you've been on a big ship you know you hear it or just the small rooms or the general feel of being out at sea. What I noticed as well, which I think added to the realism a lot was there wasn't much background music, at the beginning, and at the end and some other scenes it was just sound effects and dialogue which was really good. That just added to the amazing story this film documents of Captain Phillips and his run in with these four pirates - what I wasn't expecting is them to show a bit of back story to the pirates, it showed them right at the beginning in Africa and a glimpse of what their life is and what is generally what they do for work and why; not really in that kind of ""these are also good guys too"" way but it shows how everything happens. Now the whole film is 2 and a quarter hours so there are some slow bits in the middle but it still captivates you and the end of this film, wow, I heard it was one of Tom Hanks' best performances to date and I'd say so too. The final act of Captain Phillips is extremely intense and had my heart pumping for sure which rarely happens. So in the end this was a powerful film based on a true story and I give it the rating of 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Very Good Fictional Movie,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film. The lack of a soundtrack was surprisingly great and made the movie feel more realistic. Also the usage of moving cameras which gave a great feeling like you were there.It's a shame that after reading more about the movie it seems that most of the movie is fake - but that is to be expected in Hollywood I guess. They did a good job of making a gripping movie which felt realistic.I have to say though that up until the hijacking, the acting felt a bit forced. Even Tom Hanks wasn't convincing - especially before they get on the boat. (Maybe this was partially clouded by my knowledge of Tom Hank's other movies.)The parts with the US Navy thought are unbelievable.Message of the movie: Don't mess with Uncle Sam.I highly recommend seeing this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Another Tom Hanks Triumph,"As a rule of thumb, I'll see pretty much anything Tom Hanks makes. This one didn't disappoint...all along the intensity gradually increases. You kind of know what's eventually coming...force against force that will result in Capt Philipps' freedom or death. Of course, we knew he survived the ordeal, but the gripping suspense really takes over. My heart was pounding the last 20 minutes or so...culminated by the scene inside the rescue ship when the (real) Navy Corpsman examines Capt Phillips. Hanks' performance was Oscar-worthy...no doubt. That's just great filmmaking. Equally impressive was Barkhad Abdi, who played Muse. Would love to see him get best supporting actor at the Oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Fantastic All-Around Film,"Captain Phillips 8.5/10- Based on the real-life hijacking of the Maesrk Alabama, Captain Phillips is a brilliantly directed film by Paul Greengrass with riveting performances by Tom Hanks and the newcomer Barkhad Abdi who plays Muse, the leader of the armed pirates.The movie is great largely because of the always great actor, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks, who plays Captain Phillips, might have had the best performance of his career since ""Forrest Gump."" Barkhad Abdi makes every single person in the theater believe that he actually is an actual Somali pirate. Paul Greengrass does not just show captain Phillips as the good guy and Muse as the bad guy. He gives Muse heart, he shows how the pirates are still people too and it works like a charm. The design of the ship and the life boat was extremely realistic . Captain Phillips is one of the most intense movies of the year and it keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire movie guaranteed. I dare someone to fall asleep in Captain Phillips. I forgot about the pirate incident that took place a few years ago and seeing this movie got me to remember how intense of a situation it was for Captain Phillips whose heroic actions saved his crew. The movie made me feel like I was there and it did not even seem like it was a movie as much as someone filming the actual events with a very good camera. Captain Phillips is one of those movies that everyone goes to the movie theater to watch, one of those films where you completely forget everything going on in your life and you are just watching a movie. This movie was a great start to awards season and this is bound to be nominated for several Oscars and even win a couple.Captain Phillips is a great movie that anyone with a brain can enjoy and it is no doubt worth the ten dollar ticket admission.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"I did not just board the Maersk Alabama, did I?","That's how real 'Captain Phillips' is. The cast, the performance, the camera movement, the language.. You can tell the director put a lot of thought and effort into making it look as realistic as possible down to the detail. That reality intensifies the tension and the thrill because I feel vicarious fear and anxiety out of Captain Phillips's abduction.The writing brings the most out of all main characters. Of course, Phillips's side of the story is important, but the writer does not forget to present a little bit of Muse's side of the story and emotions. Muse is not a flat character anymore to the audience, and it makes the whole movie deeper and wider. The writing prevents the movie from being 'just an action movie'. While things are moving fast as the present time, the audience gets to see the whole picture in the back of their minds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"An AMAZING movie, go out and watch it!","This was just all in all, a great film. It kept you on the edge of your seat pretty much the whole way through. If I had to complain about it, it did start off a bit slow, and it got kind of boring at scenes. (It WAS a 2 and a half hour movie)but it was mostly really good. The acting was phenomenal, especially from Tom Hanks and it was just done really well, the way they filmed it and how it played out. It was exciting, thrilling and emotional. When I came out of the theater, I said to my friend ""It was so good that it was horrible!"" What I mean by that is, the ending was just so, well I can't really explain it without giving spoilers but because of this, it was GOOD. This is my first review and I right away knew that I wanted to do this one, (I just saw it last night). Anyways, I definitely recommend it and I originally gave it an 8 out of 10 but now that I'm thinking about it again, I give it a 9 out of 10. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Fine and Neat,"If you want to see anything like quality acting then you better watch Tom Hank's movies, one among his best movie is 'Captain Phillips', Hanks is just incredible in his performance, and to speak about the plot it's a true incident of Capt. Richard Phillips that bought on the screen but it has been portrayed fantastically, thumbs up for the director and Screen writer Paul and Billy Ray for their fine work, Tom Hanks is just superb he had acted as if he had actually been caught by those Somalian Pirates , and even Abdi who played a Somalian Pirate was good in his performance, the story and portrayal was heart touching, you might have seen lots of such movie but you like it a lot because of its real and practical way of presenting, it put my mind to think, 'how will you react when you are stuck in such situation', it's worth to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Paul Greengrass' most balance film,"The ever political and sometimes controversial Paul Greengrass directed Captain Phillips after making his disappointing rant of film Green Zone. Teaming up with Tom Hanks and writer Billy Ray Captain Phillips tells the true story of the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and the ransoming of Richard Phillips, a merchant sailor by Somali pirates.Captain Phillips is one of Greengrass' more balanced films showing regular people playing a small part in international system. The American navy is treated respectfully, doing their job when trying to save one of their citizens and the pirates themselves are painted in more shades of grey, making them more human. Greengrass is strong with true life stories and Captain Phillips plays to his strengths, realism and looking at wider operations. Captain Phillips is a very well acted film and Greengrass' shaky cam is toned down, making the cinematography much more effective.Greengrass keeps a fast pace going throughout the film, with the best part being the pirates attacking the ship and the crew having to outwit the heavily armed men. There is a slight dip when the action moves to a lifeboat, but picks up again when the Navy gets involved.Captain Phillips is a big improvement to Green Zone and stands along side with United 93 as Greengrass tells the story of a real life event.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Captain Philips is enthralling with Tom Hanks giving stupendous performance,"Actual event films are fascinating and exciting to watch as they take you to the new world which will give a completely new dimension. Captain Philips has a perfect ingredients with veteran actor Tom Hanks and director of Bourne series, Paul Greengrass joining hands to give full- fledged thriller.Based on actual events set in 2009, Captain Philips tells the story of survival of Richard Philips, captain of US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama which was the first American ship in 200 years to be hijacked by Somali pirates.From the director of action-thriller Bourne Platinum, Supremacy and extraordinary United 93, Paul Greengrass gives you another touted real- time account of the hijacking. Right into the film and your eyes will be glued to the silver screen with solid screenplay. The fake call made by Philips to sway off the Pirates, the interaction between the head pirate and Philips and the negotiation between US Navy Seals to rescue the Captain are spellbinding. Hats off to Greengrass for handling such crucial subject with aplomb. Tom Hanks is classic as Captain Philips. He is incomparable and emotes so well in the scene when he was rescued and goes for the medical check-up and barely could speak. Barkhad Abdi was outstanding as the head pirate.Captain Philips is enthralling with Tom Hanks giving stupendous performance.

Tom Hanks in a realistic and Oscar worthy performance as the true Captain Phillips,"This modern day pirate thriller is a nail biting hit movie, even though the true events of the 2009 abduction are familiar to most viewers and the outcome is known from the beginning of the historic story. Tom Hanks playing Captain Phillips, the commanding officer of the Maersk Alabama, gives the best performance of his career, in my opinion. Hanks demonstrates the strategic thinking, compassion and intelligence of Captain Phillips as he deals with a Somali pirate take over of his ship. A trio of Somali pirates portrayed by Somali men brings a startling realism to this movie. Especially noteworthy is the performance of Oscar nominated Barkhad Abdi,who was one among a tribe of Somalians who were involved in the piracy. This movie is memorable because the people who were involved are alive to testify to it's authenticity, the scenes were action packed and the story itself is so well told as to become even more compelling over time. Captain Phillips will definitely be popular for many more years beyond 2009, when the high seas adventurous events occurred, while other movies made in 2013, awards notwithstanding, will be easily forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Storytelling excellence,"Paul Greengrass knew exactly what he wanted to make. And he made exactly that. Above everything else, he got the pace completely right. No where in the movie you will feel any exaggeration or anything that does no FIT. Everything happened in its due course of time, taking nothing away, but still able to draw out the thrill and suspense at the required level.Let me also add things about Tom Hanks. Why him ? You will have to wait until the end. The way he portrayed defeat, relief, shock and trauma, he made it look so genuine. And he did it so subtly.Muse's character was the masterly researched aspect of this movie. One can only be in awe at the outcome the film makers were able to get out of that particular character. The claps must go to Barkhad Abdi who was rightly nominated Golden Globe.The pirate crew did their job superbly too.I personally would have liked to get a little more out of the other characters on the good side, both the crew of Maersk Alabama and the Navy/Seals. Probably it would have been a tad bit more dramatic ... or am I wrong ... ??This is one movie that will tell every movie loving person that Paul Greengrass is a complete film maker and why the one and only "" Tom Hanks "" is .. Tom Hanks.I can only wish them well at the Academy 2014.A salute of 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Perfect Biopic,"Captain Phillips continues a long association with biopics for Tom Hanks. He has arguably the best performance of his career as the titular character, a cargo ship captain. Hanks never once loses poise in his role, always remaining calm and collected. His heroics are impeccable, and he truly propels the film forward. No one else could have done this well in this role. The rest of the cast also performs well, with Barkhad Abdi delivering a stunning debut as Muse, the pirates' ringleader.Paul Greengrass does not get in the way of these wonderful performances with his direction. Instead of opting for grandiose editing, he focuses on making Captain Phillips realistic and down-to-earth above all else. His great cinematography makes the film feel like a documentary due to its slight shakiness and occasional sharp cuts. There are also many close angles used to allow the actors' subtle features to be seen. Overall, Captain Phillips is a stirring biopic that will be a treasure to almost every moviegoer because of its incredible acting and non- distracting direction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Captain Phillips,"Captain Phillips, which is based on a true story and of the book by Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty, has been getting a little bit of backlash from the media, because some events in the movie weren't accurate, or were embellished for the film and weren't as close to the truth as some may have wanted. I guess this does not bother me personally because I for one do not remember specifically the exact details of this story when it happened in 2009, nor have I read the book which serves as a guide to the film. So for those who want perfect accuracy and were looking for an one hundred percent accurate film, I can not comment on that. Some of my more regular readers on this site may be a bit surprised that I went to see and review a film like Captain Phillips, because for the most part I do not either see, or review action films because I often find them boring an clichéd and full of long unnecessary effects and just things that to a lover of a good film script, or acting, more, or less leaves me dry. Captain Phillips, on the other hand is a horse of a different colour though. Yes, there is a lot of action in it and I guess it would technically be considered an action film, but this is what I would call an action film done right. The film captures your interest pretty much right from the beginning and at times it can be a very intense and harrowing film. The film even though it is a little over two hours, moves at a brisk pace and because of how involving the film is, we do not feel the running time and instead as a viewer we are so immersed into the events going on before our eyes that we really do not care how long the film is because we want to see what will happen to these characters and how everything will be sorted, or what the end consequences will be. The film is directed by Paul Greengrass, and to be honest, this is the first film I have seen by him as a director. I wanted to see United 93, when it came out, but unfortunately I have not seen it yet, but I do plan on it. I was very impressed with Mr. Greengrass's direction in the film and it really does add to the overall affect that it left me with. Other than Tom Hanks, who delivers a top notch excellent performance here, all the other actors were unknown to me and I don't believe I had ever seen any of them in anything else before, but I actually think that helped the film. By casting lesser known actors, or perhaps people who are acting for the first time, it gave the film a certain authentic quality to it and it felt more real and less like a Hollywood film. Speaking of a Hollywood film, even though this is a Hollywood production and is a wide release film, it didn't feel like a Hollywood film at all. I loved the choice of the unknown actors and also the fact that the film was shot in a cinema verite style making everything seem more gritty and enhancing the unpleasantness and the heat, fear and conditions the characters are in. The final shots of this film were so powerful and so unlike a mainstream Hollywood film that I could both really appreciate it and the final shots were haunting to me, but also powerful and something that will stay with me for quite awhile. The editing of this film is also top notch which includes jumping from scene to scene and event to event with skilled precise from the editors and I think it was also one of the film's strongest points. I also like how the pirates in this film were given personalities and were not just overly exaggerated cartoon like clichés of what a pirate, or evildoer must be. They interact with one another and we can somehow connect with them as much as we can even though we do not sympathize with them, but the film does humanize them in a sense and makes them seem like everyday people, just caught up in a terrible way of life and living. Again, I think the acting from everyone is really strong here. Tom Hanks' delivers one of his strongest performances in years as someone who is level headed under pressure and also at the same time brave, but also terrified and unsure all at the same time. The affect his performance and what this character goes through is all the more believable because of his strong performance. All the lesser known actors do a great job too and their performances seem real and are equally as powerful and affective. I like how these characters were able to interact and also that between the captain and the pirates, at times there almost seemed like they had a sense of honour and respect for one another. The way they communicated was one of the film's strong points as well. Captain Phillips is exhilarating and a powerful film to watch that because of how well done it is, it is bound to leave you feeling something after you leave and you will be totally immersed in the film as they do this. A first rate action film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
