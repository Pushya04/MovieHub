Unjustily Criticized,"I stayed away from this film for a long time, doing a dumb thing: listening to the well-known film critics.When I finally got around to it, I was very surprised. It was a good film. Not great, not intense as the first two Godfather flicks, but definitely a lot better than advertised.Many people said this was filled with anti-Roman Catholic propaganda, but I didn't it find that way. Yes, the ""Vatican bank,"" whatever that is, was portrayed as not on the up-and-up, but it was a little confusing to follow, maybe too confusing to get offended! Actually, there were some positive things, religious-wise, with Al Pacino's character, who sought forgiveness for his past sins and made a few very profound statements such as, ""What good is confession if it isn't followed by repentance?""Anyway, Pacino's acting talents are the main attraction in the lower-key, more cerebral Godfather film. There isn't that much action but when it occurs, it's pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it's nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.Finally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
It really isn't that bad..,"Having heard the endless amount of critique and insults that the last part of the Godfather saga carries.. I have to disagree. Although people seem to love to hate Sophie Coppola and say she ruined the film, I think her part alone wasn't that frail it'd ruin the entire cinematic experience. Saying that is just humorous. Also, the absence of Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall is really a loss and even I think this film would've been a lot better if there was him in it.. but he got too greedy and couldn't make it into the movie, and that's that. I'm not going to judge a movie by what it could have been, but what it is and how good it ends up being.Despite some shortcomings, Godfather Part 3 is a decent ending to the trilogy. While it may have been an attempt to cash off the audience, they still have Coppola bring us his finest directing. I found Al Pacino's performance extremely satisfying and even terrifyingly so. He embodies the mistakes and losses of his life with excellent skill, showing us a don that has lost his health, the loved ones of his life and even the respect for himself. While I never found Diane Keaton's performances in the saga that good, she still fills the spot required, same goes for Talia Shire, whose role in the ending finale of the film really came as a surprise to me - which was a good thing. I didn't find her role in Part 2 too appealing but in this one she has more character, more importance. Sophie Coppola was OK, like I said a lot of people have complained about her acting skills and I gotta admit she was a little ""stiff"" or sorts in some scenes but it's not notable all the time and it didn't spoil any moods for me. Andy Carcia was just excellent, my favorite add to the saga cast, playing the son of his father with excellence.So, umm.. this film is perfectly fine. The ending finale was tremendously well shot and very climatic, filled with a lot of excitement. I'm telling you this movie is a great ending to the saga even because of that one particular scene so just go see it, despite what a lot of people have said about, badmouthing it for faulty reasons.. it brought a tear into my eye. It did.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie is greatly misunderstood and it has become popular opinion to say it is bad.,"The Godfather Part three is a great movie but many would contest. This final installment of the greatest trilogy ever made is misunderstood by most because they do not see what this film is really about. G3 is  not about hits and gangland killings, but rather, G3 is about the end of Michael Corleone's legacy of crime in America. This movie shows him stepping out of the gambling and the other rackets because they have hurt him so badly. This movie is a masterpiece because it shows the conclusion to an incredible story. There had to be an end to this trilogy and this thoughtful way to do it exemplified the trilogy as an unbeatable one. Just because it doesn't end with a violent scene like the murder of the heads of the 5 families does not make it a bad movie, but in this case, a beautiful one. Please, don't feel you have to agree with the common view by proxy, but think on your own about what this movie really means and how it concludes and consequences the first two.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
It simply doesn't work very well,"Being an optimistic fellow I wanted to enjoy The Godfather Part III the first time I saw it - this was easy, since its a competent piece of film making, generally well paced, acted, it's coherent, Al Pacino's in it, Coppola has made this film from A to Z and on its own terms the film doesn't have any inexcusable flaws. (Not even, I might add, the notorious Sofia Coppola; she's bad, but her performance is benefited by the character she's playing, which is also weak). So for a long time I was one of those guys going ""Hey, Godfather part III isn't as bad as everyone says. Sure, its not as good as the first two but not many movies are!"" Later in life, presumably with heightened standards and a better sense of criticism, I started to suspect that the opposite could be true - that part III was really nowhere near as good as I'd recall - and after seeing all three films pretty much back to back I have to be honest (an approach I think wouldn't hurt the more enthusiastic defenders of this film) and conclude that The Godfather Part III, despite certain qualities, simply doesn't work.(Excluded passage due to word limit; concerning how Coppola did the film for the money, and that it actually makes the film a little easier to appreciate)I think the film really, on a whole, is perhaps not 'bad', certainly not horrible, but definitely a failure. The plot is underdeveloped and not engaging - Michael Corleone suffers from guilt. Its not unreasonable to say he did that at the end of Part II already. Where does his search for redemption lead him? Do ""they"" really pull him in again? Does his character do or say anything really memorable? Once or twice. But the script really is a long filler-session. And while everybody seems to just automatically praise Pacino because, well, he's Pacino I don't think his performance in this film is particularly good either, at least not by his merits. He's a great actor, and this is as fine a performance as any other he's made, but when you consider how truly versatile Pacino can be (compare Godfather part II with Scarface, with Serpico, Devil's Advocate, you name it, he's right there in character) its a disappointment that the aged Michael Corleone has turned into... well, Al Pacino. Obviously the character is not the same man that he used to be, but I never once really believed that I was watching Michael Corleone. He looked, and acted, too much like Al Pacino.Not to mention Andy Garcia being nothing more than Andy Garcia, Joe Pantanglio, Eli Wallach, Talia Shire in a strangely awful performance (she's not a bad actress at all, but whatever happened here?). And of course Sofia Coppola; she isn't the crucial problem, but in the end she does become responsible for a lot of misfiring. The only one still doing a prime job is Diane Keaton as Kay - truly an unsung hero in these films, and to me one of the main reasons the drama work - and the film's best scenes were the one's she shared with Pacino. Why? Because then I felt like I was even watching a Godfather movie.Much of everything else simply doesn't work. Whereas the original films were subtle and ambiguous, part III filters the story with melodramatic punches that are un-inspired and obvious. Michael's son, played by Franc D'Ambrosio, seems taken from Days of Our Lives and so many of the questions we ask ourselves - what does he remember from his childhood? What does any of the characters feel about Michael's marriage in Sicily? Did Tom Hagen ever move to Las Vegas? etc - are left completely by the road, as if Coppola truly isn't interested in telling this story. There are instead near-insulting reminders to the audience that the other two movies still exist (like the pointless scene where Michael have kept the drawing Anthony left at his pillow when he was nine or so; ""I remember this"" he smiles, though I'm not sure if we are to understand this as ""I also remember they shot up the bedroom that same night""; once again, it seems Coppola simply forgets his own story). There are also awkward attempts at creating dramatic highlights in line with the horse-head scene and that very shooting in the beginning of Part II, involving a shooting during a parade in Little Italy and a stupid and ugly scene involving a helicopter. Making a Godfather sequel formulaic is truly a depressing insult to the originality of the first two films. The attempts Coppola takes on the Vatican are also pretty flat when you think about how Italian cinema has been doing this for half a century.There's no reason to watch this film have you not seen the first two. And there's really no reason to watch it if you have seen them either. When you think about it, I don't see why the film's few merits are worth talking about. Movie newbies having seen Part I and II will naturally see III too, and I think many of them will come to the same conclusion. It's not all bad, but so what. It simply doesn't work very well.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Passionate Requiem,"I finally saw it ! As a total devotee of the two previous installments, I avoided seeing the third one, on purpose, people I respect had told me about the disappointment and, quite honestly, I didn't go there. Last night I did and surprise, surprise, it moved me no end. Maybe because I haven't seen the other two in four years. Yes at times is more Ken Russell than Francis Ford Coppola and in my book that's not a bad thing. I was, however, a bit taken aback by the healing in Pacino's Michael as far as Keaton's Kay is concerned. As it nothing had ever happened, while in Diane Keaton the memory of that pain is always present. Talia Shire is a lot of fun as a sort of Madame Sin. Raf Vallone, superb as the doomed Pope John Paul I and then a bit puzzling casting choices that I think they me code for something. George Hamilton, for instance, takes over from where Rubert Duvall left off. Helmut Berger plays the head of the Vatican Bank. Helmut Berger! Just as curious as to find Troy Donahue in The Godfather Part II - All in all, I'm really glad I've seen it and I'm sure I'll see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Disppointing, but not as bad as it made out to be","First off, I adore the first two Godfather films. They were wonderfully made, scored, directed and acted with compelling elegiac stories. However, while I do not think it is as bad as it is made out to be, The Godfather Part III is a disappointment. I did like it in general, but in comparison to the first two it is like a distant relative.Starting with the good things, it does look splendid. The cinematography is beautiful and the settings are superb. The music is also outstanding, and the direction is good. The acting is uneven, but not all of it is bad. Al Pacino does have a lot of fine moments as a more gentler Michael, while Andy Garcia is electrifying too.However, I didn't like the story as much here. It lacked the elegiac feel of the first two, it has a lot of loose ends and there was a number of times I didn't know what was going on. The script isn't as thoughtful, intelligent or as sophisticated here, instead some of it is quite stilted. As much as I do love Diane Keaton I personally don't think she was necessary here, she served her purpose perfectly in the first two. Finally I have to concur about Sophia Coppola. She never convinces as the ""symbol of innocence"", and just comes across sometimes as embarrassing. Much has been said about the climax in the opera house, some loved it, others didn't. I think it was a mixed bag. I had no problem with Pacino, the way it was shot and the music but it did come across as very protracted.So all in all, not awful, not great. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Godfather Coda: Don't waste you money,"I was extremely excited to see the new cut of The Godfather Part III. I bought a digital copy. As I was seeing the movie, I could barely notice any changes.By the trailer of this movies, I was led to believe that Sofia Coppola's role was going to be drastically cut; that was not the case. As you probably now, her acting has been the biggest point of contention against Part III.After the movie ended, I felt that I was cheated. The differences in The Godfather Part III and The Godfather Coda are just too small to make a big deal out of them. I was expecting to see a big improvement that take this movie closer to the level of the first two parts, but was very disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Stands out On its Own, Weak in Comparison to its Predecessor,","The Godfather: Part III is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. It certainly stands out on its own, Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone here, being his first time playing the character in 16 years, it is as if he never left the role. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is still on point, though the writing may not feel as passionate, he still manages to bring the world to life in s splendid manner, the only way he knows how.The dialogue and overall story is far less inspired than the previous two, it never manages to make much of an impact. Having no Vito Corleone in this one was a big loss, I understand that his story came to a close in the second film, but he was the heart and soul, as well as the highlight, of these movies, there was a gaping whole without him. I was not a fan of Andy Garcia's character, merely a repeat of the same type of role Pacino had in the first Godfather, but never as effective. While its flawed and certainly not a pleasing finale to the trilogy, The Godfather: Part III is still a must watch for fans of the first two, you might as well form your own opinion of it.Michael Corleone confesses his sins while trying to legitimize his business to keep his family safe as he ages.Best Performance: Al Pacino / Worst Performance: Sofia Coppola",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not as bad as everyone says  but suffers from the pressure of the first two,"Michael Corleone has sold his illegal business in an attempt to win back his family.  However he must still contend with up and coming mobsters such as Vincent, who wants to work for him and Joey Zasa, who wants to fully take over the Corleone family's territory.  When the Corleone family begin to deal with the Vatican and plan to buy out their share of an multinational corporation he finds that the Vatican is just as corrupt as his illegal operations were.  Despite his best efforts he finds himself sucked back into the world he has tried to leave behind.Easily one of the most hated films ever made  or at least you'd think it was by the critical mauling it got for a raft of reasons.  However watching it now it isn't that bad and really it only suffers from comparison with the two films before it.  But lets be fair, Coppola has made 3 or 4 of the best films ever made  did we really expect another one from him?The film has a reasonable plot and brings the trilogy to a logical end.  The plot however does have it's weaknesses  for example it starts well with Michael's attempt to `get out' being hampered by other families on their way up.  But when it starts to get involved with money laundering through the Vatican and the corruption therein, it starts to lose it's way and it's focus on Michael.The main weakness comes in the characters.  Would Michael really go straight just to get his family back  and how come he managed to do it so easily up till the time of the film?  Worse still is Connie who seems to have become some sort of Mafia widow when that was not part of her character in the previous films  would she really have got that twisted or influential? Little problems like these just bugged me and they also fed into the performances.For such a great cast the acting was very average.  Pacino is good but I sensed he didn't see Michael turning out this way and he didn't convince occasionally.  Keaton has little to do and again I felt that her approach to Michael was too forgiving, although maybe I'm not allowing for time.  As I Siad before Shire was doing some sort of `Bride of Frankenstein' act as Connie and I didn't buy it for a moment.  Garcia was OK and faces like Wallach, Hamilton and the like helped.  The two worst performances were sadly two of the main ones.  First Joe Mantegna..now it wasn't that it was bad  it was more that I've seen him do so much better.  Here all I could think of when I watched him was how his character and his acting was very like his Simpsons' character of ` Fat Tony'.  Bare in mind Fat Tony is meant to be a spoof of the Mafioso characters and you'll see why I didn't like it.The worse performance was Sofia Coppola.  Now she was vilified at the time for her role  a bit unfairly and cruelly but she was still bad.  She has this strange scowl on her face for most of the film and she acts like a spoil little girl.  She also has no realism in her voice and speaks in the same constant tone  that Vincent would fall for her was just a leap of faith too far to accept.  The cast does have others who are unused or underused  Fonda being the best example.  Why did she bother with that role!?Overall, this is miles behind the other two Godfathers and it has plenty of weaknesses.  However at it's heart it's a good try as the concluding part and the story is watchable.  It's not bad, it just is average and it feels like the director and large sections of the cast felt they just had to turn up to make a third classic film.",,Anonymous,Crime
Underrated,"Godfather III is generally underrated because because it is more intellectual, subtle, and psychological than the first two.  There's lots more Italian language, operatic venues, references to subtleties like the P2 masonic lodge, and there is the inner revelation of Michael Corleone's soul. Pacino should have won an Oscar for his performance.  The movie would be a good staging point for a Godfather IV, with ""Vincenzo Corleone"" and Connie Corleone running things, while developing further the relationship between Michael, and his wife and son.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not Worth the Hate,"Review of ""Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone""; which is a huge mouthful compared to its original title, but I also find it a slightly better fit as it no longer has super strong ties to the first two films and is now more of a character film based on Michael (Al Pacino) and his ending. It's the original vision. We already had the first two films in the 70s and they don't really need further details or story exploration beyond the epic ending of ""Part II"". But with that being said, this movie is a very interesting piece of the puzzle and I'm certainly glad of its existence as a sort of epilogue to the saga. People hate on this film because it's not up to the standards of the first two. I like it because it's an exploration of Michael's character twenty years after the events of ""Part II"" and it doesn't necessarily try to tell the same type of story. Michael is an old man at this point and really has no more character development to go through other than ""get out of organized crime."" Which is a great premise to work off of and we're taken through 1970s Vatican politics to do it, which is new.All of that being said there are a lot of similar clichés storytelling wise. I think the last act of all three ""Godfather"" films play out pretty much the same. Very predictable plot structure by the third film. This movie also just doesn't quite pack the amount of narrative punch that the original films did. Again, I think this boils down to the fact that Michael is an old man at this point and it's hard to surprise us with anything about him. The plot's pacing is a bit slower and not as polished.Some of the best scenes in the franchise are in this film, but I also admit that this one has the most amount of slack and filler and dullness. I actually don't think Sofia Coppola is as bad as people say she is. Andy Garciá also does a great job as Vincent Corleone. It's a shame a lot of the big actors like Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro couldn't at least make cameo appearances in this film. The only real big star we have here is Pacino. Pacino does give a nice performance though.""Coda""/""Part III"" basically continues and concludes the story of Michael Corleone in a way that will most likely be satisfying. It's not a masterpiece but it comes very close and I do think it acts as a good companion film to watch alongside the original two. It doesn't deserve the hate it gets, it's decent enough and it's hard to compete when the preceding films are already among the pinnacle of cinematic expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Mother Of Mercy, Is This The End Of The Corleones?","The Godfather Trilogy may have reached its end with The Godfather: Part III. But was there enough room to allow for yet another film based on another generation of the Corleones? Time and public demand will only tell.I liked The Godfather: Part III right up to and including Sofia Coppola's much maligned performance as Mary Corleone daughter of Don Michael Corleone, the one and only Al Pacino. I think she was unjustly criticized. In her performance she set out to play one of the innocent children of Al Pacino.There's a moving scene in The Godfather where we saw Al Pacino and Marlon Brando talking for the last time. Brando's hopes were for his son to become Governor Corleone, Senator Corleone to attain that level of respectability that was out of the Don's reach. Pacino tells him, maybe the next generation.Flash forward to the late seventies where Pacino has slowly divested himself of the illegal interests of the Corleone family. But the other crime bosses don't like the idea of him going completely legitimate. He also has some opposition within his own family. His surviving sibling Talia Shire thinks he ought to keep a hand in and his illegitimate nephew, Andy Garcia is having a running feud with another family head, Joe Mantegna.Andy Garcia got the only acting nomination for The Godfather: Part III as Sonny's son out of wedlock. And he's every bit as wild and hot tempered as Sonny was from The Godfather. Garcia brings a lot of passion to the part. But he does prove able to learn from his uncle and eventually not repeat the mistakes of his father. Garcia lost to another hoodlum portrayal, Joe Pesci for Goodfellas for Best Suppporting Actor.Probably Al Pacino has gotten all he could out of the character of Michael Corleone. He's gotten real respectability now, he's been conferred with a Papal Knightship for the good works of the Corleone Foundation now. He's high up the criminal world too. But people and circumstances won't let those worlds mix and as he ruefully remarks, ""just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in again.""Only four characters made it through the three Godfather films, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Richard Bright as Al Neri. All except Neri seem to grow in character, Neri is still button man in chief since Lucabrazzi started sleeping with the fishes in The Godfather. Keaton's character is still the outsider. Separated from Pacino in The Godfather: Part II, she still loves him and regrets as much as he has the outside forces that caused their separation.Although Talia Shire got an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress in The Godfather: Part II, I think she really comes into her own in this one. Had it not been for male chauvinism implicit in the Sicilian culture, she'd be taking over the family business from Pacino. She's changed so dramatically over the course of the three films. In The Godfather she's the innocent daughter about to embark on marriage to a wife beater. In The Godfather: Part II, she's now entering middle age, overindulging in excesses, unhappy as a many time married widow, her first husband being killed in the original Godfather. She lives on the sufferance and tolerance of her brother. Now in The Godfather: Part III she takes an active interest in the family business and the family legacy. She realizes more than Pacino there's no escaping the Corleone roots. She champions Garcia as the new Don, she knows he's got the chops for the job, she hopes he can develop the smarts as does Pacino.Eli Wallach contributes a fine performance as another aging crime Don who's got a lot more to him than when we first meet him. Raf Vallone plays Pope John Paul I and the urban legend of his sudden demise after a one month papacy is woven into the Corleone story. As is Joe Mantegna who plays an undisguised version of Brooklyn mob boss Joe Columbo.I'm sure if the money's right and a workable screenplay is developed we may not have seen the last of the Corleones. There was one talked about a few years ago. Still if it never develops, The Godfather: Part III is a fine film to end the saga.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Focuses more on who we all know is the TRUE main character of the series, and that's why it's my favourite.","Castigate me if you will for saying this, but I believe part 3 to be the best of the series.  It's a very close run thing, with each film receiving the same rating from me (8), but it benefits from being a more intense study of ONE character rather than trying to divide its time between several, as the other two did.  That character of course is Michael Corleone; and when he's played by an actor of such class as Pacino, the movie can't fail. Michael has always been the most interesting character of the series for me, and is the fulcrum around which the entire series revolves; more so than Marlon Brando, who was nevertheless the first to essay the character of 'the Don'.  It's fascinating to watch events unfold now that he is finally a willing head of the 'family', trying to emulate his father.I did as is recommended and watched all 3 consecutively, so my ultimate preference for this one can't be explained by having forgotten how good the other two were.  IMO, this is a superior film on its own merits, which have nothing to do with the 15yr (I think) gap between sequels.Andy Garcia is a great addition to the cast as the cocksure Vincent, and Sophia Coppola, despite what you may have heard, is fine here too as Mary.She is also very beautiful.The entire trilogy is a series which demands to be seen by all those who call themselves film fans, and the third is not a blight on the other two, but rather a quality addition that enriches far more than it detracts.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Michael is trying to go legit, but the Corleone family crime partner Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) is disrespecting Michael. All out fighting breaks out between Vincent and Joey. ""Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."" It is the only quote worth quoting.The third generation doesn't have it. Only Andy Garcia has any acting prowess. He has the cockiness of a street punk. Sofia Coppola is just a symbol of the lack of depth in the cast. It's shocking since I would expect that all of Hollywood would be jumping through hoops to get a bit part or some background work in this iconic franchise. Francis Ford Coppola doesn't have anything left in this franchise. Even Pacino looks dried up. Instead of muscle and threats, Michael does business deals. It doesn't have the same power and menace.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Godfather Part III,"Wow, this is a really poor cousin of the first two films. Centring on the later life of ""Michael"" (Al Pacino) this has much more of an episodic, almost soap opera, feel to it. He is determined to become legitimate, to look after his family and to stay alive despite the conspiring of Eli Wallach's ""Don Altobello"" and some of his cohorts who are trying to assassinate him and claim the Corleone crown. Talia Shire is quite effective as his sister ""Connie"" but Andy Garcia's smarmy ""Vincent"" (the son of the gunned down ""Sonny"") just made me squirm. This film really does miss the previously strong supporting cast too. No Robert Duval; Diane Keaton (with some simply hideous jewellery) features but sparingly and the whole thing just plugs along until a rather downbeat ending that just didn't seem to do justice to the excellence of Puzo's story or to the previously established, captivating, characterisations. It looks great, the production is first rate but this is just not a story to compare with the others.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"like the Star Wars prequels, this film is marked by some as a 'never should have been made'.  I wouldn't agree with that","In giving a wrap-up, a conclusion to two of the most powerful crime and family stories to come out of the seventies, Francis Ford Coppola took a risk that many feel didn't pay off. I almost wish I didn't know what criticisms people had before viewing it again recently (I had seen the film when I was in my early teens, but forgot most of it). Some of them, such as the mis-casting of Sofia Coppola, the long, drawn-out scenes, the heavy-handed dialog, are not entirely un-founded. And I would agree that this is my least favorite of the trilogy. But I do not feel that it is a failure, or a mis-calculation by Coppola and co-author Mario Puzo.In fact, right from the get-go and throughout the film, I was very intrigued by the direction of the story that was being taken, as well as with the characters. At the core, Coppola cares deeply about the Corleone family, in particular Michael (Al Pacino, his most infamous crime performance alongside Tony Montana), despite the sins that have been committed. It's a tale of redemption, of loss, and of what matters in a life dominated by greed and corruption in the legitimate as well as illegitimate places. Coppola understands this world, or at least the dynamics of it, and that's what makes Godfather 3 at the least a fascinating character study.Not to mention, much of the assembled cast (with the loss of Robert Duvall being the only set-back) is still highly dependable- Pacino is great at being tragic, and his subtleties in some scenes rank with his best work (one scene that stuck with me was his confession to the priest about Fredo). Keaton, for her scenes, is alright considering her dialog. Andy Garcia makes an impression fast in one of his early performances. Eli Wallach is an interesting choice for the Don (once again, like with Tuco, an effective take on a clichéd character). And Sofia Coppola, while understandably forced in some of her emotions (or, indeed, under-cooked), is not as bad as some have made her out to be. After all, she is supposed to be just a regular girl, not within the overly dramatic landscape of the criminals and politicians.And the story, which follows Michael's chances at achieving legitimacy at the turn of the end of the seventies while his nephew tries to find the line of a ""good"" made guy, keeps a viewer on edge with the style too. To put it as such, Gordon Willis keeps a consistency with his masterful work in the first two films (at least, all three in the trilogies are masterpieces of lighting and compositions, and Willis was reportedly more responsible for the look of the films than Coppola, who focused on the actors and theatrics). And such a wonderful, operatic music score by Carmine Coppola is a fitting swan song, if missing the Nina Rota touch. For me, The Godfather: part 3 (a.k.a. The Death of Michael Corleone, Coppola's original title) is only a disappointment in how there isn't (arguably) the level of ambition in regards to the others. And the violent content, although original in its tactics, may not pack the wallop one might expect. But as a film by itself, this is a drama of considerable merit, and wouldn't spoil the flow if watched right after the first two in one sitting.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Time for reappraisal,"Ok!! So I watched this 30 years ago and like most people felt it was a disappointment. However in the past weeks having watched all 3 again in order it is actually pretty good and has stood the test of time. Nothing compares to number 2 but 3 does not tarnish the legacy the way some people say it does. It's poignant and heartbreaking and quietly epic and its a
fitting finale to the trilogy. I'm really glad I came back to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unnecessary and overwrought but reasonably interesting and entertaining,"It is 1979, about 22 years since the events of The Godfather II. For Michael Corleone, the move to legitimacy is complete: the New York crime business has been handed over to Joey Zasa and all elements of the Corleone business empire are legal, non-criminal enterprises. Michael, approaching 60, is now thinking about his legacy. His charity, run by his daughter Mary, has just handed over $100 million to the Catholic Church. Michael also intends buying a large stake in International Immobiliari, a Vatican-run property company. Things are peaceful and stable but then Vincent Mancini, Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, starts a feud with Joey Zasa. This has far- reaching, deadly consequences, including for Michael's deal with the Vatican.Unnecessary, as The Godfather II didn't need a sequel. Francis Ford Coppola has stated that he only did it for the money.The product itself is a bit hit-and-miss. Plot has some intrigue, with a Robert Ludlum-like Vatican conspiracy woven into a more conventional mafia story. This does mean a departure from the feel of the first two movies, and I'm note sure it's a good departure. The plot becomes unnecessarily complex and overwrought, making it less tight than the first two movies. Coppola also unnecessarily draws out the movie - every scene gets stretched to the limit and there's a lot of padding. He could easily have lopped 40 minutes (at least) off the movie without us losing any information or engagement.Then there's the performances, which are mostly good, with two notable exceptions. The old guard - Al Pacino, Dianne Keaton, Talia Shire - put in solid performances. The change in Connie, from passive to assertive and decisive, was one of the positive features of this movie and Talia Shire is great in that role.The new faces include some pretty big names: Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Andy Garcia, George Hamilton, John Savage, Bridget Fonda. Andy Garcia is great as Vincent Mancini, a worthy (potential) successor to Michael. Bridget Fonda is great but criminally underused, especially as it appeared that she would have a bigger role. Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna are solid as Don Altobello and Joey Zasa, respectively, and John Savage has little screen time.George Hamilton is badly miscast as BJ Harrison, Michael's attorney. He really didn't fit the part and comes off as somewhat unconvincing. He was stepping into Robert Duvall's shoes - Tom Hagen was meant to continue into The Godfather III but the character was dropped when Robert Duvall pulled out over a pay dispute - so he does suffer due to the comparison with Duvall.Then we have the performance which almost single-handedly wrecks this movie: Sofia Coppola. She is absolutely atrocious as Mary Corleone, well deserving her 1991 Razzie wins for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star. Her dialogue delivery is incredibly flat and unconvincing and even when she has no dialogue she seems awkward, like she doesn't know what to do with herself when she's on camera.Her flat delivery results in lack of engagement with her character, and this ruins the climax of the movie. So, there are greater consequences to her terrible performance.It's a good thing she took up directing - she's clearly better at that.Apparently she wasn't first choice for the part, as Julia Roberts and then Winona Ryder were cast for the role but then had to pull out. So at least Francis Ford Coppola could say she was hired more out of desperation than being his daughter. Still, he really should have kept looking...(Aside: Winona Ryder as Mary - how awesome would that have been? The mind boggles. And yes, I am a big Winona Ryder fan.)Overall: not bad, but not that good either.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth to re-watch!,"The Godfather CODA: The Death of Michael Corleone a.k.a The Coppola's Cut is much better than the original The Godfather Part III.The storyline is better, not confusing.

Horrible ending to a great series,"Having just watched The Godfather and Godfather II again after watching and enjoying it so many times, I decided to watch this 3rd and last installment again to see if it was really as bad as I remembered.

No Comparison,"I recently watched all three Godfather films again in sequence and was surprised at how bad GF III is when closely compared to the other two fims. There are characters in the film whose presence is never made clear (i.e. George Hamilton, Brigette Fonda and Don Novello - Father Guido Sarducci??) The major characters bear little resemblance to themselves from the previous films. Connie Corleone is now a major supporter of Michael even though she knows he had her husband killed? Michael now has a change of heart and tries to go ""legit"" even though he so eagerly immersed himself into the power and control of the Corleone family. And Kay continues to ""hang around"" even though she dreads Michael and all that he stands for. Why?? The movie drags on in parts and never really gains it's true identity untill the end of the film during the opera scene. Not even Winona Ryder who was scheduled to be cast in the part of Mary could have helped. It only serves to give us an appetite for the earlier two films. Both of which I consider masterpieces.",,Anonymous,Crime
Not bad at all...,"""The Godfather: Part III"" was released on 25th December 1990, as the last movie of the ""Godfather"" saga. Celebrating it's 30th anniversary, Francis Ford Coppola unfolds a new version of the movie as Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: ""The Death of Michael Corleone"" which is mentioned as the original version of the movie.It is obvious that ""Coda"" is more satisfying than the ""Part III"" which is also helps in healing the broken hearts of the Godfather fans with the ""Part III"".I love Coda, starting from the first scene. Instead of the flashback of abandoned Corleone house and the clip from ""The Godfather: Part II"" where Michael's brother, Fredo getting killed at the lake, Coppola starts the movie straight from the Vatican business with Immobiliare. That technique reminded me of the movie's famous quote ""It's not personal. It's only business"". The flashbacks of the previous version emphasized a great fall of the Corleone empire but the Vatican business shows the strength has not left the family.It is revealed that some scenes of ""Coda"" remind us the memories from ""The Godfather"" which I appreciate as a successful use of scenes to denote the end of the saga. The celebration of Michael, receiving the Order of Saint Sebastian honor takes us back to Connie's wedding, presenting a festive mood to the audience within the first 30 minutes of the movie.Coppola has removed some scenes such as the church scene and the meeting of Michael and Don Antobello at the hospital. Eventually, he has trimmed some scenes and also added short clips which support to fill the time frame of the movie as well as a decent look to it.The considerable change of the movie that I noted is trimming the death scene of Michael at Don Tommasino's villa. Instead of his fall from the chair, Coppola fades Michael into a frame that says
""When Sicilians wish you ""Cent'anni"" ... it means ""for long life"""".It is crystal clear that though the movie title says ""The Death of Michael Corleone"", it is not about Michael's physical death but about his emotional death.Michael did all these businesses for his family. Thus, the things he lost are also his family. Since ""The Godfather"" to ""Coda"", Michael is losing the people whom he considers as the most precious to his life. All the sins he commits, is meant to be greatness in their lives.Among all the moments, the most excruciating lost in Michael's life is the death of his daughter. The silent scream of Michael on the steps outside the theater is successful enough to tear your heart out from your chest. It creates this heart-wrenching scene as she dies with a bullet in her chest which had Michael's name carved on it. According to the new wrap-up of the movie, Michael is going to live a long life, grieving and suffering. He is alone and everyone has either betrayed him, left him or died because of his actions. It is worse than death because he never wanted this type life.It is interesting that with the restoration of ""The Godfather: Part III"" as ""The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone"", Francis Coppola does a worthy change to conclude the epic ""Godfather"" saga with a great success.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
It had way more potential but great.,"Part III wraps up the legendary saga with a satisfying and emotional conclusion, highlighting the standout performances of Al Pacino and Andy Garcia. Pacino continues to shine with his portrayal of a man grappling with the weight of his past while striving for redemption. His ability to convey the internal conflict and emotional depth of a character who's been through so much is one of the film's strongest elements.Andy Garcia steps into the spotlight as Vincent Mancini, the fiery nephew of Michael. Garcia brings a fresh energy to the film, balancing both intensity and vulnerability, making his character a fitting successor to the Corleone legacy. His performance is compelling and adds a new dynamic to the family drama, particularly in the way his character interacts with Michael.While the third part may not carry the same towering influence as the first two films, it offers a respectable and fitting conclusion to the Corleone family saga. The film's tone may be different, but its power lies in the emotional stakes and the characters' arcs, making it a nice finishing touch to one of cinema's most iconic series.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Didn't hate it. Also don't get why there are so many negative reviews. Its honestly not bad.,"So I'm not sure why I decided to review The Godfather III before the first two. I feel like there's more to be said and examined about the third one over 1 & 2. High praise and acclaim for those but this one is more polarizing and worth being talked about.I think this film while definitely not as good as 1 & 2 was definitely not a disappointment. It does deal with an intimidating opponent(s)for Michael Corleone for sure and shifts a great deal storywise from what the others had to offer but it certainly adds to the legacy of the Corleone family in general. Family always the root of the story from the beginning is always the theme here as well. The dynamic is different because now the children are grown up and play heavily into the story. Sofia Coppola the daughter and Franc D'Ambrosio the son Mary and Anthony respectively with Andy Garcia as cousin Vincent Mancini added into the mix. It does suffer from the loss of Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen (his reasons totally agreeable) and as Coppola mentioned ""the powers that be reworking and rewriting his initial script"" which is the reason for the director's cut CODA. Alot of salary demands behind the scenes also cast a gray shadow over this movie.But in other regards it is fine as a final entry to me. Alot of the hate for Sofia Coppola's acting seems unfair. She's not great but she's not terrible either, and for how little she's honestly really in this I don't get the criticism. It completely makes sense to the story that she's there she is in the first one after all. If Winona Ryder was the best choice at the time I don't know if this wouldn't have suffered the same fate either way. And also Al Pacino's opinion of the portrayal of Michael Corleone in this one, I find it rings very true. I won't reveal other than to say he's different from the Michael Corleone of 1 & 2. Nonetheless Francis Ford Coppola as usual in fine form directing this. Fine pacing and great camerawork. The plot suffers of course but all in all watchable and not as bad as it sounds. Garcia a welcome addition, a nice performance, a little bit of a loose end concerning Diane Keaton's character Kay but forgivable.Your thoughts on this one may vary but I feel its a fine third entry that doesn't deserve to be put down. There are ALOT of worse films out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A very good conclusion to an excellent trilogy,"I watched all tree movies in one weekend. If you have time, do it and you'll get a very good sense of continuity of the story of one family spanning over many generations. You'll get a very deep thought and emotion provoking experience.All three films are very good and I don't see why the third one has been discredited as the weaker one. In my opinion it is as strong and valiant as the first two. Perhaps people who had seen the first two films made in short proximity of 72' and 74', after 16 years of waiting had their expectations lifted to almost unattainable levels? Another mystery for me is the assault of critic's attacks Sofia Coppola received for her portrayal of the part of Mary Corleone. I thought she was excellent. I thought her casting in the role has been a brilliant idea. She comes across as a young, innocent, well-protected girl- just right for the part she is playing.Watch this film and judge it for yourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Godfather: Part III (1990),"This is my third time watching GF3, with about 8-9 years between each viewing. I probably won't watch it again. It's not just that it pales in comparison to the first two movies. Watching it now, completely separated from its predecessors, makes that clear. In fact, for a while I was thinking ""eh, this isn't so bad"". But it really is. Slow and boring, with a complicated web of Vatican blah blah that is too hard to follow, and yet all the major emotional themes are presented in a wretchedly blunt fashion. Everyone pretty much blurts out exactly what they're feeling. I think Eli Wallach and Talia Shire might be the only decent performances in the movie. And speaking of performances... you know where I'm going with this. Sofia Coppola has taken a lot of crap for her role in this film (and Francis for casting her), and deserves every bit of it. She's awful, awful, awful. There are a few lyrical sequences and intriguing elements, but overall it's a dull, muddled, heavy-handed mess.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Al Pacino is as superb as the other two, and the inclusion of an extremely inspired Andy Garcia (bad luck he wasn't ever able to repeat such a good part) and the rest of the cast are just wonderful.

Wondrous Revision of a Flawed Classic,"This is a terrific reimagining of The Godfather Part III. The edit's power is quietly radical because it's 95% the same film, but dozens of tiny cuts & shifts in emphasis make it feel like a new movie. And it looks & sounds GLORIOUS.It's still too broad in tone to be compared to the original classics, but it succeeds almost entirely on its own terms now. Gordon Willis photography's gloomy loveliness, the autumnal regret of Milena Canonero's costumes & the brilliance of Dean Tavoularis' set-design all benefit from the restoration & the music... Wow! The last 30 minutes of this movie is pure genius.There's a little less Sofia (who is really lovely & touching in this), a little less Eli Wallach, a little more Diane Keaton. Andy Garcia is almost a co-protagonist now & the great Al Pacino gives one of his best career performances. A flawed but wonderful film just got a whole lot more wonderful.

Michael Corleone seeks redemption while a young buck takes over the shady business,"RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part III"" stars Al Pacino as aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in 1979, who seeks to legitimize his work in New York and Italy and avow for his sins. He mentors his bastard nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), while trying to steer his teenage daughter, Mary, away from him (Sofia Coppola).MAIN CAST: Diane Keaton returns as Michael's ex-wife, Kay, while Talia Shire reprises the role of sister, Connie. Franc D'Ambrosio is on hand as Michael's son, Antonio, who wants to leave law school and become an opera singer. George Hamilton co-stars as B.J. Harrison, essentially taking the place of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as Michael's chief financial adviser and attorney. Eli Wallach plays an aged don and Joe Mantegna the gangster Michael put in charge of Little Italy after semi-retiring. Raf Vallone plays a dubious Cardinal and Bridget Fonda a fornicating reporter in a small role.Part III is on par with Part II in tone and quality, but I give this one the edge in overall entertainment value. Michael (Pacino) has much more human dimension here as opposed to his one-note grim depiction in Part II. His scenes confessing his sins to a priest in a Vatican City garden and, later, with Kay in Sicily are good examples. There are several other highlights amidst the drama, like the break-in scene at Vincent's abode, the Atlantic City massacre, the street festival hit, the entire closing opera sequence that juxtaposes the performances of the play with various violent attacks and the aftermath.Andy Garcia brings fresh blood and vitality to the trilogy in a pretty significant role, as does Sofia in a relatively small part. Winona Ryder was originally cast for the part, but she was too sick to perform and so Francis chose his daughter at the last minute and she's fine in the role. Does anyone seriously think Winona Ryder would have taken this peripheral part and done it any better? I heard all the ridiculous criticism over Sofia's performance before viewing the film and therefore kept waiting for a serious train wreck, but it never happened. She did a fine job for a side character who's an unseasoned, slightly self-conscious (i.e. wooden), flirty teen. To those sheeple who have joined the idiotic critical feeding frenzy: Shut the fudge up and get a life!The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Needless to say, Life's hard enough without taking that foolish route.Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with several highlights, but it doesn't rank up there with the first movie, which stands alone. If you're a fan of the first two films it's almost mandatory that you watch this one. It lacks the thrilling greatness of the first film, but it's about equal to the second, although I favor this one a little.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 42 minutes (or 2 hours 50 minutes, the longer version) and was shot in Sicily and numerous places on mainland Italy, including Vatican City; the New York City area; Atlantic City, NJ; and Lake Tahoe, California.

The perfect end to the perfect trilogy ...,"16 years after the last of two brilliant godfather-films, director Francis Ford Coppola returns to complete his thus far unfinished mafia saga. Despite rumours that the final godfather-film is a blemish on an otherwise magnificent tale of organized crime, it is in fact one of the most beautiful films ever made and a story that's just as riveting as any of its predecessors. It once again deals with familiar themes such as corruption, misuse of power, love, respect, remorse and of course the most inevitable of all  death! The endless amount of critique and insults that this film received must have something to do with the many years dividing part II and part III. In those many years the face of American cinema has changed radically. Back in the '70s method-actors like Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were the true kings of the movie industry, but after a couple of years special effects started playing a bigger role in cinema and fantasy figures such as Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, aliens, terminators, gremlins and horror icon Freddy Krueger all became immensely popular and just as important.Amazing is that ""The godfather part III"" didn't change one bit amidst this massive update of modern cinema. Surely: it takes place a few dozen years later, but it seems as though time has stood still. Even so: there are some significant changes to be had. The biggest change of all is how Michael Corleone has transformed from a strong and confident leader to a weak and aging Don desperately trying to deal with his tragic past. At the same time he wants to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld. Method-actor Al Pacino does exceptionally well at acting out emotions with his voice in this final instalment. The last time I watched this film, I actually cried on two different occasions. That's how powerful and genuine his acting really is. The first moment that got to me was the confession of Al Pacino to a priest. Having never shown repent for any of his sins, he suddenly realizes the vast magnitude of his wrong-doings and ultimately breaks down in tears. Even more compelling is the ending of the godfather-trilogy.But Al Pacino isn't the only great actor in this film. Andy Garcia plays his role of a lifetime as Vincent Mancini  the ferocious son of Michael's oldest brother Sonny and unfortunately for anyone involved he shares his father's hot temper. Especially small-time enforcer Joey Zasa seems to enrage him beyond all reason. This character is played by actor Joe Mantegna and he does a very good job. Mantegna would still get the chance to play an actual mob boss but only as the voice of Fat Tony in the highly successful television series ""The Simpsons.""The one person who was attacked the most for her performance was Sofia Coppola; daughter of director Francis Ford. She evidently plays the part of the daughter of Michael Corleone. I have to agree that Sofia is much better behind the camera than in front of it, but to say that her acting was terrible is an overstatement. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are still around playing their eminent characters, but not everybody returns for this third film. Robert Duvall got a little too greedy on his part and that's why his character consigliere Tom Hagen does not return. This is a real pity, but the film has found a very clever way to work around it  so this change is more than satisfactory; I think. Bridget Fonda is also present as a reporter but her role is of no real consequence. Suffice to say, ""The godfather: part III"" has a fabulous cast.In short: Sequels simply don't get any better than this! This masterpiece is just as grand as part I and part II ... everything falls into place - from its wonderful actors to the delightful cinematography - ""The godfather part III"" truly is ... the perfect end to the perfect trilogy!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fitting conclusion to the series,"THE GODFATHER: PART III may not be the best film in the world, but it does serve as a fitting conclusion to the Oscar-winning series. The story (as well as the director and actors) have now moved on 20 years, allowing the narrative a change to explore the differences that age and time have had upon them, making a story that in some aspects feels superior to the second film, which didn't really add much that we didn't know from the original.Coppola's direction is assured as ever, and there are enough returning actors from the original series to make this a joy to watch. The newcomers are also pretty interesting, in particular Andy Garcia, who seems to be channelling Pacino's spirit from the first two movies. I didn't find Sofia Coppola to be distracting in the least, only that the camera is clearly in love with her, which you'd expect given that the director's her father.What I enjoyed most is that the film gets back to the series origins: this one's about corruption in high places, religion, betrayal and violent murder. The characters visit some dark places, which is what we the viewer wish to watch, and the extended opera set-piece works nicely along with the helicopter assault. It also doesn't feel as slow as the admittedly superior second part, which is also a point in its favour.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than people think,"Yes, they should have paid Duvall his quote, and Coppolla should never have cast daughter Sofia in such a pivotal role. Despite these potentially disastrous setbacks, Part III is a far better film than the panning received from critics, particularly when it had to follow the two greatest films ever. Pacino is sensational, ably supported by Keaton, Shire and Mantegna. But it's Garcia's movie, as he channels a combination of the original three Corleone brothers in an Oscar nominated performance.

Did you all watch the same movie i did?,"Honestly, I am baffled with all the negative reviews that I have read for the final part of this timeless classic.

Michael is doing everything in his power to finally turn a new page in his family's life and leave the dark past behind, but soon figures out that things are not as simple as he wishes them to be. We are introduced to a new character, Vincent (Sonny's illegitimate son), who has his father's temper but still menages to find the patience to listen to his wise uncle. The only thing that i really missed in this movie was Robert Duvall's character. Also i have to say that i strongly disagree with the critics who argue that Francis Coppola made a wrong decision by casting his daughter as Michael Corleone's daughter.

Do not blame Anyone,"Brilliant film - Certainly not as good as the first two, but a great conclusion to the Trilogy - almost wish there could be at least one more. Some have criticised Sofia Coppola, as if, she ruined the movie, being an amateur, and not a professional actress. If anything, she was the best thing in it, portraying the pivotal character of Mary Corleone. The same people who have a go at her might even try to claim she ruined Part I - and she only played a baby in that one. If the movie was bad, which it was not, it would be in its overall presentation. There is little wrong with it - perhaps some factual discrepancies, but then these are fictional depictions of events, some of which were based upon true history, like Cardinal Lamberto being a representation of Pope John I. This movie contains many of the elements of the first two, and one guesses it would be compared to them, as it is meant to continue on from them, showing what happened to the Corleone Family after the occurrences shown in the first pair of movies. There is a good mix of drama, intrigue, action and bloodletting, but the film also stands on its own, as if it could have been made in isolation, and not the third instalment of triplets.

It's just not on par with with the first two movies.Plot In A Paragraph: In the final instalment of the Godfather Trilogy, an aging Don Michael Corleone seeks to legitimise his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld.Al Pacino is as watchable as always, Talia Shire puts in another brilliant performance, Bridget Fonda Joe Mantegna and George Hamilton all offer superb support, but while Sofia Coppola is universally panned for her work here, it's Andy Garcia (so good in ""The Untouchables"" and ""When A Man Loves A Woman"") that I find unwatchable.I feel Francis Ford Coppola (who has admitted he did this movie as part of dealing with his personal problems) was hamstrung by a decision made by the struggling studio. According to him, he wanted $6 million, producer, director fee with six months work on the scriptwriting. The studio instead gave him only $1 million in fees and 6 weeks to work on the script in order to meet the Christmas 1990 release. Paramount did approve this movie with a $56 million budget under strict conditions that the final cut of the film must not be less than 140 minutes (to get more screenings per day in cinemas) and any additional expenses would not be covered by the studio.Another problem that was the studio's fault was that the character of Tom Hagen had to be written out of the script because the studio refused to meet Robert Duvall's financial demands when Duvall asked for pay in line with what everyone else was getting. With Hagen gone, an essential character and counterpart for Michael Corleone was missing from the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not bad, but unnecessary third part of the series","I've seen the first two parts a few times each, but never got around to the much-maligned third installment until now. Not that everyone hates it. It was well reviewed and was nominated for Best Picture. It's that one element that garners most of the hate. You know which one. And, I have to say, Ms. Coppola's performance deserves the derision. It's a rare performance - a supporting one, at that - that drags the whole film down a level. She just has no business being in front of a camera. The film after her is hardly perfect, either. Pacino has entered his hammy phase. Keaton is mostly a non-entity. Frankly, the reason to watch, acting-wise, is Andy Garcia, who was the only actor in the film who earned an Oscar nomination. He's usually a bore, but he's excellent here. Talia Shire and Eli Wallach are both pretty good, as well. The film also lacks the focus of the first two films. With all that, though, it's still pretty good. Beautifully produced, of course, and Coppola's directing talent had yet to leave him (by my account, he had one more great film in him, Dracula, before he became worthless).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Massive Improvement,"While Sofia Coppola's performance was notoriously bad, and her relationship with her first cousin kind of creepy, the biggest problem The Godfather Part III had was always that it was billed as a sequel, prompting comparisons to the first two masterpieces. It was always a good film, but it was the worst chapter in the greatest book ever written. The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone fixes this, by cutting out majority of the flashbacks and retitling the film to emphasize that it's not a new chapter of the saga, but rather an epilogue. As well as this, the new beginning and more reflective ending help focus the film and makes it feel tighter, while giving Al Pacino and Andy Garcia more time to shine. All in all, Coda is a massive improvement over The Godfather III. Sofia Coppola's performance is still pretty bad though",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, Not Great Sequel.","Francis Ford Coppola returns as director to complete his crime saga of the Corleones. Film begins many years after Part II, where an aging Michael is determined to legitimize the family business, to finally remove it from the violent setting that has dogged them for so long, but unfortunately his dealings with the Vatican, and challenges from a rival Mafia family once again pull him back into that world, and his attempts to make amends for his past, and find a worthy successor, do not go according to plan.Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, & Talia Shire return, joined by Andy Garcia(very good as Sonny's son) Eli Wallach, and Joe Mantegna. Not a masterpiece like the first two, this does feel overly-stylized and confusing, but nonetheless is still superbly acted, with an interesting story, and fine direction, all leading to a memorable end.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not even close to the first two, but probably not as bad as you've heard.","I recently picked up The Godfather DVD Collection, having seen (and loved) the first two films. I proceeded to watch the first two over again, enjoying every minute almost as much as the first time around. Then I watched the third one, which I had never seen before. I'd heard how bad it was, and how Coppola ruined the series with Part III, so my hopes were less than high, even though the brilliance of the first two films was still fresh in my mind. So I watched it all the way through, trying to keep an unbiased oppinion.Well, it's not great, that's for sure. But I wouldn't call it horrible either. It certainly lacks the wonderful mood and appeal of the first two films, and it doesn't hold together nearly as well. The first two are so masterful that it takes a very keen eye and many repeated viewings to find even the most minute flaws in them. In Part III, there's plenty of cheesy scenes, forced acting and hammy lines. On the other hand, a lot of the scenes were really good. I liked most of the time spent in Rome, especially the confession scene with Michael and the soon-to-be Pope. The construction of the story itself was pretty decent as well, although it's ruined a little bit by some bad acting.The main problem with the story of Part III was that it wasn't about anything the audience really cared about, and it certainly wasn't anything new. Part I gave us the story of an aging Mafia crime boss, who's family goes into chaos when he's shot. And Michael, the moral son who doesn't want to get involved with his families business, but feels it's his duty when he sees the corruption in the law and the government. Part II gave us the continuing story of Michael Corleone, trying to vanquish his enemies, and it also had the side story of Vito Corleone as a young man coming to America and his rise to power. To me the scenes with De Niro as Vito was the best part of Part II, and I don't think the film would've been nearly as great without them. Part III was the story of the aging Michael Corleone, but we'd already seen the same type of thing in Part I. So we start looking for parallels between Parts I and III, but they're just not there. So we start looking for originality and redeeming qualities of Part III on it's own, but we have a hard time looking past some of the flaws.Frankly I just didn't really give a damn about any of the characters in Part III. Michael was an old man, and I could guess he would be dead by the end of the film. Connie had suddenly turned into this hard Mafia consultant, which didn't seem to fit her character from the originals at all. Vincent was basically James Caan's character, Sonny, from the original, only Andy Garcia isn't as good an actor and didn't pull it off as believably. Also it seems hard to believe that Michael would leave the family in the hands of someone so brash and forward as Vincent. The character we were really supposed to care about, Mary, was completely blown by a terrible acting performance by Sofia Coppola, that has to be one of the worst casting calls I've ever seen. I literally laughed at the end (you all know what scene I'm talking about), her acting was just so canned and cheesy it was really pathetic.On an up note, the cinematography was great once again. Although the film didn't have the same play on light and shadowing that the first two had, it did have some amazing shots of Rome and Sicily. The film was very pleasent to look at throughout. The music was also very good, although I think they used Nino Rota's original theme a bit too much.Of course, if you compare Part III to the first two films, your going to come up with tons of problems with it and probably won't like it very much. But on it's own it's a pretty decent movie, there have been tons of better Mafia films (Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco etc..) but it's still alright. What's so disappointing is that the first two are amazing, and the third one is just pretty good. But it says a lot about a series when the worst of the bunch is still a good movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give The Godfather Part III, 6 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Time made sure Godfather III would never get the ratings of the first 2,"The Godfather part III as a stand alone movie was great. I enjoyed it immensely. Not as great as the first two movies but definitely very watchable and a fitting ending to the trilogy.One reason why it's ratings are not as high as the first two is in my opinion due to the 16 year gap between the making of the first two movies and this one. That's a generation skip. You can see the same ratings decline with the Star Wars movies.Movie audiences crave something new all the time and movie studios try to make what they believe the audience want. You can plainly see the cycle of the genres. Right now we're in the middle of super hero cycle, but when was the last time you saw a Western blockbuster? In my opinion it hasn't been since 1992 with Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.If Godfather III was made a few years after the first two while the buzz of the first two was still strong and in the zeitgeist of the populace I believe it would be scoring much higher in IMDb as it does now.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great (though not perfect),"This is a great final installment to a famous trilogy.

I love the dilemma's in it, the drama, the Italian gangster Greek tragedy, the cinematography, the acting by just about everybody, especially Eli Wallach and Al Pacino, the views on Sicily, the involvement of the Vatican etc etc. Even if not entirely perfect, I say: well done.

Watched the 2020 re-edit of this movie,"When the movie stands on its own, it's not so bad, but you have to compare it to Godfather 1 and 2, and that's when the movie becomes pretty poor. This 3rd movie in the series is far 'slower' than the previous two, and much more concentrates on politics and inter-family squabbling which makes for a very slow and almost boring movie (when compared to the previous ones). The performances all round are good but the best actors in the world wouldn't have been able to liven-up this snore-fest of a movie. I'd honestly just recommend watching number 1 and 2, and then calling it a day. If you're really aching for more 'mafia movies' then watch something like Goodfellas or Casino which are both fantastic films.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The acting is second rate, and by the time the plot got rolling, I didn't care.The love scenes were awkward.

The Godfather Part III - A fitting end to the trilogy,"I liked it. Yes, it's a slightly different tone to the first two, but then it is set 25 years into the future, so if it had exactly the same feel as the first two it would have seemed false. However, it still has the deception, music, style and dialogue of the first two. Those things make it pretty special in my opinion.Yes, Sofia Coppola seems out of place even moreso in scenes with Garcia who is so good in this it makes Coppola look even more amateurish. It makes me wonder how good it could have been with a better actress playing Mary.The final hour or so of the film from where Michael speaks to the soon to be Pope is just superb though and matches anything that has gone before. As I said, the ending fits the whole theme of the Godfather movies perfectly. They're all about power, deception, loss, regret and family and in that sense I was ultimately content at the outcome.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A worthy and fitting conclusion,"Not a perfect movie like the first two, but a worthy and appropriate conclusion to the saga.

Part III serves to underscore and complete the great theme of the trilogy: Michael's fatal flaw in not being able to escape the criminal world into which he was born. The women are stronger presences in Part III, compared to the other two, and a more accomplished actress in the role of Mary would have made those presences have even more of an impact. Andy Garcia does a great job, combining the strength of Vito and Michael with the rage of Sonny.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Uneven, but far from worthless.","Nobody's favourite Godfather still has enough to offer to be a worthwhile film. I sort of understand dumping on parts of it, and pointing out the whole thing being inferior to the other two movies, but there's some good stuff here.Anyway, I've seen the other two 4 or 5 times each. The Godfather Part III I'd only ever seen the one time. A local cinema screened parts 1 and 2 last year, but I guess they didn't figure screening Part III was worthwhile. I kind of get it... but also, I think the best thing The Godfather III has going for it is how it looks. Visually, it would've looked great on the big screen.Beyond the look, I also like how this still feels like The Godfather. Having Gordon Willis return to do the cinematography clearly helped. There are some strange edits very occasionally, but I think this film still flows relatively well. You feel the nearly three-hour runtime more than you do with the others, but I like parts of the first act and I've always thought the final act was strange. There's a bit of dragging around the middle, but it's survivable. I think where it ends up is good and worth it. The extended climax is generally effective, tense, and emotional.The negatives are the stuff everyone says. I know there's one performance that gets criticised more than others, but she's not the only cast member here who comes across a bit awkward in some scenes. Enter the less-than-great screenplay... I think, regardless of casting, some of these lines couldn't be said convincingly by anyone.Parts of this film are unintentionally funny, but only very occasionally, and really only during the second act. The film is a little disappointing, but still technically good. I wish it had been better - as good as the others - but I also think this one could've been worse. I lean more positive than negative, but the glaring stuff is hard to overlook at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna make this worth watching.,"I was fortunate to have been given a copy of this film before its release so I knew the story beforehand. Like the two films that preceded it, the story is based on real events and people. In this case, the Vatican and the mysterious death of Pope John Paul I. At this point, Michael Corleone is striving for a clean life in business as a philanthropist but it seems that they pull him back in. Eli Wallach is a.competing Godfather who Connie wants to deal with personally, Michael suddenly gas a half brother with his own violent agenda who is the collegiate son of Sonny Corleone and just as hotheaded. On top of this, he has it in for Joey Zaza, played expertly by Joe Montegna. Unfortunately, Sofia Coppola is absolutely amateurish and dull as Michael's daughter.The problems in this movie really.get in the way towards the end which.seems to go on forever. But, as I have mentioned, Eli Wallach (whom we just lost at 98) and Joe Mantegna make it all worth the price of admission. That, and a stunningly heartbreaking end scene are the high points of this epic.Al Pacino actually gives a measured performance as well.

Aftermath,"16 years after the second Godfather came out, finally the long awaited sequel arrived. And it was received well by the academy, when it comes to the nominations. It didn't win anything, but just the sheer amount of nominations are proof, that they must have done something right. And the movie is good. Al Pacino returning again and playing exceptional as he did in the other movies too. You do wonder why he never won an Oscar for the character of Michael Corleone.Andy Garcia is a welcome addition (even if he mirrors his father Sonny) and not the only thing that reminds or is supposed to be a throwback to the first Godfather. There are many hints at what Pacino does or where he goes that connect this movie to the other movies (even the second one, with the oil company mentioned by Garcias character). So if you have been following the movies, there are many treats for you to be found here.It still concludes the sage that started with the first movie, for better or worse. So while people wanted another movie (and maybe still urge for that), I would tell them to watch the Sopranos. The fact that it's a TV show works for it, because it has more time to develop characters and show you stuff that is tough to put in a movie (even a long one as this here, with almost 3 hours running time). The ending might not be to everyones taste, but I think it suits the trilogy to go out like that ... Whatever that means to you",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I was hoping to see the old explosive temper, and maybe a conflict with Andy Garcia over the love of his daughter? This is stylistically too different from the first two. As a standalone, this is maybe a cable movie at best. I compare this to ""Hannibal,"" it has a similar slow pace and art style. The tension is rather smoothed over and cultured, like a fine Italian cheese..?? Anyway, I found the deal with the Catholic Church to be out of character for Michael.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If you enjoyed the first two, spare yourself the agony of this one","-This movie is awful on two counts: as a finale to the trilogy and as a stand-alone film. This shows in the poor character development, the abundance of meaningless shots, and lastly, and most importantly in my mind, the meaninglessness of the dialogue. -All of the integrity of the characters from the first two Godfathers is completely done away with in the first sequence. -Michael, a taciturn, introverted, calculating megalomaniac in the first two films is lavish, loose-lipped, pathetic in his control over his family, and careless as he never was and never would have been by the first two movies. -Constanza is all of a sudden involved in the family affairs. Joe Mantegna plays a terribly thin enemy of the family, Joey Zasa, but can't be blamed as an actor with such a flimsy script. Andy Garcia overacts every one of Vincent Corleone's lines and every step--he practically goosesteps. Tom Hagan is missing and leaves a giant hole. It doesn't matter that Sofia Coppola can't act, because she had nothing to work with anyway--she plays a whinging, incestuous brat poorly, but convincingly (!). -The first dramatic sequence involves a conflict between Joey Zasa and Vincent mediated by Michael, who is trying to go legit, but can't seem to do it. Vincent tries to convince Michael that Zasa is ""an enemy"" in a very un-Godfatherly manner: a) he does it right in front of Zasa, b) he does so simply because Zasa supposedly says, ""F*ck Michael Corleone,"" behind his back, and c) he disobeys Michael right in the room by biting Zasa's ear off. -This is juvenile drama. There is no tension that lasts longer than a sequence. There is no reason motivating the characters. There is no real respect for anything--all the subtleties of the family traditions are stomped on, which makes the highly visual sequences, loaded with symbols, cheap because the symbols mean nothing to the characters. -The haughty diction is only pretension void of any understanding of respect and the values that drive the family and Michael in particular. Michael, a very chiseled character in the first two movies, becomes paper thin, with no real idea that is central to his action. All his actions in the first movie and the facades he puts on as Don in the second movie show an aspiration to an ideal or, at least, an aspiration to appear as this ideal. He has none of this in the third film and this change of character doesn't happen on screen, nor is it explained. We're left only to believe that Coppola and Puzo tore this one off in a frenzied weekend when the purse got light. -The story lacks direction, focus, has nothing in particular to say, but that's not condemnable unto itself. The dialogue, however, is worthy of a pair of misguided high school kids who watched the first two movies and figured they knew what respect was because they saw one guy shoot another and a bunch of people get scared. None of the dialogue is loaded with the layers of meaning and subtlety that exist in the first two. All the characters are brash and stereotypical, or, in the case of a few, like Enzo the Baker and Bridget Fonda's character, tokens and a waste of celluloid. -Though Godfather III isn't worth its score in Scrabble, it is, however, a testament to Pacino as an actor, that with such flimsy stuff he still manages to act compellingly.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terribly disappointed,"In some ways it was wonderful seeing some of the original cast members (Pacino, Keaton, Shire) reprising their memorable roles.  But in a lot of ways this third installment was just not necessary.  If it was all about revealing Michael's wounded mind, and ensuring that he was 'punished for his sins', that was done (quite well, and in a much less graphic way) in Part II: You could tell he was undone in the very last scene.  Part III was just overkill.There were a few casting problems, as well.  Sofia Coppola was just terrible, absolutely painful to watch.  George Hamilton made the film look like a made-for-TV movie every time he appeared: What was he doing there?? I sure did miss Robert Duvall!

I'd always been curious...,".. about the reasons for the bloodthirsty critical and audience antipathy towards the movie when it came out, besides the obvious ""Heretical"" idea of Al Pacino's post-Scarface ""comeback"" for a twenty-years-later Late-80's classic-movie sequel. The VHS Movement of the late 80's put audiences more in touch with classic films for the first time, and it was easier for an aging Paul Newman to do ""The Color of Money"" or Jack Nicholson to do ""The Two Jakes"". Just as ""Jakes"" pretty much depended on having all of ""Chinatown"" fresh in the memory, most of Godfather III depends on having all of Coppola's ""Godfather Part II"" fresh at hand, as plot lines pick up fresh immediately after a twenty-year break.We see the Corleone Mansion West in ruins, as Pacino's Michael has moved back to NY, and is now pondering end-of-the-road ideas about going straight after complicated deals with the Vatican, which, yes, start hinting at double-crosses from the inside. (And, updating the action to 1979, hints at real-world conspiracy theories over Pope John Paul I.). Son Anthony is now grown up and wants to leave the business and become an opera singer, since he has ""bad memories"" from the end of Godfather II, and Andy Garcia now takes the central subplot as the family's most promising, but dangerously old-school nephew. Basically, if Godfather II became over-mythologized and praised as ""The sequel that was better than the original!"", Godfather III is pretty much just The Sequel You Expected, for good and bad, which could explain most of the overreaction when it came out in theaters.And the elephant in the room: The one reason why, thanks to the Razzie Awards, no one, seen it or not, can talk about Godfather III without giggling, namely Sophia Coppola's performance as daddy's-girl Maria. Given the Razzies' gay celebrity-gossip snickering, I thought they might be overdoing it, and thought ""How bad could it be?"" Yes, the legends are true: She's THAT bad. Sophia basically wanders through Coppola's Italian-opera setting like a contemporary teenager from one of her own movies--Imagine Elizabeth Berridge's jarringly anachronistic 80's-girl voice from ""Amadeus"", only in an emotionless monotone, even in the sudden out-of-nowhere ridiculously overwrought climax in the last ten minutes of the movie, which...no, if I told you, you wouldn't believe me. I think that may have solved the mystery of why this movie stuck in our cultural memory.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

*A Complex Closure*,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather Part III,"" released in 1990, serves as a potent, albeit divisive, conclusion to the iconic Godfather saga that has captivated audiences since its inception. While it does not quite reach the monumental heights of its predecessors, this installment provides a thought-provoking exploration of power, redemption, and family-themes central to the franchise.Set years after the events of the first two films, Michael Corleone, once again portrayed by Al Pacino, finds himself grappling with the consequences of his past decisions. The film dives into the moral complexities of Michael's character, showcasing his attempts to legitimize his business while simultaneously wrestling with the shadows of his criminal empire. Pacino's performance is compelling, capturing the weariness and resolve of a man who is both a powerful leader and a deeply flawed individual.The addition of new characters, including the ambitious Vincent Mancini played by Andy Garcia and the enigmatic Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone, adds layers to the narrative and highlights the generational conflicts within the Corleone family. While some viewers have criticized Sofia Coppola's performance, it's important to appreciate her role in the context of the film's thematic exploration of innocence lost.The film maintains a rich aesthetic, with striking cinematography and a haunting score by composer Nino Rota, further enhancing the emotional gravitas of the story. Coppola's direction masterfully juxtaposes opulence with tragedy, creating a sense of inevitability that permeates the narrative.Overall, ""The Godfather Part III"" offers a contemplative resolution to a legendary tale, urging audiences to reflect on the legacies we inherit and the choices we make. Though it may be viewed as a step down from the groundbreaking first two films, it remains a significant and resonant part of the Godfather legacy, ultimately inviting viewers to ponder whether true redemption is ever attainable in the world of corruption and crime.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I'd always been curious...,".. about the bloodthirsty critical and audience antipathy towards the movie when it came out, besides the obvious ""Heretical"" idea bringing back Al Pacino's post-Scarface ""comeback"" for a twenty-years-later Late-80's classic-movie sequel: Unlike today's studio-franchise attempts to resurrect Ghostbusters and Blade Runner, the VHS Movement of the late 80's put audiences more in touch with classic films for the first time, and it was easier for an aging Paul Newman to do ""The Color of Money"" or Jack Nicholson to do ""The Two Jakes"". Like ""Jakes"" pretty much depended on having all of ""Chinatown"" fresh in the memory, most of Godfather III depends on having all of Coppola's ""Godfather Part II"" fresh at hand, as plot lines pick up fresh immediately after a twenty-year break.We see the Corleone Mansion West in ruins, as Pacino's Michael has moved back to NY, and is now pondering end-of-the-road ideas about going straight after complicated deals with the Vatican, which, yes, start hinting at double-crosses from the inside. (And, updating the action to 1979, hints at real-world conspiracy theories over Pope John Paul I.). Son Anthony is now grown up and wants to leave the business and become an opera singer, since he has ""bad memories"" from the end of Godfather II, and Andy Garcia now takes the central subplot as the family's most promising, but dangerously old-school nephew. Basically, if Godfather II became over-mythologized and praised as ""The sequel that was better than the original!"", Godfather III is pretty much just The Sequel You Expected, for good and bad, which could explain most of the overreaction when it came out in theaters.And the elephant in the room: The one reason why, thanks to the Razzie Awards, no one, seen it or not, can talk about Godfather III without giggling, namely Sophia Coppola's performance as daddy's-girl Maria. Given the Razzies' gay celebrity-gossip snickering, I thought they might be overdoing it, and thought ""How bad could it be?"" Yes, the legends are true: She's THAT bad. Sophia basically wanders through Coppola's Italian-opera setting like a contemporary teenager from one of her own movies--Imagine Elizabeth Berridge's jarringly anachronistic 80's-girl voice from ""Amadeus"", only in an emotionless monotone, even in the sudden out-of-nowhere ridiculously overwrought climax in the last ten minutes of the movie, which...no, if I told you, you wouldn't believe me. I think that may have solved the mystery of why this movie stuck in our cultural memory.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The horror, the horror","On its own, this film would be merely mediocre.  But in contrast to Godfather I and II, and as a film marketed as part of a trilogy, it is a travesty.  From the vanity casting of Sophia Coppola, to the stupefyingly boring subplot of the Vatican banking scandal, to the all-sunshiney cinematography, to the sophomoric references to King Lear, it is on a much lower plane than Coppola's earlier films.  The boxed set is like getting Citizen Kane, Chinatown and Porky's III as a trilogy.  Not to mention the fact that the beginning of Godfather III is inconsistent with the ending of Godfather II. The recent news story that a Godfather IV is in the offing is, after the invasion of Kosovo, the worst news I've heard this year.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Godfather Part III,"Well done finale to the fantastic saga of the Corleone family with Coppola's daughter Sofia being the only weak link in the acting area. Garcia is brilliant and carries the same vigor and power as Caan before him. Pacino still has that touch as Michael, now in his later years. The film moves along briskly and features great support from Mantegna, Wallach and a surprisingly well used George Hamilton. Wasn't as big a hit at the Oscars as the first two installments, but the saga is still one of the most important series of films ever made.",,Anonymous,Crime
A lot better than people say it is,"This is a really good movie. You have to pay attention so you know what the story line is exactly, which is difficult when it gets slightly boring in the middle. I really like how Pacino's voice is sounding heaps more like Marlon Brando did in Part I. He most likely did that on purpose, but I can't be sure, because his voice is naturally like that. Andy Garcia was the perfect choice for Sonny's illegitimate son, because he acts exactly like Sonny did - self confident, acting without thinking of the repercussions, and taking everything personally. I particularly like the scene that flashes back to when Michael decided to enlist in the marines.I gave this 8/10, taking off 2 because Sophia Coppolla can't act. It was quite painful to watch her.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not Bad But Still The Last In The Trilogy Best List,"""The Corleone Family is getting old and getting less terrifying than the first two, replacing with their own son and godfather son, turn down to be an awkward cousins love relationship, but at least they still know what's wrong what's right in the end, The Godfather Part III is still have that moment, the movie still have that power, and ended with a very well done ending, The Godfather Part III is not a bad movie but still the last in the trilogy best list""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Al Pacino was brilliant as always, Andy Garcia did a fine job,(and looked great, I might add), Diane Keaton was great too and everyone else was well cast.  EXCEPT Sofia Coppolla.

"Not as good as the first two parts, but a good enough film","While I loved the first, thought the second was equally as good, though a bit redundant and unnecessary(apart from Vito's back-story, and possibly the further development of Kay and Michael's relationship), this one just didn't reach the high level of the first two. It obviously tries, but I don't really think there was that much left to tell of the Corleone family. The cast members who were in the previous two films(that don't appear in this one) are sorely missed; the first had Marlon Brando himself, the second had Robert De Niro... what does this one have going for it, really? Only a few new characters, none of them particularly memorable, and only a few of them well-acted. I'll say it right now; I do not consider Sofia Coppola an actress. I've heard she did a great job directing Lost in Translation(which I haven't seen yet, but will see as soon as possible), but she can't act. Luckily, there aren't that many scenes that require her to, but still, the ones that do require her to put some emotion into it she totally screws up with her lack of acting capability. The few actors who reprise their old roles give as great performances as they did in the first two, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Richard Bright; all great. I liked the addition of Andy Garcia, he did a great job as well. So did Bridget Fonda, but she didn't have very much screen time to prove her talent. The script is decent enough, I just found myself questioning it a little too much; it seemed like they were running out of ideas for starting mob wars, and just figured they'd put a lot of characters in the film, have them interact, and finally kill them off. I'm not saying it's downright bad, the script(or the film, for that matter), I'm just saying it's not at all as good as the scripts of the first two parts. The plot is decent, but it halted too much, especially the last half hour; I had almost entirely lost interest by then, and the climax was just slightly anti-climactic, at best. The actual end was good, but the entire climax sequence was far too long and confusing to be genuinely exciting or thrilling. The acting was mostly good, with the four leads being great(Pacino, Keaton, Shire and Garcia). The characters were reasonably well-written. All in all, the film is worth watching, I guess, but only for those who want closure to the Godfather story. I recommend it pretty much only to the biggest fans of Godfather, as it can be easily ignored with no big loss. Also, you could watch it and just consider it a stand-alone film, with no relation to the far superior first two parts. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
More about family,"In my opinion, the success of the first two parts of the balance between crime and family was that this balance was broken in this film.The first reason is that in the first two films, we are faced with a larger and better-organized family, but in this film, it was less colorful.It is true that the causes of gangsterism caused problems in the family, but it was not very satisfactory.Maybe one of my mistakes is to compare this movie with the previous two episodes, but the atmosphere of the previous two episodes was more attractive and it is impossible not to make this comparison.But the thing that I liked more than the previous two episodes was that the main character was changed again, that is, in each episode we face a new face.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Casting Coup,"I've read a lot of the bad reviews about this film and couldn't disagree more. In my opinion, this is a brilliant film that relies mainly on casting for its success. While the plot is a bit disjointed in places, the gaps make the viewer think more. I thought the Vatican scenes were a bit of a yawn and seemed to stray a bit from the main Hamlet-like theme (i.e., torment, guilt from the past). (Too bad, could have been a perfect setting to spook Michael with Fredo's ghost or Jesus on the cross or something. I could have seen him do a collapse routine overcome with guilt.) Michael's carefully chosen words clearly speak louder than the violent actions of his younger days as an ambitious mobster. Likewise, his restraint in dealing with enemies contrast with the hubris of his younger days. All the other characters revolve in his world and react to him. Everyone in the film looked Sicilian or Italian and were very believable. Eli The Ugly did not disappoint, reprising his role as the villainous worm he was in the spaghetti western genre. Perhaps he represents the mobster in grotesque, what Michael could have become if he did not have his family. I'm also amazed that Sofia Coppola was so good in this film! I think the criticism of her was off base and maybe just a little envious that a director's daughter could step in and do so well. I guess sometimes talent does run in the family. This movie is all about the journey of life and fragility of human existence, where a life can end in an instant and a tough guy can be brought to tears. It is a classic film evoking primal elements not unlike 2001. Part III completes the trilogy in a big way. It is a must see film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Godfather's Disastrous Finale: A Trainwreck Worthy of Sofia Coppola's Legacy,"The Godfather as a closing sequel? Oh, sorry, but I must vehemently reject that proposition! Honestly, I deeply cherished the two films before, but this time, Sofia Coppola came in and ruined everything. It seems like her father, Francis Ford Coppola, handed her the wrong chance by giving her a role in this iconic film. But forgive me, Sofia, your acting felt like a lifeless zombie, devoid of emotions and purpose. Perhaps, some acting classes would have been more fitting than casting you in such a monumental film.And what on earth happened to the storyline of this film? I felt like wandering in a desert without water. All the plot twists felt like passing winds, leaving no impact whatsoever. Honestly, I'm still puzzled about what this film actually aimed to convey. Maybe, there's a hidden message about how impoverished and meaningless Sofia Coppola's presence was in this film.And don't let me start on the damnation of this nightmare! It seems like I'll be haunted forever by those melancholic moments in this film. Who would have thought that a film supposed to conclude an epic trilogy would make me yearn for tears?Perhaps, we should save ourselves and reject Sofia Coppola's presence in future films. We need intricate, creative, and ingenious stories, not just a facade for family promotion. Let's hope that our cinema will be filled with satisfying films that won't make us want to close our eyes and flee from the screen. I am ready for the wonders of cinema, not nightmarish dreams like this.",,Anonymous,Crime

Definitely the least one out of the series but still a more than great movie.,"It all isn't quite good enough to considering this movie a true classic, especially when you compare this one to its previous two predecessors. Out of the Godfather-trilogy this movie is also definitely the least great one but that of course really does not mean that this is a bad movie. Far from it of course really.I still see ""The Godfather: Part III"" as a great movie to end the saga. It ties up the loose ends and shows how the characters from the first two movies end up eventually, in the more modern world and age of the late '70's.It's quite amazing that this movie got made 14 years after the previous Godfather movie but it still manages to maintain the same type of atmosphere and overall cinematic style, even when this movie is set in an entirely different time frame as well, as from the previous two movies. I think that's also way there is simply no way hating this movie when you've already loved watching the previous two movies, even though when this still remains a much hated and criticized movie, which just seems to be simply because of the fact that this movie isn't quite as good as the previous two masterpieces out of the series.It was also great to see that after 14 years basically every actor was willing to reprise his role again from the previous- or the first two movies. Even persons who played some very small roles return in this movie again, except for Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who was demanding too much to reprise his role again. His character is being replaced by a new one, played by George Hamilton. Hamilton is of course not the only new big name in this movie. Andy Garcia, Joe Mantegna and Eli Wallach are all some welcomed new additions to the cast. Garcia even earned his, so far, only Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. And yes well about Sofia Coppola. She simply is no actress and there should had been no way that she should had been in this movie but her character and her plot line with the Garcia character all play a fairly small part, considering that the story is build up out of many different story lines, which all brilliantly come together in the final sequence.""The Godfather: Part III"" is well written and it has a great main premise of the Corleone family trying to legitimize their business. But just when they thought they were out, they get pulled back right in, when different characters from different corners try to take advantage of the situation, business and money-wise. Perhaps it's due to the fact that this is the first Godfather movie that is not being based on a Mario Puzo novel but I feel that out of the three Godfather movies the story in this one works out the best, from a cinematic perspective. It's definitely really a movie written for the screen, which had still Mario Puzo involved as the writer of the screenplay, along with the director Francis Ford Coppola.Just like the previous the previous two movies, this movie as well as some great memorable sequences in it, which not in the least are due thanks to the great acting in the movie. It's a movie that got nominated for 7 Oscar's, including best picture, but eventually it won none. It was up against movies like ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Ghost"" and ""Awekenings"" that year, so it's no big shame that it won none. It at least says nothing about the great qualities of this movie.A great fitting movie to end the Godfather trilogy.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good film,"Good film. In sum, Michael Corleone, wants to get respectable, recognized by the catholic church and world influential. So he tries to donate big quantities of money to the Vatican bank in exchange of a majority share in the Vatican's real estate institution. He fails at first but goes on and tries to find the invisible ways into the labyrinth. So he makes friends with as many people as possible in the financial, religious and political circles around the church. He finds out he has to go to Sicilia to get in touch with an important cardinal who is actually elected Pope, but does not last more than a few months. They have special teas that make you sleep very long in the Vatican. But this third part shows a great evolution of the Sicilian-American and Italian-American communities in the US. Violence is becoming less and less easy in the US. They have to respect the law and law-enforcing institutions are too strong and powerful for them to be neglected or under-evaluated. Then there is a shift in that mafia violence. The Corleones going to Sicilia, among other things to take part in the first operatic production of Michael's own son who is an opera tenor, violence catches them up and Sicilia becomes the theatre of what they can't do in the US any more. And once again Michael goes through and is well protected by the men of his nephew who he has just appointed his successor, and also by chance. The final gun directed at him cannot be prevented from firing, though the assassin will be shot back on the spot by the new Don Corleone, but Michael is once again lucky and the bullet does not reach him.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Weaker than the first two, but that's hardly a fault","'The Godfather' and its first sequel, 'The Godfather: Part II', are both hailed as two of the best films ever made (with the first sometimes considered the very best). A couple decades after them, it was given a proper ending/'epilogue' with 'The Godfather: Part III'.While the first two dealt with the rise of Michael Corleone, this deals with his fall. Wrecked by guilt at all his wrongdoings and his strained relationship with his ex-wife and children, he attempts to repent for his sins while also taking in his illegitimate nephew as his successor within the mafia business.As one can expect, things don't go right. A tale of betrayal, murder and power hunger unfolds.The movie retains much of the great cast of the first two. Al Pacino is great as ever playing Michael Corleone, now in a much more emotionally pained and fragile vision than the ruthless kingpin he was in the second. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire also return well (Keaton more so, while Shire does get annoying at times), and the entire supporting cast (where Eli Wallach in special shines) is great. Andy Garcia is also good, though he doesn't shine (which is made worse by the fact Robert Duvall didn't return).The film also retains the sophisticated atmosphere of the first two. And their excellent soundtrack, excellent directing and pacing, and dialogues.On the other hand, it still falls short of living up to the expectations. It ends up too continuity based; it is almost impossible to understand it well without knowledge of the first two films. A good deal of what made 'The Godfather: Part II' such a masterpiece was exactly the fact it didn't rely on the first; it could stand on its own.'The Godfather: Part III' would be a mess if you take it for itself.Another problem was Coppola's usual nepotistic tendencies. It is common of his to cast his relatives in his films, though usually in minor roles (he did that in the first two). This time he went overboard: rather than search for a new actress once Wynona Rider withdrew, he decided to cast his own daughter for the major role of Mary Corleone (Michael's daughter). She is an amateur, no wonder her acting career didn't pick up; she is still watchable, yes, but her scenes lose so much of intensity and believability she could have single-handedly sunk a lesser film.So, despite not being the masterpiece 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather: Part II' were, 'The Godfather: Part III' is still a terrific film. It just suffers from the absurd expectations the first two generated.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

But it strays other, unfortunate directions.The Diane Keaton scenes are forced. She speaks in expository dialogue that is meant to stir memories and feelings from the previous Godfather films. She never sounds like a real human in a real situation.Sofia Coppola's acting is adequate in some scenes, but stilted and lifeless in others. It is some of the worst acting I've seen in an expensive motion picture from a major film studio. It reminded of the acting in Godzilla films, when the voices are unconvincingly dubbed in English. Worse still, she was cast alongside Al Pacino, so her acting is being compared against one of the greatest actors in the history of film.Andy Garcia's character is arrogant and hotheaded and unsympathetic, he is never believable as a member of the Corleone family, and his storyline involving a romantic relationship with his first cousin is creepy, inappropriate and pointless.The helicopter scene is impressive and exciting shockingly violent, but it feels like it belongs in an 80's action film, not a Godfather movie.The cinematography and directing is cinematic and beautiful in some scenes, and in others looks like a TV movie.Michael's confession is the best scene in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a great looking film though I thought, colours look rich and warm and it has a lovely film like look.

"Coppola Must Run on Frantic Drama, Frustration, Violence and Seemingly Nothing Else In His Life To Make a Great Film","The third chapter in this everlasting series of films is certainly the saddest of the trilogy, because as well as being an impression of characterizations and events from mob history, such as mob-related conspiracy behind the death of Pope John Paul I and Joey Zasa (played entertainingly by Joe Mantegna) being a creatively ironic amalgam of two real-life gangsters who hated each other, it is also a study of Michael Corleone, now a middle-aged man who did not foresee such regret and remorse for his ruthless conquests in the previous films. In his attempts to use the wealth and power he has gained from those bloody triumphs, he tries to cleanse his family name, under the quietly desperate delusion that it is not an exercise in futility. For if it were not, there would be no opposition for his extensive criminal history to the landmark international real estate deal he works to seal. Nor would his old New York partners want in on the deal, an affair that tips the first domino in a succession of violence, betrayal, and scandal amongst the highest of statuses (stati?).Though there was great reluctance from Coppola to make a third installment, which was greenlit for the sake of understandably anticipated box office returns, it becomes an important part of the story of the Corleone family, even if it does not measure up to its two immortal predecessors. We see the modern effects of the conservation of the preceding generations. Michael suffers for his father's legacy, and Michael's stubbornness to preserve his own, though it has grown weather-beaten by the time during which the film takes place, has created a barrier of communication between himself and his wife and children, a classic senior having planned a much different future than he's received. Even Talia Shire's character, Connie, Michael's sister, is a completely different person in this movie than she was in the last. It is not a poor characterization but a very realistic one, as a woman from that generation who has resigned herself to the life into which she was born. There is no mention from her of Michael's order of her husband's death, for instance. She is not the meek, vulnerable soul she was before but astonishingly transformed into a highly competent adviser to her brother.However, even despite Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana being a cherry on top of the most beautiful musical theme in the history of film, the movie is inarguably the weakest of the three Godfather films. There is hardly a way of defending the idea that it surpasses or even equals its predecessors, which in the case of both had such a distinctly powerful touch not only at the helm but in the case of all departments. Here, the dialogue is weak with typical final-chapter-in-American-trilogy visibly scripted wisdom. I also have a hard time understanding why Andy Garcia, a Cuban, was cast as an Italian when so many hot-blooded young Italian actors could have played that role just as well as he did. Those are flaws some can accept and others have a difficult time accepting, and one cannot complain directly about Garcia's performance. (Besides, his father Sonny was played by James Caan and his grandfather by Marlon Brando, neither of whom are Italian.) The inextricable misnomer is one of the most well-known in contemporary cinema history, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Mary, Michael's daughter. I will not plunge into criticism because I know the poor girl suffered quite enough at the time, what with the Razzie awards, countless notices, and other such humiliating things. I am glad she was able to redeem herself by becoming a director like her father, a completely different style all her own, not plainly influenced by Francis, an unaffected subtlety as opposed to his inherent need to outdo himself, which brings me to another thought on this film's weakness.The Godfather Part III, now that I've rewatched it as a grown person and refreshed my memory and understanding of it, has supplied me with a theory as to the striking inconsistency in Coppola's filmography. In the 1970s, he made the first two Godfathers and Apocalypse Now, showered with giant personal, political, and artistic obstacles that in some cases almost literally destroyed him. The Conversation was made entirely from scratch. These films are his great works. After Apocalypse Now, the quality of his films took a major nosedive and even now, as he has recently returned to the director's chair with Youth Without Youth, he cannot seem to regain his aim. Godfather III is very telling. In comparison to the danger, conflicts and drama throughout the first two productions, Part III was a walk in the park. He had to fight for those films and that passion is what made them so incredible. Part III was handed to him, and because it was the other way around entirely, he had a hard time committing to the project, thus the film is clearly made with much less ardor and feeling, though the set design and atmosphere are still not one ounce short of top-notch. Coppola must run on frantic drama, frustration, violence and seemingly nothing else to make a great film. However, considering the relatively peaceful circumstances of Part III's production, he succeeded to a good extent.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Original is Better than Coda Recut,"The gist: ""Coda"" felt like a made-for-TV release of the film. The original beginning and end are superior to the bland versions in ""Coda."" It also cut all of the church scenes, which were essential to the spirit of the film.Many dislike ""The Godfather III,"" but a few appreciate it as a masterpiece of late '80s/early '90s cinema and a satisfying end to the Michael Corleone story. It earned seven Oscar nominations. Andy Garcia gave a tour de force performance, earning him a Best Supporting Actor nomination, and yet the Oscar-worthy performance by Pacino was overlooked by the Academy.The director, Francis Ford Coppola, released a recut with a new title, ""Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone,"" which is what Coppola originally wanted to title it. Aptly so, since ""coda"" in Italian means epilogue, and this film was not trying to be like the first two, any more than an epilogue of a book tries to recapture the entirety of the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Pacino is great, Coppola's direction masterful, but plot is complex and full of holes","I did a three-consecutive-night binge watch of Godfather, Godfather II and this, Godfather III (the Coda version).After the first two, Coda is a mild disappointment. Yes, the same beautiful sets and locations. Pacino is wonderful again. There is a strong supporting cast, with a few notable exceptions. And many memorable scenes. Coppola's direction is masterful. He has produced a film that is a visual treat.But wow, the story itself is a mess, with key points not explained, relationships not at all clear. Motivations murky.It all starts in 1979, ten years after the Godfather II ends. Pacino's Don Corleone is in his early 60s, suffering health problems, and feeling guilty about his life of crime. He's turned in to a mega-donor to Catholic charities, and is obsessed with morphing the family's businesses into a legitimate empire.He puts in a $600 million (about $1.8 billion in 2023 dollars) tender offer for an Italian real estate venture controlled by the Vatican. Thanks to corruption, the Vatican bank, headed by a Corleone ally and Catholic cardinal, needs the money to stay solvent.From there we go through crosses and double crosses. An attempt by the American mafia families to get in on the action. The buy out of their casino interests in Vegas and Atlantic City (Trump's now demolished casino is the backdrop for a meeting of the crime families). A new pope's short-lived efforts to clean up the financial mess in the church.There are also two subplots involving the Don's bastard nephew, Vincent (Andy Garcia), his ambitions, and his romantic relationship with Mary Corleone (Sophia Coppola), Michael's daughter and Vincent's first cousin.But so much is not explained. There is almost no reflection by anyone on the Vincent / Mary relationship other than it is ""dangerous"" according to Michael, and that he disapproves.Sophia got lots of criticism for her bland acting, but you know what? It is such a nothing role a strong actor would have been wasted.Vincent also has a running conflict with low level mafia boss Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) but that's not explained at all.And who tried to kill the crime family bosses? And why? Why is there a contract out on Michael? What is Don Altabello's (Eli Wallach) beef?What is the mysterious Luchesi character up to? What is his real role? Wikipedia says that he is head of the real estate company that Michael is trying to buy. But the Coda version does not explain that at all. And how did the bank scam work? The business plot in Coda has more holes than a Dunkin' store at 6 AM.Redeeming all of this are some fine performances by Pacino and supporting cast. The glaring exception is a badly miscast George Hamilton as the new mob lawyer and presumably the Tom Hagan (Robert Duvall) replacement. Hagan's disappearance is never explained. Hamilton when he appears - thankfully it's a small role - gives the movie a bit of a cheesy, cheap, TV vibe.Diane Keaton is back as the Don's ex-wife, Kay. They had a bitter split at the end of Part II but now they are seemingly best friends. Why? How did that happen?Connie, Michael's sister, is also here. But her transformation is the most remarkable and most mystifying. Over the course of the three films she transitioned from loving, conventional housewife and mom, to trashy, serial marriage-and divorce floosy, to now, in Part III a sort of an assistant Don, a dragon lady actually ordering executions. How? Why?I must say the last 30 minutes and the opera scenes in Palermo are very satisfying if a bit over the top. So redemption points there.So watch this for the cinematography, direction, sets and scenery, costumes, upscale melodrama and Pacino. But plot? Fuhgettaboutit.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

After Thoughts,"After having heard a lot of people talk about how bad this movie is, I'm pretty confused why they think it is. Like it is definitely the weakest of the Godfather Trilogy, but it's not bad. I know there was some behind the scenes issues with them not wanting to pay Robert Duval enough money. But other than some dry acting I thought the film was pretty solid. I think Al Pacino is still outstanding and Andy Garcia was a great addition to the cast. There was some dry acting in the film and I really missed the local Italian culture that was portrayed in the previous two films. But overall very solid and make to me The Godfather one of the strongest Trilogies out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Embarrassingly bad in some respects,"The flaws in this picture are well-known but I'll start with some other noticeable, less mentioned incongruities: why does Talia Shire's character Connie all of a sudden has a heavy Brooklyn accent in contrast to the first 2 films? Her accent sounded terribly out of place and was a distraction. Coppola should have corrected this. Also, I noticed a lot of double-breasted suits and longish hair on some male characters. I don't remember this style as being popular in the late 70's---more like the time around when the film was made. One more: the gratuitously violent ""hit"" scene in Atlantic City. That was something more akin to an B-movie action director rather than a great auteur like Coppola who I consider to be a modern-day Orson Welles in many respects. Coppola's body of work (i.e. ""Tucker"" and ""The Cotton Club"") will one day be appreciated just like Welles' work is finally getting its recognition. Unfortunately the appreciation usually happens when you're dead. Another misstep, in my opinion, were the constant flashback scenes from the previous films. I mean--everyone knows these by heart by now. There was no need to show these flashbacks--unless they were meant as filler.Now for the major mistakes: Robert Duvall's absence hurt badly. Duvall allegedly told Coppola: ""Let's be honest, this is not about art. It's about money,"" which was obviously true. Why didn't they just pay Duvall the money? Because of Duvall's absence, the script was overhauled. I am curious what the film would have been like had Duvall accepted. Despite his absence, George Hamilton did a very nice job as the Corleone's WASP lawyer (an interesting side note: maybe Coppola thought that the final product would be better since Robert Castellano was supposed to be in Part II, but asked for too much money and was written out of the script. A fascinating tidbit was that Castellano was the highest paid actor in ""The Godfather"").My apologies to Coppola about the flack he tolerated about his daughter's inclusion in this film and her ""performance."" But let's be real, Andy Garcia falling for her? And speaking of bad acting, Eli Wallach should be tried in court for the most egregious crime of overacting. I think the long layoff after Godfather Part II made Coppola's casting skills atrophy a bit, not unlike George Lucas's casting mistakes a few years later in the Star Wars prequels.Even more painful than Soffia's addition was the lousy dialogue, especially between Michael and Kay. Every attempt was made to ""hit the home run"" and give her the one-line zingers that were quite frankly painfully embarrassing to watch.I think it's a shame because the nucleus of the film--about corruption in the Vatican and the possible murder of a pope was very intriguing and done properly, this could have been a great film. Unfortunately it could only be called fair at best.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Exquisite Coppola,"It is in Coppola that I think we see the direction and spin Welles put on American cinema in it's most vivid survival. The multi-layering, the richness of texture. What Welles says about his films could go for Coppola's too. When someone called Welles' films 'baroque', he explained that for him when the texture of film becomes too thin, it becomes dead. Coppola must feel this way too. And when the still moments occur in Coppola, and there are many treasurable moments of stillness and reflection, there is still much going on in the frame, much to watch, subtexts and contexts to let wash over you. In other words, stillness, but not emptiness.I think they are all wrong about Sofia Coppola's part in this. If she had played her character in a higher key, a more ""real life"" key, she would have been written off as a stridently irritating valley girl. She plays a self-conscious young woman in development somewhere between awkward wall-flower and blossoming social butterfly, and she plays it to a T, I believe. Low key. Why not? I guarantee you, three hours of anything else would have been too much. Her performance may have come out of talks with the director, or it may have been her good-sense intuitive playing. But whichever, I think the word ""shrewd"" can be applied accurately to the way she acts and is used here.I prefer this third installment to the second, by the way. The third film achieves and sustains an overwhelming crescendo and haunting coda for the series. Taken as a unit, these 3 films form one of the stunning achievements of the American cinema. 10 stars for each Godfather film, this one no exception.",,Anonymous,Crime
"After two masterpieces, Coppola should have quit while he was ahead","I have seen all three Godfather films numerous times. A few days ago, I watched all of them in succession, and found that my opinions have changed very little over the years. The major flaws of GF3 are that it is at least 45 minutes too long; Sofia Coppola's poor performance, and a screenplay that isn't in the same class to the two predecessors. At times the film was close to boring, especially the amount of time when Michael shows Kay Sicily. The climatic sequence at the Opera is also drags to the point where I was muttering to myself, ""Get it over with!"". In the earlier version, at the end, an old Michael is sitting in the sun and putting on sunglasses when he topples out of the chair and falls to the ground presumably dead. In the newer version, it ends with Michael putting on his glasses. Why the change? It makes no sense to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good ending to the Corleone saga not as bad as I thought,Michael Corleone's plan to finally legitimize the family don't work out as he planned as he finds out the Vatican stock brokers are just as crooked and not happening matters is Sonny's illegitimate hot head son Vincent Mancini who Michael takes a liking to and chooses as his heir the new head of the family but Michael's daughter Mary falls for her first cousin something Michael is not to happy about. I thought the storyline was very good and I can see why it got 7 academy award nominations and I think Andy Garcia should have won an Oscar. I don't understand why some critics think part three wasn't as good as the first two I think it was a masterpiece and I look forward someday to them finally making The Godfather Part 4 and continuing the rise of Don Vincenzo Corleone they could even maybe show flashback scenes of how his father Sonny got into the family business something of a plot like Part 2 mixing two stories together Vincent's and Sonny's and they could even have someone like Leonardo DiCaprio playing the young Sonny I think it would work.hope to see it happen maybe they could even start the movie with Michael's funeral.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
PLEASE !! Let there be another installment of The Godfather.,"The story of the Godfather is another giant piece of gold wanting to be found. I believe if another sequel were to be made, like a continuation of the 1990 Godfather part 3,with a brilliant writer to put down the script and the right Director to put it into motion, l think it would be without doubt a marvellous project. Especially if the story were to continue following the death of Michael Corleone and the rise of Vincent Corleone, If the story were to be centred around the life of Vincent Corleone after 31 years since the incident that left the Corleone family devastated. Now Vincent, an ageing Don with a family of his own. And another Don hell bent on revenge say Don Altobello's son or Don Luchessi's son or Hyman Roth's son or any son of one of Michael Corleone's Powerful enemies. And also, who'll take the throne as Vincent's successor. The first trailer of the movie should show the Corleone family catacombs with names, birth and death dates. Something similar to Gary Ross's (2018) Ocean 8 when Debbie Ocean played by Sandra Bullock visits her brother Danny Ocean played by George Clooney where he was buried. Or in Zack Snyder's (2016) Batman Vs Superman showing where Bruce Wayne's (played by Ben affleck) mom and dad were buried.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Complete Abomination,"Part III is dead in the water in every way. It's derivative in plot outline from the first two films; it has some awful acting stints by Pacino, Sophia Coppola, & Talia Shire, among others; and it insults the Catholic Church by positing as truth the murder of a pope. Critics have been way too indulgent with this dog! The Godfather saga seemed appropriately concluded at the end of Part II, when we're left with a heartless Michael aging alone in his blustery Tahoe home. That haunting scene is jettisoned in Part III when we're re-introduced to a redeemed, conscience-stricken Michael. Also, Pacino was the master of understatement in the first two films, so that when he exploded, you took notice. In Part III, alas, he's still stuck in his shouting, out-of-control acting schtick (see ""Heat"" for more of that).Supposedly the future shoplifting Winona Ryder bowed out of III: but why, oh why would Coppola replace her with his talentless daughter? It's a key role, and her non-performance further taints the film. Stick to the first two!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The word ""bomb"" is an understatement.","This was one of the biggest disappointments ever to hit the silver screen, and please don't blame Sofia - she was the least of its troubles. It was almost like the creators intentionally set out to make this movie bad, for a number of reasons:1) No plot: What exactly was this film about? Something to do with the Vatican banking scandal, I think. (Yawn) Wake me when it's over.2) Lack of continuity with the first two films: Parts I and II told interesting and believable stories. I have no idea what this film was trying to say. Even though you had all the familiar faces, the story didn't really fit with the last images we saw of Michael sitting on the shores of Lake Tahoe in the 1974 film. There were a few places in which this film looked like it was trying to make a weak attempt at borrowing from Goodfellas - which came out the same year. Why? Goodfellas was a completely different kind of film. There was no need to steal from it (and no pun intended).3) Spending all that money to get back Diane Keaton: Again, why? Her character was basically written out in Part II. A rekindling of their romance, however mild, was not only a distraction but also not credible.4) Not spending the money to get back Robert Duvall: On the other hand, the Tom Hagen character was still important to the saga, and could have been used in interesting ways (e.g., suppose Tom had betrayed Michael as well, only in a more complex manner?). Duvall should have been in this film. Instead, they used...5) George Hamilton: They had to be kidding on this one.6) Changes to the Talia Shire character: Connie as a Sicilian Ma Barker was an even bigger joke. By the way, if she was so sinister, wouldn't she have had enough brains to figure out what really happened to Fredo?7) Underdeveloped Andy Garcia, Joe Mantegna, Eli Wallach, and  John Savage characters: Especially Savage as Tom Hagen's son, whose brief appearances were a total mystery (was his character originally conceived as having a more critical role in the story?). All around, there was just too much wasted talent in this film.8) Lack of original music - It borrowed too much from the first two films. The stroll down ""Michael's Memory Lane"" while the son performed a rendition of ""Speak Softly, Love"" almost made me want to stroll out of the theater. The use of the Intermezzo during the credits was stolen (pun intended this time) from Raging Bull, which further suggests that Coppola had Scorsese on his mind.9) The End: The creators should have had the ""guts"" to kill off Michael by means of a climactic ambush, not an anticlimactic stroke or heart attack (that last scene reminded me of Artie Johnson's routine in Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In). The death of the daughter meant nothing to the audience.10) Laying the seeds for Godfather IV - Lord help us; I think I would be more intrigued by Rocky XVIII.*  *  *When they were making this film, I remember reading somewhere that its plot was supposed to be a modern-day, organized crime version of the Cataline Conspiracy. That, intertwined perhaps with the story of the fall of a real-life mobster for Pacino's character, would have made for a fascinating film, even better than the first two. Instead, we were left with a movie so bad, it even tarnishes the reputation of the first two films to some degree. Alas, whatever Coppolla had back in the 70s, he no longer had it when he made this film.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Yes, it does feel more like a coda to a big orchestra rather than a third act to one of the grandest stories ever told, but ""The Godfather: Part III"" does work as a whole","What definitely personifies best the separation of the first two films in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" trilogy and the third and final entry is the Hollywood Greed Syndrome, which was spawned in 1977 following the release of ""Star Wars."" The first two movies were made before this event, in which Hollywood allowed ambitious directors to go after making the next big American movie. But ""The Godfather: Part III"" was released post-""Star Wars,"" from which the movie industry has yet to escape, in which the sole concern is making the next big American hit. Nevertheless, even though it is a lackluster companion piece to its predecessors, ""The Godfather: Part III"" does work as a crime drama. Its dicey and uneven, but it does work.Quite some time has passed since the end of the second movie. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, still great) is now an old man, his family's empire has lost a lot of power, many of his old friends have gone, and a lot of his own family has distanced themselves from him. As he attempts to mend fences in his personal life, Michael also tries to control his temperamental nephew (Andy Garcia) and prevent another mafia war from erupting.The strongest aspect of ""The Godfather: Part III,"" I think its general function as a nostalgia trip. It almost seems as if Coppola realized that he wasn't going to be able to make a third masterpiece and the best way to preserve as much of the original power is to remind us of the first two movies, but in a way that isn't shoddy or consumed by (too many) flashbacks. It is fascinating to see how the remaining principal characters have changed since the last two movies. How Michael has become worn down by his age and personal life. How his sister Connie (Talia Shire, very good in this movie) is still attempting to maintain a good relationship with the brother she once hated. We see some of the supporting faces, such as Al Neri (Richard Bright) and it becomes very fascinating, even though it is really more of like a history lesson than a character study.There are also some good story elements, too. For example, the relationship between Michael and his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton). First of all, seeing how they've changed physically and psychically is fascinating and uncovering the fact that they still love each other is a powerful element. Most interesting however is the doomed relationship between Andy Garcia as the aspiring new don and Sofia Coppola as Michael's spunky, independent daughter. Director Coppola and his two young performers take a relationship that is, without giving too much away, sort of taboo or unnerving, and makes it quite moving in its own unique way. They are interesting. Much more interesting than the villains.That is the core flaw of this movie, I think. There are no interesting antagonists. Nobody here is quite menacing or developed enough to really leave an impact. Great as Eli Wallach is in the movie (and let's admit, he was destined to be in one of the Godfather movies sooner or later) he frankly doesn't have much material to work with. Joe Mantegna, who overacts his part, is also dull. It does sound paradoxical for a movie that clocks around three hours in length to seem rushed. But it does. There is even a moment where Coppola's craft breaks in a scene where Michael suffers a stroke and we get a horrendous jump cut that stands out quite painfully, like a sore thumb. And a massacre scene in the middle of the story only reminds us how much better the climaxes of the first two movies were. Whereas those seemed brutal and terrifying, this one really seems staged with an overuse of cartoonishly-lit blood and rapid cuts between camera angles.And then there comes the problem with the ending. The emotional climax of the movie works quite well. Without giving it away, I'll just say it reminded me of a great scene from an Alfred Hitchcock movie from 1956 in terms of dramatic tension and suspense. At this point, I was almost willing to forgive the movie for all of its flaws. It was going to be a great ending to a magnificent saga. Then came those two final, unforgivably awful shots and a poor decision to finalize the story with a cut to black as opposed to a slow, dramatic fade.Yes, it does feel more like a coda to a big musical orchestra rather than a third act to one of the grandest stories ever told, but ""The Godfather: Part III"" does work as a whole. There are some great dynamics here, even if they aren't fully realized, and the movie does, again work primarily as a nostalgia trip. No, lightning did not strike a third time. This time it just brushed it and some sparks made contact. Well, those sparks were strong enough. ""The Godfather: Part III"" takes a while to get started, but it did leave me satisfied, if a little empty.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's better than Part Two,"As much as I enjoyed The Godfather Part Two as it was a good movie, I honestly enjoyed Part Three a lot more than I thought I would. I often heard how this movie in particular is a bad film but not as good as the first two. I, however, believe this is just as good as the others and definitely the second-best movie in the trilogy with the very first one being the bestOnce again Al Pacino kills it as Michael Corleone giving much depth, range and sympathy to the infamous mobster as this time Michael is an old man who still wants out of the mobster life and goes legitimate with his family. But once again his enemies and role as the Don failed his attempts to turn away from that life. He is also at this time guilt-ridden with everything he has done to get to where he currently is and contemplates seeking redemption despite knowing he can't be savedFrom start to finish I was hooked in and loved every second of it, although I wasn't the biggest fan of the subplot involving Michael's daughter Mary Corleone seeking an incestuous relationship with her first cousin, Vincent. I mean for obvious reasons it's wrong but I dont think there really was any point in involving it. It just seemed like a waste of time and felt disconnected and out of place involving the main plot with MichaelAlthough upon saying the only part I disliked about this film was the subplot with Mary and Vincent, the actress who played Mary although not the best actress she was pretty decent and is stunning. Really beautiful. I also think this movie slightly suffered with the lost of Robert Duvall not reprising his role as Tom Hagen like in the first two movies but Part 3 was still a great movie and perfect final entry into this amazing trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not necessary to see Godfather III,"I just watched Godfather III for the first time.  Godfather I and II were two of the greatest films of all time.  However, although the third is a decent film, it is nowhere near the level of the others.Michael Corleone, as the Don, is supposed to be a powerful man.  In no point in this movie does Michael actually look like a Don.  This is a far cry from the strong character he was in the second movie.  This may well be showing the fall of organized crime, but I don't think that was Coppola's intention, and if it was he did a bad job of conveying that message.  Also, Connie is suddenly a powerful character.  Apparently all of Coppola's strong characters were dead so he had to take the only recognizable character that was left and make her some sort of family business matriarch.  In the first two movies she had nothing to do with the family business.  The plot in this movie is also disjointed and confusing.  At the beginning of the movie it seems like Michael barely recognizes Vincent Mancini, but throughout the film Vincent is his right hand man.

Godfather III,"I was so excited to watch the third installment of The Godfather after watching the first two. I was horribly disappointed. The first two Godfathers were truly works of art. The acting and directing were excellent. Pacino and DeNiro were wonderful. The writers and directors wisely kept Keaton to a minimum in the first two. The first two were intriguing and really told the story of the Corleone family well. However, The Godfather III should not have been made. The acting was terrible. Even Pacino (i am a huge fan) came off as forced acting. Sofia Coppola was absolutely awful. Keaton was such a drag throughout the entire movie. The plot was weak and did not hold my attention. It also seemed like such a ""recycled"" movie from material from the first two. The first 15 minutes of the movie were clips from the first two (and definitely the highlight of III). There was too much Italian opera singing and repetition of the first soundtrack of The Godfather. This movie reminded me of the new Star Wars movies that came out in the 90's and later. Both The Godfather and Star Wars were created in the 1970's were classics and should not have sequels or prequels added to them.

May have been better if made earlier.,After watching this film the first time all I could think of was that Francis Ford Coppola waited too long to make it. It's not a bad film but it seems detached from the original and Part II. The actors seemed to be out of touch with their characters but clearly did the best they could considering the time frame between Part II and III. I came away with the feeling that had he made this motion picture four or five years after Part II it would have been a better film. Of course the story may have been different but who knows.

It set the precedent and built a cracking narrative. The second film was the brain and heart of the trilogy. It developed the intellectual intensity of the films, as well as inspiring true care for the characters on screen. The third film was the soul of the trilogy. In watching it, we understand and love the characters of the entire series. Some people would see the emotional additions as cliché, but I feel that they are intentional. Michael is an old man now, obsessed with his troubled past, trying to live his life legitimately. The three films together form the greatest trilogy in cinematic history, and to ignore this film is an utter tragedy. What rating should this have?

The end of a Tragedy,"We reach the end of the Michael Corleone tragedy. His attempts to become ""legitimate"", his attempts to bring his family back together, and his attempts to bring peace to himself for past sins.The story is as complex and detailed as ever, with the same quality. The only problem is that the secondary characters in this one (Michael's daughter Mary, Vincent, son of Sonny Corleone, and ascending mob soldier and Connie Corleone) aren't as interesting nor entertaining as the ones in the previous movies.The emotional ending is there, but the way is done makes it a bit boring in my opinion. If you love those 30 minutes, then you would fairly love this movie. I liked it a lot, but I didn't love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Doesn't deserve to be bashed,"As other reviewers have discussed, this movie opened to a fairly unenthusiastic response upon release in 1990. Perhaps this is due to the fact that it takes more time to grow on you than the first two films; I actually didn't react very strongly to this one the first time, it was only on a second viewing that I saw it as the great film it was.Sophia Coppola's performance as Micheal Corleone's daughter IS slightly underwhelming, but in the end she gets the job done, and her screen time isn't enough to make that big an impact on the overall quality of the film. Aside from a few weakly delivered lines by Miss Coppola and a plot that can be a bit tough to grasp on the first viewing, this movie is excellent. Vincent is a fantastic addition to the series and Al Pacino is compelling as usual as Micheal Corleone. The film's plot is perhaps the most emotionally captivating of the series--especially the devastating ending. Give this movie a chance--it's a worthy conclusion to the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"All over the place, but not THAT bad!","I think the problem here is that the direction of the movie is all over the place. At times the music seems to be right on point, and others it's underutilized. New characters are introduced, and the story is a little confusing. Al Pacino wasn't given enough dramatic scenes that showcase his acting ability. Scenes are short and kinda jump around a lot. No character in the movie is given a lot of screen time, so you don't get to like them or hate them, they're just kind of there. That said, the story is fairly straightforward even if it is a little confusing you can still guess and will probably be right in who's trying to do what in the movie. Some of the actors don't have the acting chops to do their character right, so that's a little annoying. The scenes in Italy are beautiful and capture that Godfather 1 and 2 feel. I do recommend you watch this one if you're a Godfather fan just to close out the series. The movie is entertaining enough and there are even a couple really good shocking scenes. If you've got an afternoon, why not?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Frustratingly average,"This film had a lot to live up to and it is very good in some parts but ultimately the story doesn't meet expectations. If the film was made in the early 1980's it would of been better because being made in 1990 it had a modern feel to it with the music and the corny dialogue. ( my lucky coat, it's my lucky coat) also the final act in Sicily wasn't great and the worst part was Michael Corleone having a change of heart. It's not the character we know. Part IV should happen.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Price,The price paid by Michael Corleone was too high. Should I call this a trade between his sins and his gains? Firstly I thought this movie will not impress me as 1st and 2nd episode did due to the reviews by others. But it is quite interesting. Especially the scenes where the Corleone family had prepared to kill their enemies and the assassins planed to kill Michael Corleone. This are always the best scene from 1st episode until 3rd episode. I rate 3 of them 10 as my respect to the actors and the stories. Grazie!,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should not have been made,"I dislike this movie a lot. If you've read the Puzo's books, or at least have watched very closely the two first movies (specially the first one), you're going to agree with me.Compared with the Corleone's saga presented by Puzo's novel, the script of this film is, sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships among them are distorted. The story ends up reaching nowhere, although it appears to go to some direction during the movie.It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone's saga in the 90's, and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before. But, in the other hand, I don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies, in contexts when they didn't fit. Why this? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities.What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this. A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies. So does Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written this. How come? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzo's novel ""The Last Don"" is a 90's story about the mob, and it is great. We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why Part III is the best episode,"Part III is the best episode of the Godfather trilogy in that it comes full circle and brings Michael Corleone to where his modus operandi has been leading him (Hell). Like Faust, Macbeth, and other great tragedies, it's about the price one pays for the life he has led. Al Pacino endows his character with Shakespearean awareness. The sinner is haunted but can no longer turn the tables. When he meets the Cardinal, and the Cardinal asks for his confession - what a crossroads between God and man. LOOKING FOR RICHARD III and THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE come to mind. I thought Sophia Coppola played what her character represented - the last shred of innocence and beauty to which her father clings.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Not up to the quality of the previous ones, but still a great film","We've been waiting a long damn time for Godfather III. While the first part is from 1972 and the second from 1974, the third part is from 1990. I'm glad Al Pacino stayed. There's just no other person than Al Pacino to play Michael. The previous episodes are among the MASTERPIECE and the best movies ever made. Is that the case with the third installment? Not really for me. As great as the film is, it's not as masterful as the previous installments. While the story is again great and the soundtrack is masterful, as it always is with The Godfather, it just wasn't as interesting because not much happened except for the ending. The previous episodes appealed to me more. This was already a bit of an epilogue that just didn't have a chance for me to catch on to the previous episodes. The finale is worth it though, and the last 20 minutes of the film are an absolute delight to watch. A nice ending to the trilogy. It wasn't easy to conclude such a masterful trilogy, but it was quite successful. On the one hand, I'm not going to lie, I would have preferred it to end with a double feature. At least for me. As for this new version, I don't have much to add. In most respects it was identical. The beginning and the end. Perhaps the only thing I noticed was the changes there. I see the film in much the same way. Nothing that would change my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A disgrace to the Godfather legacy.,"If you watched the first two movies, you will know that the story for part 3 is totally implausible and disgraceful. In the first two movies, the story revolved around the ""family"" and relationship between the father and his sons and then the brothers relationships. Why is Mary Corleone a central figure? Why is Anthony an opera singer??! In part 2, Michael never talked to Mary or acknowledged her existence. Michael comforts Anthony after the shooting incident but doesn't do anything for Mary. Mary just sort of ""appeared"" after the shooting incident in part2. Michael focused on his son in the first two movies, therefore, why does Michael pay all of his attention to Mary in part 3??!The main reason this story flopped is that Anthony isn't a central character. Do you think Michael Corleone would allow his son to grow up to become an opera singer?!! The story should have been Michael introducing his son to the business and Anthony's refusal or acceptance or maybe his death. If you've seen the movie Donnie Brasco, the chemistry between Pacino and Johnny Depp was great. Why wasn't Depp cast as Anthony?Another insane character development was that of Connie being involved in the family business. Connie wasn't involved in any way with the business in the first two movies. Why is she now giving orders to Michael's button men? How did Kay become so forgiving of Michael? How could she not now the ""truth"" behind Fredo's death??!Lastly, Michael wasn't the same character as the end of part 2. No reason was given for his change. He was twisted and evil at the end of 2 and now he is like a kitten. The most insane moment was when Michael was hiding in the limousine and surprised Kay by being the limo driver. That was totally un-Corleone. Tom Hagen (Duvall) was greatly missed from this movie. He couldn't have saved it though. A great saga ending would have been Kay ending the Corleone curse by taking out Michael herself.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Godfather3,"This is the last of the trilogy and the weakest!Pacino is superb as he was a from the start but two character casting ,that of Vincent and Mary,hold back the film.Garcia is clearly apeing De Niro in his body language but his talking with eyes sinks him.Coppola's daughter is all innocence but a matured actress was required here.The plot is nothing new and flashbacks to the other films reveal a lack of originality.Besides Pacino,Eli Wallach is very good as well as the others from movie no.2 but the urgency,the violent romance of it all is completely missing.The best film is the always the original,sequels just cash on its success.Godfather1 was as we call it the 'real thing' the others were copies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What happened?,"After the immense success of the first two Godfather films, it was only right that there should be a third one. This entry takes place in New York during the 1970s. Michael Corleone is older now, and he's struggling to go legitimate and leave the Corleone crime empire to somebody else. Sonny Corleone's son Vincent is struggling to become the Don, but Michael doesn't trust him. As Michael tries to get out, a series of events causes him to be sucked back in. You'd think this entry would be just as good as the last two, but it's not. It's just not the same. You don't get the same feeling watching it.It's a given that Al Pacino is older and Michael Corleone is older as well, but Al just doesn't play him the same. Michael Corleone had a certain style from the way he talked to the way he acted. In this movie, Al Pacino plays him differently, like a character from one of his more recent movies. All of the actors from the first film are gone except for Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, but they're not important enough for the audience to care. Sofia Coppola is in the role of Michael's daughter Mary showing some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The only new actor that deserves praise is Andy Garcia as the cocky Vincent Corleone.This entry in the Godfather series has the obligatory 3 hour running length, but unlike the first two films, you'll be checking your watch to see when it ends. Even less happens in this movie than the first one. It's long and boring, and it doesn't even have the same style as the first two films. Overall, it's good to watch if you've seen the first two, and it's not terrible, but it just doesn't have the classic quality of the first two films.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

My Vote of 1 was generous....,"As a person who is able to practically recite the entire script of the first two Godfathers, and has yet to tire of watching either one or both, my disappointment in III was near fatal. This disaster approaches biblical proportions...one plague after another. Contrary to popular thought, I found Sophie Coppula to be a breath of fresh air in this stinker. Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep and Glenda Jackson in their prime would have failed in this part as the daughter of Michael Corleone...so give Francis Ford's kid a break...Also, I loved Andy Garcia, but alas, even he could not save this sequel. Al Pacino has not aged well, and those of us who remembered Michael as the handsome, strong silent type, as displayed when he slammed the door on his ex-wife. His bad-hair and sunken cheeked ranting and raving, made me think that he was attempting to resurrect the snarling, spitting Scarface. The plot of this show was also way too convoluted and boring to keep my attention long enough to care who was wacking who. The Consumer Protection people ought to investigate the usage of the ""Godfather"" packaging. So, this is my story and I'm sticking to it.....",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fitting end to a magical trilogy,"A fitting end to a magical trilogy. So sad to see the Goidfather films come to an end but if they have to then this is the way to go. I know a lot of people were disappointed by the third Godfather but I genuinely can't understand why. It gives tasteful, appropriate hints of what has gone before in a nostalgic, almost wistful way. I think the acting is amazing but6 what really stands out for me in this film is the cinematography: the way ion which the colours used throughout the film are consistently of an autumnal hue, lulling us often without knowing it into the feeling of the end drawing near. It continues the intricate political and criminal plot with great delicacy and gusto. Francis Ford Coppola can be proud of this contribution to fine films.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If it only hadn't had that ""III""","There are few movie series that were as successful as The Godfather series. Maybe, in the opinion of some, the 3 Lord of The Rings films will be better...anything can happen, and it is all a matter of opinion.This here is the third and last movie in the series, I consider most successful(the series, not this film). A variety of great actors, great ideas and one great director made such a feast possible. When I hear the Godfather I can not think of only one movie...the Godfather means Francis Ford Coppola. It means Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, and most of all, it means Marlon Brando. You might well enough conclude, that I liked the first movie in the series most, as it probably is considered the best by most viewers. But this review is about the third part of the trilogy.The whole movie is similarly structured as the first two. It really reminded me of the first part though, maybe a little too much. Probably, the, let's say, lack of success of this movie is also based on that. Most of the ideas that appear in the first movie, and in the second, can also be seen here. The family has it's part, business it's part and love it's part.Michael Corleone is the character we will follow through out this movie. I consider that some changes have taken place in time, and that Michael, as time passed by, desires to get rid of the life he actually never wanted, but then embraced. After his, what I consider, degeneration as a human being in the second movie, he tries to redeem himself in this one. Yet, we get to see a world that is shattered by the hatred of men, and consequently by evil. Many morals are being ignored in this world: forbidden love and terrible crimes take place. The meaning of ""family"" is actually being played with, by the two lovers who  ignore the fact that they are relatives. People can never be trusted in this world, and revenge is always bitter sweet...is it really our world? Well, not our whole world, but still part of it.There are the scenes that are similar in the first and this movie: the films start with a party, ends as both the others, trusted people betray, nobody is safe, Michael(like his father) gets to the hospital and a new don appears. This don is none other, but Sonny's son, who, probably for the worst, is very alike his father...the short temper. Also he gets attached to Michael, and protects him when he is unable to protect himself, and he does have a strong will. Vincent, that is his name, falls in love though with Mary, his cousin and also Michaels daughter...Michael does not agree with this combination, and he succeeds to unbind them too, using the lust for power that Vincent feels. Sadly, few real stories have happy endings, and this one couldn't be one of these. The fact that we get to also see Michael die at the end underlines the idea that everyone has his turn...no one escapes.The involvement of the church in this story is a little incredible...the fact that such things can happen at the Vatican is slightly disturbed. can people really do such terrible things? I hope not...still, what can you expect from those who have no other reason to live, but money? The Archbishop is an evil character...I considered him so from the beginning...I think the fact that he smoked was a sign. Still, I could not imagine that anyone would be so ill minded to kill the pope. Frightening story...Kay and Michael rejoin through their children...partly at least, the relations between them get better. This was to be expected, as Michael's was was to be redeemed, and he was practically preparing himself for the end of his life. Some might think this is normal, that many people suddenly turn to God and start to regret, the wrong things they have done, at an old age. I'd tell them just to think of the 80 years old Altobello. He, the one who calls himself ""peace maker"" is actually the one who causes the death of a beautiful young lady...peace is rarely achieved through murders, and if it is, then I really would not trust such a ""cease-fire"".  Cardinal Lomberto is honest and good hearted...all that is good in that world of evil...well, maybe together with Anthony. But Lomberto is also going to show that goodness does not prevail in our world...honesty is not welcome in some places, and some personal interests are more important than the interest of the human race.I really enjoyed this film, more than other movies with higher marks...I stick to my idea, that if this had been a stand-alone movie it would've been more successful. Peace is hard to find on earth...and when you decide to do something you better think twice. Sometimes, you can not turn around.The actors are good...yet, I really felt the missing of a Marlon Brando. I fear Al Pacion isn't enough...that might be why I considered the second Godfather part a small disappointment...but that's another story. Andy Garcia plays the role of Vincent smoothly, and he has also got the aspect I would think of for such a character. He is a useful addition, that did give this film a little more taste. I did miss though some of the great actors that appeared in the first two movies. I guess, as I said, Pacino wasn't enough for me...and Garcia could not complement for a Brando, or even for a De Niro. This movie is generally good and if there hadn't been the two things I mentioned earlier it would've been great. But in this case, an 8/10 are enough for the performance seen. Still think it's worthy for an applause.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A good movie, which loses by comparison to the previous.","This film follows the story of ""The Godfather,"" which chronicles the journey of the Corleone family through the violent world of organized crime. In this film, an elderly Michael Corleone lives haunted by the crimes he committed and looking desperately, but unsuccessfully, to clean his family of any taint through its legitimation and links to the Vatican.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novels of Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, it kept most of the cast of the previous films, made in the seventies, and bring new and important characters. The soundtrack goes from Nino Rota to Carmine Coppola, father of director and Talia Shire, actress who also enters this film. It didn't won any Academy Award but was nominated for seven statuettes.More than fifteen years after ""The Godfather II"", this film is, almost, the black sheep of the ""family"". Criticized, misunderstood, even somewhat ridiculed, will always live in the shadow of the two films that preceded it, and which are undoubtedly two giants of cinema. And if we want to compare them, this is the loser because it can no longer surprise us, despite maintaining excellent action scenes and a Michael Corleone much more paternalistic, living threatened by his ghosts (in particular his brother, which is a very smart way to explore the cruelest act of the criminal life of this mobster). I didn't quite understand his position on the daughter's romance with Vincent, her cousin. The connection to the Catholic Church also seemed a bit forced, as if it had been snapped on in the script. Al Pacino has remained up to the challenge and managed to perfectly display the psychological contradictions of his character. Andy Garcia also had a great performance and Joe Mantegna can say that this, probably, it was the best performance he did. This is a film that is worth seeing, mostly if we didn't compare it to the previous two films.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Poor Relation,"Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic.

I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG!, I wish I'd stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)...

Andy Garcia & Al Pacino are great,"A pity this film was so bashed this was the role of a lifetime for Andy Garcia, and he should have been critically acclaimed. He has all the best lines, he is electric whenever he is on the screen, like a young Al Pacino, he plays the role of a very dangerous man and he gets his head around the violence so well. He is not just committing violence on screen for no reason it seems to me as if he understands the reasons that his character is committing the violent acts. As good as Pesci in GoodFellas, he should have been in it even more I cant remember how long he is on screen for but regardless it is his best role in my opinion.Another brilliant role for Al Pacino playing a character he must know inside out one of his more subtle roles. A man who is losing his grip, a lot less yelling than a lot of his roles. But it stands up at least in terms of Pacinos performance to the two previous godfathers.One of the most underrated movies of all time with some outstanding performances. I can see though why it wouldn't have been well received at the time considering the other excellent gangster movies that were released around that time (Good Fellas, Casino although I cant remember the exact years now).

Too bad Robert Duvall declined to reprise his role as Tom Hagen but I thought George Hamilton was as good a replacement as possible. And Andy Garcia was also aces as the son of James Caan's role from the first one and deserved his eventual Oscar nom for the role. As for Sofia Coppola, well, at least her role didn't have too many scenes which meant whatever her deficiencies as an actress, her father didn't make her look too bad.

Out With A (Comparative) Whimper,"Why did Coppolla make this film? What possessed him to, sixteen years later, ""conclude"" the greatest movie saga ever told? It's a shame that this film will always be attatched to the first two masterpieces. Kind of like how Yoko will always be attatched to John, Debbie Matanoupolis to The View and Roseanne Barr to the human race. Although, while watching it, it can at select times, be engrossing, looking back however, chunks start to rise in your throat. What are the problem with this? Here goes:1) A lack of atmosphere. The Godfather II was also a bit weak in this department, but Godfather III tops the cake. Transporting it to a modern setting simply doesn't work. It gives the film a lack of identity. Sure, Corleone is pretty to look at, but it looks like the Corleone we knew in I after some mysterious force came down with a needle and sucked the beauty out of it. Part I used reds and blues to give the film a rare beauty and sense of the time in which it took place. It seemed lik an epic, brilliant comic book. Part II was shot depressively in dark colors (not a flaw it all, it matched the sad story of the film). I guess that since III doesn't have a theme, there's no way for a cinematographer to bring one out. Which leads me to the next flaw2) Part I is Michaels ascention to the top. Is the mob glorified? To a point. Part II, the mob is anything but glorified, as Michael, loses and/or kills almost all that is dear to him. Part III is SUPPOSED to be about redemption, but unless I fell asleep during the film, I didn't seen any taking place (Perhaps I just found the answere my problem). He dies a miserable man, even more lonely than he was after II.3) The plot is too muddled. Godfather II was successful in telling two stories because they were completely isolated from eachother. In this case, they aren't. The Vatican, and the troubles inside the F(f)amily don't mesh-at all. The characters from these two different tales never interact and I didn't feel like I got to know any of the new cast members (except for Vincent).  This leads to a heinous, confusing and overblown finale where, to be honest, I didn't know who was being killed or where the killing was taking place AT ALL.As for the good parts...Well, of course there were some. The performances by Pacino, Keaton and especially Garcia were top-notch. Sofia Coppolla has taken enough abuse here, so I won't complain. As I said before, the film is watchable. At points, when you actually DO understand what's going on, it can get very interesting. But the characters provoking you interest don't last long enough. Overall, an alright film in it's own right (with several flaws) fails to follow the example of it's two flawless counterparts.",,Anonymous,Crime
Heartbreak,"In the saga of ""The Godfather"" it became unimaginable to believe Coppola could top his two previous achievements. Part I and Part II shine because of their terrific performances, but the films as a whole needed some serious editing, and there were problems with the pacing. Most of those aspects were fixed in the third installment, and the performances continued to be pretty flawless, with the exception of Sofia Coppola, a last minute replacement for the I wonder what she could have done with the role Winona Ryder. Coppola is not bad, but she can't match the sterling work by Paccino, Hamilton, Keaton, a magnificent supporting cast, and especially the dark turn by Talia Shire, who takes a role that would have made Lady Macbeth a serious attack of paranoia.This film is a visual stunner, and it brings together the best of the previous two movies, as musical themes are revived, key plot points are revisited in order to explore the dynamics of the present time drama. The audience knows Michael Corleone will never be able to achieve respectability because of his previous dealings. It is impossible to him to repair the familial bonds as Kate (Keaton) returns in a dashing performance to advocate for the future of her son against the will of her ex-husband.

Vastly Underrated!,"People may bash me for this, but the third and final entry into the well-respected Godfather trilogy is the second best film in the series right behind Part Two. I was really hooked into the movie for the entire running time of 170 minutes. I don't know why people hate this film, but I love it.Michael Coreleone is now in his 60's and he is trying to bring his corporation out of the gangster realm and into the world of legitimacy and respectability.The acting, as with the first two, is just amazing. Pacino should have been at least nominated by the Academy. I don't care how many people bash Sofie's performance, but I liked her. Also just to see Connie Corelone played beautifully by Talia Shire turn into the scheming sister really made my day.The cinematography and the score were just amazing. I still run the theme over and over in my head.Overall, this is an epic conclusion to one of the best trilogies of all time. There is not one bad thing to say except it may be a little long. I rate this film a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Suffering From Expectations,"A writer and a producer/director combine to create a story that produces not one, but two of the greatest movies ever made, both legendary cinematic classics, and the only movie and its sequel to both win the Oscar for best picture.  Then, 16 years later, it is announced that a final movie, the last chapter in the trilogy, is being released to complete the story.  Of course, the expectations for this movie will be tremendously high, so high that anything less than a spectacular film will be written off as a disappointment.  This is the atmosphere that ""The Godfather: Part III"" was introduced into, an almost impossible situation that even a good movie was destined to fail in.  Which is exactly what ""Part III"" is: a good movie. Taken on it's own, this a good film, with some fantastic actors (Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Diane Keaton), a compelling story, and well directed.  Of course, the problem this movie suffers from is it can't be taken on its own. Presented using most of the same characters, and as the final chapter in one of the most loved film story lines of all time, comparisons to ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"" are inevitable, and this is where ""Part III"" suffers.  It is not the equal of either of the first two movies; not that this would normally be a tragic sin, as 99.9% of all films are not the equal of the first two movies.  But the buildup of 16 years since ""Part II"" had been released, plus the general expectations surrounding anything to do with ""The Godfather"" saga, are too much for this film to overcome. ***1/2 out of *****",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Part III - Misunderstood and sadly forgotten.,My Rating : 9/10I'm sure to watch this again and again - it's become a favourite.

A good film that doesn't go as a sequel,"Godfather III is a good movie compared to other movies that we watch nowadays. However, it has nothing to do with the legendary ""Godfather"" If I did not know, I'd never be able to guess that, Francis Ford Coppola has directed this film, as well.This film is a film of 90's. And, therefore, like most of the holywood films, its main focus is its budget, not the art. This film has been shot only for the reason of having more profit over the godfather. It's entirely a new film. Al Pacino is old and ""VERY"" different. He has his own character, and he doesn't act for the film. He rather plays a part of his life, in the way of the script. It's no good.I have rated this film 6. It may indeed deserve 7, but I was so dissappointed to see such a different film that, I felt  like to decrease its average.I can say, at the end that, If you like cliché holywood films, and the new and old al pacino, you may watch this film. But if you wathched The godfather I and Godfather II, and liked them (you should LOVE them), don't ruin the taste, and don't ever watch this film. Trust me. Read the book, but don't watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Extremely Disappointing,"I realize this had very little hope of measuring up to the 1st two GFs, but I never imagined III would be SUCH a disappointingly off-the-mark failure. Difficult to believe it even could've been made by the same people.This movie had absolutely none of the fascinating believability of the 1st two: NO gangsters would actually use the pretentious empty (and annoying) dialogue that pre-dominated here; NOR would they conduct hits in the extravagant Hollywood-concocted manner here (Helicopter/parade scenes etc.)that seem more appropriate for Batman type movies whereas the whole vatican/immobilario plot base seems more at home in a James Bond flick; characters react throughout as their counterparts in I and II never would have; and entire plot lines (especially the incestuous cousin-love angle) needed to be thrown out entirely. An average Sopranos episode gives a far more interesting and realistic Cosa Nostra portrayal.And the performances only made it worse. Sophia Coppola was justifiably panned for being dreadful--it looked as if she was reading her lines for the 1st time off cue-cards. But even Pacino seems to have lost track of his character. Michael was so compelling in I and II because of the introverted, extraordinarily controlled, always-calculating way he conducted the ""family business"", but none of that was apparent in Pacino's III overacted portrayal of an almost-whiny Michael prone to regular emotional outbursts.You get the idea, I didn't like it. Coppola appears to have grown terribly pretentious and uninspired, and has thoroughly lost touch with the creative vision that made the 1st two GFs so great. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you don't. Re-watch I and II, pretend this never happened.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Inspiring Film,"This film is often shadowed by the other two classics, Part 1 and 2, but this movie is, in its own right, an amazing film with incredible performances by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia in particular.Francis Ford Coppola directs this underrated film with family member Sofia putting in a worthy performance as Mary, daughter of Pacino and lover/cousin of Garcia.Having watched all three, I have to say this is the one that hits me the most. The other two were fine, but they were too cheery. The end two scenes of Part 3 are both touching, and memorable. The one flaw about this great film is the inconclusive end to Sonny Corleone's(James Caan) son Vinnie(Garcia). We neither see whether he lives or not. He disappears near the end with no indication about what happens to him.Despite this one flaw, Part 3 is a superb conclusion to one of Hollywood's greatest trilogies. But with talk of Leonardo Di Caprio taking on a prequel, I think Ford Coppola should quit while he is ahead.The Godfather Series has made stars of James Caan(Godfather Part 1), Andy Garcia(Part 3), Sofia Coppola(Parts 1,2,3), John Savage(Part 3), Robert DuVall(Parts 1,2), Joe Mategna(Part 3) and, of course, Al Pacino(Parts 1,2,3).

An excellent film - Sofia Coppola played her part well.,"I have seen this film several times since its release, in the cinema and on DVD. I have also read numerous adverse comments from some film critics and cannot believe that they saw the same film. It was actually a worthy follow-up to the first two Godfather films and is still worth viewing after all these years: Al Pacino playing his part magnificently. Some critics poured out volumes of abuse about Sofia Coppola at the time and this has been repeated by others until it seems to be accepted generally - sadly, many critics are unoriginal and trot out others' clichés. I find myself totally unable to agree - she played her part well, in my estimation, and her character was believable - certainly did not merit the denigration she received from some. (I have even seen comments (on this site) disparaging her looks - I can only conjecture about the writers' gender preferences and/or stage of development.) If you have not seen this film, forget the sour criticisms, watch it and you may be pleasantly surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Wonderful,Underrated And Overlooked Finale To The Godfather Trilogy.","The Godfather Part III is a wonderful,underrated and overlooked finale to The Godfather Trilogy that is filled with great direction,terrific acting and a fine score. While it's not as good as the first two films,The Godfather Part III is a nice conclusion to The Godfather Saga.Set twenty years after the events in Part II,The Godfather Part III depicts Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is now older and has finally made the Corleone Family legitimate and on the straight and narrow. But,unfortunately for Michael his past and thoughts of guilt have come back to haunt him and his enemies have lured but into the criminal world while worrying about his family including his nephew Vincent Mancini(Andy Garcia)and daughter Mary(Sofia Coppola).Released in 1990,The Godfather Part III is a sequel that despite being nominated for 7 Academy Awards and being a modest Box Office success sharply divided Godfather fans and movie critics. Some fans and movie critics felt the movie should not have been made and is a bad film compared to the first two films and disliked the casting of Sofia Coppola. Despite the film's flaws it's a really good film in my opinion and is a powerful conclusion to this great trilogy. I don't think Director Francis Coppola was trying to top the first two I think he just wanted to make a satisfying conclusion and he does so here. Francis Coppola has said that the first two films is the series and part III is the epilogue and that is very true with this film because what makes The Godfather Part III so effective is that we have seen what happen to some of the characters in the first two films and we see some of their fates which adds to the tragedy and sadness of this film because we see most of the characters haunted by their past demons and there is a sense of doom that hangs over the film and you will feel like there will be no happy outcome and Francis Coppola shows this to viewers in stylish way. The themes of violence,betrayal and death were in the first two films and it's also in Part III as well and with the Corleone family trying to distance themselves from the Gangster world but what GF III tells us is that while a person can get out of the Gangster world it never leaves any person no matter what they do. When we see the character Michael Corleone in Part III we see a man who has aged and that being the don and leader of the Corleone family has not only taken a mental toll on Michael but a physical toll as well. Where it was kind of tough to have sympathy for Michael in Part II,in this film we finally start to feel terrible for Michael because he is disturbed by his evil deeds and what he has done and realize he never wanted to be a the head of The Corleone family or be a gangster he felt like he had no choice. Throughout GF III we see Michael trying to reclaim his tortured soul that was pretty damaged after the events in Part II and it's not a sinner trying to become a saint but a man trying to bring some goodness into his life. The Godfather films are in their own way morality tales about people and the things that they do and the unfortunate consequences of people's Actions. The Godfather films are known for their violent scenes and Part III doesn't hold anything back giving viewers a few scenes that are shocking and horrific. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is good and memorable even though the script lacks the greatness of the first two films. The ending of The Godfather Part III is amazing and is one of the saddest and most heartbreaking endings in film history and no matter how many times I see the ending it still gets to me. A powerful and fitting end to The Godfather Trilogy.The cast is wonderful. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone,with Pacino bringing emotion,power and depth to role. Diane Keaton is wonderful as Kay Adams,Michael's former wife. Talia Shire is terrific as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Andy Garcia is outstanding as Vincent Mancini,Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son and Michael's nephew. Eli Wallach is amazing as Don Atobello,an old-time Gangster. Joe Mantegna is great and clever as Joey Zasa,a smooth talking Gangster. Sophia Coppola does an O.K job as Mary Corleone and is not as bad as everyone says. Richard bright is sensational as Al Neri,Michael's old bodyguard. Bridget Fonda(Grace Hamilton),George Hamilton(B.J Harrison)Donal Donnelly(Archbishop Gilday)and Franc D'Ambrosio(Anthony Vito Corleone) give good performances as well.The direction Francis Coppola is fantastic and stylish,with Coppola a beautiful and amazing visual style to the film. Great direction,Coppola.The score by Carmine Coppola is wonderful,epic and matches the tone of the film. Outstanding score,Carmine.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,the first two Godfather films,Gangster Films or Crime Dramas,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part III,a wonderful,underrated sequel that deserves a second chance. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good movie, but could have been much better.","I enjoyed this movie, even though there was no way it could live up to inevitable expectations I had after seeing the first two installments. I think it was a certainty that I was going to be a bit disappointed.Pacino was magnificent as the elder Don, haunted by the past (especially the murder of his brother Fredo). I thought it was a shame that Robert Duvall couldnt be convinced to play Tom Hagan again. His presence would have been a clear upgrade over George Hamilton (howd he get cast in this?) and would have given some breadth to the overall quality of the movie. I had some problems with another casting choice: what was Briget Fonda doing in this?Andy Garcia was really good in the part of Vincent Mancini, and Richard Bright was solid as Al Neri, a hold over from the earlier Godfather films. There are some really good actors in lesser roles like John Savage (from the Deer Hunter and Salvador). Cast as Tom Hagans son Andrew, Savage plays a preist who is thus removed (unfortunately) from the family business. His talents arent utilized nearly enough in this flick.Overall its a good movie, and an interesting look at the Corleone family 20 years later. But anyone expecting something along the lines of Godfather 1 quality will be let down.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Screenplay is good, location is something compromised and is not as spectacular as in the previous two. Support cast is good and could've been better.

The best of the three,"The Godfather Part III is, in my opinion, the best out of all three movies. The Godfather is my second favorite, and Part II a distant third.This movie was definitely the most complex out of the three. It really details Michael's struggle for the legitimacy of the Corleone family and that he's definitely haunted by ordering the death of his brother Fredo. I think one of the reasons why his character is developed so well over the course of this movie is the fact that it's set in his older years, and he's doing a lot of reflecting on his life, especially after he suffers a diabetic stroke. He's hell-bent on jumping the gap and taking the Corleone family into legitimacy. You see that he really doesn't want to start another war, but in the end it's necessary.However, Michael is not the one to actually plan everything out. That's taken care of by his nephew, Vincent Mancini (and later on Vincent Corleone). Vincent is the (illegitimate) son of Santino Corleone. In the end Vincent becomes ""Don Corleone"" and handles everything. At the beginning of the movie, Vincent was raucous, and rowdy like Sonny, but after he's appointed Don, he becomes much more like Michael: Quiet, reserved, and level-headed.The outstanding storyline is topped only by the SUPERB acting of Al Pacino and the rest of the cast. Al Pacino is one of THE BEST actors of all time and definitely my favorite. He's just absolutely amazing to watch on screen. The final two scenes of this movie are probably the best scenes he's ever done.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Underwhelming but not bad,"I can see why. I can see why some people who watched the first 2 movies were severely disappointed after seeing this one.Watching this third movie right after the first two felt like somebody had dug up bits and pieces of Godfather I and II at some archaeological site and then tried to create the third movie based on the style of the found artifacts. All the aging actors are now trying to remember whom they were playing in the original movies and the director is standing in the corner trying to remember how to direct and the writers got pens in their mouth and their eyes on the ceiling trying to remember how the previous movie ended and to somehow tie it into this new movie.It is like a cow that was able to produce 2 good batches of milk, but now her udders are empty, and Hollywood is trying to squeeze yet another Godfather out them, but all you got are a few last squirts from a sore teat.While the 2nd Godfather film had flown almost seamlessly out of the first, much about this third film is different. The tone has changed, with Al Pacino giving a much more subdued and humorous performance with those rising eyebrows that started dominating his later career. The people act contrary to their character types established by the first two movies. They try to make the gangster Michael Corleone into some sort of anti-hero in this one, which is missing the point of the series.But at the same time, the creators expect you to have watched the first two movies, because right from the start there are references made to characters from the first two films without much explanation. The visuals are striking, but the gritty realism of the first two films is gone.Al Pacino is still good at his role, but some of the other people are not. The world squarely put its crosshairs on Sofia Coppola as the scapegoat for this movie's downfall, and I can see why. Maybe the problem is that English was not her native language or that she was playing a very different role than before, but this lady really phones in her performance. Something goes wrong in the intonation at the end of every sentence she utters. And it doesn't help when the text she is given is so subpar.In fact, the movie takes a number of dips in the quality of the dialogue. I got flashbacks of Star Wars prequels while listening to it. The screenplay is trying to be dramatic or poetic but often comes off as phoney. It's not all bad though.The story centres on one of Corleone relatives played by Andy Garcia and that guy is always good, especially in gangster roles, but you can't expect him and the older Al Pacino to carry a Godfather film on their own.The Godfather Part III has its good and its bad moments. It is unfortunately overshadowed by the greatness of its predecessors. If this was just a standalone film in a universe where Godfather I and II did not exist, I bet it would have been much better received. Therefore, the best I can suggest is to for the viewers to do the same as what the movies did: watch the first and the second movie and then wait a while. Watch the third movie a few weeks or even years later. That way the contrast will not be as startling.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
10 things that would have made Godfather 3 better.,"Although the Godfather Part 3 is not a masterpiece, it stands alone as a good movie. Still, critics have destroyed this movie as the lesser of the 3 in the trilogy. As a fan, here are my 10 things I would change to have made the movie better.1. Michael's hairstyle.The Al Pacino in Godfather 3 is not just an older version of Michael Corleone but one that we really do not recognize. This is more of an issue that Sophia Coppola's performance. In fact, Sophia is less than an issue when compared to the real issue that Michael is no longer Michael. Pacino brings more of an older Frank Keller from Sea of Love or even an elder Tony Montana without the cocaine.2. Sophia Coppola's and Andy Garcia's Relationship.The chemistry between these two works. I just wished we could have seen more and have more of a comparison like a young Michael and Apollonia to show the youth and vulnerability. I would also add that we do not get to see enough Bridget Fonda. Adding more to her character as Garcia eventually begins seeing both women and has to make a choice which eventually pushes him to choose the Family business.3. More John SavageWe see John Savage as a glorified background actor at best. Including just one scene more with him and Michael would add to the plot of Fredo's murder as well as Savage being a Priest with Michael looking for forgiveness. Maybe, Savage refuses to give him penance. Maybe Savage knows that Michael gave the order to kill Fredo and this scene brings Michael closer to his end.4. Michael asks Connie for forgiveness.Another great scene would have Michael admitting to Connie that he has Carlo killed. A better twist would have Talia Shire's character seen as more ruthless by admitting that she always knew Michael had him killed and agrees with his decision.5. Bring Danny Aiello backInstead of a weak performance by Eli Wallach, I would have brought back Danny Aiello as Tony Rosato. That way, there is more of an established character that brings us back to Godfather 2 and how the Rosato brothers have been waiting over 30 years to destroy Michael Corleone.6. De Niro and Kirby cameo.Adding Robert De Niro to any film is good. Here, a flashback scene from the Olive Oil Wars where we see a young Vito and Clemenza talk about strategy and partnership could have led into the relationship that Michael has with Vincent would have in comparison.7. More NYC and less Italy.Godfather 3 is more foreign because half of the movie takes place in a foreign world that the audience is not familiar with. Both Godfather 1 and 2 has elements of Italy but remaining true to an American audience by including at least half the landscape be New York City if not Nevada.8. Graveyard Scene.Michael brings Vincent to the Family grave. This scene is for Michael to sat goodbye and to show Vincent where he came from. This heart wrenching scene would include flashback scenes and added (new) voice over or even cameos from James Caan and god forbid, even Marlon Brando. Even if Fredo's body is still at teh bottom of the lake, a cenotaph at the cemetery would add the tension of Michael needing to confess.9. Kay is murderedMichael loses all 3 women (his true loves) although Kay lives. To add more drama, having Kay finally be one of Michael's true victims earlier on in the movie would add more reason to why Michael wanting to return to Italy. Whether she is killed by Joey Zaza or not, her murder would be another death on Michael's soul which would push him further to his end.10. Tom Hagan lives !The big reason why the Godfather 3 fails is the absence of Robert Duvall. Instead of killing him off, Tom Hagen has been living in exile in Nevada. Resigning from Michael and the Family, he has lived with the guilt that Michael killed Fredo. With that, Michael and tom have never talked and it appears that Tom has died until Act 3 when Michael visits Tom finally have a talk. These added scene alone would have closed the books on many issues in the Godfather trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Final Act,"The final closeup of Al Pacino that ended 'The Godfather Part II' would have been the perfect signing off. Unfortunately Francis Ford Coppola after a dry patch that had lasted several years felt it necessary to return to the scene of his earlier triumph with results that are, alas, rather moribundThe story depicting financial malpractice in the Vatican has definite possibilities and the synchronised violence at the film's conclusion is pure 'Godfather'; but Al Pacino's fatalism now looks more like inertia and he's inexplicably been saddled with a very bad haircut and a haggard air that reflects his increased withdrawal from reality.The film also sorely misses Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan; they should have paid him whatever he asked.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Alas it does and the middle of this movie you tend to start to get bored. But Part 3 has such a good last 45 mins that the boring parts start to fade away fast.Pacino's performance is everything it had to be and you really sense the loss he embodies the whole film. I did miss Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan, I do feel we could of gotten a much better movie with him in it (it would of been a great addition). But for all of the film's faults they're some great parts. Like I said the whole climax in the opera house, spilling out onto the steps, was tremendous. It was extremely well shot.

I thought the first two Godfathers should be in the list of best films ever so I figured it was about time to see the wrap up. I didn't expect to see one of the worst movies ever, produced and written by the same people too. This movie was so overacted and had so many funny lines that I started laughing about 1/3 into the movie. Am I supposed to get all teary eyed because two first cousins can't fall in love? And what made me laugh the loudest was when Pacino keeps saying over and over that's ""it's dangerous."" Incest is not dangerous, it creates offspring with screwed up genes. Go see ""Deliverance"" which came out when the first Godfather did to see what happens when cousins marry. And the number of plot points that didn't make sense are too numerous to mention. I wondered if they wrote this movie while drunk.Perhaps if they didn't wait 16 years after the Godfather II to make this film they might have continued the inspiration.

Different than the first 2 but deserves the same respect,"The Godfather Part III is, what I think; one of the most underrated movies ever made. It is definitely on my own personal ""Top 10 Most Underrated Movies"" list. My question is: why? The possible answer: It is too different than the first 2. And this is very true, as different as Part II was from the first, they were still in the same league. This movie is almost in an entirely different league. One reason could be that the first movie was made in 1972, the second in 1974, then this one waited until 1990. But I don't see why that's a problem. We have all of the basic (surviving) cast and crew: Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino starring as Michael Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie, Diane Keaton as Kay, Richard Bright as Al Neri the enforcer. We also have a number or more modern big name actors here, such as "" Andy Garcia (Vinnie Mancini), Eli Wallach (Altobello), Joe Mantegna (Joey Zasa), George Hamilton (BJ Harrison), Bridget Fonda (Grace Hamilton), Sophia Coppola (Mary Corleone, and John Savage (Father Andrew Hagen). The setting is back in New York, and also in Sicily (as in the original, we also see Don Tommasino from the first 2 here as an elderly man), and also the Vatican. The storyline here is very different than in the first 2 movies, here the Corleone family is a legitimate family with all the connections they need, and several foundations to their name. Michael is now an elderly man and therefore does not have the physical authority he had in the first 2 movies, but of course Al Neri, his senior enforcer is still with him. I liked this movie a lot. Very well written. The cast was well picked and everyone played their part well. I just hope that people will watch this movie before deciding to outcast it from the first 2. It's very different but still very good, you will like it. Maybe not as much as the first 2 but I guarantee it will be an enjoyable piece. I give this a 9/10, the only reasons it doesn't get a 10 is because of some plot holes left from the second movie that weren't carried to this one, and some things were left unanswered here. Also the ending was a little dry, but wasn't terrible. But fans will enjoy this film, I know I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not great....,"This is a beautifully filmed motion picture. The settings and the sounds are perfect for sitting the mood, but what makes this film only good and not great (like its 2 predecessors) is the distractions of of 2 actors, 2 roles and a plot that, while logical, is somewhat unbelievable.The actors, lets get them out of of the way, were Sofia Coppola and George Hamilton. Neither was believable, but I do not blame the actors, that error falls to the director for even allowing such casting. Sofia and George do not fit the mold. Their mannerism, dialects and mannerisms fail to compare to the outstanding acting of the other cast members.The roles..The first is Vincent (played skillfully by Andy Garcia) For me to believe that Michael is so willing to accept the bastard son of his dead brother is ridiculous. This role should have been handled by Michael's or Connie's son. And the whole incest thing should have been nixed also.The second role was one where the the scenes would have better fit on the cutting room floor. Grace Hamilton serves no real purpose. Appears out of no where and then is gone in a flash. It only adds to the distraction.The other role was one that was missing. Tom Hagen was sorely missed, and his absence and lame explanation were horribly gaping holes in the Godfather fabric.Lastly is the plot, while overall I found it very in intriguing, I still felt that so much was contrived. The idea has always been that Micahel had become what he had not wanted to be. He admired his father but never wanted to do what his father wanted to do. He bowed to the needs and desires of his families. But this chapter does not show that conflict, that coolness or that rage within.One last note: While I will watch the film again I cannot help but wish that it never existed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I loved how this film gave her a much bigger role. She is a fascinating character and seeing her gain more agency was brilliant to watch. I also liked how Part III hearkened back enough to its previous films. Coppola described it as an epilogue and I think that that's an accurate description.

The Godfather 3 is not a terrible movie.,"This movie is by far the weakest of the 3 movies, but if you watch Godfather 1 and 2, before Godfather 3 the movie plotline for Godfather 3 will make sense. I do feel however waiting 16 years to finally finish the trilogy was bit excessive, if I had to speculate, I believe Francis Ford Coppola never intended to make a third Godfather movie, also casting his daughter Sofia as Mary, Michael Corleone's daughter was a travesty, Sofia Coppola cannot act or for that matter direct, the only reason she has gotten as far as she has is because she is Coppola's daughter. What I did really enjoy was the interaction between the character's Michael and Kate, and the evolving of Connie as a strong, capable, fierce woman who could become head of the Corleone family if she wanted to, that I enjoyed.
Overall, I did enjoy watching this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Was Wrong,"The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was as good as part 2, and not as good as part 1, my initial rating for it was an eight. When I saw it for a second ( and third time ), I began knowing why almost everyone doesn't like this movie. While parts 1 and 2 can be watched hundreds of times, without being bored for one second ( especially part 2, which is now my favorite movie of the trilogy ), i felt VERY bored watching part 3 again. I actually fell asleep during the movie, and woke up only to watch the final 15 minutes, which are definitely the highlight of the movie.Let's start with the good things, Al Pacino was excellent as always, Andie Garcia, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shore were very good in their parts. I also think the storyline is good, despite being a bit surprising. After all the power Micheal Corleone had in part 2, i felt he was too weak in part 3.Now let's move on the bad things. Sofia Coppola's acting wasn't the best, but i don't think she ruined the movie as everyone says. I felt the movie was a little slow, especially in the second half, and it could have been about 20 minutes shorter. The movie's main flaw, in my opinion, is that it gets weaker with every time you watch it, while the other parts get stronger with repeated viewings.So I recommend watching The Godfather part 3, but only once, so you could know how the story ends, but don't watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overwhelming and over-underrated,"... its really a shame to see this movie as a sequel, if there was no previous godfather movies, this one could standalone as one of most magnificent movies i've ever seen...but, there's always a ""but"", there are previous conditions! we have godfather I and godfather II. i love all the three parts, and thats why people rate this movie so poorly. the first two were outstanding in every levels, it really transports you into that family, you become a part of it too! At a certain point i look into yourself asking whats best for the ""familia"" and what should they do. Whit brilliant performances by Marlon Brando and De Niro, Al Pacinos character seems a bit far for the movie and in a certain part you wish he didn't show up anymore in the film, you just want to see Brando in part I and the same in part II played by De Niro. Its like we forget Michael Corleone. But I now see that its the most important person in all three parts, Pacino managed to show us such a growth in its character thats difficult not to see right in the first movie!In part III you will experience something you've never experienced in the others... i feel sorry for the misunderstanding of this great movie. i hope you feel so powerless in the end as i did... its the most beautiful ending i've ever seen, surpasses gladiator. from this moment on i'll love Al Pacino. take care",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A few good scenes, but overall quite poor.","Disappointing last part in the Godfather-trilogy. I don't know why this third part is so weak, but it may be because of a number of factors. The story may not be interesting and/or it is not worked out properly and/or the actors are not convincing and/or God knows what.The only interesting story-line is that of Vincent's. He reminds me of the way that Michael and Vito used to be. There are some good scenes with Andy Garcia (e.g. when he's lying in bed with Bridget Fonda, and later when he takes care of the Joey Zasa-situation).

A lukewarm finale to the Godfather saga.,"Francis Ford Coppola was obviously blinded by paternal instinct when he decided to cast his daughter (Sophia Coppola) in the role of Mary Corleone. While the acting in G3 was passionate for the most part (especially by Pacino and Andy Garcia), Coppola comes across as a dead fish in comparison. I found myself fully distracted every time her face ""graced"" the screen. Sadly, Coppola was not the only problem with this movie.

"Initially intriguing, ultimately disappointing...","I was unsure of what to expect of Godfather III. For me, the last great movie Coppola made was Apocalypse Now. His subsequent works, while as technically flawless as any living director's work today, have lacked importance and impact.I long ago realized the essentially mythological nature of the Godfather movies, but the first two were at least entertaining and featured great ""Coppola"" look. (If you want to see something authentic, watch Goodfellas or Casino, or even the Sopranos.) But the Michael Corleone of Godfather III seemed like a different character. He was a lot more like Tony Montana from Scarface than the Michael from Godfather I and II. He had lost his refined, understated manner and gotten gruffer and craggy. Some of this might be attributed to the aging process, but not to this degree.The idea of a Mafia don occupying a position analogous to royalty or a statesman is ludicrous, but it can make for an entertaining movie. Unfortunately, this does not carry through the entirety of the film. Up until the time Michael and his family travel to Sicily it kept my interest, but during the final, overly long opera scene I simply wished it would end.There were other problems too, particularly with the film's timing. If we are to believe that this takes place in the time it was actually made, 1990, Michael would have to be about 70 years old (look at the cars, which are all of that time frame). I arrive at this by estimating his age in the Godfather I, which took place around 1945, as 25, meaning he was born around 1920. When he dies, he looks a LOT older than 70, or even 80, yet the movie does not indicate that 10 or 20 years have passed.Perhaps I'm being a bit too picky, and with most any other director I'd agree. But this is Francis Ford Coppola, one of the best directors living today, so I find it not unreasonable to put his work under the microscope.We are left with the clear impression that Andy Garcia was being set up as the next don, and I'm sure that there will eventually be a Godfather IV. I can only hope that it's not as disappointing as this I found the third installment to be. As far as Coppola goes, I once had the occasion to communicate with a close associate of his. He claimed that Coppola had been very deeply affected by the death of his son, which would explain a lot. Let us hope that he can find a way to overcome his grief and give us a movie truly representative of his immense talents.....",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A disappointing finale to a great saga.,"As a huge fan of the first 2 movies, I was disappointed with Francis Ford Coppola's final chapter. Events surrounding the production of the movie doomed this picture to be a letdown from the start. Director Francis Ford Coppola cast his own daughter, Sofia, to play the part of Michael Corleone's daughter since Winona Ryder had backed out due to an illness. Ms. Coppola's performance was laughable at best. You would think that Mr. Coppola would have at least paid for some acting lessons. My other problem with this movie is that Robert Duvall was missing in his role as Tom Hagen, family consigliere. Mr. Duvall wanted way too much money which was rightly deserved. I couldn't get used to seeing a sun-baked George Hamilton advise the family. It's a shame that all this overshadowed great performances by Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, and Joe Mantegna as Joey Zaza, but it did. I would've enjoyed seeing Andy Garcia reprise his role as Don Vincenzo Corleone in a fourth installment but now that screenwriter/author Mario Puzo has so dearly departed us, we may be stuck with this disappointing third and final picture as our only memory of his legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The acting is horrid,"I watched The Godfather Part 2 again after not having seen it for a number of years. I fell in love with it for the first time, especially the acting and the cinematography. I felt compelled to see 3 right after that, mainly because I was feeling the glow of the excellence of 2. I was hoping that that 3 was actually better than I had remembered from past viewing, and I was wrong. I've read lots of reviews about the plot and Sophia Coppola's wooden acting and still my major complaint from the get-go is the god-awful acting. Every one in the movie appears false! I just couldn't get beyond how forced each line appeared. Maybe the story was effective yet I couldn't get through enough of the film to understand the plot because of how painful it was to watch each actor deliver his/her lines. It's so excruciatingly obvious that Francis Ford Coppola was not inspired nor were his actors. All in all, the message this film conveys to me is that it was made under duress. It has no artistic connection whatsoever to the previous masterpieces of the same name.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unfairly Criticized and Underrated,"This final installment of ""The Godfather"" trilogy, THE GODFATHER: PART III really is unfairly criticized and underrated.

I am very impressed by Andy Garcia's performance as Vincent Mancini, the role fits him perfectly.

Diane Keaton's performance surprised me, especially in one particular scene; this is a side of her I have never seen before.Overall, THE GODFATHER: PART III is a great ending to the trilogy and I enjoyed it very much.

It ties it all together,"The Godfather parts 1 and 2 are complete works of art. They have originality, brilliant acting and writing. The third may not be amazing, but it certainly was good, maybe even great. As usual, Pacino gives a great performance, Andy Garcia is a good touch to give the story a darker edge then it already has, and the directing by Cappola is stunning, beautiful images and cinematography. At times the writing seems strained, the dialogue, awkward to hear, and some of the characters stereotypical, where as the first two made them original characteristics. Now lets get to the part we have all been waiting for, Sophia Cappola. We all are not watching the film to see her, but I tell you, I would watch her a thousand times a day instead of Winona Ryder. Cappola isn't very good at acting, her directing is far better, however that works out, but she is at times watchable, maybe even humorous to see force out the lines. I'm sorry Sophie but I'm sure you've heard it all a thousand times, never the less, don't let her get in the way of seeing this picture. It's interesting, smart, and hey, it's the end, you can't close the book before reading that last chapter right?

Hold on a minute,"Awesome movie to take a great trilogy to a close. Excellent acting, excellent directing, and themes, motifs, and symbols that are really intriguing. (Look in the Godfathers for murder directly following the scenes of someone eating an orange- it foreshadows death) And in the Godfather III, it shows Michael being served OJ which displays the fact that Michael is having other people taking care of his problems because he is slowly breaking down.Anyway plenty of people will go into great detail with movies like this so ill just say this:The women in this one tick me off. Talia Shire. She's innocent, soft spoken, and angelic in both Godfathers 1 and 2. Not only that but she's always a very strongly against the family business. All of a sudden she's making hits and acting like a big shot in this cosa nostra. Talia, go back inside and come back out when you need one of your brothers to beat some culo.And for the other one, Sonny's daughter, get off your cousin! I'm Italian your disgracing the family values here come on. You know why I really didn't like her though? Because Godfather to me is set in a generation that I link to the traditional Italian-American family values. Sonny's daughter is a more modern generation breed and I don't like the new generation mixed in with the old, it seems too...too..today. Kids are much more free these days and don't really place their family first. When i was a kid it was always Sundays with the family, pasta and meatballs from 2 till everyones done talking.

"Not perfect, but still good.","My journey into the Godfather saga has been quite a surprise. I expected not to like them at all. But I ended up thinking The Godfather was extremely good, and Godfather 2 even better.. You don't have to be into mafia-stuff to like these movies at all!Now for number 3 I kind of expected to like it just as much as the other twos. I thought the bad critics was mainly cynical. But, in some ways I found them to be quite right indeed. Sophia Coppola is today a great director in my opinion. I loved both of her present movies. In this movie she's playing Michael Corleone's daughter, and she really doesn't suit the character. The movie also suffers from a bit of a loose grip. I had to watch this movie over three days because I found myself too impatient to watch it. The other two movies are also slow in a sense, but they kind of held a grip on you all the way. On the better side the movie does bring a lot of completing segments into the saga. It shows a lot of the afterlife of the mafia affairs which Michael Corleone is trying to stop once and for all now. Andy Garcia plays his part good as well. The confession scene is one of the best scenes of the saga even maybe. Its a good movie. And its a good closing of the saga. Very slow though.

"Coppola unable to escape his own shadow,","There has been a lot of nonsense written about this film. I think we can all agree that it doesn't compare to the original classics, which are really a complete work - from another time & place. They look down from a heady pedestal as the most perfect achievement in modern American film. So, there are lots of reasons why GF3 isn't as good as the first movies; NONE of those reasons have to do with Francis Coppola's talent. He's actually been rather dismissive of the film himself - just listen to the DVD commentary. But he made it because he needed the money. And he didn't have much luck in production, either. According to Al Pacino & Walter Murch, the original script was ""all there"". Again - it was about the death of a brother, Tom Hagen. When Duvall pulled out - it knocked the structure from underneath the piece. So he tried something different, improvising & revising on set. It didn't work. The scripts for the first two are world class. But he & Puzo had almost a year to write both of them - compared to the 6 weeks for GF3. Winona Ryder pulling out was a big blow. Choosing Sofia was stress induced folly - even then I don't think she is the main flaw. Eli Wallach's performance is quite frankly worse, wildly OTT. And by all accounts post-production was rushed & panicked. Why wasn't Walter Murch involved from the start, instead of being drafted in at the 11th hour? Coppola made some bad decisions and never quite managed to establish his rhythm or tone. But there is still so much to enjoy in this film. Brilliant sets from Dean Tavoularis, gorgeous autumnal photography & costume design from Gordon Willis & Milena Canonero. Pacino is once again magnificent - even if his characterisation seems a million miles from GF2. Also, Andy Garcia, given the confinements of the script is superb. And for all it's flaws, I have a lot of affection for this film. Francis Coppola is unable to make a film without genuine emotion - and compared to 90% of the crap we get forced fed today, GF3 is really rather good thanks. I always thought this film was the perfect metaphor for Coppola's career; flawed & brilliant in equal measure - unable to escape the shadow cast by his own initial burst of genius. A bit like Michael Corleone, really.*** I've just finished watching the trilogy on the new re-mastered DVDs. Have to say the films look just incredibly beautiful. Not only the oily browns, blacks & yellows, but also the blues, greens & reds - my God - the REDS! Just glorious. Along with a brilliantly enhanced sound /score, Part 3 has benefited enormously. No kidding - the whole piece has been lifted - plays much better, with a lovely ""cathedral"" quality, I didn't appreciate before. Overall, the films look much more a like. Really, Gordon Willis should get a Noble Prize for photography.

There should never be another in this series, leave well enough alone.Now, back to the Mary casting: I cannot *believe* that a man as brilliant and intelligent as F.F. Coppola would be so arrogant as to nepotistically cast an unproven, ineffective actress in a central role like Mary. Unbelievable. It's the only taint on the entire series of films.One of the best moments of the film: when Vincent is brought into the room with Zasa and is trying (unsuccesfully) to control himself, as he says, ""What am I gonna do with this guy, eh?"" he does a body movement that makes you swear James Caan is back playing Sonny.

"OK, so it's not as good as the first two","Judged on its own merits The Godfather: Part III would probably be remembered as a pretty good film. But this film was never going to be judged on its own merits. It was always going to be compared to the first two Godfather films. And, not surprisingly considering the first two are among the most acclaimed and revered films of all time, Part III doesn't measure up. That doesn't make this a bad film though. Yes it has some notable flaws but there are certainly enough good things here to make this final journey into the world of the Corleone family worthwhile.The most obvious and most often repeated criticism of Part III regards Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone. And the performance is indeed rather terrible. But all the criticism of Sofia Coppola is more than a bit overblown. She was bad but she didn't deserve all the vitriol she received. On a first viewing of the film she certainly sticks out like a sore thumb, especially considering all the quality performers around her. But when you go back and watch the film again you realize that while her character was an important one in the story she's really not on the screen all that much. She's certainly not front and center to the point her presence could possibly sink the whole film. The criticism she received is way out of proportion with her actual impact on the film. And while she has some truly terrible moments there are some times where she's at least passable. The legend of the awful Sofia Coppola Godfather: Part III performance has far outstripped reality.Sofia Coppola's awkward performance may get the most attention but it is not the only flaw with the film, certainly not the most important one. The biggest flaws deal with the story which is rather convoluted. So many shadowy figures lurking in the background, so many different strands of the plot which need to be tied together. The first two Godfather films were grand and epic. That sense of grandeur is missing here. The story is big, director Francis Ford Coppola is clearly aiming for epic. But this film falls short of that mark. Where the first two films built momentum all the way through this film is saddled with a story which only moves forward in fits and starts. With so much going on some important characters are never really properly developed. Who exactly is Don Lucchesi anyway and what strings is he pulling in the Vatican? What exactly is Archbishop Gilday's role in all this? Not really sure. Don Altobello, with the Corleone family or against them? And why? By the time some of these questions are answered, and some of them are never really answered satisfactorily, it's too late. The story seems to have gotten away from Francis Ford Coppola a bit and when he tries to bring it all together in the end, as he did so well in the first two films, the payoff isn't nearly as great this time around.Viewed through the prism of the first two films Part III is certainly a bit of a letdown. But rather than bemoan what it isn't, namely one of the greatest movies of all time like its predecessors, you can still enjoy and appreciate this film for what it is. If you can get your head around the story there are a lot of things to like about the film. Al Pacino is terrific as ever as a now beaten-down, worn-out Michael Corleone. Old reliables Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are back for another go although Robert Duvall is sorely missed, his replacement George Hamilton making no real impact at all. There are some good new characters. Andy Garcia does a very good job in portraying Sonny's hotheaded illegitimate son Vincent Mancini, newly welcomed into the Corleone family business. Eli Wallach is excellent as old Don Altobello even if the script doesn't provide us with much insight into the character. Donal Donnelly does very well with the role of the nervous Archbishop Gilday, a man with the weight of the Vatican bearing down on his shoulders. Unfortunately Gilday is another somewhat undeveloped character. Amongst other new characters Don Lucchesi is woefully undeveloped, Joey Zasa is an underwhelming antagonist and Mary Corleone has the aforementioned, if overblown, Sofia Coppola problem. The flaws with this film are plain to see. But the good outweighs the bad. This film was always going to be held to an impossible standard. It falls short of greatness but it still manages to pack quite a punch. Michael Corleone's journey is at an end, the saga is complete. History may deem The Godfather: Part III to be a disappointment. But that is really not fair. It is a good film and a worthy conclusion to one of film's most epic tales.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Some of the scenes, especially the one at the Italian feast with the procession which really reminds us with Vito's story is too close to the one previously seen. When you saw the three parts quite closely in time you really have a feeling of `déjà vu' which suppresses the suspense. Things here seems too superficial and put together only to answer all the questions we could have had in the previous films : how it was possible to act like that with Fredo, how Michael was feeling with his first wife and then with Kay. But, any of us could have made nearly the same answers and while in part II things seemed a bit too hard, here things seem a bit too nice  with respect to people feeling. For me, the only good part of the film is the enigma around the Vatican, which is inspired by a real life fact. The film gives its own interpretation of it and it is rather pleasant.

The second ,divided between the De Niro and Pacino episodes ,created a compelling dynamic. Here, Pacino has to carry the whole movie. Although Dianne Keaton tries her best, she has become too bitter to be anything but nagging to Pacino. And we know by this time he is already tortured enough. The rest of the cast just doesn't measure up to the earlier versions . It would have been nice to have Robert Duvall return as Tom Hagen rather than suffer through the ""Lady Macbeth"" histrionics of Talia Shire.

"A beautiful, elegant look back at The Godfather and The Godfather Part II","The reason for which The Godfather Part III has such a nasty reputation and is underrated is not that it is inferior, not even that it is too different from the other too, it I that it came out too late. Since it took so long to make it, people had created their own expectations for a third Godfather. If it had taken so long to make The Godfather Part II, it probably would have met with as little success.I do not know if The Godfather Part III is the best of the trilogy- I think they are all three to different to compare them- but it is certainly the one that leaves me most satisfied. It is an elegant, nostalgic, operatic, Shakespearian epilogue to The Godfather. It possesses an irresistible, inexpressible, and personal charm.One of the things I like best about The Godfather Part III is that it is an old man's film in every sense. It has the calm, relaxed feel of many films made by aging people- Bergman's Fanny and Alexander, Lean's A Passage to India, Renoir's Le Caporal Epingle. It is a meditation on the passage of times. Michael, Connie, and Kay have all changed but there remains a distant feel of how they were the last time we saw them. There are also these little moments that remind of us of ""the old days"" (Vincent's way of saying ""I'll take care of it"" like his grandfather Vito in the second Godfather, how Joey Zasa faintly reminds us of Don Michael in the first two film). It is a look back at the first two films through the eyes of an old Michael.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Happy it got made,"Big successes are than it offers another installment in a great story, given the benefit of being carried by sublimeness of the previous 2, and it's well shot.But the reason this movie is despised is also plain in many traits.The biggest fail is pandering to recollections of the previous movies, and a soap-operatic tone. Nothing is at stake with Andy Garcia and Sophia Coppola as superficially attractive young tourists of the previous installments who never actually embody their roles as a new generation. I can imagine S. Coppola having sex on the couch with Garcia while watching the original on on Cable TV and bragging about it to her BFF.No one in this installment has any gravitas and much time is wasted on drawn-out idiomatic patter that begs you to recall the previous 2, but never amplifying any portion of the previous story.It's worse than lamentable that this movie offers beat-for-beat repetitions of gestures from the previous movies, with only minor adjustments to syncopation.In its backwards-looking, It's like ""Tenet"" of Godfather, with the Vatican playing an eerily similar part to Ken Branaugh's evil, dead-ender uber-oligarch.My initial reaction was disgust as Pacino seems to be literally diabetic in his responses to having to bring Michael back to life. He is sort put in a casket to start, climbs out, and slowly shuffles as more than a zombie through the paces of a criminal mastermind with a wheezy ambivalence towards redemption. The characters of his kids are oddly, yet believably, passive and bored, with S. Coppola coming across as a daddy's girl way too believably, and the character of his estranged son serving no point but to rhapsodically eulogize the first movie--The kids are meta-textual constructs here. In the son's case, operated at the level of the NYC stage actors seen by young Vito in GFII, so that Mike can reprise the portentous walk-out of Don Fannuci. Except this time it's lame and boring because it signifies nothing but Pacino's Michael's unease at having to listen the character of his fake son give a guitar recital of the series' theme music.In Terrence Makick's Knght of Cups, Rick voice-overs how he aged and forgot the man he thought he wanted to be, and now looks back on dissatisfaction with realization he made life miserable for himself and for everyone around him. In this GF, we see a cinematic embodiment of regret that's not tragic because painful outcomes of previous choices, but tragic in how senility obviates any memory about why those choices were ever made--both in the character of Michael and in Coppola's direction! GFI and GFII were brilliant vital renderings. GFIII is an aging uncle still living his heyday in his dreams but mostly just nattering about it to his kids. When Vincent (Andy Garcia) helps Michael from the casino attack, did that situation really happen? Or did Vincent (Andy Garcia) just shine Michael on, as he assisted with the changing of a Depends Adult Undergarment?Andy Garcia (Vincent)... I guess I get his appeal in the sense of celebrity fetish, which I imagine is analogous to why I like Cara Delevingne in Luc Besson's Valerian--mutant sex appeal. GFIII is a production similar to Besson's Valerian in the way the directors have inadvertently introduced empty space into derivative works which they prefer to see as cleverly overflowing with personal idioms, when in fact they create a void by merely rehashing pet gestures from previous successes. As John Huston retorts in Peter Bogdonovich's completion of Orson Welles' The Other Side of the Wind: ""It's alright if we steal from each other, but what we must never do is steal from ourselves!""I've never liked Keaton as Kay, she just seemed wrong and unbelievable, with her modest strength as an actor being a bit of wit about the absurdity of so much pretending--this made her a great sidekick to Woody Allen in movies like Sleeper and Love & Death. In GFI and GFII her Kay serves a tediously plausible but empty counterpoint of some other American reality beyond the tyranny of the family, but she never get as far as intruding, she's merely imposed as a plot device: In GFII, Michael has to be up against something personal in his state-side marriage and Keaton puts on the helmet with the blast-shield and dodges like Luke Skywalker harnessing the force to avoid Mike Vader's raving. In this movie, Kay is such an outlier that she's only a bit more than an empty signifier, helping Mike go through an awkward reconciliation with himself. it's impossible to imagine they ever had anything for each other. And looking back at the other movies its obvious they didn't, we just overlooked it because of all the other characters.In the broadest sense, my complaints about this movie are sort of a claim about its authenticity: Real families, inc my own, are actually like this across the generations... Something once vital about an era ends up getting lost through no fault of anyone in the lineage. It's just that situations age out.So, although this is movie is only a pale extension of the other two, I still enjoyed seeing it, and I'm glad it got made. More life ain't bad.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A mixed bag, but you can't ignore what its highlights add to the saga.","With its present reputation, it takes a long time to get around to The Godfather Part III, unless of course you're already a big fan of Coppola's saga. I only ever wanted to watch it after refreshing myself with the first two parts, but that's a long investment. You've seen over 6 hours worth of film before you get around to the third, usually I'm burnt out by then. However, this time I really came around on Part II. While I'm still hot and cold on Part I, mostly admiring it more than enjoying it, I found a deep and consistent appreciation of Part II that really spoke to me on a personal level. I'd finally found motivation for Part III and I don't intend to revisit it anytime soon. It's good, not great - but you can't take away the things it does right.Most of the acting is stellar, the production is top notch as always and it closes arcs on poignant notes. It's at its best when it's low key. The weakest moments are when Coppola tries too hard. The violence is sudden, but unmeasured. It feels like he's just nudging you for your attention but moments like these fatally break the flow. I hate to agree with the consensus of hating Sofia Coppola, but yes, she is a dire sore thumb in need of a bandage. A surprisingly welcome addition to the saga is Andy Garcia, who's the one exception to the rule of the film's best moments being the low-key ones. It really needed Tom Hagen, his absence illustrates how this was just a film made for the money but the studio wasn't keen to spread that love. Part III is a mixed bag with some worthy highlights.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Also, Sofia Coppola can't act.Beyond that though, the film has amazing performances (Sofia Coppola may not be one of them, but Andy Garcia cretainly is) and way too many great scenes and sequences to call it bad.A step down from its predecessors (it can't be easy being a sequel to not just one, but TWO of the greatest films of all time), but being the weakest Godfather movie still means you're better than 99% other movies.

"The overall effect of the piece is one of total disappointment, with an aftertaste of poor writing, bad acting and an utter lack of subtlety.","'The Godfather: Part III (1990)' feels like a total betrayal of character, a backtrack of immense proportions tacked onto the end of two terrific cinematic achievements. Only the incredibly brave or incredibly foolish would even attempt to touch this series with a ten-foot pole for fear of besmirching either its legacy or their reputation, though this unnecessary epilogue was surely only even attempted for monetary reasons. The insatiable studio was determined to milk this cash-cow with or without the talent that could make it even close to something worthy of its moniker, so perhaps it was best that Coppola and co came on board. Sadly, while it is perhaps better than it could have been and the picture does indeed have a few interestingly inspired moments, the overall effect of the piece is one of total disappointment, leading to an aftertaste of poor writing, bad acting and an utter lack of subtlety that makes you yearn for the first two features again. It almost seems like it's from a different franchise and, while it doesn't quite ruin what came before, you're probably better off not knowing what happens to our mafia-man protagonist once the credits roll on 'Part II (1974)'. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
All the power on earth can't save some performances in this reasonable closing chapter,"Most of what you can say about the previous instalments in the trilogy, apply here. It's generally well acted - with one exception - and looks nice. This time there's the theme of striving for redemption, as Michael Corleone looks to atone with others, and - most importantly - with himself, for the crimes he has committed in the past. All well and grand then - we're having a more character-focused movie here. There's one extremely low bit to this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned it too - the dreaded performance of Sofia Coppola, as Michael's daughter. And yes, it is that bad. Her scenes, especially put against her peers, are liking having a drill boring into your brain - they're flat, with poor delivery, and no emotional resonance. However I can overlook it and focus on the movie, which should otherwise please fans of the series (which I am not particularly). The story does have a fairly fitting sense of resolution, and believable with what has gone before. It's a fine enough piece of film making but again fails to fully engage me.

Sophia seemed somehow more acceptable as an ingenue, the ending less over-the-top operatic., the story more cohesive. Mostly, it feels less like Coppola replaying his greatest hits and more like a brilliant re-imaging of scenes he did brilliantly before - the wedding, the end montage. Subtract a star because the film still wasn't necessary, and another for a few awkward moments and some bad voice dubs, but overall, a very satisfying and close to brilliant film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind""","My three-week engagement with Francis Ford Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy came to a close this week, and, contrary to the prevailing public opinion, I find myself satisfied. 'The Godfather: Part III (1990)' has always been the Fredo of the 'Godfather' family  frequently disparaged, resented or otherwise ignored. Certainly, there was considerable risk in returning to the Corleone family after a sixteen-year absence, especially given the mixed critical and commercial reception towards much of Coppola's 1980s output {indeed, the director only accepted the studio offer to recoup his past financial losses}. Nevertheless, that a second sequel wasn't produced sooner demonstrates Coppola's dedication towards getting everything right, and the result is a picture that successfully expands upon the two previous instalments, respectfully and solemnly drawing the saga to a close. Any film is liable to suffer in comparison with two of the great gangster pictures of our time, but, despite a few issues  which I'll get to shortly  'The Godfather: Part III' is a more than worthy addition to the family.Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has spent the last two decades trying to legitimise his operations, perhaps a last futile attempt at reconstructing his shattered family. However, still tormented by the memory of brother Fredo, Michael knows that he can never truly wash his hands of organised crime (""just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in!""). Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent (Andy Garcia) offers his services to Michael, proving his dedication towards the family, even if he shares his father's recklessness. Michael's two children have since grown up. Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has defied his father's wishing by becoming an opera singer, and Mary (Sofia Coppola) begins a worrying incestuous relationship with Vincent. Meanwhile, in a further bid to improve his reputation and importance, Michael moves to purchase the Vatican's shares in real-estate company Immobiliare, a bid that ultimately reveals corruption and treachery in the highest echelons of the Catholic Church, a group traditionally regarded as pure and virtuous. Here, Coppola shows that policemen, judges, and even priests, can readily be bought.For the most part, 'The Godfather: Part III' is a wonderful film. Gordon Willis' return as cinematographer ensured that the film remained aesthetically consistent with its predecessors, and Coppola's film-making is, for the most part, handsome and professional. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is just as convoluted as the original film, but I'm confident that a second viewing will substantially improve my understanding of each character and their motives. Though the first few dialogue scenes seem strained, as though the actors are easing into their roles, the performances are generally excellent. Only Sofia Coppola  and I don't want to labour the point, since she's been lambasted enough  fails to construct a well-defined screen persona. She wears a peculiar scowl for most of the film, and her role in the story is vague and superficial. Nevertheless, any of the picture's weaknesses are quickly forgotten in lieu of an unforgettable climax, set amid an operatic performance of ""Cavalleria Rusticana,"" perhaps the finest instance of super-prolonged suspense since the Albert Hall sequence in 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).'",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A worthy finale..,"The Godfather: Part III has met rigorous criticism, and although far from the colossal standard of it's predecessors, it remains a decent finale to the finest saga ever made. The final sequence is near-flawless, and Pacino's performance is superb. Add this to a bold plot, rich cinematography and a fine score, you get a creditable movie, which is certainly not brilliant but vastly underrated. The film packs a strong emotional punch and is a worthy ending to the tale of Michael Corleone.The real problem with the picture, if I had to pick out one of the many reasons it doesn't match the earlier flicks, is that is lacks the significant images and lines that make the others not only great stories but profound and wise fables. There are less representations, and it is a less philosophical and bold narrative. Furthermore, in terms of practically every cinematic aspect, it is way behind that of Parts I and II, and doesn't have the effect they do.However, it is still a good film; it tells us of an adequate ending to the Corleone chronicles, and it tells it well. The last minutes are surprisingly moving, and the movie as a whole would stand up strong on its own, should its high expectations be lifted.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I've given it 10/10, and I don't generally do that. The Godfather 2 is a very good movie. Yet The Godfather 3 goes beyond both its predecessors, and is easily the best of the three. It might well be the best movie I've ever seen.It combines all the strengths of the past godfathers (great acting, great scenes, thrilling story, etcetera), but it adds something to it. What is new is subtlety and true tragedy. This last part has the main character really think about what he has done in his life - ethics finally catch up with him. This makes for interesting psychological and ethical questions not seen in the previous two movies. There is another storyline going through all this - the difficulty to get out of a criminal position once you are in it is demonstrated beautifully by the difficulties the Corleones have with becoming legal.I won't spoilt the end of the movie by telling what happens, but this is another great point. No 'victorious' ending like part 1, no bleak ending like part 2, but the purest tragedy. Truly beautiful.

Not as bad but please don't compare it to the prequels...,"The movie was not altogether that bad, but the prequels are in a class of their own.

How many times did we even here Sonny's name in the Godfather part 2. I think Coppola knew he didn't have the same atmosphere as the previous ones so built this one around to remind the viewer of the past.Why on earth did Coppola have his daughter play such a critical character. Her character grows on the audience like a thorn stinging you, she leaves you wishing that she never appears again in any of the scenes. Andy Garcia was good, and I swear I saw James Caan in Garcia's character more than once. Al Pacino was Al Pacino.

A travesty - just awful,"Let me be a bit more precise: If you were to see this movie without having seen or known much about the first two (and why would you do that, pray tell?), you might find it a mildly entertaining Hollywood production, marred by ham acting, a script that covers a lot of ground to no good effect, and egregious Italianamerican stereotypes. Coming to it with a knowledge of the first two films, what I saw was a travesty - a totally unnecessary film that unintentionally parodied most of what was great about its predecessors.The critics were pretty kind to Godfather III when it came out, no doubt out of the respect for I and II. But the truth is quite dismal.Where to even begin? In place of the powerfully minimal, understated performances he gave in I and II, Al Pacino gives yet another of the scenery-chewing exhibitions he's been prone to of late. The part where he chauffeurs Diane Keaton around Sicily looks like it was accidentally thrown in from a bad cable-TV travelogue. Talia Shire's performance is a kitsch-fest of Italianamerican cliches. Although perversely entertaining, it has nothing to do with the character she created in the first two films. George Hamilton as the consigliere instead of Robert Duvall? What were they thinking??? The only reason Sofia Coppola isn't laughed off the screen is because all the other performances here are so broadly awful that she actually comes across as somewhat understated (although her Valley Girl intonations are pretty hopeless).One of the great things about Godfathers I and II was the way they avoided cliches and gave dignity to Italian American characters in a setting that's usually been used to stereotype them, and in fact used them to comment not on mafia corruption but on the corruption of America itself. Not here! The penultimate scenes with the poison canoli at the opera are Italianamerican kitsch to the Nth, and the killing on the opera house steps that follows is just bad Verdi.It's clear this movie was made entirely for the bucks. Coppola and Puzo had nothing left to say about these characters. Let's just pretend it doesn't exist, shall we?",,Anonymous,Crime

A splendid finale,"Occasionally marred by certain technical imperfections (such as problematic dubbing or, at least in one instance, unacceptably bad editing) and an unfortunate casting choice, the third part of the Godfather saga is the ill masterpiece that never got the recognition it deserved. Few directors possess the Promethean touch to spark atmosphere in their master shot, the feel for historical detail, the breath for a period saga, the skill to narrate a layered plot or the demonic ability to translate the operatic passion to a crime story. Mr. Coppola is this Viscontian descendant and the Godfather is his three-part Gatopardo. Godfather III is a film of almost serene beauty, toned perfectly in its operatic fatalism, shot (surprisingly for such a fluid picture) in mainly steady shots, baptized in the blessed air of Sicily for the better half of it and forever haunted by the probably deserved but certainly emotionally devastating fall of its protagonist.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

And that's what the whole movie is about. The other actors (Andy Garcia does a great job!) are just there to explain what Michael is worried about. Coppola's title for the movie was ""The death of Michael Corleone"" but Paramount changed the title. The original title explains what the movie is about, not about the family, it's about life, it's about things you did in your life and how you might think about them later. Michael doesn't care about the ""business"" anymore, he wants to be a good man. But in the end, there's no way out and for the first time, Michael is the victim. It's a fantastic movie.

Probably shouldn't have been made,And the amazing thing about that is that it's better than most of the stuff being made today. I think the reason why it doesn't have the acclaim accorded to the first two is that it was made too late and doesn't have the powerhouse actors the first two did. Notably missing is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall wasn't offered enough money) and Sofia Coppola should not have been cast as she wasn't an actress (Winona Ryder backed out of the project at the last minute). The funny part of trivia about this film was Coppola's visit to Duvall's house in which Duvall thought he was wanting the recipe to his crab cakes not offering him a part in this next film and the fact that Coppola threatened to start the film with Michael's funeral because Pacino wanted so much money. Again real life situations are part of this movie and are obvious to the semi-trained eye. Garcia isn't bad he just isn't enough to make it truly great which in and of itself isn't his fault the movie was just too contemporary for it's own good.

"Some say underrated, some say shouldn't have been released","Being somebody who loved Godfather I and II, this movie truly changed the way I will remember Don Michael Corleone. But that's not even the problem. Not only did this movie undo what was done in the first two movies, it had a major flaw in the casting of Mary Corleone. Although some may not agree, the majority of this movie's storyline is dependent on the much loved Mary. When Sofia Coppola played Mary (honestly she sounded half-asleep throughout the movie, idk if she's trying to sound seductive but it wasn't working for me), the entire plot comes crashing down. The way Mary Corleone was portrayed did not allow the viewers to become attached to her character, much less understand why the characters around her adored her so. If Mary had been portrayed with a stronger presence, it would've been an acceptable closing to the Godfather series. If I could make erase my memory of this third movie, I would. The way Godfather part II ended was perfect. With Michael Corleone making the stone-cold decision to kill anyone who poses a harm to his family, it made his character rock-solid, respected, and most of all, a legend. But being a huge fan of the first two, I had to see the final installment for myself, and man did Sofia Coppola disappoint. I'm not saying I'm 100% happy with the other characters' acting and the overall plot. But if Mary's casting had more character, it would've made the movie a LOT more formidable. Al Pacino's acting was all that saved this movie from being a horrible one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good story ruined by one bad apple,"I found Godfather Part III to be a plausible, but somewhat flawed, ending to the Godfather saga. The story of Immobiliare and corruption within the church was riveting. Most of the parts were acted well, especially Pacino's and Garcia's. The notable exception, as many have pointed out, was Sofia Coppola - she was definitely miscast for the central and crucial role of Maria. The woman just cannot act, at least in this film. A good film would have been a much better one had Winona Ryder stayed on.Other shortcomings: the hit scene in Atlantic City was just not believable. More people would have fled that room than what was shown.  Also, the final scene in which Mary is killed is overly melodramatic, while it defies the law of physics.  I don't know of anyone who could take a shot in the chest from a 9mm at close range, then have enough strength to keep standing and say ""Daddy"" before collapsing (OK, maybe the guy from Halloween could).Also, what happens to Connie, and Vinnie after the hit at the opera?  A short glimpse of their lives after would have been good.Despite the flaws, it is still a good film.  It could have been much, much better, perhaps even one of the best in the saga, with better writing and casting.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Godfather Part III,"After the failure of Zoetrope Studio. Coppola was mired in debt. Paramount Pictures drew Francis Ford Coppola back in to help him out of his financial black hole.Inspired by King Lear, Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote the screenplay in between playing the gambling tables in Vegas casinos.After winning the Best Picture Oscars for Parts One and Two. It was the third trip to the well with The Godfather III. This time they would only land a Best Picture nomination.Draped in autumnal colours. It is 1979 the elderly Godfather Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) seeks redemption over the deaths and destruction he had caused. A life of crime since coming home as a war hero. It involved giving the order to execute his brother Fredo.Now the Corleone family are going legitimate. Giving money to charitable causes and donating a sizeable chunk of money to help out the Vatican bank from a financial deficit. In exchange the Corleone family will get a controlling interest in the Vatican's real estate company. Once that is approved by the Pope.Only the Pope dies and Michael Corleone realises that the Catholic Church are just another set of gangsters. Some of them have a foot in the clerical world as well as the underworld.One of them is in cahoots with the New York crime families upset that the Corleone's are going straight and will hold a powerful position in the Vatican.Coppola has subsequently re-edited the third film. The 30th anniversary issue was called The Death of Michael Corleone.Upon its release the Godfather III was heavily criticised by some critics. The first two movies are regarded as the greatest movies of all time.The plot was seen as complex, the last minute casting of Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter after Winona Ryder dropped out. Then Paramount got cheap by not ponying up to get Robert Duvall to reprise his role as Tom Hagen.Also Michael Corleone was now a weaker character, being bossed around by other women. Ex wife Kay (Diane Keaton) and his sister Connie (Talia Shire) who parades around as a latter day Lady Macbeth. Now more bloodthirsty than the man who ordered the death of her husband.Duvall is certainly a glaring omission. Sofia Coppola is adequate, she has the naivety required. A young woman who has had to live a privileged but sheltered life. What young man is going to mess with the Godfather's daughter?The only one is long lost cousin Vincent (Andy Garcia) the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone. It's true that Sofia does not have the chops for the dramatic scenes. Maybe Bridget Fonda should have been considered who got a minor role as a journalist.The movie still has a grand epicness. Coppola still has an assured touch with the set pieces. When Vincent takes out gangster Joey Zasa. The helicopter attack in the Atlantic City hotel
Then there is the finale in the opera house in Italy. It also mirrors the Joey Zasa assassination scene. The opera part has been mimicked in other films such as Quantum of Solace.As a director Coppola was not on a cash grab. He and Puzo sensed the corruption in the Vatican. When in the 1980s New York City DAs finally took on the real life elderly Mafia bosses. They were suddenly old ill men. You can see them in their court appearances with oxygen tanks. When years earlier they were venal men ordering murders of people. You could understand why Michael was being bossed about by his sister.Coppola did well with the casting of Garcia. The hot headed outsider Vincent who Michael grooms to take over the family business. Right from that opening scene when Michael beckons Vincent over to be part of the family photo. It is the realisation that Michael knows who some of his enemies are. Joey Zasa is a two bit thug, someone is controlling him.Despite being maligned in some quarters. The Godfather III is better than some recent Oscar winners. I found it better than Dances with Wolves who did win the Best Picture Oscar that year.It also marks the end of an era of a particular type of gangster film. Where the mafia are regarded as criminals with a code, a sense of honour. 1990 also saw Martin Scorsese release Goodfellas. That showed a different aspect of the mafia. Hyper violent with psychotics. No code and no honour. It is this view of gangsters that has now stuck.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A watchable, 3rd shot, but ultimately unmemorable","Watching this film many years after its release for the second time, I have to say if the power had gone half-way through I'd have been pretty annoyed, and yet as the end titles rolled I felt much like after the first viewing that there was nothing really outstanding or memorable about this film.Rather than packing a final jaw-shattering punch, (like the 1st installment), or confronting us with bleak immorality, (part 2), the film is like one long second act without any of the set-pieces that made me sit up and take note in the previous movies, (horses head, murder of the five families, motel hooker mutilation, Easter parade, domestic violence, etc.), although some attempts are made to include many of these ideas, (eg. the assassination of Joey Zasa).The cast try their hardest. Andy Garcia, initially very annoying, settles down to a more natural performance after a ludicrous establishing scene at the Corleone party, biting an ear off - (come off it Francis)! Sofia Copplola mostly carries the part, (unless she speaks); Diane Keaton leaps in and out from the wings saying the same old things, and George Hamilton does rather well in the unenviable task of filling Robert Duval's role as consigliari. Vatcian politics is portrayed bleakly and the theme of honour killing is dealt with quite well, making some nice references to motifs in the previous installments, (eg explaining the curious operetta seen in part 2 by a young Vito). John Savage, however, is utterly wasted in the superfluous character of Tom Hagen's son, and Franc D' Abrosio seems hopelessly miscast as Pacino's son.All in all though this is a cynical film made purely to capitalise on the franchise and made to line Coppola's pockets after the commercial failure of Tucker. The script was also over-laboured and subject to major changes, some a result of financial constraints. The direction is less assured than the previous films, Michael's 'dread' is imperceptible and, curiously for a film of this genre, there is nothing adult enough to elevate it from a melodrama; - it's pretty much family viewing! All in all I enjoyed watching this film, and it does close the story for good, but considering the power & legacy of the first two movies it is ironic that the series should end on such a wimper, rather than a bang.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Most Underrated Film of All Time,"The final chapter in The Godfather Saga is regarded by many people today as something that pales in comparison to the first two Godfather films. This is probably because of the acting of Sofia Coppola. But the first time I saw the film, I noticed nothing wrong with her. Even with further viewings, she seemed to be a fine actress. Now she's not the best in the film, but she's not bad at all.With that out of the way, I can get into the plot of this film. Michael Corleone (Pacino) wants to get out of his business in crime. He even goes as far as to confess to a priest about what he did at the end of the second film. This doesn't work as well as he planned. The young Vincent (Andy Garcia) now wants to follow in his Uncle Michael's footsteps. But he can only do this if Michael is there to guide him.Another reason why he can't get out is the fact that a younger mafia man, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), wants to destroy the order of the old mafia. To stop this, Michael must reluctantly give in to his nephew and also deal with the rest of his family in the process.Every character in the film, like the first two, has its purpose. And everyone provides something that the film needs to become the great movie that it is. With this, Francis Ford Coppola gives us his final, excellent part in the masterpiece that is The Godfather Saga. Without this one, there's no real closure. That's why it was necessary to make this brilliant film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overlong and unnecessary,"One thing everyone knows about each of the three 'Godfather' films (even if they haven't seen them): that the first is the classiest piece of soap opera ever made, that the second is the most successful sequel ever made, and that the third is spoilt by the poor performance of Sofia Coppola, the director's daughter (who, of course, subsequently gave up acting altogether for a career as a director herself). For once, all of these pieces of conventional wisdom are true; moreover, all (and not just the last) are pertinent when answering the question, why isn't the third film (made after a long interval) as good as the other two? Because the complete answer isn't just Sofia's fault: it's fair to say that, after two epic movies, the whole idea has started to run out of gas, and the plot (based on the short reign of Pope John Paul I, and the death of Roberto Calvi), which appears tangential at best to the overall story of the American mafia, is itself one indicator of this. In effect, the central story has been told already, and it feels as if Coppola is cranking out one more episode of a soap, and no longer in a good way.The movie isn't all bad, but it loses further points for its bizarre ending, a lengthy sequence set during a night at the opera during which almost every character appears to be killed, including many whose particular role in the plot is not at all clear to the audience. Indeed, at times, the symbolism almost appears comically obvious - opera singer picks up a knife, man in the audience gets stabbed, opera singer picks up a rifle, man in the audience gets shot, etc. - and it's impossible to argue that less grandiosity, and more editing, would have benefited the whole finale. Ultimately, there's a reason why sequels aren't usually very good (if a story is told well, it is told and then it is done); and while Coppola managed to defy this rule in making 'The Godfather Part II', sixteen years later he came decidedly down to earth.",,Anonymous,Crime
The soul of the Godfather was Mario Puzo,"Okay it's the weakest of the Godfather films as Mario Puzo died before it would be produced, but I am also againist all those who claim that it's bad.
It's a nice epilogue to Michael Corleone's story, paying tribute to his character who finally understands Vito's teachings.
But the film itself proves that the soul of the Godfather was Mario Puzo. They were his characters and only he himself could trully understand them. Coppola created a fine third installment, but I believe that if Puzo was around to write the film and not only contribute the story, scenes like the love scenes or Michael's turn of character would have been done in a better, more fitting to the Godfather's atmosphere themes.
Finally, even though I watched the film with an open mind, it is true that Sofia Coppola being cast was a terrible move...
A great ending to the Godfather that could be better....",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant ending to the sequel,"This movie is definitely underrated and criticized harshly. I can empathize with people who expected more action, thriller especially after watching the first two members of the sequel. But the viewers need to understand one thing: ""Bigger crimes are political by nature"".The ending could not be pictured better than this. If you climb the criminal ladder, you eventually hit the rock of the politics and you have to deal with it. Given the fact that Michelle Corleone had a great power, he was a big threat to the political mafia, and he had to deal with it. If the main character is the big player himself, why bother showing small crimes in a limited time? It would be a waste of time. Also no matter who you are, no matter how powerful you are, there is always battle inside you aside from your external ones and this battle inside you is harder than any other external battle.

Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.,"Before I get started with my review of this movie, I made the decision to watch the version that was released in 2020 and this is the version of the movie that Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo originally envisioned the movie to be back in 1990. Well I just finished watching The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990) and it absolutely phenomenal.Positives for The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990):
First off, this movie is a technical masterpiece much like the first two Godfather movies were. Everything from the direction, screenplay, writing, story, editing, pacing, sound design, score, production value, set design, costumes, cinematography and acting are all perfect from the very beginning to the end credits. The acting from the entire cast is still phenomenal. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room that is Sofia Coppola and admittedly she is the main reason why I didn't bother to watch any of these Godfather movies because of all the negatives things I've heard about her performance. Now that I've watched the movie, I honestly say that she's not terrible in the movie, but she definitely gives the weakest performance of the entire Godfather Trilogy. The killing spree in this movie is by far the most brutal and violent it has ever been in this trilogy. And finally, I want to applaud both Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for finally getting the chance to release the version of their movie that they wanted it to be.Overall, The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990) is a phenomenal conclusion to one of the greatest movie trilogies in cinematic history and I highly recommend this version of the movie to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not in the same class...,"This movie is not in the same class as the first two, and this is not because of poor Sophia Coppola, who actually does a decent job as a naive Mafia princess in denial.  One of the strengths of the first two movies is that they stuck to events that actually could have happened.  The helicopter machine-gunning of the penthouse meeting of Dons would never happen. Especially in Atlantic, where mobsters are at pains to be inconspicuous. The very public struggle of Michael for control of the Vatican-owned conglomerate would have been carried out by WASPy proxies, not a Corleone.George Hamilton is surprisingly good as the mob mouthpiece.  Diane Keaton is surprisingly irritating as the liberated Kay.  Eli Wallach is absolutely awful as the deceitfully fawning Don Altobello.  Coppola ought to be horse-whipped for allowing this veteran character actor to become a huge and unbelievable HAM in this picture.Had there not been a I and II, this movie would have been mildly tolerable, but even the great performance by Pacino here cannot save this film from suffering severely by comparison to its two excellent ancestor films.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The most subtle, intellectual of the trilogy","I am very disappointed to hear all the negative comments and the jokes aimed at the final installment in The Godfather trilogy. But I guess it isn't that surprising for the third installment takes a long time jump over the second and is less violent. If the first movie was an introduction to power and a very powerful family, the second was about using that power as protection for the future, the third is about the cost of using power to secure your future, how you may change yourself but can't change your past.This is Al Pacino's best work of the 90s and probably his final subtle performance. Andy Garcia (the Pacino of his generation) steals the show and is the perfect actor to play James Caan's son. Sofia Coppola isn't as bad as most people think but I really regret that Winona Ryder wasn't in her place. Director Francis Ford Coppola takes a different approach in his direction, shooting much longer scenes with Michael Corleone and much more Italian language. The final climax and final image is haunting and is the inevitable, masterful end to America's greatest saga.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pacino reminded me of every other Pacino character I've seen for the past 30 years. The movie would have been much better served to have another actor play Michael.

"Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in","Frequently attacked and constantly under-appreciated, The Godfather, Part III is often, and unfairly, referred to as one of the biggest disappointments in the history of cinema. When comparing  and I suppose a comparison is inevitable  The Godfather, Part III is certainly not quite as strong as the first two films, both of which are classic masterpieces, practically flawless, to be found in any respectful list of all-time best movies. It was largely a failure both commercially and critically (being nominated for seven Oscars but receiving none). Nevertheless, Part III is a fantastic drama, as good a crime drama as Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', which was released that same year and received much more critical acclaim; certainly the last great film Francis Ford Coppola had directed yet (hopes for 'Youth Without Youth', which has a late 2006 release date). Just like The Godfather, Part II achieved greatness by not trying to recapture the original but being an entirely separate and unique creation, so Part III is a separate creation that stands by its own right, and while it's a continuation of the first two films, it does nothing to subtract from their greatness as some sequels do. The Godfather can work perfectly as a single film, as a two-parter, or as a trilogy; it's a wonderful saga either way.In many ways, The Godfather, Part III, is closer in its spirit to the first film than to the second. International affairs take second place to character development and human insight. Part III, however, focuses on the character of Michael Corleone deeper than any of the other films. It's debatable whether or not Al Pacino's performance here is stronger here than in Part II  it's clear that he's more experienced and mature an actor than he was in 1974, though he may have lost just a bit of his edge. But while in Part II we saw Michael as a decent man gradually turning into a monster, all the while focusing on his life in comparison with his father, Part III delves more deeply into his soul; the influences of Shakespeare and Sophocles are stronger than ever before, as Michael turns into a tragic hero in the classic Greek sense of the words, a man with, ultimately, good intentions, brought down to his tragic end by fate and by his own flaws. Michael is more human and more pitiable in Part III than ever before, and Pacino is certainly up to the task. Comparisons to Vito are certainly there (watch Michael talk some sense into Vincent, just like Vito did to Sonny in the first film) but they're no longer the focus of the film; this film is about Michael, and so Pacino's performance here is more impressive than in the first two parts.The rest of the cast is fantastic (although there aren't any actors in the caliber of Brando, De Niro, Caan or Duvall  who was supposed to be in the film but backed out), but other than Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, who reprise their roles from the previous films excellently, the real revelation here is Andy Garcia, who plays Vincent, illegitimate son of Michael's eldest brother Sonny, and friend-of-the-family Lucy Mancini (the affair between Lucy and Sonny is referred to very briefly in the first film, although it plays a large and important part in the original novel). The role of Vincent Corleone is certainly the strongest in Garcia's career, and his only Oscar-nominated one; Vincent is wonderfully reminiscent of his father (played by James Caan in the first film), and he plays an important part of shedding light on the character of Michael Corleone, while never quite stealing the show from Pacino, clearly the center of the story. Also commendable are performances by George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda and Eli Wallach.There has been much debate about Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael's daughter Mary, so here's my angle on it: it's quite bad indeed, and Sofia proves beyond doubt that she's not an actress. With a lesser cast around her, it wouldn't seem as bad, but next to actors like Pacino, Garcia and Keaton, Coppola seems totally out of place. However, it does little to hurt the film; Mary's part in the film is quite big, but she's mainly there to shed light on Michael and Vincent, and Sofia's less than mediocre performance is ignorable. Thankfully, she quit acting afterwords, and moved on to directing, a field in which she shows much more promise; in fact, the young Miss Coppola shows signs of being one of the most promising young directors of the new millennium.The Godfather, Part III is a fascinating and thrilling tale, and the last forty five minutes are as gripping as any scene in the first two films; Coppola's directing is as inspired and sensitive as it ever was before, and the dialog is all spotless, believable and captivating. The reference to the death of Pope John Paul I, who died only 33 days after being indicted and whose death remains something of a mystery, is a nice touch, which helps create the sense of realism that was an important aspect of the first two films. It's not as timeless a masterpiece as The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II, but if you loved the first two films, you should by all means watch this third installment, too.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not as great as the first two, yet still a profound movie.","The Gofather series is of course arguably one of the most influential and captivating works of contemporary art. The first two in the series hardly need to be spoken for with regard to their magnificence. The third one however, I feel, needs someone to stand up for it. It is the younger brother who only played college ball while its brother played professional, for lack of a better analogy.The Godfather part 3, at first glance, is just a poor sequel which was meant to appease hardcore fans, make money, and start off some careers. Yet, if you really look at the 'summary' of all the Godfather conflicts that were put into this movie, you will see that it is just as artistic as the first two.Michael is a hero. A hero whose life ends in tragedy. His fatal flaw is the ability to understand the nature of good versus evil. To elaborate on that further, Michael understands that he must sacrifice his peace and plans for the future to save his family. This of course will take sacrifice, what he fails to understand is, that good conquering evil will always come with a price, and that sometimes it is hard to distinguish the two. That will seal his doom.Michael cannot differentiate between what is right and what is wrong while he doing the right thing. Telling God that he will sin no more if he is let out of the business, then handing the wheel over to a man who he knows will commit great acts of violence, is, I'm afraid to say, committing a sin. He also fails to realize that killing your brother who was just stupid, is probably not gonna look good on God's account. Many other instances of synonymous circumstances occur throughout the movies and I doubt I have to elaborate for anyone who has seen them.Michael fails to see, that after many of his loved ones death, he still did his job well, he saved his family, but doomed himself for not listening. And it is understood in the end that he dies alone, hating God, hating life, hating all that he did for he thinks he failed.All in all, the Godfather 3 is actually a damn good movie, which sums up all of the points the first two did not make emphatically clear.

Underrated,"I agree with the sentiment expressed by others that ""The Godfather III"" is an underrated film. I suggest that the primary reason for its having been underrated was Francis Ford Coppola's unfortunate decision to cast his then 19-year-old daughter, Sophia, in the pivotal role of Mary Corleone. Sophia Coppola had neither the charisma nor the acting chops for such a role, which made her scenes painful to watch. Nevertheless, the movie was outstanding in most other respects, I believe.The closing scenes are mostly cuts between an opera and a series of assassinations. This was a good choice, because the story, written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is highly operatic  and it works. Although ""The Godfather III"" is certainly not in a class with the first two films of the Godfather Trilogy, which were two of the best films ever made, it is still a fine movie.The film was made at an early enough stage in Al Pacino's career that he did not consistently overact as he has done to his detriment in too many roles since. There is nobody better than Pacino when he exercises restraint, as he did here in his portrayal of Michael Corleone. The other members of the large cast, other than Sophia Coppola, were uniformly effective, too, particularly Diane Keaton, as Michael's long suffering ex-wife and the mother of his children.""The Godfather III"" is a worthy concluding entry in the Godfather Trilogy. Highly recommended, 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unnecessary chapter to a fine franchise,"THE GODFATHER, PART III (1990) ***1/2 Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Andy Garcia, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, George Hamilton, Sofia Coppola, John Savage, Richard Bright, Don Novello, Al Martino. In my view an unnecessary third chapter to what was a brilliant one-two punch, but never-the-less an interesting take on the familia Corleone with a faded Michael (Pacino {""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""} a decidedly Shakespearean turn on his iconic role) facing retribution, redemption and ultimately tragedy the likes the Greeks have never seen as he wheels and deals by trying to by salvation with The Vatican (!) Garcia (Best Supporting Actor nominee) breathes life into the series as the bastard son of Sonny Corleone, Vincent Mancini whose bloodthirst for family acceptance is the film's shining star. However there are indeed vital flaws, including perpetual sun-tan/skin cancer candidate Hamilton filling in for consigliere Tom Hayden(!) {incidently Robert Duvall wanted more dough; can't blame him} and what the hell is Novello, aka Father Guido Sarducci (!) doing in this film!! But two words best sums up the harsh reality : Sofia Coppola!!! Arguably the worst acting ever in recent history. {The sad fact is Winona Ryder was originally tapped but had to begrudgingly drop out when she passed out during a rehearsal from exhaustion and ordered by her doctor to rest} Best sequence: the homage to the first chapter's baptism of fire with similar results during the opera/Vatican killings at the film's climax (ok I admit I was glad Sofia gets killed off) and without a doubt the worst final scene in any film; Pacino old and alone doing a Benny Hill-ish death!

Good but nothing compared to the other two,"Godfather III had a bunch to live up too and it didnt really deliver that much. Its a good movie but pretty flawed, when the first two were pretty flawless. Godfather III has some good things about it that if the bad hadnt been so noticable I could outweigh the bad with the good.The acting is good with ONE exception. Al Pacino is solid as Don Corleone, but this is his weakest performance in the trilogy. Diane Keaton is passable as Kay. Andy Garcia is excellent. Talia Shire is good. But Soffia Coppola was absolutely awful. Coppola must have been desparate to put her in.Godfather III's strengths are in some of its scenes, which it has two excellent scenes. The Atlantic City Massacre and the Opera Scene, both flawlessly shot. The movie is pretty well shot, though the other two were superiorly directed. Its well written, though the dialogue isnt as memorable in this one. The Sets and Cinematography were fantastic.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Odd Father,"Well this is interesting, I've seen he first GF, (haven't reviewed it yet), haven't seen the 2nd one, and here I am, writing a review for the III. The Godfather Part III of course, continues Don Corleone's adventures as being a Mob boss. But he wants to venture out of crime and into more business ventures. His main focus, and one which threads this movie, is the acquisition of a huge energy company from the controlling hands of the Vatican. Meanwhile, an up and comer, Vinnie wants in on the action, but believes that Violence is the answer, Don however, wants to veer away from it, but soon has no choice when things heat up..This would have been a good movie, if it weren't for some weird casting choices.. OK.. fine, I'll jump on the Sofia Coppola bandwagon.. She looks.. strange. And Andy Garcia looks like he's on speed for half the movie! And Diane Keaton... well, let's not discuss that please.I recall Robert Evans saying that one of the reasons he wouldn't work with Francis Ford Coppola again is that he doesn't know how to edit his films, and when he saw this, he said it was 'pure Francis'. I think I know what he means here, scenes start halfway into conversations, there are awkward cuts, and all sorts of head scratching things going on.BUT! I DID love the ending..

Adding the religious aspect to this installment is a bold and boring element. This day & age, no one cares. And given the low rating for this one, it never has been.

"Do we have a satisfying ending to this trilogy? Or, is this film a total letdown? Check out my review below!","""The Godfather: Part III"" (1990), as most of you know, I love the first two Godfather movies. They are both flawless, and are tied for a spot on my top ten all-time favorite gangster/crime films! So, I had high expectations for this third film. I watched it, and ultimately, it was hit and miss for me. That being said, it's not a total failure, there is both good and bad in this movie. ""The Godfather: Part III"" has a redundant cliched storyline, average to abysmal acting, and surprisingly cheap special effects. One thing I feel I must mention is, that if you haven't seen the first two films, then this story will not make sense and you won't understand anything that's going on. Even if you have seen the first two movies, the storyline feels a little jumbled and confusing at parts. The plot is, Michael Corleone tries to legitimize his criminal empire. Now ordinarily, a simple storyline like this would be better for character development, which there are a few new characters introduced. The problem with such a simple story in this case, is that it tries to throw way too much into the plot. Therefore, it becomes way too complex. At 162 minutes in length, it's the shortest movie of the trilogy. But, it never really takes the time to breathe, there's not enough commercialism, everything is extreme and big all the time! Normally, that would be warranted for a last movie in a franchise. If the story was more focused on, then maybe it would've been a stronger film overall. The first 2/3 of the film is dull and it drags on forever. However, the last 1/3 is where it finally gets good for me. The opening scene is promising, but the middle of the movie is where it's convoluted and over the top. Probably the best example of an over the top element in this film, is where people in a helicopter open fire at one of Michael Corleone's meetings in an attempt to assassinate him. Something like that is completely out of place in a franchise like this. There are other extreme elements littered throughout that detract from the thin plot thread. This is a rare case where the story should've been more complex, especially due to the runtime! If you can stomach the first 2/3 of it, then you may find yourself enjoying it. Like I said, the last 1/3 and ending are very strong. If only the rest of the movie was as good as that, then we would've had a perfect trilogy! As for the acting, most of it is good overall. But, there are a few that are either too dull, too extreme, or just plain horrible with their performances! The worst acting in this film, by far, is from Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone. Here's a fun fact for you all, Sofia Coppola is director Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. Francis Ford Coppola had a habit of putting her in his films, playing cameos or other small roles. But this time, she was given a major starring role here. Her performance is terrible! She's way too plain, too simple and just boring to watch. Seriously, it's like she's not even trying! How did Francis Ford Coppola not notice that? He's a phenomenal director! Why did he let her bad acting slide? Yes, I know that she's his daughter. But, if you're gonna act in a Godfather movie, you better give it your best! She may not be a good actress, but, she's a great director. That's right, she has directed other films and she's done other work off-camera. For those who may not know, Winona Ryder was set to play the role of Mary. But, she was committed to a different project, so she had to turn it down. I wonder if she would've made the film any better? Winona Ryder is a decent actress, maybe she could've added some redemption. But, we'll never know. As for the rest of the cast, their just plain to over the top. Even Al Pacino goes a bit crazy at times! Now, that doesn't mean it's a bad performance, it just doesn't look right for the character of Michael Corleone. Overall, the acting is just hit and miss. As for the special effects, most of them are very well-done. However, there are some that look either too cheap or cheesy. Plus, there's a scene where the editing is choppy, the scene where Michael Corleone has a heart attack. There's a sharp cut to where he and his family are suddenly on the other side of the kitchen in the next frame. Editing in movies should not be noticeable. If you notice the edits, then you know there's a problem. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this film. Shall we? The only good things are the sets/locations and the soundtrack. All of the sets/locations are stunning and give this movie a beautiful atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Carmine Coppola is fantastic and his film score sets the tone. Unfortunately, there are times where the music is trying harder than everything else in certain scenes! ""The Godfather: Part III"" is overall just a disappointment. It's a shame, because I was looking forward to enjoying this movie! But, the bottom line is, it's not all bad. Sadly, the bad outweighs the good here. I'm giving this film 3 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 6 out of 10 IMDB stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""The Godfather: Part III"" is a marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, a bad movie. It's sad, because the first two movies are such impeccable masterpieces! That being said, this film had some big shoes to fill. Unless you're a fan of ""The Godfather"" trilogy, I recommend skipping this movie, especially if you haven't seen the first two films. You'll just wind up being disappointed!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Trash Inferno: Godawful Father III,"Unleashes an unapologetic assault on the senses, a visual and auditory cacophony that rivals a collision between a symphony orchestra and a freight train. It's as if the filmmakers embarked on a daring quest to shatter every rule of storytelling, acting, and coherence known to humanity, leaving the audience in a bewildered stupor.Sofia Coppola's performance is a remarkable feat of anti-acting, a virtuoso display of vacant stares and emotionless intonations. Her presence on screen feels like an avant-garde experiment in sleep-inducing techniques, a hypnotic trance inducing a stupor that even the most potent of energy drinks couldn't shake off. If charisma were a flame, Sofia's performance could put out a forest fire.The plot, intricate as a labyrinth built by a mad architect, twists and turns with the grace of a drunken acrobat. It's almost as if the screenwriters invented a new form of storytelling called ""narrative contortionism,"" where logic and coherence are discarded like yesterday's leftovers. Audiences are left grappling with the sensation of being trapped in a waking dream, desperately attempting to make sense of the senseless.Dialogues, oh the dialogues, are a linguistic marvel, a symphony of nonsensical phrases and melodramatic declarations that could only be the result of a collaboration between a thesaurus and a malfunctioning AI. Each line is a masterpiece of absurdity, leaving the audience torn between laughter and tears, wondering if they've accidentally stumbled into a parallel dimension of ineptitude.And then there's the acting, a display of lifelessness that would make a zombie cringe in embarrassment. The cast's performances are reminiscent of a troupe of amnesiacs attempting to reenact a Shakespearean tragedy after a night of heavy sedation. Emotions are conveyed with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving audiences yearning for a moment of genuine human connection, or at the very least, a cup of strong coffee.In a daring departure from cinematic norms, ""Trash Inferno: Godawful Father III"" proudly flaunts its disregard for the audience's time and sanity. It's a triumph of audacity, a cinematic monument to the art of making a mockery out of art itself. If watching this film were an Olympic sport, one can only imagine the medals awarded for enduring such a feat.In conclusion, ""Trash Inferno: Godawful Father III"" is a tour de force in the realm of cinematic disaster. It's an avant-garde masterpiece of ineptitude, a symphony of absurdity that could only be concocted in the deepest recesses of a fever dream. To watch this film is to embark on a journey through the labyrinth of human folly, a descent into the abyss of artistic aberration. Viewer discretion is advised, for only the most intrepid souls dare to venture into this realm of cinematic chaos.Rating: 1Critique:
""Trash Inferno: Godawful Father III"" is a true testament to the boundless depths of human imagination when it comes to creating a colossal failure. It's as if the filmmakers huddled together and collectively decided to challenge every preconceived notion of cinematic storytelling, resulting in a bewildering display of ineptitude. Sofia Coppola's performance, if one can call it that, is a remarkable exercise in anti-charisma, a veritable black hole of emotion that sucks the life out of every scene. It's as if she's auditioning for a role as a sentient mannequin. Francis Ford Coppola, once a cinematic maestro, seems to have undergone a dramatic transformation into a purveyor of creative catastrophe. The plot, if one can discern it amidst the chaos, resembles a labyrinth constructed by a deranged architect, a convoluted mess that leaves viewers questioning their own sanity. Dialogues oscillate between the cringeworthy and the incomprehensible, as if a thesaurus spontaneously combusted and scattered its pages across the script. The acting, a masterclass in lifelessness, rivals the excitement of watching paint dry. Paramount, in an astonishing display of audacity, seems to have taken a vacation from all notions of artistic integrity, opting to exploit the Godfather legacy for a quick monetary fix. In a world teeming with cinematic disasters, ""Trash Inferno: Godawful Father III"" emerges as a phoenix of absurdity, a monument to the baffling potential of human folly. It's a film that not only defies convention but gleefully tramples over it in a mad dance of creative chaos. In the realm of bad cinema, this film reigns supreme, a true testament to the limitless depths of cinematic catastrophe.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Easier to follow than the first two, but has a few flaws","I finally saw this the other day, and I did find it much easier to follow than the first two, but one problem with this movie was Coppola's choice to put his daughter(Sofia Coppola) in the film, she's not bad looking, but she had hardly any prior acting experience, and her bad acting took away from the films quality.

Flawed but compelling epilogue,"Let's get this straight: The Godfather: Part III is not as good as the first two outings, and wasn't really necessary. But then again, neither was Terminator 3, which can't match James Cameron's original cyborg opuses, yet people think it's a good film if considered necessary to know how the whole story ends. It's the same for the third Godfather chapter. On its own, apart from one flaw, it could be a great picture, but compared to its much superior predecessors, it's just an interesting conclusion of the epic Corleone saga.Many years have passed since Part II, and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is getting tired: he decides to hand over the business to his nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), put an end to all illegal activities he's had a hand in, and seek reconciliation with his wife (Diane Keaton), who still fears him for what the mafioso patriarch did to his own brother. In fact, Fredo's death, shown in flashback at the beginning of the film, is probably the main reason Michael wants to retire: he has realized what a terrible man absolute power has turned him into, and he doesn't that to happen to his children. Unfortunately, though, he still has enemies, and they're going to strike pretty hard, maybe through Vincent, who has inherited his dad's quick temper (remember Sonny Corleone?), or Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), whose friendship with the new boss is blossoming into a passionate, and incestuous, love affair...While the first two Godfathers dealt with power and its effects on people, Part III's main theme is redemption, which is desperately sought for by the aging Michael, a man so repulsed by his own crimes he even confesses his evil deeds to a priest. Al Pacino still makes a believable Corleone, although I have to say I preferred the determined, ambitious, ruthless Michael from the '70s. Nevertheless, his performance is respectable, a thing I can't say of Sofia Coppola. With all due respect, she's an excellent writer and director (Lost in Translation is one of my favorite movies), but her acting is very bad, and you notice it even more when she shares the screen with the show-stealing Garcia, who's having the time of his life as the Don's nephew. He's terrific, but his performance alone can't fill the huge charisma hole left open by Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and James Caan. Still, he and Pacino make the third chapter of Francis Ford Coppola's Mafia epic worth a look.So, ultimately, I must say I've seen better franchise conclusions, but I've also seen much, much worse.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't listen to those nonsense critics.,"This is a very good continuation of god father 2. It shows how a crime family don ages and become physically weaker, regret his past, try to bring his family back and try to be close to his children. You know everything can be achieved by power but not the love. You have to gain it. Michael Corleone is one of the victim of this. He abandoned his wife only for the power and even murdered his brother for his own safety though it was not necessary as Fredo was just like a kid and his immaturity was the reason for the hatred of Michael. We've seen he apologized in God father 2 to Michael and he was really unaware of what he did to kill Michael and it was just a complete set up where Fredo was just a victim. In god father part 3, finally aging Michael has already figured that he was wrong and did a terrible sin by killing Fredo. Not only fredo he also did so much crime in previous GoD Fathers that at the last stage of his life he is actually trying to be just a little bit better and this is the main Theme of God Father 3. One thing to mention, God father is a religious term and Michael Corleone was a god father of his sister's child. So it can be easily said that he was a religious person and every religious man atleast once in his life will try to make all his sins forgive and Michael Corleone is just the perfect character to show this in drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Godfather III: The Culmination of an Epic Tragedy,"The epic saga of the Corleone family, immortalized by Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic brilliance, reaches its pinnacle in ""The Godfather III."" In this third and thrilling installment, Coppola once again demonstrates his mastery by transcending the boundaries of the gangster genre, delving into the depths of the human soul and the intricacies of power and redemption.The narrative takes us two decades after the events of the previous films, where we witness Michael Corleone at an advanced stage of his life. Masterfully portrayed by Al Pacino, we see a Michael seeking social respectability and spiritual redemption. His graying hair and weary eyes reflect a journey of internal and external struggles. The bestowal of the Order of Saint Sebastian by the Vatican seems to be a milestone of recognition and acceptance for Michael, whose investments are now legal, but his soul remains haunted by ghosts of the past.Family dynamics have also evolved significantly. His sister Connie, once a submissive figure, emerges as a powerful influence within the family, challenging established traditions. Meanwhile, his son Anthony seeks to pursue his own dreams, distant from his father's expectations, and Kay, his ex-wife, finds her voice and independence in a mature and complex relationship.However, it is with the introduction of new characters, such as the ambitious Joey Zasa and the explosive Vincent Mancini, that the plot intensifies. Vincent, Sonny's illegitimate son, emerges as a central figure, oscillating between family tradition and his own desires for power and revenge. His relationship with Mary, his cousin, adds an additional layer of tension and conflict to the narrative.Coppola skillfully weaves a narrative rich in symbolism and tragedy, guiding the viewer through a journey of redemption and expiation. The meticulous construction of each scene, from the condecorating ceremony to the breathtaking climax at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, is a testament to the director's mastery of his craft. The fusion of opera and cinema, permeated by intense emotions and muted violence, elevates the cinematic experience to new heights.In the end, ""The Godfather III"" is not just a film about gangsters and power, but a meditation on the nature of family, forgiveness, and the search for redemption. It is a masterpiece that resonates beyond the screens, leaving an indelible mark on the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Lightning hardly strikes thrice.,"To be frank and obvious, The Godfather Part III fails on many levels so that it cannot hold a candle to the first two. And should we really have expected it to be as good as Part I and II? The reason it was even made was because Coppola was strapped for money and felt he could give closure to this epic saga. More on that later, but first to focus on what went wrong in this continuation of the Corleone crime family.In this third story, Michael has aged considerably over the years and is now starting to decline not only in health but in his mindset of how to run the family. Mob activities are becoming more and more violent, something he is not necessarily ready for. He becomes involved with Vincent (Andy Garcia) who is the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny from the first film. He has inherited his father's temper and ambition and hopes to help the Corleone family take on Joey Zusa (Joe Mantegna), a mob boss now running their New York business. Michael also gets involved in the Vatican and their running if large sums of money. This plot thread I thought was fairly ridiculous and uninteresting. Of course, the best things of the story are the family arcs and the relationships between these people.For the positive, the acting is good but not on par with what it was before. Al Pacino and Diane Keaton are both wonderful as Michael and Kay, two people with a lot of history but much to connect with each other. I do wish we could have seen more of the history of them and Michael explaining his actions in Sicily from the first film. Garcia is quite strong as is Talia Shire and Eli Wallach but Sofia Coppola brings everything to a halt with her very wooden and stiff performance of Mary, Michael's daughter. She speaks in one tone, has little chemistry with Garcia and has a weird contortion with her mouth that is distracting. Is it the worst thing of this movie? No, that would be the screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo, who seem to go out of their way to avoid doing what they did in the first two films. Those focused much on the family and the internal conflicts within. This part has a global span, going from Rome to New York to Sicily; it all seems too much for one movie.The burning question is: was this a necessary production? I think it was, for now we know there never will nor can there ever be a fourth film as well as the closure we do receive on these people. The best part of the film is the family itself and we continue to see development in many of the characters, especially Michael and his sister Connie. For me, Connie's arc was the best of this film as we watch this beautiful woman, who got married in the first film, seem to lose her way. She is conflicted with the fact that she loves her family but is appalled by the violence associated with them. What happens to her in this movie is shocking but also understandable as it was with Michael's transformation. That, of course, is the main theme of this saga. Pacino seems to ham it up a little here but is still very effective in his role as a man filled with demons of his past and trying to do anything he can to exorcise them.Why does this fail? Probably because we expected too much of Coppola. He hardly expected the first film to be so widely revered as it is, let alone the second film. Could he have known people wanted that same quality for this one. I am glad I saw it for now the story is complete to one of the greatest cinematic achievements.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Trilogy of the 20th Century,"From Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather Part III was what declared the couple into a trilogy. This time, the story is even more intense and dramatic than the other two movies.A dying Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) decides that he is tired of business and wants to spend the rest of his remaining days at his fathers home in Italy. So he and his family move from New York to Italy while Michael hands the business over to his nephew (Andy Garcia).Produced by Mario Puzo (Superman), and directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Jack, The Outsiders). The Godfather Part III marks the end of a great era of filmmaking and movies.Starring:  Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Diane Keaton, Sofia Coppola, Eli Wallache, Talia Shire, George Dzunda.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's not that bad,"Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I had been warned. I have to admit, in comparison to the first two, the film's reputation is not without any merit; but those are two of the greatest films ever made, and 99% of films are going to look terrible if you compare them to parts I and II. But as its own film? It's actually pretty good. Quite a bit of what was so great about the first two installments is still there but toned down, and there are a lot of new problems I and II didn't have, so like I said it's definitely a downgrade from its predecessors but it's still a good film in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

complete replica of the first,"When people say that the first Godfather movie is the best overall, concerning the trilogy, I have to argue the fact that even though it was the first, the unorigionality which has transcened into the final part is just a relaying of Godfafther Part One, which leads me to the conclusion on the basis of pure foundation and and self-defining that Godfather part two was the finest of the trilogy, individually, of course.Clearly in the third and final part of the corleone story it is visible in some parts that, the third invisages aspects of the first. Coppola's transparency and inability to do anything origional with the conclusion, even with his relunctance to do a third, was clearly visible.For example some uncanny comparsions between 1and3, is the basic parallels which they have, such as there's a party at the start, (the wedding, part 1, the church's recog. of michael, part 3), michael is a mirror image of his father, vito, in terms of morals etc, michael like his dad, is hospitalised, by the consquences of his buisness, there, like barzini, is a young, celebrity gangster, Joey Sasa is backed by a close friend and business partner of michael, and similar to part 1, an assanation plot is carried out.

Definitely not as good as Godfather 1 and 2 but still a great mafia film and a great conclusion,"Rated R for Violence and Language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AThe Godfather and The Godfather Part II are the two greatest mafia epics ever! Both had great acting, a great storyline, great characters, an all star cast and were just overall great movies.Sixteen years after Godfather 2, Godfather 3 was released.This one was not as well received as the first two but was still nominated for Best Picture of 1990 academy awards.However Goodfellas came out that same year and it was much much better than Godfather 3.Both films lost to Dances With Wolves.I have not seen that film.Godfather III isn't as good as the first two because it is not as interesting and the acting of Sofia Coppola is not very good.However Al Pacino as usual steals the show.He is in fact an excellent actor.Most of the cast of the first two godfather films are in this such as Al Pacino,Diane Keaton,Talia Shire etc.However there are some new actors in the third film such as Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda.Also the first two films took place in the 40's and 50's(well half of Godfather 2 took place in the 10's and 20's).This film takes place in 1979-1980.Michael Corleone is now older and is still running his mafia family.His son does not want to work for him so he takes Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent under his wing.While Godfather 3 wasn't as good as the first two, it had an excellent ending!

A film I could not refuse!,"Once again I seem to be the controversial one. I actually think that this film works better for me than 'The Godfather II'. It is certainly Pacino's best performance of the three. I thought he was superb and he was supported by a great cast as well. Eli Wallach is an absolute legend, who could suspect that sweet lil' ol' fella of anything? And Andy Garcia, not only looking incredibly hot in that suit, but also giving us a fantastic Vinnie.The film may take place 20 years after the second and be filmed 16 years later, but it still has the same values and film making qualities of the first two. It's all done very carefully and considered, even though it is probably still at least half an hour too long. It definitely has some slow bits.I think that this one appeals to me because you get to see Michael (Pacino) finally turning things around and going legitimate as he had always hoped to be. It's the bad guy comes good story that the world hopes for and needs to be true. Let more bad guys come good and make a difference on this planet of ours. Let's start with the politicians and the churches (I'm on my soap box again).The one distraction for me was that Joey Zasa was played by Joe Mantegna, who I am afraid is firmly fixed in my head as 'Fat Tony' from 'The Simpsons'. It's hard to distinguish him from that character when his voice is so unchanged. I kept expecting to find out that he was selling rat milk to schools.It was also a shame that they the end came so quickly and that there was no real overall conclusion. I'm not in to the gun fighting that much, but a massive shoot out that ends with everyone dead might have worked better for me?It's definitely a good saga and I would be glad to watch it again in the future, but I won't be adding it to my ""Must Have"" DVD collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"WHY Coppola, WHY???","This movie is one of the most underrated movies in IMDB I think, everything in this movie is high class, directing, acting, scenario, music and ... .
Al Pacino acting is masterpiece again in this role, music is phenomenal, Andy Garcia is like a new born star, even scenario is more fascinated than two previous Godfathers and Coppola's directing is the best again. Last episode of the movie in the theater was very well directed and breathtaking, and the whole story has a great meaning.
Any way I think there are some weaknesses about this movie that I should say (because of these its 9):
1. Although Pacino, Garcia and Keaton very well played in this movie, but other actors and actresses weren't good enough for this great movie, specially the Pope and Mary (Sofia Coppola) , I have to say Sofia Coppola ruined the character of Mary and I think if his father wasn't the director of the movie she never ever had any chance to get this job, her acting is the blind spot of the movie,
WHY Coppola, WHY???
2. Some point of the movie you understand that some characters didn't well defined and its a little hazy, I think it was better that director take more time to define some of the characters.
Totally I have to say this movie is a masterpiece and enjoyable but many people in IMDB because of comparing this one to two others rated it very bad such as 1 from 10, are you kidding me? If you don't like it as those 2 previous versions you have to rated 1? I think its very unfair.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not a masterpiece as the other two were, but an effective end to the saga","This movie is, the consensus seems to be, great as movies go, but not quite up to par of Part I and Part II.  I should have to agree. Sofia Coppola really truly should not have gotten the part as Mary.  The only positive thing I can say about her is that she has nice hair, which is not much, is it?  Andy Garcia, well, he was not bad but could have been much better.  There are a couple of moments when he seems to have forgotten his lines.  Is this Coppola's fault for letting us see it? And is he (Garcia) really strong enough to continue the Corleone empire?  The movie doesn't quite let you make your mind up.  Pacino is, as always, faultless, this time as the ageing Michael.  Talia Shire is better in this movie than she was in the other two, though maybe this is because she is more involved in the actual plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fitting end to a brilliant trilogy,"Al Pacino is magnificent in the final instalment of this epic trilogy. The film continues the story of The Corleone family and Michael's desire to legitimise their business. The character development is excellent and draws you in, keeps you wanting to see more. Michael is tormented by his past but driven for the future he desires for his children. Will he succeed? Or will the criminal ties he seeks to sever prove too difficult to cut?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Some flaws but better than most,"First off, I should probably say what I thought of Sofia.  She's not a very good actress but she fit.  Had she been a sophisticated character it wouldn't have worked.  But she wasn't and she did pretty good under the cirumstances - could you have imagined Julia Roberts (another choice)?  Be thankful for Sofia and leave her alone - she's getting enough crticism.Now for the movie.  Al Pacino turns in another great performance in phase three of a familiar character and the most rounded in cinema history.  I won't dwell because at this point in his career it's assumed that he'll be good. Instead, there are two people who were a pleasant surprise.The first is Diane Keaton.  Let's face it.  Her roles in the first two were not exactly a great step for women's lib which was bad because she was the strongest female character in those movies.  The third time around she is independent from the family and acts instead of reacting.  The best scenes in the movie are those between her and Pacino because they're both sweet and sad.  They show the Kay and Michael we saw at the beginning of the first movie plus a lifetime in between.  They are now closer than they've been since Michael's dad was shot.The second surprise should be obvious.  Andy Garcia - he even LOOKS like Pacino.  His character is both charming and dangerous and that combination is the kind that audiences adore.  And he is absolutely perfect.So, I liked the movie maybe even more than the other two because the relationship between Kay and Michael which I always thought was the center of the movie.  The first movie was the beginning of their deterioration, the second completely ended their marriage, and the third was a reconciliation. I have the feeling however, that I was the only one who saw the movie that way.",,Anonymous,Crime
Spectacular,"When I read the reviews of this movie I ignored to watch it, but I had an urge to know what happen to the Corleone family.

This is better than The Godfather Part II ( honestly). And Al Pacino as always did a stainless performance. I appreciate the whole series but found part 2 over slow. Never judge a movie by it's poster & critics. The plot of the movie is intelligent and surprisingly epic. And climax is unpredictable!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
good movie,"God Father III had a lot different style then the first two. Probably because it was set twenty years later. I really loved the insight and thought put into it. There was a lot more music and a softer dialog. I think what made the movie was Michael getting older he actually looked more like a mobster. He was more reasonable in this move then the last two, he seemed wiser. He was looking for redemption in his life. I'm not sure if Andy Garcia was a good replacement to take over. I think he fit in well though. The daughter wasn't a very good actress. She didn't seem like she fit in this move. All in all I think it was a really good ending to an awesome trilogy. The music was awesome. I especially liked Brucia La Terra. I recommend this move to anyone but you have to see the I and II first. Michael dressed incredible in this part.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better with Each Viewing,"I remember seeing THE GODFATHER III a couple of months after it was released on VHS and being completely mesmerized by it. I actually had my reserveations, thinking what many of us here though at the time:""How can Coppola TOP the previous installments?"" He did not top them, but he certainly was VERY close. Several years passed and I bought the DVD trilogy, but before I could get to watch GODFATHER III, some local TV channel aired it, and I couldn't help but watching it, albeit, not totally focused and incomplete. Somehow, the movie didn't grasp me this time around. A couple of days later I decided to watch it with my wife, on DVD and give it another chance. How wrong was I! The magic that unfolded when I first saw it came back like a hammer blow. I remembered something that I already knew: You have to watch these films with total attention to fully appreciate them. The lack of continuous action packed scenes may discourage some people, but then again, when the action scenes appear, they are over the top. THE GODFATHER III is set some 16 years after the ending of GODFATHER II. Michael Corleone is still trying to make his empire, ""Legit"" and his desire to shed the blood of his enemies has greatly diminished. We get to see most of the original cast, although Tom hagan's character (played wonderfully in the first movies by Robert Duvall) is sadly absent. It's never mentioned, but it appears that he died during the 70's. Michaels two children are now young adults. Andy Garcia is introduced as Sonny Corleone's bastard son, Vincent Mancini. His performance has yet to be outdone by himself! He is simply superb as the future heir to the Corleone Empire. Michael, in his attempt to go legit, strikes a deal with ""immobiliare"", the Vatican Bank. This deal will make the Corleones as respectable as the Rockefellers. As Michael tries to get this deal done, he faces new enemies who don't want him to run ""immobiliare"". The circumstances force Michael to adopt his old ""Mafia Warfare"" tactics, although he does it hesitantly. THE GODFATHER III is just as complex and richly textured as the other two movies...even the film quality has that ""grainy"" aspect that makes you think it was really filmed fight after last picture. Al Pacino's performance is more subdued in this one, but that's because his character is an Old Mafioso looking to redeem himself. The anger and fury of young Michael is present in Vincent (Andy Garcia). The ending is tragic and while it not may please everyone (it leaves many lose ends in the air)it's decent finale to what's possibly the most highly revered film trilogy in history.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I haven't cried like this since I paid to see Godfather III,"Of Course this movie isn't such bad as everyone wants to say, but that is only if there weren't the Prequels.Especially the first part is as excellent as only a few movies will ever get. In the second part it is everything a little too much, except the flashbacks with the young Vito Corleone (Great Appearance from the young de Niro, in my Opinion this the Quality like the first part. Pacino isn't that good even in the second part and now in the third part he performs his ritual (like in every ""new"" movie, not that bad in Insomnia and Any Given Sunday but still not really a change in it). I liked Garcia, but still this is far away from a Masterpiece. Especially if you think about Goodfellas which was the movie Godfather III had to be compared with.

A solid film,"I think the script for the film is good. I think Coppola's daughter did a good job. I think Diane Keaton was a lot better in her role this time around than she was in the first two films. Eli Wallach was a great casting choice. He has great charisma and can play a creepy conniving villain that still comes across as likable. For me, the biggest problem was the way Pacino played his role, as well as the way his role was written. It is hard for the audience to fill in t he blanks and figure out how the guy who sat in his living room smoking a cigarette while his brother was being executed became this harmless puppy who acted more as if he's never seen the world of the mafia and wanted to stay out of it than someone who'd spent his entire life in that world and wanted out. That is the main problem. Also, Garcia is over the top in his role, and really should have toned his performance down a bit. I am not sure he understood what kind of movie he was in. Still, it is a good film and I am surprised about all the negative criticisms. Maybe it's because people expected a grand finale to overshadow the first two films, or at least be as memorable, and the film turned out to be weakest in the trilogy. However, even as the arguably weakest entry, it is a good film, period.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Works Better Than It Should,"Godfather II and I are number I and II on my all-time movie list respectively. There are timeless, awesome, skillful films worthy of their Oscars and accolades. GIII does not make my top 25.That's not to say it is a bad film. It is quite good. But take away these rich, wonderful characters and links to the previous classics and you have a long and confusing film.The plot is well known - patriarch Michael Corleone's attempts to buy his way out of the criminal empire he built and ruthlessly ruled, thwarted by his enemies and his bloodthirsty, power-hungry nephew Vincent(brilliantly played by Andy Garcia), who is poised to take command of the family business. There is also the strong theme of Michael's guilt for his past offenses, most notably the murder of his brother.It is a sad a grim tale, with what I thought was a very satisfying ending. Without spoiling, lets just ask this question - does a life long criminal and murderer deserve any better?The movie's best scene takes place when Michael sees the wise and powerful Cardinal Lamberto and receives a reluctant absolution of his sins. I love this scene because the Cardinal understands him so well, and knows that he can be more than he is, but won't.The movie has a flaw which comes very close to ruining it completely - and that is of course the infamous casting of Soffia Coppola in the pivotal role of Michael's daughter, Mary. A great deal of this plot revolves around the passionate, dangerous love of Vincent and Mary and it simply does not work. She lumbers around on the screen like an amateur and destroys every scene she has. I never bought in for a second that Vicent cared at all about her as anything more than a trick.All that said, Diane Keaton, Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna all offer wonderful supporting roles. Talia Shire shines again as Connie. The script is great and the theme of the trilogy is very clear - don't take sides against the family. I value this film a great deal primarily because it does a great job of winding up the story of Michael. Do not see this first, see the three in order.***1/2 out of ****.",,Anonymous,Crime
The « Coda » version is MUCH better.,"I have just finished watching the « Coda » version on Netflix, and all I can say is that it is REALLY better than the original theatrical release and transforms the film from maybe a 5 out of 10 to an 8.Most of the theatrical version's discontinuity is fixed, the gaps are remedied and the film finally MAKES SENSE. Coppola is even wise enough to cut out some of the amateurish acting of his daughter (who can hardly be blamed for having to take on the role at the last minute).It's not masterpiece level like the first two films but it's a solid achievement and deserves a second chance by the critics.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Disappointed by this one,"I watched all three movies consecutively, having read no reviews and with no bias. The third part left me with a rather bitter taste. The movie's supposed intention is to dig into Michael's character, giving him the chance to develop a more human profile, with feelings of love and remorse, seeking for redemption, as fitted to a tragedy coming to an end. However, it doesn't succeed to do so. There is a lack of that incredible energy, dynamic and attention to detail the previous movies had. This might be intended to some point in the case of Michael, who has become old and exhausted, but it didn't feel like watching Michael Corleone at all. He's a completely different person, with no explanation. Even the young characters lack the nerve and the vitality they should have. I found the acting to be weak from almost everybody. Andy Garcia kind of ruined the film for me, with that constant half-smile, acting like a ham; such a poor choice, totally downgrading the profile of a don to be. Sofia Coppola is fresh and innocent looking, but not a good choice either, with that blunt, awkward face throughout the movie -her last scene left me speechless, in a very unpleasant way. There is no bond, no spark between any of the characters. The plot is not gripping at all, the dialogues are flat -to say the least- and there are a lot of things that just don't fit, such as Kaye's presence, Connie's attitude, Michael's bodyguards' surprising incapacity. This movie feels like just a task that had to be done with, not an inspiring story somebody wanted to tell, like the previous ones. Overall, it's not an entirely bad film on it's own, but it definitely could have been so much better.

On the other hand, Micheal's nephew and Sonnie's illegitimate child shows interest in the business and Micheal keeps him near himself for the business.The end however leaves a deep imprint on the lives of the subjects and has kept me wondering about the movie for at least 3-4 hours.

"A great movie, and on equal footing with the first two","I'm gonna break cliche of saying only the first and second were 4-star. There's a certain personal feel to this movie that was in the first and second, but even moreso. Maybe it's Sofia Coppola, and her broish manly black-haired nature and her bros, to which their babies like Lucy Boynton and Kirsten and countless others just flock to. She just kills the spotlight. But there's another aspect. Broish Talia Shire and her bros see Grace as their baby. You can see she just holds the movie together and is a voice of reason. When Michael tries to goes on his grudges, she watches everything. You even sense she cares about Grace, so much that that off-screen she's willing to rebuke Andy's character. There's a fuzzy. And the story is beautiful. It shows the aftermath of Michael's actions. But this one truly feels like a Coppola fam movie (exagerrated with violence, and all those things). This feels like a more serious ""Richard Bey"" episode with a ramp up on drama. UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship movie. And I know this movie aired on UPN and on WWOR.A great classic. Everyone really gives it their all. :) I have a movie called ""Connie and Grace"" which is essentially a 4th installment planned. I think it has the makings of a great movie.

The developing of the characters is believable and consistent with the previous prats.There are some things not important but felt bet odd for me like Konnys (Michels sister) reaction to her older brother death and believing he is drown contrary to her reaction to her husband death in the first part and i didn't understand one scene in which the assassin using glasses in the office because he was in a suicidal situation ,I mean how was he suppose to escape .The curt end Michel's death alone and old in his home town could v been done much better .Yet this film has its many strong points especially his dealing with sociological issues for man with power and responsibility feeling the end closing and trying to redeem his self yet the circumstances surround him make him fail with the greater loss of all .",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Decent but not quite up there with the originals,"It's easy to hate on this movie for a number of reasons.

Or the fact that it's supposed to take place in the 70s while it has a early 90s vibe to it... Or the fact that Sofia Coppola can't act AT ALL!The first two movies was practically flawless, couldn't find a single production error in them.. In this one I found countless without even looking.It's hard to look at this 100% objectively without comparing it to it's predecessors.

Part 3 in particular, deserves a much much higher score. it took my breath away.out of all the films i cannot point to one bad performance.I would happily watch them all again. i will watch them all again, and this time pay extra special attention to Pachino, who sneaks up on you again and again and again with his subtly masterful control over Corleone. knock you down, stun gun, head spinning, stupendous drama.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.,"My friends were really divided about the Godfather Part III: no whether it was good or bad, but if I should see it or not. Some said I may as well complete the trilogy, whilst others said it would ruin the first two masterpieces. In the end I decided to watch it to judge for myself after watching The Godfather Part I and Part II again.Set 20 years after the events of The Godfather Part II, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has made moved back to New York and is made a Commander of St. Sebastain by the Catholic Church for his charity work. He has been a legitimate business man, with a few a links to the Mafia. He is suffering guilt from his ruthless raise to power, the murder of brother and the death of his first wife in Silicy. His daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) is still close to him, running the Vito Corleone Foundation for him, whilst his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has turned his back on the family business to focus on a music career. In the middle of a ceremony to celebrate Michael's deels to the church, Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garica) shows his face. He is a low-level hood who is in the middle of conflict with a Mafia Don, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna (Fat Tony from the Simpsons)). Michael offers to show the young hot the ropes of the business. After a devastating hit that wipes out most of the Mafia Dons, a power vacuum happens the world of crime. Michael is forced back into the Mafia because of it. The second plot involves Michael attempting to buy Immobiliare, the real estate sector of the Vactican Bank. The deal is meant to save the Vactican's troubled finances and Michael is encouraged by Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly), the head of the Vactican bank to invest $600 Million in Bonds. But this ends up being a scam by dodgy elements of the Bank and forces Michael into Vactican politics.The Godfather Part III has often been derided by fans for being inferior and insulting to the first two films. But there is a sector who do still like this film. They is a long gap between this film and the preceder, which is never a good sign. It means that a lot of chances are forced appond the film and gaps have to be expanded. It is also normally a sign of cashing in on a popular title. There are problems with characterisation in the film. The first two films are about Michael's moral decline and becoming a ruthless and cunning Mafia boss. But in this film the filmmakers are trying to make him a good guy and forced back into the business. It weakens the message. The rise of Vincent also felt unrealistic and less organic compared to the rise of Vito and Michael. However, I do like that Connie (Talia Shire) as an adviser.The plot itself should have been really interesting, dealings between the Mafia and the Vactican. That in itself could have made a really good thriller/drama, and showing the international nature of both organisations. As well the power vacuum in the Mafia, and forced change could have lead to a good film, particularly more in the context of the first two. But the Godfather Part III seem to be trying to put too much in one film which was shorten, because it also has the added family drama that was key to all three films. As a stand alone film it could have worked, but as a Godfather film, not so much.Acting wise, it was hit and miss. Of course Al Pacino was excellent, Michael Corleone was the role that made him into a star. Andy Garcia is also a good actor, and most of the actors returning were good. The big problem was the casting of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. Sofia has a good look, and lovely long hair, but she was so wooden and weak that it was a struggle for the other actors. Her expression on her face was so distance that it looked like she wasn't really interested. Luckily she moved into directing where she shows her real talent.Francis Ford Coppola does a fine job directing, having some good set-pieces like the hit on the Mafia (even though it could have been simpler). He keeps the tone the same as with the first two films, have the slow burning atmosphere that made the first two films great. But this film did feels a little too slow and distance compared to the first two. Some of the music also did not fit as well as the first two films. However there are good scenes, like the intercutting between the opera and the outside events.Overall, its no where near as good as the first two films and should have been a stand alone film. But it still has entertaining moments. 3 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Definitely Belongs With The Other Coppola Masterpieces,"The third and final film of Coppola's Godfather series ends with a bang. It holds up really strong within the trilogy and I feel currently is underrated. Before seeing this film I thought this film wouldn't hold up as everybody seems to say that The Godfather Part III is horrible or lackluster. I completely disagree as I feel this film is incredibly strong. Yes the film doesn't have that feeling of a period film because it isn't. It's more contemporary and I think it's a great way of seeing these characters in a new era.The point of the film is to show that Michael is trying to become a better person and trying to make his business legitimate leaving the ways of corruption and murder behind. But just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in; I just couldn't resist. The reason the old film felt a bit lackluster for me is that there are too many new characters introduced and those characters aren't as interesting as the ones in this film. The characters in this film do feel new but most are just older versions of themselves from the first film or second film. The main focus, even though there are other things going on like romance and revenge, is Michael looking for redemption as he has regretted everything that he has done. There is a lot of reflecting of the past in this film, like about Fredo or what Vincent and Mary's discussion about their fathers or when Kay and Michael was in Sicily. These moments were enjoyable. In comparison to the second film, I preferred this one as I found it to be more entertaining to follow.Coppola returning for a third film is risky as for years people have seen Michael Corleone as a horrible man. So the decision of restoring his image to the public and family is very risky but I think it paid off as I think it gives the saga a better closing. The film goes back to the strengths of the first one and keeping it linear. Coppola did a great job in concluding the saga and will be regarded, at least by me, as a classic.Gordon Willis did the photography for the Godfather trilogy but since this film is set in a more contemporary era then that style that was found in previous films is now gone. The film is still shot well with moments that are beautiful, in particular Sicily, but this really is more about the characters rather than capturing something unique and daring. The film's photography definitely isn't as strong as the original but it's appropriate to the film's setting and story.Instead of Nino Rota being the composer of the film, it's now Carmine Coppola. Carmine has worked on the first two of the Godfather films but his role was minor. Nino Rota died a few years after the second Godfather film, but his work is still found in this film. I felt that Carmine Coppola did not deliver that same level as Nino Rota did as it was a little underwhelming and never creates a sense of presence but his score does fit well with the film and does his best to fill in Rota's shoes.Acting again like the previous films is top notch. Another brilliant performance from Al Pacino showing off vulnerability that was rarely shown in previous films. Andy Garcia felt like a reminder of James Caan's Sonny but making it his own and adding a more unique personality to it. It was great to see Eli Wallach in films, as the films I have seen him in were always vicious, here he is a little more soft but still retains that viciousness in a subtle way. Keaton and Shire were great in playing stronger women in a time where Michael is vulnerable. Sofia Coppola was not spectacular but she did her part fine, chemistry between her and Garcia wasn't at the level of Pacino and Keaton but passable. Good thing that she chose to be a director rather than an actress.Great ending to the trilogy supported by a strong script, great direction, decent photography and score and fantastic performances. It is definitely along with Coppola's finest work and should not be dismissed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Underrated, yet still lacking the force of its predecessors","I saw this film upon its release, and there was something missing. Throughout the years, I continued to watch The Godfather, Parts I and II relentlessly. Last week I saw the third installment again, and liked it better than before. It would be a masterpiece, if we didn't have to compare it to parts I and II.What I realized is that the force of the original Godfather films came out of their understatement. You can hardly see a moment of excitement in Vito Andolini's face (Marlon Brando in the original Godfather). He plays it chillingly cool, and I think that's the secret ingredient. Al Pacino did the same in the first two parts, but the third installment got out of control somehow, and there is a lot of overacting. It's a pity, because the story is really good, but a tighter direction could have gone a long way further.I still recommend The Godfather, Part III. It does work, with its music, with its emotions, with the final dagger in the evil heart of the beast we have loved for so long, for reasons unknown.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too harsh,"I gave my honest review of this movie, but the weaklings of IMDB thought I was too harsh on Bridget and Sofia. So, I'll back it down a little bit. They are the two worst actresses of all time. And they almost killed the greatest franchise of all time. That's as nice as I can put it.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing that it is not a classic,"For most die hard Godfather fanatics, Pacino could have staged a musical revival of Gilligan's Island and they would have loved it as long as the word ""Godfather"" was in the title.  For me, personally, I rank the first two Godfather movies among my top five all-time.  But any expectation you have that Godfather III will match those lofty hopes are quickly dashed.  The screenplay is so awkward and contrived it seems at times that it is an improv skit set to Italian music.  There are no surprises, no suspense and no single character captures your imagination or attention - it is almost a farce.  Pacino gives a decent reprisal of his most famed role but everyone else is just plain bad including Garcia and, most noticeably, Sofia Coppola. I was so surprised by my disappointment, I went back and watched it again recently in hopes that I would change my opinion.  Nope.  Still bad.  Four out of ten stars.",,Anonymous,Crime
Fully worthy of the Godfather name,"What's the deal with the slagging this film has taken? Ok, so it's not as good as the first one (few films are), but it's a more than worthy wrap-up to the series, teeming with all the elements that make the Godfather saga so engrossing: strong characters, shadowy back-room negotiations, elaborate plotting and double crossing, shocking yet fantastically orchestrated violence and, finally and most memorably, an operatic finale which is a masterpiece of cross-cutting between ritual and acts of murder. If the film sags around the edges, well - that's entirely appropriate too, since Michael Corleone, its lead character, is himself now aging and frail. It is as if each of the Godfather films takes its cue from Michael's metabolism: the first is full of zest and youthful exuberance, the second is cold, hard and opaque, and the third is creaky and totters on the brink of collapse. Many take this as a fault of the film, when really it is the perfect mirror of the soul of Michael himself. As such, the weariness which pervades the entire story is poignant and heartbreaking, not the result of bad filmmaking.The acting is all first rate, as is expected by now in a Godfather film. As Sonny Corleone's bastard son Vincent Mancini, Andy Garcia makes a strong impression and the push-pull between he and Pacino - the young hothead vs. the wisened and calculating veteran - gives the film its edge, and its unique place in the Godfather canon. It is slightly unbelievable that Michael would have no one else to turn over the running of the family to besides Vincent, a tangential relation at best, but since it works dramatically you tend to overlook the flaw in logic. Likewise, the scenes between Michael and Kay carry a special charge; though written near the level of soap opera, the fact that it is actually Pacino and Diane Keaton sitting across from each other, and that we feel we have shared so deeply in their history together, breathes a curious kind of nobility and sadness into them. Like everyone else, I missed Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, but even his absence serves, in an ironic way, to underline the theme of Michael drifting toward the end of his life, losing all his associations along the way; the loneliness and solitariness which enveloped him by the end of the second movie have not gone away, and his attempts to fight against and deny this fact is what gives his character real tragic dimension here.Ok, just a word on Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter Mary. No, she's obviously not a trained actress and her readings are a little flat, but you know what? It doesn't make that much difference. Her character exists more as a symbol to Michael of innocence and incorruptibility than as a true three-dimensional personage. As such, she at least has the right look and feel - I can imagine her as Pacino's daughter in a way I don't think I ever could have bought Winona Ryder (who was originally to play this role). What I'm saying here is that, while she's not great, she does what she needs to do and she in no way sinks the film - if for no other reason than that her screen time isn't large enough to do so. And for those of you who laughed at her in the climactic scene, I can only point out that this is *Pacino's* dramatic moment, not hers; if you can look upon his soul-chilling reaction and still not be moved, then I think there must be something fundamentally dead inside you.All in all, this is a great film, with a plot line that is at times admittedly hard to follow, but not nearly as much as the one in Part II. And this one has a better cast of characters - just think of it, the Corleones getting into business dealings with the Vatican!  The audacity of this storyline alone should make it beloved to all true Godfather fans. And some of the violence here - including the helicopter assault in Atlantic City, the murder of Joey Zasa on the streets of Little Italy, and most notably the new and wildly unexpected use found for a pair of reading glasses - is as brilliant and memorable as anything in the first film, and supersede the second one entirely. In short, Godfather III makes a great wrap up to the entire saga, and earns its full place in the family history; it's no mere footnote, but a great and satisfying film all its own.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece,"The Godfather Part III is the long-awaited conclusion to Francis Ford Coppola's legendary mafia saga. While it does not reach the towering heights of its predecessors, it remains an ambitious and emotionally weighty film that offers a reflective take on power, redemption, and the cost of a life in crime.Al Pacino delivers a compelling performance as an aging Michael Corleone, who is haunted by his past and seeks legitimacy for his empire. The film excels in its exploration of guilt and the inescapable nature of the Corleone family's legacy. The supporting cast, particularly Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, adds depth, though some performances feel uneven.Visually, the film retains the rich cinematography and meticulous direction that define the series. The operatic tone, coupled with a dramatic and tragic climax, reinforces its Shakespearean themes. However, pacing issues and some questionable casting choices prevent it from fully capturing the magic of the first two films.Despite its flaws, The Godfather Part III is a fitting, if imperfect, epilogue to one of cinema's greatest sagas. Fans of the series may find it a rewarding, if bittersweet, farewell to the Corleone dynasty.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Godfather Part 70's,People like to blame the lack of fan acceptance on Sofia Coppola when the true reason is that Francis changed Michael Corleone's hair. Godfather nerds were upset that Pacino was no longer the ruthless Terminator of the previous films but laid the blame solely at the feet of Sofia Coppola whom they accused of being the shallow daughter of a powerful man. Totally missing the point that she is playing the shallow daughter of a powerful man. Her subsequent career as an amazing film director should encourage a re-evaluation of her performance here. Plus we get Eli Wallach which easily makes up for the lack of Robert Duvall.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing addition to the Godfather legacy,"Just saw it again without seeing the first two in years, and it's even worse than I remember. I don't feel any connection to the characters, some scenes are nonsensical, and I leave with a taste of ""what was the point of that."" Compare Al Pacino here with Al Pacino in DONNIE BRASCO, and you can see he wasn't crappy here because he got old. It's not his fault. The whole project is simply a massive failure.All the dialogue that seemed so slick and smart in the first two films has disappeared, replaced with monotonous 3-liners. Don't even get me started about assassination by glasses. You don't have to compare this movie with its namesakes either. Just see how it matches up with GOODFELLAS, a movie released around the same time.So in essence, what makes this movie good? Is it the worn out tried and tested formula being (mis)used? Is it the complete lack of wit? Is it the amateur quality flashback methods? Is it the fact that none of the actors really seem interested? Is it Sofia Coppola? None of those are part of my good movie criteria.The film does work better than it should, and it's all because of the help it gets from the previous two. If this were considered as a stand-alone product, it would appear much, much, much worse.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie sucked.,"This movie was a major disappointment. The first film in the trilogy is by far one of the best movies ever made, and the sequel almost lived up to that title. But this third installment uses the name to ruin everything. The first hour and a half is incredibly slow. The opposing families are killed off in an unrealistic action movie fashion. Once the scene changes to Italy, the film picks up a bit, but not enough to save it entirely. Granted, the attempted assassination was intense (although stolen from the first film). The best part was the end, where Michael truly gets his.",,Anonymous,Crime
The Best Way To End Trilogy,"Being almost twenty years after Godfather 2, the third Godfather movie still lives up to the same potential after Godfathers 1 and 2, although not as much by just a little bit. Although, I still thought the movie was excellent because it still had the wonderful action and drama of the first two Godfathers.Taking place years and years after the setting of 'The Godfather: Part II' we see Michael Corleone(Al Pacino), now aged and divorced from his wife Kay(Diane Keaton). His children are now full-grown adults and finds out he has a nephew named Vincent(Andy Garcia) who is the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny. Michael takes Vincent under his wing to replace him as Don while he goes out to Vatican City to repent for all of his sins, but then gets the shock of a lifetime when he finds out that his daughter Mary(Sofia Coppola) and Vincent are seeing each other... even though they're cousins! Now, the whole incest thing between Coppola and Garcia was a little shocking to me, but (and this is coming from a teen who's not an incest fan), I didn't mind it. In fact, I liked it (although this will be the only time I accept incest). It was a nice little twist to the final film.Filled with an all-star cast, including Pacino, Keaton, Garcia, Coppola, Joe Mantegna, Talia Shire, and others, the final film to the Godfather series gives us the same amount of quality and potential that the first two movies had. I don't know why people bash it so much, because I thought it was really good. I think it deserves to be in the Top 250 Movies along with its two predecessors. It really was great; a true classic sequel to a sequel to an excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's worth seeing if only for the performance of Raf Vallone.,"Al Pacino is, well....Al Pacino. He delivers his usual exemplary performance in this one. George Hamilton, despite the fact that he is often savaged by critics as an ageing pretty boy, is quite credible in this film as the urbane topnotch corporate lawyer helping Michael get out of the bloody Mafia business by acquiring legitimate and respectable holdings.But the real gem in the movie is the Italian actor, Raf Vallone. Often cast as a ""heavy,"" a Mafia enforcer in countless gangster movies such as in the original Italian Job (with Michael Caine), it is refreshing to see him cast in a sympathetic role. As the Catholic Bishop of the diocese covering Sicily, he becomes father confessor to Don Michael Corleone and offers him saintly advice. His character is based loosely on the short-reigned John Paul I (Albini), a theologian, philosopher, essayist and poet of high caliber.I will never forget his observation on why the corrupt Mafia culture persists in Sicily. He pointed out the stones in a stream/fountain in his courtyard. Then seizing one, he smashes it open to reveal that its core is dry. These people (the Mafia), he says, are like the stones immersed in water for centuries. They have been Christians for hundreds of years but they have never absorbed the true essence of the faith.I liked III better than II which I found ponderous and filled with sympathetic yet corny details especially on how Corleone Sr. rose from petty mulcter to a leading Mafia Don. He was just evil, period.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A more personal ""Godfather"" movie","As with ""Star Wars - The Phantom Menace"", this film took a lot of hits for not being a worthy successor to the original series, but in both cases I disagree. I'm certainly not going to argue that G-III is the best, but it is nonetheless a worthwhile film in its own right.For starters, it is different from the first two, and not just because of the time difference. Just as the real life actors had aged nearly two decades since G-II, so does the setting of the film, which takes place in 1979. I think one aspect that hardcore fans really missed was the lack of a stellar supporting cast, it's interesting to note in both earlier films the large number of nominations for Best Supporting Actor & Actress Awards, whereas in this film the only nomination was Andy Garcia (who, incidentally, did not win). For the most part, this is Al Pacino's movie, and it is also the first time we really get to see him (or the rest of the Family, for that matter) as real human beings. In the first two films, the Family is almost like a machine  ruthless, ambitious, and able to crush anyone who gets in the way. Vito Corleone and his sons and lieutenants operate in a world of cold rationality, when the Godfather wants to put the squeeze on someone he `reasons' with them and if that fails to persuade he makes `an offer they can't refuse'. In the first film Mike decides to kill the Turk and the crooked cop because it's the logical, rational solution to the problem of protecting his father from a rival. Later, Mike has his brother-in-law, and later still, his actual brother, killed, all in the name of protecting the Family.This film is quite different. The point where this hit me was about halfway through when Mike, back in Sicily, is making his confession to a priest. Initially, I thought, it's just a scam, he's only doing it to set someone up or get valuable information. That's what we'd expect of a Corleone, the sort of ruthless cynicism that allows you to manipulate anything, even a solemn religious ritual, for nefarious ends. But it's not that at all, Michael is genuinely remorseful for much of what he's done, most notably Fredo's murder. In another scene, he addresses the corpse of Don Tommasino (the guy who protected him when he was a fugitive in Sicily years earlier) and asks, `Why were you so loved, when I was so feared?' He's also trying to heal rifts with both his kids and his ex-wife. The whole tone of the movie is much more up to date. The women are much more prominent. Kay, his ex, still has feelings for Mike, but she's also managed to run her own life with the kids separate from him. This would have been unthinkable to a Mafia wife a generation earlier. And Connie, who in the original was little more than a whiny human punching bag for her husband, is now as cold and dangerous as her brother. In short, their lives are a far cry from that of Mama Corleone, whose job it was to shut up, take care of the kids, and keep food on the table for the boys. It must be noted, however, that none of the feminism or `touchy-feely' stuff gets in the way of some good old fashioned Corleone style violence, most notably at the end, when, in a move that is reminiscent of the end of G-1, Mike arranges to wrap up all the `loose ends' in the span of just a few hours.Anyway, the plot is somewhat convoluted. There's a big business deal going between the Corleone family and the Vatican and of course the usual corruption and payoffs. Trying to keep track of the various characters and their machinations was difficult at times, but that's really not all that important. What this movie really is about is Michael Corleone having to finally come to terms with the life he's lead and what it's done to his family. It is less a story than a look at the personal side of both him and his family and, most importantly, what all the power, money, and `respect' has cost all of them.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A serving of sirloin after 2 previous helpings of prime rib,"It helped that I saw this, understanding that it was a major disappointment for those with high expectations after the first 2. It was interesting backtracking to this and seeing Andy Garcia as a young buck, much in the same vein as Al Pacino was in GF I, while Pacino is still his own man, out of Brando's shadow. It draws well from the previous 2, leaving you understanding why it waited 16 years to be made. I loved how it rounded out Michael's destiny after showing how much the years wore on him. Talia Shire shows herself as being more than capable of playing a tough mafia woman after her character had previously been so feeble. Overall, a more than decent end to the this epic film series.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Death of Michael Corleone,"When the Godfather debuted in 1972 It revived the gangster genre it brought them back into the spotlight showing them in a very Romanize depiction with a realistic undertone from its writing to its fleshed-out and developing characters. The bloody depiction of violence and the themes of honor, and family. It ushered a new perspective to these types of movies and became iconic. So to think that the same lightning in a bottle could be captured twice even back then seemed like a huge stretch. However, Francis and Mario returned In 1974 with The Godfather: Part II. Not only again becoming a critical success but in many ways surpassing the original. Delving deeper into the backgrounds of the characters of Vitos coming up and Michaels further descending in the roles as the godfathers. While still keeping that very classy and gritty feel from the original. It ended on a powerful note and at that point, it seemed there was nothing left to do. So it came as a huge shock That after 16 years Francis Ford Coppola returned one last time with The Godfather: Part III meant to serve as the epilogue to the Corleone family. Originally meant to title the death of Michael Corleone, It didn't fly with paramount, and legal issues with a cast like Robert Duvall resulted in rewrites. Which results in a rather subpar finale. In the finals day of Michael Corleone, he tries to legitimize all of his business and leave his family safe and secure. Only to be pulled back into the life when other gangsters and corrupted hands in the Catholic church Conspire against him. While the Godfather is nowhere near as great as the others it does have a plot that does offer an interesting concept. Overall the real driving point of the movie is Al Pacino as he's tri to put everything in order and make amends for his past action. He is the only one who seems to be trying in this. Although at this point it seems that he was trying a bit too much to try to capture the portrayal that he had in the 70s. Regardless of how it is kind of a stretch with the idea of the Catholic church it does play off of Michael's character as he seems to find absolution. The music is still good and the cinematography is good though the pacing I terrible it jumps right into the story without really getting to know anybody this time around. As well as throwing in too much with the church and the commission and Vincent and Sofia. That it just becomes clutter. The Recut The death of Michael Corleone fixes some of this, by changing the opening and ending and also removing some scenes. While it doesn't completely rewrite the film it does help a little more and make the movie more tolerable. The things that aren't tolerable is the rest of the cast and the acting. From Sofia Coppola whose acting is very bad and disinteresting, she seems like she has been dubbed over. Same with Vincent who is such an unlikeable character and is so boring his character has so much impact on the character of Michael and really just comes off as a douche, but not like Christopher from The Sopranos where he's an arrogant prick, but you still find him entertaining. He's bland and the whole incest subplot with him and Sofia is disgusting it, not even a commentary on something it's just gross. The fact that many scenes are wasted on these two is a majorly an issue. The fact that it's played off like we're supposed to care is ridiculous.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

After multiple viewings I suddenly realized that, for me anyway, Al Pacino's performance is what turned me off.

"Weakest of the three, but still brilliant.","It really says something about a film when, even when it's the weakest of a trilogy, still manages to be a fantastic film too. While The Godfather Part III doesn't manage to scale the heights of the first two films, this still manages to be a powerful film and brings the story of the Corleone dynasty to a gut wrenching conclusion. The continuation of Michael's story, this time as an older man whose life has moved on to new areas since the second film has a lot to recommend it and it is truly not the disaster that many claimed it was when first released. The central performance of Al Pacino is extraordinary. Filmed in 1990, just when every other Pacino performance was all about screaming and shouting dialog, here he manages restraint as a man burdened with the guilty conscious of ordering the execution of his own brother, a piece of character development that leads to a brilliant moment where Pacino confesses his sins. Pacino's performance here is one of his best in his latter day career when every line of dialog he utters in any other film tends to be said with the volume turned up, but here he brings back that wonderful quality he had during the first two films as well as his career in the 70's.The rest of the cast is a highly mixed affair. Andy Garcia joins the cast as Vincent Corleone, the illegitimate son of Sonny and is superb. How his acting career floundered after this film is quite strange, but he settles into his character fantastically here. Good looking in the same way Pacino and De Niro were (sun tanned skin and thick dark hair), he looks the part and plays it fantastically. Being the son of Sonny the character has a fiery temper and Garcia plays it with the relish you would expect. When it comes to the romance with Michael's daughter, Garcia brings more of a Pacino/De Niro sensitivity to part, making it a wonderful hybrid of a performance that is fantastic to watch. Diane Keaton, once again, is superb as Kay and her scenes with Pacino are once again some of the highlights of the film. So, what makes the casting more mixed this time around? Well Sofia Coppola is the biggest weak link here. Looks wise she doesn't look like Pacino or Keaton and her acting ability is adequate at best. Original choice was Winona Ryder and it makes one quick to point out she would have been a better choice. Then there's George Hamilton as Michael's new lawyer, Tom Hagen having died off screen at some point. His performance is not bad, but he looks out of place in a film like this.In saying that, the script from Coppola and Puzo is once again marvelous, Coppola's direction is as assured as one would expect and the conclusion is shocking and downbeat. The fact that Michael dies alone gives the ending to the trilogy a very poignant and sad tone, more or less confirming that he was doomed to failure no matter what he tried to do with his life, his family and his business.This is still a fantastic film and makes this, overall, a superb trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Godfather Directors Comments.,"It has taken me years to finally watch the Bonus DVD, and ask everyone to watch it AFTER watching all three films.I must say that Michael was the ""Tiger Woods"" of the family. His eyes really told how he felt, had people really studied them. He was like a master chess player and he never ""whacked "" anyone that did not deserve it. He had the REACTION for every ACTION and the way he carried it off gave me the highest respect for the man. If you are truthful and honest with Mike, you are a friend for life, but start digging your own grave, if you cross him. I feel Kay was the only ""pass"" he gave, when she told him about how she lost the third child. He paid her back big time, but she kept on breathing. I was very sad when bad things happen in his family, but as I said, for every action, there is a reaction. Roots, The Color Purple, and The godfather are my favorite movies. I love all of them and the talent of the actors, sets, costumes, and the morals taught, as well as what you should do and what you should never do in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

How to Make Godfather Three Enjoyable!,"Godfather III is a terrible movie. Its one of the most painful movies ever released... If... you have seen parts I and II prior to watching it.Had Godfather III been a stand alone movie, there would not have been such great expectation for it and rather then being a big let down it might have been embraced by the public.But, after watching some of the highest caliber acting, cinematography, direction, music, set design, costume design etc. The movie will make your stomach turn.So my suggestion is: If you haven't seen the trilogy, watch Godfather III first. Then watch I and II. If you do it this way then III will probably be a delight and the first two will blow you away.Save your self the heart break of what could have been the greatest trilogy of all time, bar none, and watch the third installment first.7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone has a story worth telling plus a fitting ending - beautifully shot and a great gangster film","The Godfather Part III is an epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay he co-wrote with Mario Puzo. Although reception to the film was mixed, which is totally understandable as it is far from perfect and masterpieces like the the other two are, it's impossible to top that. Yet it's still a great crime film, one that I really liked on my first viewing but also on my second. It's clearly meant to be an epilogue to the duology that preceded it and if you think about it in that way, it's quite great. Not perfect but great. Though the reception was mixed, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Andy García), Best Cinematographer and Best Film Editing. I agree that they deserve those nominations. The Costume Design are top notch and so is the art direction, sets and locations. The cinematography is excellent and mesmerizing, Gordon Willis shows again how a brilliant cinematographer he is. Carmine Coppola musical score in this film is perfect, keeping the same brilliance that the previous films had. There's much to love about this movie and the performances of Al Pacino and Andy Garcia are of course one of the main reasons, but where is it lacking? The writing works, but isn't perfect. Also the acting of Sofia Coppola isn't that good, but I'll have to say that the hate she got is wrong. It was an alright performance but they should have cast an actress with more range and skill, yet we got Sofia Coppola and if you look past some of the wooden and bad acting, it's overall okey.It is the third and final installment in The Godfather trilogy. It concludes the story with the aging Don Michael Corleone who seeks to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld but is kept back by the ambitions of the young. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster seeking to upset the existing Mafioso order and a young protege's love affair with his daughter. The film also includes fictionalized accounts of two real-life events: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981-1982, both linked to Michael Corleone's business affairs.The Godfather Part III has Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire reprising their roles from the first two films. Some important characters are Andy García as Vincent Corleone, Eli Wallach as Don Altobello, Joe Mantegna as Joey Zasa, George Hamilton as B. J. Harrison, Bridget Fonda as Grace Hamilton, Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone, Raf Vallone as Cardinal Lamberto, Franc D'Ambrosio as Anthony Corleone, Donal Donnelly as Archbishop Gilday, Richard Bright as Al Neri and Al Martino as Johnny Fontane. There's of course much more actors and fully fleshed out characters in the film. Vincent Corleone is the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone and his mistress Lucy Mancini. Coppola has said that Vincent is an amalgamation of the five Corleone family males, having Vito's cunning, Michael's ruthlessness, Fredo's vulnerability, Sonny's temper, and Tom Hagen's courage. Don Altobello is an aging gangster and longstanding ally of the Corleone crime family's. Joey Zasa is a longtime member of Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza's regime. Following the retirement of Ritchie Nobilio, who succeeded Frank Pentangeli after the events of The Godfather Part II, Zasa assumes control over the Corleone family business in New York City with approval from the Commission and Michael Corleone. Zasa is feared and to a certain degree, respected among his peers in the New York underworld for his business acumen and utter ruthlessness.The character arc for Michael Corleone in the first two parts of The Godfather Trilogy is brilliant and just a milestone in terms of storytelling, but it comes full circle here and sees the true nature of Michael. Part III is all about him being a better person and trying to make the Crime Family legitimate, which have been his goal since the first film. The Godfather Part III is a satisfying end to his arc and it wouldn't be as excellent if it wouldn't be for the phenomenal writing and two other films in the trilogy to fully flesh out Michael Corleone and the other characters who he have surrounded himself by. Vincent Corleone also has a magnificent character arc in this film, taking the spotlight multiple of times away from Al Pacino. Their characters are different but also similar, but it's how Vincent is young and Michael now old. It's easy to sympathize with them both. Vincent Mancini-Corleone has quickly become one of my favorite characters of the Trilogy. Al Pacino and Andy Garcia is who clearly stands out the most, their performances are some of the best in the trilogy. Al Pacino is still a lot better in Part II but it's still a great performance. Eli Wallach, Talia Shire and Joe Mantegna also deserve some praise. Regarding the character of Michael Corleone, he's a character you can sympathize with in some degree, he's a very bad person that feel no regret of what he does. Thus he suffers from bad karma and he ultimately suffers from it. As the recut version is called: The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneLike Part I and Part II, I have only seen this film once before and it was the theatrical cut. But for my second viewing, I bought the re-cut version of the film, titled Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. It truly is better and a more fitting end, but not much have changed in terms of it being the same film except for the pacing being better. It's always nice to see the creator's true vision come to life and this is what Francis Ford Coppola wanted. Sadly there's a reason why the writing isn't on the same level as the previous films, it's said that he only had 6 weeks to write the script instead of 6 months he wanted, Francis Ford Coppola had only a year to write, direct and edit the film. So it was rushed, but the finished product were a great crime/gangster film with; memorable sequences and dialogue, great acting and cinematography so perfect. It's a worthy addition to The Godfather Trilogy, and to the crime genre. With its fair share of symbolism like the other films before it, visually this is a great looking film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't Bother,"Godfather III, like so many sequels, simply fails to deliver on the promise of the series. Godfather I & II, while essentially soap operas, both deliver brilliantly.  They are well acted, well written beautifully filmed and engaging.  But why else would they package III in the Godfather box set and with a bonus DVD?  On its own it wouldn't sell.  I found myself wanting to fast forward through scenes and wishing I would have rented instead of bought.  Many situations (the parties, parades, disguised cop etc.,) are copied from the first two episodes, but just don't seem as convincing. Why did Joey Zasa have the helicopter wipe out the mob bosses before he knew the outcome of the meeting?  Many actors are cardboard and George Hamilton is positively wooden.  Is he an actor?  I thought he was just on Hollywood squares?  Diane Keaton seems out of place, like she walked in from the set of a Woody Allen film and landed in a gangster picture.  Despite its 2&1/2 hours, you don't `feel' the relationship between Vinnie and Michael.  How did he grow or `learn' the ropes to become a Godfather?  He just changes from a leather jacket to a suit.  Many scenes and dialog are laughable or cliché,  The spinning newspaper that freezes on the headline, the assassin lurking in front of the opera poster etc., The only reason to watch this film is to see Andy Garcia steal scenes (he's the only actor who seems he really wants to be in the film) and a few good one liners.  Otherwise the movie falls off the chair like the aged Al Pacino at the end of the movie, a dead, dried up shell of its former self.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Highs and Lows,"I enjoyed this movie the first time and every time I've watched it. There are some negatives, which I will get ride of first- Tom Hagen/Robert Duvall is missing, and George Hamilton is no Robert Duvall. Not greedy, but feeling underpaid, he chose to skip this one, and it hurts the finished product.And second- Sofia Coppola is awful.
That said- I loved Garcia as Sonny's son and the heir to the mafia throne. I liked Talia Shire's growth as a character into a true ""Corleone"". And I like how Michael Corleone's life of crime didn't end with a happy retirement. While I disagree with the cardinal's assessment (or at least, his blaming God) there are certainly consequences for actions, and Michael is certainly reaping his criminal harvest. It is dark and depressing, as his life of crime should be, and that is when he should seek redemption. But this shows that redemption isn't something you can earn, but is a gift from God. The scenery is beautiful, the interplays of the characters (minus Sofia) are well done, and though not up to the first 2 installments, very few movies are.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I'm tired of all these bad reviews. Godfather Part III is a worthy end to the sequel!!,"I'm going to be short with my comments...I would just like to say that I'm tired of hearing all these horrible, negative reviews about The Godfather part III. While I respect everyone's opinions, It's just hard to comprehend how people could trash this beatiful and high-drama movie.Is there that much of a difference and deviation with this movie and Godfather Part I, and II? Francis Ford coppola stays genuine to his style of directing, and the writing for this script was great, while the cinemotography was amazing, and the storyline was intruiging. There isn't too much of a difference between The Godfather Part III and the other ones, so I don't see why critics find this one conspiciously different from the first two.I actually thought The Godfather Part III was better than Godfather Part II.Godfather Part I was the best by far. It's a perfect, beautiful movie that astounds me every time i watch it. I love the storyline that Michael Corleoni evaded the family's ""business affairs"" in the beginning, but then as the family was dwindling, he assumed responsibility and the RISE of Michael Corleoni begun. AL Pacino is amazing in this movie and so is Marlon Brando's. ****Godfather Part II- A worthy sequel, but fell short for several reasons. The storyline is complex and obscure. The ""business"" references are odd and almost nonexistent. And most of all, the suspense and the tension is not there, unlike Godfather Part I. Nevertheless, i liked this movie. I thought the flashbacks to the young Veto Corleoni was awesome. While Veto Corleoni was justful and on the rise....Michael Corleoni was suspiciosly unmerciful and on the DECLINE...as he lost Fredo, Kay....***Godfather Part III- definitely a good end to the trilogy. The suspense and tension is back in this one. It is interesting how Michael Corleoni has matured since his days in the Godfather Part II. He is reconnecting with his family and searching deep within his soul. He repents for his wrongdoings (very powerful scene)...and concedes his trust in Andy garcia, the new godfather in case anything happens. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ambivalent,"It's a good movie with all the ingredients of the previous parts, but adds nothing in scope and depth, and the plot is not as stringently scripted.This remains an ambivalent experience, since it falls so way down the previous two films and has so many flaws and only rare moments of brilliance.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
It shouldn't have been titled 'Godfather',"Though the unbelievably bad Sofia Coppola received the bulk of the criticism, the main fault with this hugely disappointing epic is the plot. The concept of a known gangster being embraced by the Vatican just didn't seem plausible & the direction compared to the previous two instalments is lifeless and formulaic. Coppola states in the DVD commentary from the first movie, that it's strength came from the quality of the cast - not just the big names like Marlon Brando & James Caan, but also people like Abe Vigoda in smaller roles. In Godfather 3, that kind of ensemble performance is missing as the whole enterprise degenerates into a tacky star vehicle for Al Pacino & Andy Garcia. I personally thought Garcia was dreadful, but again it wasn't all his own fault. At the start of the movie he's an uncontrollable psycho who chomps off ears - a trait which he miraculously loses by the end of the movie. Bridget Fonda makes a fleeting appearance and one wonders why she could not have been cast in the role of Mary instead of Sofia Coppola. In terms of talent, Sofia is obviously the 'Fredo' of the family and Don Coppola should have made her an offer she couldn't refuse!. Even when levelled against other lesser films of this genre I feel Godfather 3 is a poor movie, but compared to the previous two it's an unforgivable disaster.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Would Ryder and Duvall have saved this flick?,"Winona Ryder was supposed to play the part of Mary, and Robert Duvall was supposed to come back as Michael's consiglieri, or at least as his attorney in place of George Hamilton. But Ryder left because of illness and fatigue, and Duvall held out because he wanted as much money as Pacino( a fact that has always really bothered me, being that Coppola pretty much gave Robert Duvall a forty year career by casting him in I). I think they would have made this movie much better; think about it, no Sofia Coppola who sticks out like a soar thumb, and could have had a genuinely provocative relationship with Vincent, and no George Hamilton, fresh out of the Mark of Zorro. But do you think they would have put it on par with the other two?",,Anonymous,Crime
A great ending,"The Godfather Part III, despite receiving mixed reviews upon its initial release, deserves a reevaluation as it offers a compelling and thought-provoking conclusion to the iconic Godfather trilogy. While it may not match the level of brilliance of its predecessors, the film still showcases the exceptional craftsmanship of director Francis Ford Coppola and the captivating performances of its talented cast.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its narrative complexity. Set several years after the events of the previous films, The Godfather Part III explores the moral dilemma faced by an aging Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he tries to legitimize his family's business and protect his loved ones. The film delves into themes of redemption, guilt, and the cyclical nature of violence, adding depth to the overall story arc.Al Pacino delivers a remarkable performance as Michael Corleone, capturing the character's internal struggles and conflicted emotions with finesse. Pacino's portrayal brings a certain vulnerability to the role, showcasing Michael's regrets and desire for redemption. Diane Keaton also shines as Kay Adams, portraying her character's strength and resilience as she confronts the consequences of her past choices.The film benefits from a visually striking cinematography, with Coppola's masterful use of lighting and composition creating a moody and atmospheric tone. The opulent settings and intricate costume design further enhance the film's immersion, capturing the grandeur and decadence of the Corleone family's world.The Godfather Part III features a strong supporting cast, with standout performances from Andy Garcia as Vincent Mancini, Michael's nephew, and Talia Shire as Connie Corleone. Garcia injects an electrifying energy into the film, portraying Vincent's volatile nature and complex relationship with Michael. Shire delivers a nuanced performance, showcasing Connie's transformation from a naive young woman to a shrewd and manipulative character.The film also boasts a haunting and evocative score composed by the legendary Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola, which perfectly complements the on-screen drama and adds to the film's emotional depth.While some criticize the film for its intricate plot and pacing, these aspects contribute to the film's reflective and contemplative tone. The Godfather Part III rewards viewers who appreciate a more introspective approach to storytelling and a deeper exploration of the consequences of a life steeped in power and violence.In conclusion, The Godfather Part III, though not reaching the heights of its predecessors, stands as a worthy conclusion to the iconic Godfather trilogy. It offers a compelling narrative, strong performances, and visual grandeur that contribute to its lasting impact. With its exploration of complex themes and emotional resonance, the film deserves recognition for its contribution to the Godfather legacy.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the most underrated sequels of all time.,"Godfather 1 & 2 are a diptych, whereas part 3 really is a Coda. Many have dissed it as underwhelming and nowhere near as good as the first two, but I beg to differ: for here we have Michael at his rawest and most vulnerable, impeccably portrayed by a more seasoned Al Pacino.Meanwhile, the new school of villains are just as strong if not more powerful and nefarious than the ones in the former instalments.The film furthermore addresses the controversial topic of Catholic Church and Vatican corruption, which has gone on to influence later films such as Conclave, both visually and narratively. While the villains of Part One were the opposing Families, and the ones in Part Two were the State, the true villain of Part Three is, in fact, the Vatican Church at its ties to the mafia (most notably in real-life events, the secret organisation P2).I'd say that Part Three is definitely more hot-potato territory than the first parts, simply because it's about exposing corruption in high places that makes Michael's organisation look like Disneyland. Not only this, we have a terrifically edgy romantic subplot with the Kissing Cousins: Vincent Mancini (Sonny's Boy) and Michael's daughter (played lusciously by Sofia Coppola), which culminates in a literally operatic bloodbath that amounts to Shakespearean Tragedy at its most poignant and cathartic.""All we are saying

the end of the saga,"I was a little skeptical before seeing Part:III. I mean the first two films are rated #2 and #3 in IMDb and the third film is not even close to being in the top250. Still it has same director, screenwriter and major part of the cast who were in the first two films too. After seeing this one, I have to admit. Part:III is underrated. It definitely should be at least in the top250. It isn't that intense than the first two parts. There are not such a shining performances but hey, it still is very good. Good story and quite similar to the first two films in my opinion.Al Pacino steals the show for me here as well. Although Andy Garcia is quite challenging. The supporting cast is quite good but it's the lead characters who shine the most. And they should be. They accomplish that and they should be recognized for that.This is the third and final part of the famous mafia saga. Don't leave it to watch this because of the low rating. You regret that.

A great film in its own right,"So I don't know why but I had gone 28 years without seeing Part 3 after having seen Part's 1 and 2 numerous times.

After finally sitting down to watch it, I was glad I did because it was a fitting end to the saga and a fine film in its own right.
Now, I do not feel this film is the same caliber as the first 2. There is a lot missing from this film, but it tells a different story from those movies that I thought was well done. The biggest drawbacks for me are the actors, either some of the roles cast or the lack of characters from the first 2. Robert Duvall is sorely missed (I read somewhere there was a contract dispute and that's why he wasn't involved). Sophia Coppola's performance is not as bad as I heard it was, but it was still no a highlight of the film. I thought Andy Garcia was fine for the role he was cast in, but I wasn't too impressed with Diane Keaton in this movie.

Does anybody care about all these new faces?,"Was it supposed to be funny that the main storyline in The Godfather: Part III took ""keep it in the family"" to an entirely new level? It's a love story between Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola, who play first cousins. Andy is James Caan's son, and Sofia is Al Pacino's daughter. Does anyone really care about these people, or would you rather send them to a therapist and save yourself three hours? Since only three of the original cast has made it to the last installment, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire, the movie banks on audiences caring about all the new faces and plot points. Instead of all the old faithfuls from the 1970s, there's Andy Garcia, Sofia Coppola, George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, and Eli Wallach. It doesn't really feel like as much of a classic, does it?In this one, you can look forward to tons of violence, lots of new faces, old grudges, and the infamous-and once again, continually spoofed-silent scream from Al Pacino. Maybe the only reason why The Godfather franchise is so famous is because people keep making fun of them and mimicking them-or maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part.

ALTHOUGH IT HAD A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.....,"....I have just finished watching the final chapter in my favorite film trilogy of all time. The Godfather. After watching the first two films, and bathing in there brilliance, I read some very negative comments on The Godfather P:III. These were mainly in the shape of Sophia Coppola's bad acting, but to be honest, I found her acting to be realistic and convincing. The plot of the third film centers around the aging Michael Corleone and his attempts to legitimise his bussiness and find a successor to his empire. This successor comes in the from of Vincent Mancini (Lucy Mancini's and Sonny Corleone's son) portrayed wonderfully by Andy Garcia. But Vincents violent ways of doing things soon pull Michael back into the dark and violent world of the mafia.This film is a brilliant conclusion to an epic saga. Puzo's and Coppola's script holds the viewer for all 163 minutes. The acting, like all Godfather films, is top notch. Especially Al Pacino, who should have won an oscar for his preformance. It's also nice to see old faces such as Kay, Johnny Fontain, Connie and Al Neary. All though the film is long, you really don't notice it at all, and I thought that the film could have been twice as long. I read elsewhere on the site from a comment that said 'This would be a good staging for The Godfather P:IV, with Vincent running things, while further developing the relationships between Michael, his wife and their son'. But I veiwed the special directors cut version, and from the ending I saw, how could this be possible?With incredible directing, brilliant acting and an unforgettable ending, The Godfather P:III, all though not a good as its predecesors, is a marvellous film, which beautifully ends an epic saga and is an absolute must for all Godfather and Al Pacino fans alike.My Rating: 8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Will there be any kind of a reconciliation with Kay? Bad guys are still waiting in the wings to pull him bacfk in just when he thinks he's out (to coin a phrase). OK, fine.The problem is that, notwithstanding all these family issues that could command full attention, the viewers have to contend with sorting out just what the heck is this International Immobiliare thing, why should they care about it, and who is the heavy-smoking archbishop in the middle of it all?Then, I saw the clip of the alternate beginning of the film, in which the archbishop does a Bonasera-style confession to Michael, in which he explains the Vatican Bank shortfall, and he and Michael lay out the outline of Michael's nine-figure donation and the Immobiliare quid pro quo.And I realized that this is exactly the urgently-needed, sorely-missed plot exposition that could at the outset have revealed Immobiliare for the MacGuffin that it is, and left the viewers free to pay attention to the family issues that the movie is really about.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Godfather III: A New Pope,"The Godfather III serves as the final chapter in the series, showing the viewers the beginning of the next generation of the Corleone family dynasty. The themes of the series are continued in this film, namely the duality of doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The values of loyalty and family are contrasted with crime and evil acts.In the final film of the series, Michael Corleone has grown older and the actions of his past begin to haunt him with guilt. Along with losing his family in the previous films, Michael's unhappiness drives him to atone for his sins. Despite his charitable actions, his nephew, Vincent, begins to follow in his uncle's footsteps. This is a different form of the vigilante philosophy that usually drives the protagonists of the series, as the head of the family desires to ""go clean"", while others participate in the older, more violent, methods.Like the previous installments in the series, the film does have a long running time. Unfortunately, unlike the other films in the series, Godfather III doesn't stand on its own. The third film serves as a bookend to the other films, or as Coppola said himself, an epilogue to the story. Part III may not hold up as well as the first two films, but that only speaks to how good The Godfather I and II are. The Godfather III is still a great movie and worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The breakthru of his daughter was a great performance. I was amazed at how good Andy Garcia was. That man is a true actor and a credit to his profession. I was surprised at his amazing performance and how cruel he was as Nick. This was not as good as the first two but much more different. This is the movie that brought an end to the saga. This movie will forever be in my heart. I am a TRUE FAN of these three movies and will watch them all again and again. I loved that part in this movie when Garcia is riding a horse.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"so close, but  not quite","I think this movie is very close to being a great film, but it fails in a few places. first of all, what was Coppola thinking when he gave his daughter the role of Michael's daughter and then he gave her all those lines. Normally I don't like to be so tough on actors, but man was she bad, it's a good thing she changed her mind and decided to be a director because she's made some really good films except for one (Lost in Translation and Virgin suicides, hated Marie Antoinette). Another thing is that i wish Robert Duvall would have been the concillere and then I if that would of happened the concillere would've had more lines. I thought Pacino was great, Garcia was close to being like Sunny, and having Eli Wallach in it was excellent. This film was more interesting then the second one and if there would have been a better cast it would have been better then the second one. in conclusion, no Sofia Coppola and no George Hamilton, have a little different casting in other places and have Robert duvall, and then you have a film just as good as the second one, none of them could be as good as the first. I give it 8.5/10, but I do not think this deserves to be on the top 250 and round down instead of up because there are problems with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fair sequel with good moments,"The first two films of the Godfather saga were close to perfection, some of the most masterful movies ever made. Although part three is a big step down from those films, it has redeeming qualities that allow me to give it a passing grade. This sequel involves Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) trying to at last free his family from the world of crime and find someone to take over leading the family business. Michael's most likely successor is his nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), the son of Michael's brother Sonny (James Caan's character from the first film). This is the area of the film that proves to be interesting, as these two characters expand on the details of events and people in the first two films and give us information we did not really go into in those movies. For example, they discuss Michael and Sonny's relationship and Michael's short-lived marriage before Kay. These discussions are truly fascinating. I disagree that the film is too long, as I think this movie, as well as the first two, move along at a fairly quick pace. It proves to be interesting enough to sit through without really getting bored. My first problem with this film, however, is casting the director's real-life daughter Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter in the film. Her acting was pretty unrealistic and did not fit with the brilliance the rest of the cast seemed to have. Also, I dislike how the film chose to end. It felt as though the whole of the saga was not really resolved, that all three films were building up to nothing. It's truly not a bad film, but it doesn't have the masterful work the first two had. It still proves to be worthwhile, and hey, who really expects the third film to be the best anyway.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An old family head faces the question to let a family member of his marry his daughter who wants to become the head of the family.,"Godfather Part III is the turning point of michael corleone's life, as he faces the question to go on with his sins and brutality of his family or to choose the next head as he goes down on retirement. The theme of this movie's changed a lot since part II, in which Corleone family was a powerful mob family. Here the Corleone family's been shown as the absolute power and dominating force. The culminating is quite sad which with the enormous play of Al Pacino becomes one of the best emotional scenes in the history of Cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
