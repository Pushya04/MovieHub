A Mile a Minute,"After reading some of the previous reviews, I wonder what it takes to engage the modern viewer. It seems we have become so jaded that we see the necessity of giving a one star review to something as phenomenal as this film is. It is filled with action, sets of remarkable creativity, amazing characters, in a complex plot that made me long for the conclusion. I know it doesn't follow the book religiously. Get over that. Even a fifteen hour miniseries based on a novel fails miserably. Of course, every English teacher on the planet knows that we are working in two entirely different mediums. Books and movies are different! What Peter Jackson has done is taken the primary plot and allowed his script writers to take what is given and supplement it with their own creativity. The first film, though imperfect, does set the stage for this superior second effort. What we get is nonstop action, moving the characters toward the object of their quest. Tolkien's rules are followed if not the letter of the plot. The first film was criticized for being too talky. Now this one is being criticized for not being talky enough. For me, the scene where the gang must escape an elven prison and face the orcs is one of the most delightful fifteen minutes I've ever spent in a movie theater. I don't expect an action film based on a book with voluminous characters to have character development like ""Driving Miss Daisy."" See the film for what it is and count yourselves lucky to have the luxury of being able to see the amazing accomplishments of the Peter Jackson's of the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great fun, but forget the book","Bilbo Baggins and assorted dwarfs continue their journey to Erebor, overcoming various obstacles on the way (including hostile elves) before Bilbo has to try to fulfil his engagement as burglar under the fiery snout of antisocial dragon Smaug.The second Lord Of The Rings movie suffered from Middle Film Syndrome: Hobbit 2, despite occupying the same position in a trilogy, does not suffer to the same extent, and perhaps this is because it is exciting all the way through, yet follows on from a film which was pretty slow throughout its first half.It also contains large chunks which do not come from the novel - I'm pretty sure Legolas wasn't in the book. He is great fun here, as a much angrier soldier in the Elf Army. And new creation Tauriel is hugely enjoyable, resembling nothing so much as Uma Thurman's character from Kill Bill, albeit attractively played with the hint of a smile by Evangeline Lilly.Apart from being a more engaging movie than part 1, pretty much everything I thought about that movie still holds. I still have reservations about the dwarfs - their faces and hair feel obviously prosthetic and wigged, and it's still pretty difficult to tell them apart from each other except for the old one, the one wounded by the orc arrow, Thorin, and James Nesbitt's Irish one. I still have reservations about CGI orc faces - the prosthetic orc faces work noticeably better. I still have reservations about some of the action sequences, where more is not necessarily better (one sequence, in particular had the audience laughing because of the extent to which the Elvish derring-do was over-derring-done). And there are times when Bilbo looks cut out and pasted into a scene. And, once again, the 3D is indifferent.Otherwise, this was great fun. Loads of action, some nice character work, an excellent and nasty spider fight, a well-voiced and visually realised Smaug, and not the slightest yen to look at my watch.And a cliff-hanger. You swine, Jackson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Improves upon the first one just about enough to cover the weaknesses it shares with it,"After seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a ""12 months earlier"" scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn't that the first film was bad (it is too expensive to be bad) but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me, really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in (and I say this as a gamer). I didn't hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and, as Theo Robertson has said, perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.The plot has more to it than one encounter after another and connecting it to the later films was a good move that made me feel there was more content here – although I think that was artificial, I will not deny that it worked. The action sequences retain the same problems as the first film, which is that nobody ever feels like they are in real danger no matter how long the fall, how low the odds or what is happening. The good thing is that because the film isn't one escape sequence after another, I didn't feel this so often – although it is undeniably still a problem in these films. The characters were a little better than before although perhaps I was just more interested in them. Smaug in particular is a great creation – visually and stylishly; just like the first film where my favorite parts were the still and tense sequences with Gollum, so too here the high point of the whole film is where Smaug is toying with his potential victims and it is such a shame that this was not done longer.Visually the film remains a feast – although, befitting the time of year, it is a Christmas feast where everything is good but it is endless and eventually just feels indulgent and gluttonous. This remains the case because the film almost never feels like it was shot wholly on a location. I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and, as good as it looks, it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas ""if we can do it then we should do it"" school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs – I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much – Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles (shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!).The Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster; lots of action, a decent story and strong special effects – this is not the same as saying it is a great film though, but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free (but very seriously presented) action, which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I'll be there for the final film, but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A very good movie, slightly reminiscent of the Hobbit","Peter Jackson's ego that was held at bay all through the previous installment breaks free in this one. The lighthearted atmosphere from the book, that shone so brightly over the 1st part of the his version of the Hobbit, is no longer here, the strange story lines that were added to tie every thing together so no loose end is left and everyone watching the film knows that Peter Jackson did tell us all there was to know. An exact opposite of Tolkien's original who kept always saying (or implying) that middle earth has much more to it than he could ever cover with his stories. It's a difference in egos that doesn't always work for Jackson. Even though he did create a magnificent fantasy epic. Much darker than the first part, much more action packed very high quality of acting performances by all involved. The sins against the original book aren't as grave as those he committed with his LoTR trilogy, mainly because the Hobbit as I already said is a simpler story that doesn't allow for miss representations of the author's intentions. Jackson simply had to invent all these from scratch.I'm all for re-imagining a story, but if you do so at least be honest and tell us that's what you did, like Tim Burton did when he made his version of Alice. Jackson never said any such thing, if he did it was kept a secret from most of the viewers, which is plain shame as far as I'm concern. I know everyone is going to hate this review to pieces, so many ""Jacksoners"" are following every bit of film he creates trampling in their wake over all those who dare oppose him. But I personally think that had he kept himself closer to the original, he would've ended with a better movie. It was so with the first part, but I feel like his ego couldn't share the credit with the original author anymore, so that's what we got. It's fun to watch - it's just a different story we're watching than the one we were promised.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Fantastic, Exciting Adventure","While I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, it did feel like it left a bit to be desired. This was no surprise, as everything that I loved about the book was in the second half. I knew that I would be waiting for all the good stuff with the second and third films. And sure enough, the second film delivers where the first film didn't quite excite as much as I had wanted. While it isn't perfect and does unnecessarily deviate a bit, this is easily better than the first film, giving us a bigger, bolder adventure and a more interesting Bilbo Baggins this time around.Before I get to the good stuff, let me get my complaints out of the way. My biggest complaint are the unnecessary plot threads. There seems to be a big need for this series of films to tie into LotR, and I really don't understand why. A great deal of time is taken in this film to introduce us to things we already know the outcome of. We're, at points, taken away from the dwarfs and Bilbo to follow Gandalf as he goes off on his own adventure to uncover the growing evil of Sauron and his armies. Like the first film, it's completely unnecessary, but unlike that film, it's jarring. We're ripped from a fantastic adventure to a story that we don't really need to know and has no real relation to the dwarfs and their adventure. In fact, any time we're taken out of the company of the dwarfs, it almost feels cheap. The almost romance between Evangeline Lily's elf and the dwarf Kili feels something of the same, the whole lot of these stories coming off as filler in an effort to make time for three movies instead of just two. It feels like a stretch and brings a screeching halt to the momentum of the main story.That said, the rest of the film is an excellent and expertly crafted adaptation. There is a definite sense of character growth, especially from Bilbo, who seems to struggle with the power of the ring and it's greed. We already know where this goes, but it is none the less fascinating considering who he was when we first met him. The dwarfs seem to almost take a back seat here. They are less prominent, with the exception of Thorin and Balin, who take front and center. That isn't to say they aren't entertaining, as they usually are every time they are on screen. Thorin is the real standout though, as he goes through similar changes as Bilbo, which lends them an interesting comparison in their mutual struggles. The actors are all excellent once again in their respective roles, with Freeman once again being the standout. Evangeline Lily is also a pleasant surprise in an original role as an elf created for the film. She adds a much needed feminine touch to an otherwise predominantly male cast. She proves herself to be a fine silver screen presence and hopefully this will net her some further film roles.While the film does an excellent job of not simply being the middle film, something The Two Towers struggled with in the LotR trilogy, it is the action, set pieces, and effects which are the true stars. This may not be a LotR movie, but it's close. We almost immediately start out with a bang and it rarely lets up. Of course, much of what happens early on, as exciting as it may be, pales in comparison to it's explosive and lengthy climax. Smaug is quite possibly the best creation of any of the film, Hobbit or LotR. He is as awesome as you could have hoped for and Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role. While effects have been applied to his voice to give it more boom, he does a fantastic job as the sneering, wise, and boastful dragon. Watching and listening to him face off against Bilbo is a delightful treat, and that is before we get to any fire breathing and chasing. What follows is a lengthy conclusion to the film that will excite and delight all. I have no qualms in saying that Smaug makes the entire film worth the admission of price. But don't go in expecting a solid conclusion. This is, after all, the second of a trilogy, so you can surely expect the film to leave you salivating for the next one.While this new Hobbit film still doesn't reach LotR heights, it is superior to the previous film, especially when it comes to being an enjoyable adventure. It feels like it matters to the trilogy and delivers on being an epic. And I simply can't rave enough about Smaug. If you didn't enjoy the first film, you may find yourself feeling about the same here. But at least this one has a cool dragon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Fun Film, Particularly in 3D","The second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the ""whitewater rafting"" scene. That part and the whole movie has good editing. In this one, two of the non-King dwarfs' presence is stronger (Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her works, adding some heart to the film.Besides Richard Armitage leading the way as the King under the Mountain with his great chemistry with fellow castmates, there are three actors who give specially noteworthy live-action performances. Lee Pace is one of the true highlights as Thranduil, who is an Elf King that deals with foreboding in a way that is different from Elrond. Ian McKellen's acting is comparable to him in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as he takes advantage of Gandalf getting his own storyline and heart-pounding action scene. Martin Freeman is good once again as the brave titular character, and actually slightly better.The confrontation with Smaug is very enjoyable. It is a long movie, but the finale is the high point. Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent job with the arrogant beast's voice, and the dragon looks really cool in 3D. I personally think that they ended it at the perfect place. When they divide a book up, it will inevitably result in a cliffhanger feeling. But, I am satisfied with how they handled it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent!,"In the words of J.R. Tolkien - ""Things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway""(The Hobbit, Chapter 3, paragraph 26).""The Desolation of Smaug"" is sure to satisfy those who thought the first installment dragged its feet. From the first frame to the last, the movie is a thrilling achievement of Peter's. The action is none like we've seen in any middle-earth installment. The visual effects are much improved, the pace is seamless, and the danger is ever more present. Yet through it all, Bilbo and the company's journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain is not forgotten as the driving force of this tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug: Alike the first, impressive but not ground breaking","The Lord Of The Rings trilogy blew me away, they were truly outstanding masterpieces that deserved every bit of recognition they got.The Hobbit I delayed due to a laundry list of concerns, all of which are being confirmed now I'm finally getting around to them.They look beautiful, they are a lot of fun, but compared to LOTR they are alike Mythica movies.The whole franchise has become a cash grab, the Hobbit should have been one single movie and without all the excessive alterations. Yes I know LOTR had changes, but not to this devastating extent.Desolation Of Smaug certainly has it's moments, I especially enjoyed the spiders and the not so jolly romp through the cursed forest. Thankfully the film isn't as goofy as the first either which was a welcome relief.Alas it's no better, it still feels lackluster. This is The Hobbit, one of the greatest tales ever put to paper! So why do these movies feel so underwhelming? I enjoyed this I truly did, but not as much as I should have and that right there is the problem.The Good:Forest scene was greatLooks stunningThe Bad:As neat as the barrels scene is it's about as realistic as Tara Reeds boobsSecond movie, second stock screamThings I Learnt From This Movie:Bilbo Baggins has never seen Arachnophobia (1990), don't.....pluck.....the webWalnuts make great pillowsWhatever Cumberbatch was paid it was FAR too much",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
*Awesome film and there are some idea's I would like to address in this review*,"*THIS IS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE HOBBIT WAS MADE TO STOP THIS GREAT FILM'S NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY MANY*I loved LOTR and equally I love the Hobbit films thus far. I am writing this to help people see the idea and thinking behind the Hobbit films, so people can have more of an appreciation than a negative view. Firstly the thing behind the LOTR was their was three books, three long detailed books, so almost everything required for script writing was already there and could be interpreted into script and into of course, 3 films. On the other hand the Hobbit was written as a children's book, so, if you have read the book you realise things go by at a very fast pace (like really fast). So when Jackson was writing the film he didn't have much to work with, and yes, there are a lot of events in this short book that people are forgetting about, lots of events but only summarised by Tolkien, too summarised for a comprehensive film. People say he needed one film, but when you think about how fast, the film would go by, you would hardly see anything, and you could miss out on some key scenes and characters. So Jackson had to expand the sequences by using information he brought in from Tolkien's other related texts. My next big issue is pacing... seriously, what a stupid argument, where movie ""critics"" have to find something to be critical about. For instance in the first film in the Shire, where people said it took to long, for god's sake, the movie is called 'THE HOBBIT', and Hobbit's live in The Shire, I enjoyed this scene immensely as it provides more than adequate characterisation, which for a quality film is important, it provided us with Bilbo's character flaws and habits, the dwarfs mannerisms, beliefs, ambitions, quirkiness, and importantly, individual character points and differentiation. Also showing us Gandalf and Thorins power of presence and importance. The movie breezes along at a steady pace for a first film of a trilogy, which is expected. Also people say that the LOTR is more important, or interesting, thing about it... one is to save the whole world, the other to kill a dragon and take back a kingdom, so please stop comparing the two films, they have their similarities but also have profound differences, pros and cons. People have been saying he (Peter Jackson and his associates) verged too far from the books but what he did was really quite clever, he allowed us to see more of Middle Earth than ever before, and in an entertaining, clever way. Thank you Sir.So please before you go and say something negative about these great films (which I highly recommend above all other films at this point), just think about what has gone into these films and why and also show a certain appreciation for these magnificent films.And once I again I would like to re-iterate that you go see The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug, filled with awesome characters, mind blowing scenery, fantastic acting and direction for Peter Jackson. This film,is great fun for all ages and I urge you to see it.Thankyou",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Desolation of J.R.R. Tolkien's Spirit.,"When The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey premiered on silver screen as the first in a trilogy of films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, the response it received was mostly positive to mixed. The majority of criticism was targeted at the needless expansion of a single film story into three features but, in my opinion, it did commence this latest Middle-Earth adventure on the right note and, despite its sluggish pace, ended up providing a largely satisfying experience.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the second chapter of The Hobbit film series & picks the story right from where it was left off in An Unexpected Journey. Continuing the adventures of Bilbo Baggins who's accompanying thirteen dwarfs on their quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor, the film covers the journey ahead for these fellows which is full of dangers and even if they manage to get away with it & reach the Lonely Mountain safely, they have a stupendous dragon to deal with.One thing I have always admired about this Middle-Earth franchise is the filmmaker's strong intent to keep the story very much within the realms of Tolkien's spirit. But this latest chapter marks a significant departure from such faithfulness & ends up being an immensely frustrating experience. There are a few things The Desolation of Smaug gets right but there are also way too many things that are wrong with it. Let's start with the things it gets right first.Since the previous chapter was criticized for its sluggish pace, the filmmakers have vastly improved the pacing in this middle chapter with addition of many more action sequences to keep the entertainment going throughout its runtime. Production design continues to amaze. Cinematography encapsulates the picture with a darker layer which suits its tone. Visual effects has its share of highs n lows & Howard Shore's score is good but it also stumbles a little for the very first time.Now coming to what's wrong with it... First, it slaughters the book in a manner that's plainly insulting to Tolkien. Second, the absurdly introduced love triangle, overindulgence of Elves & eye-rollingly cheesy dialogues are poor filler substitutes. Third, this film had a great opportunity to further develop its characters but thanks to its rushed pace & more emphasis on over-the-top action over a riveting narration, we still have difficulty in recalling the correct names of all the Dwarfs.And that's not all. Martin Freeman is brilliant as Bilbo Baggins but his character is demoted into a secondary role for the centre stage is taken by Richard Armitage's Thorin. The remaining Dwarfs get only as much screen time as they did in the last chapter. Elves have never been as annoying as they are in this film for Legolas wasn't even needed in this adventure & Tauriel, who doesn't even exist in the novel but was created to bring a feminine energy to the series, is given a stupid love story to work with instead.At last, I would like to talk about Smaug. Exquisitely designed, remarkably portrayed & meticulously detailed, this splendid beast of CGI is a jaw-dropping wonder to look at & the painstaking work that went into bringing this magnificent dragon to life truly deserves a bow. But thanks to its inefficient handling by the filmmakers, the cunning, proud & intelligent dragon of the novel is turned into a foolish creature here which is a shame because Smaug could've been as memorable to this trilogy as Gollum was to The Lord of the Rings.On an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an emotionally unappealing but visually spectacular sequel which features a much more exciting, fiercely paced & action-packed entertainment that'll satisfy most filmgoers but for the devoted fans of Middle-Earth, it's a heartbreaking disappointment that adds even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of the most frustrating cliffhangers in cinema history, thus leaving the experience very much incomplete in the end.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

This is a fantasy genre masterpiece that is an absolute must see.,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the continued journey of our dwarf friends, an unlikely hobbit and Gandalf the wizard as they head to the mountain of the dwarf's former home. They will try to find the mountain pass, door and enter while knowing what's waiting for them inside is of course...a dragon. On their way they will be attacked by the creatures of Middle Earth and may have to rely on some unlikely friends on their journey.This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and stars Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Graham McTavish (Rambo), Martin Freeman (The World's End), Richard Armitage (Into the Storm) and Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean).The settings, attire, props and CGI in this are all perfect. The storyline is captivating and takes you deeper into the world of elves and men in Middle Earth which was fascinating. Every scene that involved both elves and dwarves were awesome. The river scene was tremendous and a lot of fun. Smaug is perfectly created in this, and his charm, wit and diabolical nature is perfectly depicted. Every scene in the gold room is outstanding. The ending was a perfect way to segue into the next film.Overall, the Hobbit films do not get the credit they deserve. This is a fantasy genre masterpiece that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this one. The first one was fair. There were problems, but all in all a good effort. This was the place where they would either bring it back or go completely in the wrong direction. Unfortunately, they went completely in the wrong direction. The Hobbit story is a good story. I read it when I was young and I know many others who did or at least tried as well. They only criticism I'd ever heard was that Tolkien could be a little dry. But it was a good story and there was no need to change it so drastically. I understand that they were trying to develop subplots in order to extend the story and stretch it into 3 movies, but please. I wonder if the people responsible for writing the screenplay ever actually read the book or just the Cliffs Notes version. If they had actually read the book, they would have seen that there was plenty of story there for 3 movies without ruining the story. But they didn't. So yes, they ruined the story. I don't post a lot of reviews, but in this case I couldn't resist. I guess we'll have to wait for someone else to come along perhaps 30 or 40 years from now to do it right. Until then we can watch the animated version and pretend this movie doesn't exist.I gave it a 6 because the visuals and effects were very cool. The dragon was great. 6 might be generous. I give it about a 4 for what they did to the story and 8 for visuals. The average is 6..",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Smaug rules, and the rest of the movie... is okay (thought I'd say 'drools' didn't ya)","Bilbo is supposedly the lynch-pin of this whole story - hell, it's called 'The Hobbit' after all, and it's about (as the song in the 1977 animated film starts, 'The greeeeatest adventurrrre') - but damn if you'd know it watching the majority of this entry. I say the 'majority' as he does show up in large part at the end, when it comes time to enter the castle in the mountains and the face-off against the dragon, Smaug, who has hoarded over the dwarfs' gold. But with the exception of a few scenes scattered about, it felt like there was a lack of Bilbo, which is a shame since Martin Freeman is so moving and funny and on-point in this role of the quirky 'straight-man' to these much quirkier, rambunctious dwarfs led by who is arguably the real protagonist - or co-protagonist - Thorin Oakensheild.Let's talk about that for a moment. For what he's asked to do, Richard Armitage isn't exactly bad in the role, not by a long-shot. He is there and present in this character if the hardcase leader of the dwarfs who has a rightful problem with his father, the former king of the dwarfs, being killed. He wants revenge and justice and so on, but the character just feels so flatly written and plain, somehow there was just a little more dimension with the Lord of the Rings trilogy's mirror character, Aragorn. Thorin comes into a scene and makes his declarations, which is what you do in a fantasy epic like this. But I never really felt for the character so strongly or his quest so much, despite the ending of the first film where there is something of an arc between him trusting Bilbo. Again, not a bad character, but something that I wish was a little more strongly written or played dimension-wise.Like the other two films in this unnecessary trilogy, there's padding. This is like looking at a nervous football player, loaded up so that he doesn't get pummeled. It's mainly in the inclusion of the elves, and an elf/dwarf romance that comes when the dwarfs are captured momentarily and the really handsome one and Evangeline Lilly's elf fall for one another. Oh, and Legolas returns and there's sort of a hint of a love triangle, because these epics need them nowadays. Not bad actors, once again, and Lilly has more than proved herself on Lost to be capable with a bad-ass action heroine as her character is here. But where's the purpose with the main story? There's no connective tissue with this, and just enough (though added not from the Hobbit but from appendices that Tolkien wrote - just that word 'appendices' like an organ you don't need) with Gandalf on his separate quest which will figure in to this whole SIX film epic at hand.There's enough well-filmed action and peril to keep things moving along not briskly, but in a manner that I at least didn't fall asleep... well, I did get annoyed by a barrel chase for technical reasons (sure, throw in a low-quality go-pro camera in the river chase while you're mostly using the highest-quality RED cameras, sure, why the hell not?) But, at least, the sequence with Smaug is perfect. It's a marvelous CGI creation that ironically brings back together from Sherlock Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who voices and also does the motion-capture work for the dragon of the title. This is a sequence fraught with tension, clever dialog (much of it with Bilbo's riddles, and this is very similar to the animated film by the way), and intense action and suspense. It's what one wants to see from one of these movies, with a dollop of humor as well.If only the rest of the film had that. Desolation of Smaug is a good movie, on the whole, but it's so uneven that it may frustrate those who aren't already super-psyched to return to Middle Earth anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) goes off to investigate the true enemy behind the looming threat.This is a good improvement over the first part. It is essentially one long road trip. There is no need for an introduction. There are several compelling action sequences. I especially like the barrel rides. Also there are a couple of good character sequences. Oakenshield and Tauriel have some good interactions and build up some good chemistry. Then Bilbo has some great funny moments with Smaug.

A clear step up from the first Hobbit.,"Let's get the best news out of the way: As a movie Desolation of Smaug is much better movie than the Unexpected Jourrney was. It moves well, pacing is great, acting is mostly great, special effects, especially Smaug, look mostly stunning and the music and the set are great as ever.And here's the but: it takes a lot of liberties with the story. A lot of the scenes in the movie have only bare bones resemblance with the book. This, however, isn't a surprise, as the first movie altered the narrative from the book quite a bit. So you either roll with it and are okay with the changes, or you cringe your teeth. I rolled with em', as the movie itself is good.Just like the first movie, I saw this one in HFR as well. I must say, that during the first film of the series I had some issues with the quality, but now it looks like most of the small issues have been cleaned aside.Like the Two Towers, Desolation of Smaug has no real ending. Afer all is said and done, the movie comes into sudden stop, where, I assume, the third, and the last, movie will continue straight on.DoS is very entertaining, well crafted movie. It is a step up from the first movie and allows to expect good things from the last movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The return of the darkness,"The first entry of The Hobbit trilogy was met with a mixed reaction by some, being too light, too comic and too long. The second film, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the shortest movie in the series, strives for a much darker tone and begins to weave many of the trilogies plot lines together.Thorin (Richard Armitage), Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the company of Dwarfs continuing their quest to The Lonely Mountain, in order to defeat the dragon Smaug (Bendict Cumberbatch) and reclaim the throne of Erebor. On their perilous journey through Mirkwood, the company end up clashing with the Elves, led by King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) of Lake-town. These two characters are but a few that hinder their journey before the final day of Autumn. A creature known as The Necromancer (also Cumberbatch) is summoning Orcs to the ruins of Dol Guldur, forcing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to also face the new threat.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a movie that contains sub-plots galore. Outside the main plot, involving the Dwarfs, Gandalf cleanses Dol Guldur, Thranduil attempts to shelter his people in his borders, the political rivalries between Bard and The Master of Lake-town (Stephen Fry), Bilbo suffering from the effects of The Ring, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), the Captain of the Thranduil, guards wanting the elves to face the Orc threat and a love triangle between Taureil, Thranduil's son Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Kili the dwarf (Aiden Turner). That a is a lot to handle even for a film that is 161 minutes long and for someone of Peter Jackson's previous experience in Middle Earth, some of the subplots get sidelined. The subplot involving Bilbo's corruption and hearing voices in his head is a presence at the beginning movie, but is ignored later on.The Hobbit is short novel and straight adaptation would have been a 2 hour, 30 minute movie. To add to the movie the screenplay supplement with the use of appendixes in The Lord of the Rings, some elements of the Unfinished Tales collection of short stories and the filmmakers own creative license. Tauriel is an original character created solely for the movie and Legolas had no role in the timeline. The events in Lake-town were also greatly altered from the original novel.Unlike previous entries in the Lord of the Rings series The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the first time we look at the North of Middle-Earth. The tensions and policies are explored and showing that the Elf kingdom is insular and does not want to get involved with the wider world and the people of Lake-town are divided. Anti-dwarf prejudice is touched on, as dwarfs are seem as greedy, selfish and short-sighted and only one level above Orcs.One of the big themes is greed and lust; both for wealth and power. There is physical manifestation with Bilbo starting to see himself and savagely killing a spider, the Master of Lake Town seeking wealth and power, leading to the mismanagement of the town, Smaug not wanting to give up any his ill gotten gains. Thorin also suffers from greed, which affect his judgement, his relationships with his comrades and is forewarned that he could end up like his grandfather.There is plenty of energy in the movie's action sequences, the highlight being the river chase as the Orcs, Dwarfs and Elves are in a battle, filled with decapitations and arrows to Orcs' heads. Both Legolas and Tauriel are given plenty of chances to show their action credentials, though since this is a prequel we know that Legolas is immune from any perky incidents like an axe to the head. The final battle with Smaug is also ramped up from the book, giving Bilbo and the Dwarfs a larger role.The first act and the third act are great with its pacing, action and character development. Its the middle of the movie that The Desolation of Smaug slows down, a little too much. This is the case of the events in Lake-town as the Dwarfs try to prepare for the final leg of their journey. It is at this point when Bilbo does not have much of a presence in his own movie.The Dwarfs are give more chance to shine this time role. In the first Hobbit movie, Ken Stott and James Nesbit were the Dwarfs with the most screen time: in the sequel Graham McTavish as Dwalin was more noticeable with his aggression, Kili is given a background and even the silent Bombur (Stephen Hunter) is shown to be very strong despite his weight problem.The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug will give fans their Middle-Earth and is successful at solving some of the issues of the first Hobbit movie. The tone is darker and the action is much less cartoony. The Hobbit is proof of being the pinnacle of the fantasy genre and this second film still proves that.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Low Expectations Helped Greatly,"After seeing the first part of THE HOBBIT I thought about catching the rest of the trilogy on DVD but having sometime off work and some money to spend I thought I'd treat myself to a visit to the cinema as a very special treat . I paid my money if only to escape the drudgery of a tough working week followed by a couple of lonely nights in my flat but didn't expect much from Peter Jackson whose creative stock seems to have utterly collapsed since RETURN OF THE KINGTo be fair Jackson has made a darker and much better paced film to the first instalment that often manages to disguise how over extended the narrative is . Instead of the painfully repetitive story structure of being captured , escaping , being captured , escaping for the entire movie we actually often have engaging storytelling . I've never read the source novel and Tolkien junkies might hate any embellishment brought to the silver screen but the quest aspects are well done for the most part . The production have now concentrated on making THE HOBBIT a proper prequel to LORD OF THE RINGS as the Necromancer's power starts expanding planning extermination for Middle Earth . This subplot is developed via dual plotting where Gandalf leaves Bilbo's entourage and finds himself in danger . Bilbo and his comrades find they have problems of their own with constant danger all around themThe problem these dangers are often undermined by the production team who concentrate on spectacle rather than developing drama . A good example is where Bilbo and the dwarfs are cocooned by giant spiders which is a terrifying fate but is totally undermined by the arachnids being killed far too easily . This happens several times throughout the set pieces in the film where the good guys constantly defeat the bad guys so easily the audience quickly lose any sense of danger and adventure being involved . There's also a bit too much of the laws of physics being constantly broken . For example a fireball in a confined space would burn up all the surrounding oxygen and anyone nearby would suffocate but this fact is ignored and other implausible things involving science don't make the slightest sense . I know this features in many fantasy films , not least the original LOTR trilogy but it's been done to death and is very distracting . Compare the spectacular set pieces seen here to the battle scene seen in the departure of Boromir in FELLOWSHIP and you'll notice how overblown everything is in comparison here .In summary this is fairly good film that is better than part one of THE HOBBIT . I say "" fairly good "" but when you compare it to LORD OF THE RINGS in general and FELLOWSHIP in particular ii is something of a backward step from the production team who brought us the original trilogy . That said I will probably pay money at the cinema to see the finale though more in hope rather than expectation",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Peter, Fran and Philippa's formula for adapting Tolkien's books","I saw the Hobbit DoS last night. Incredible movie! Very fast paced and action heavy, as I've come to expect.If I have one gripe it'd be that the action in the two latest hobbit films are too over the top crazy and unrealistic. The action in LOTR was grittier and felt more real, even though it was still fantasy. You actually felt like the characters could die or get seriously wounded in the fights. But in The Hobbit, everyone's just either super lucky or just god mode powerful. Someone mentioned it's like playing a video game on easy mode. LOTR is hard mode. I agree with that assessment. Still, the films are great fun and I found them very entertaining.Peter, Fran and Philippa tend to follow a predictable formula when adapting Tolkien's books:1. Cut out as much exposition as possible, and for the exposition that is necessary, tell it through flashbacks if time allows for it. Some Examples: -the intros to the movies are always flashbacks, and there are several flashbacks within the story. -the council of elrond is greatly shortened -lines of dialogue are always a lot more brief in the films than they are in the books: ""I am no man"" vs. ""But no mortal man am I, for you look upon a woman ...""2. If there are quiet moments in the book, cut it out, or greatly shorten it. Some Examples: -a lot of the down time at lake town, the elven king's halls, and Rivendell is shortened to the point where they seem more like very brief stays, rather than the weeks that were spent there in the books. -Nearly 20 years pass between Frodo receiving the ring from Bilbo, and him finally setting out on his journey in the books. In the film, it seems like it's the next day. -The scenes with Radagast, Gandalf and the white council investigating the necromancer of Dol Guldur, and the corruption of mirkwood occurs over the course of thousands of years in the books. In the film, it all seems to happen within the same week. -The time spent worrying about how much food they have, or how tired and hungry they are on the journey. Worrying about where they're going to sleep, and other serious problems that one would run into while going on a long journey. Bad guys trying to kill you aren't the only thing the dwarfs and bilbo had to worry about on their quest. -Journeys last months in the books, in the movies it feels like only a couple of weeks. -Moments of rest and peace, minor conversations, and minor character moments.3. Cut out anything that may seem a bit too goofy. Keep children storybook humor and whimsy to a minimum. Some Examples: -Tom Bombadil -The wacky way Gandalf introduces the dwarfs to Beorn -The anthropomorphic dogs and many of the talking animals (and wallets) -Many of the songs are cut.4. Greatly expand on any and all action that's presented in the book, even if it's just one sentence. Some Examples: -The sentence, ""They ran down the stairs and across the bridge."" is adapted to a major 15 minute action scene in FOTR when they're running from the Balrog -The expansion of Azog's role in the story (keeping him alive after Moria), as well as expanding Bolg's role. The orcs attack them much more often in the films than they do in the books. -They added a lot more action to the barrel riding scene than was in the books. -The confrontation of Thorin and the dwarfs against Smaug on the Lonely Mountain was a very brief passage in the book. In the film, it's nearly 45 minutes.5. Expand the roles of the female characters. -Arwen's role is much bigger in LOTR and she even replaces Glorfindel in her introduction. -Galadriel gets more screen time than she gets in the books, though her role in the story is true to the way Tolkien wrote it. -The Elf King's chief prison guard in The Hobbit was a nameless elf with a very small role, but in the film she's a female Sylvan Elf named Tauriel who has a much bigger role and even a romance subplot.The Extended cuts are paced more slowly, and are closer in feel to the books. A lot of the exposition and quiet character moments are put back in, as well as some of goofy humor and whimsical moments that may have been cut. The extended editions are how the films should truly be seen, IMO.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Couldn't ask for more!,"It really shocks me to read so many mediocre reviews.I think that once the third film is out, and they can all be watched in succession, people will start to fully appreciate the genius of these films.Being a big fan of Tolkien, and having read the book, I really can't imagine a better film being made. It stays pretty true to the book, and the areas where it doesn't, seem justified. Most notably, it varies from the book in the perception of time passing. In the book, everything takes forever. The whole journey takes years, and they stop for long periods of time at every location. In the movie, everything is fast paced and exciting and there is no lull. It feels like it all happens fairly quickly, in a period of a few months of something.I am also a big fan of Jackson's LOTR films, but I can honestly say, that I like the Hobbit films as much or more than LOTR. Elijah Wood in particular, but also Pip and Merry, always bothered me a bit. I think he is a great actor, but there is something about him that feels awkward to me. The actors in The Hobbit are all really great and well cast and I love watching them.The movies are long, with lots packed in, great production design, and lots to look at. This gives it great re-watch-ability, and, like LOTR, I can watch these movies over and over again without getting bored. In fact, I can't think of many other films that I can watch as many times as Peter Jackson films. LOTR, The Hobbit, and King Kong are all great movies to throw on at any time. I tend to put these movies on when I'm doing something else and tune in and out.I'm really excited for the fifth installment to come out, because I think they will all flow together very seamlessly as a whole.I feel that these movies will truly stand the test of time, and those who criticize them now will eventually come around and realize how great they are.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
That fixed it up good,"The fellowship continue to flee from Orcs, but have to venture alone into Mirkwood(aka, the LSD forest - great sequence, if one of the only two that the increased pace renders rushed through). Gandalf(McKellan, wise and somewhat on his own) has to investigate the land's growing evil. When the dwarfs are discovered by the area's Elven, some secretly disregard the king Thranduil's(Pace, carrying his force with tremendous dignity) orders to stay behind and not run risks. Captain of the guard Tauriel(Lilly, gorgeous and taking matters into her own hands), perhaps because of her growing feelings for Fili(O'Gorman, sympathetic, and still attracted to these tall, gracious beings). Speaking of romance, Legolas(Bloom, still spot-on as the determined prince) goes with her as he is in love with her - however, not to his knowledge, his father refuses him marrying outside of hierarchy.As this completes the transition into re-imagining(after the first was an adaptation with some added elements), it not only sets up the Lord of the Rings trilogy(serving as a prequel - and though this was not necessary, it is, in my opinion, quite welcome) much better than the original children's faerie tale did(or was ever intended to; for my money, this is much more enjoyable than its source, not feeling like it was made up as he went along, letting its theme of greed and selfishness being something that has to be overcome show more clearly through), it changes for the better pretty much the only things that the first one got wrong(not that I, personally, minded them). As such, the plot not only takes off immediately, it keeps moving throughout. The action never takes over. There are genuine consequences(power is corrupting... this is seen in our protagonists!), and rather than a series of unrelated events, this presents a definite chronology of events, with characters sticking around and being developed.The most compelling of these, without a doubt, is Bard(Evans, a courageous, loving father), who takes on many roles, living up to all of them. There is a change of the weighing of humor and darkness, now in favor of the latter. We now begin to feel that this is a dangerous endeavor, one that may claim the lives of some of them. While FX tend to be CGI over practical, this never gets lost in them. Reaction shots, use of perspective and other approaches are employed to ensure that. The High Frame Rate will take your eyes(and rest them before and after, this does strain them some - it's worth it) 15 minutes to adjust to - and then you'll literally believe you can reach out and touch what you witness. And even if you won't go with that, make sure to watch this in 3D. Few things poke out at you(meaning they never lose the effect), and it further improves the amazing atmosphere, where every location feels distinct, with temperature and scents seemingly affecting you in the cinema. The scope is shown well, you appreciate size differences.For those who wished they'd seen more of Smaug(Cumberbatch, making lines work when no one else could) in last year's film, this is for you. He doesn't show up for a while - trust me, you won't mind. We get such a satisfying taste of him, his massive physique, his danger, his manipulative nature. The cliffhanger ending does leave us hanging - excessively so. Dialog and acting are enthralling. Charm and mystery work well to draw us in, keeping each other in check so as to not let either overwhelm us. Bring your kids. Take your parents. There's something for everyone. This makes use of quick, loaded introductions - to people, places, beings, etc. Thus, a ton of detail and change can be implemented, making even the 160-ish minute running time packed with events. No, this is not An Unexpected Journey. That one set the scene. This? The real show. There are winks to those who've seen the previous trilogy already, and they are less on the nose. No one shows up to do nothing in this, we don't visit anywhere that nothing occurs in.There is a lot of mild to moderate violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy, drama and grandeur. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Its a tragedy that a film like this, made by so many hard working individuals with so much passion, can be criticized by so many idiots...","At what point have movies been designed to make you feel like crap? It's like a film is judged my how many medications you have to take afterwards. There are so many depressing, dull movies all clambering up the film critics' ugly little ties begging to be paid attention to that its nice to see a film that's actually made for the audiences. That's why I love the Desolation of Smaug. It's bright, fizzy, optimistic, passionate and very charming. It's also bolder and a little menacing with excellent pacing and the best CGI to date.

"Best CGI in film, yet poor dialogue and script.","""You have nice manners for a thief and a liar!""Peter Jackson's latest journey to Middle Earth was to explore Smaug and introduce the audience to the battle of the five armies that will ensue in the final film. We find Thorin Oakenshield being thrusted into leading his merry gang of dwarf's to the Lonely Mountain as Gandalf intends to inspect the happenings of Dol Gulder. This film more notably than other Jackson/Tolkien films is incredibly bloated and overindulgent, filled with multiple sub plots that create a relatively exhausting feeling. The new script for the penultimate movie was comprised with various new characters not mentioned in the original novel; this in my opinion created an unnecessary diversion to the traditional tale and therefore disrupted the enjoyment and naturalistic fluency of the story.'The Desolation of Smaug' once again possesses amazing scenery of New Zealand intertwined with the story accompanied with an immersive soundtrack composed by Howard Shore, the direction of these films never seizes to amaze as the primary story line is perfectly encapsulated and terrific casting options provide a sentimental and emotional substance to this fantasy epic. The film has a thoroughly tedious opening act but as the film establishes the antagonists and setting, it propels into an intensified ambiance unparalleled by many other films. The riddle in the dark sequence with Gollum and Bilbo was commendably the most memorable scene in the entire unexpected journey film, yet unfortunately Martin Freeman was arguably underused in this film. Bilbo shared another memorably extended scene with his encounter with Smaug which was a beautiful use of CGI and fantastically voiced over by Benedict Cumberbatch, the scarily deep and loud tone sends shivers down your spine whilst Bilbo's witty flattery to survive against this beast is a terrifically entertaining combination.The film tends to become host to some moronic and inane action sequences and experiences the occasional tasteless dialogue especially with the Elves and sub par delivery of key lines,it was rather disappointing from my perspective how the the characters had to continually rely on Legolas and Tauriel saving just in time and how these particular elves repetitively showed their skills monotonously. However the intended creative expansion on Bard the Bowman was impressive and Gollum not featuring in this movie was a somewhat substantial restraint given that Peter Jackson likes to connect and link all of his characters from his Middle Earth films. To witness the phenomenal spectacle Smaug makes up for the seemingly very long wait, despite his arguably disproportionate size in different shots it still compensates for the redundant sub- plots; for instance the love triangle between Kili, Tauriel and Legolas. I firmly believe that this tale would have been better as two, three hour movies rather than three, two and half movies. Problematic narrative flaws and raw characters wither the deep and passionate story of the dwarf's quest to Erebor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Another breathtaking addition to the Hobbit saga!,"There was quite a build-up for this movie, and also for the dragon Smaug. And Peter Jackson did NOT disappoint. The movie is everything any Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fans could ever want. More adventure, more action, more everything, only with the coolest dragon to ever hit the big screen. Or any screen. The tale of Bilbo Baggins continues as he ventures with his Dwarven companions to reclaim what was once theirs. There is plenty in this movie to satisfy anyone, even those who aren't die-hard Tolkien fans. Director Peter Jackson asked us to put faith in him, especially since he tends to go astray from the events in the book, but I must say that the faith his fans put in him has definitely paid off. The story is intriguing for all, and at the end will have you BURNING for more!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
'Hobbit' trilogy picks up steam with much more exhilarating part two,"For those not easily smitten by J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy tales, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was a substantial letdown from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films, and the thought of enduring another immensely long trilogy too much to bear. But even they'll agree with the biggest fans of ""An Unexpected Journey"" that part two, ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" shows substantial improvement over the first film.Foremost, the film benefits from needing little to no exposition. The suspense and action ratchets up quickly as Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the dwarfs, on their quest to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug, are still being pursued by a band of ruthless orcs led by Azog the Defiler at the behest of the frightening, amorphous Necromancer. They must journey through the cursed forest of Mirkwood, home of the wood-elves, up the river to Lake-town and across the lake to the Lonely Mountain where Smaug awaits.The action sequences alone prove ""Desolation"" a better film than ""Journey."" Nothing was really wrong with the first film, but the danger, excitement and creativity of ""Desolation"" simply trumps its predecessor. The return of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) along with his companion Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, who looks born to play an elf) brings with it the return of incredibly fluid, exciting and yes, perhaps even unrealistic fight choreography. Remember when Legolas took down an entire elephaunt in ""Return of the King"" in a brilliant sequence? The barrel escape on the river shows it up big time. Simply put, orcs are treated as deli meat in this movie.Aracnaphobes be warned: director Peter Jackson is relentless in the spider scenes in Mirkwood toward the beginning of the film and as for any dragon-phobes — yeah, you might want to walk out of the theater after the first two hours, because at that point begins the Smaug show. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers delicious vocals (as expected) playing the fearsome dragon, and the sheer scale of the climactic sequence inside the cavernous halls of the dwarf kingdom of Erebor doesn't disappoint.As was a noticeable challenge in ""An Unexpected Journey,"" the ""Desolation"" script contains even more filler and plot lines not in the book crafted from appendices than the first film. Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro generally make good use of this creative freedom by keeping the pace of the film up some parts of the movie, though excellently written and executed, go on a bit too long and provide little value outside of pure entertainment.Two-thirds of the way through this adventure, it has become clear that the themes of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy don't run nearly as deep as with ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and neither does the emotion. A subplot tries to create a love story between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel as a change-of-pace from the danger and fear (the film's primary and dominant emotion), but it just doesn't hit. Kili has nowhere near the same level of audience admiration as Legolas, whose legacy from ""Rings"" carries instantly over to this film and who seems an obvious match for Tauriel. Outward ploys to generate some emotion such as this, however, wouldn't be necessary if the same motifs that made ""Rings"" more than blockbuster (friendship, the struggle of being outside of one's comfort zone, the fear of failure) were a part of ""The Hobbit."" Freeman and Richard Armitage (Thorin) are true talents, but they can only go so far with this material. What ""Desolation"" makes up for in entertainment value from ""Journey,"" it loses in heart.Other casting decisions earn excellent marks among the film's new characters including Lilly and Cumberbatch. Lee Pace nails the elf aura as good as Cate Blanchett playing the elf-king Thranduil and Luke Evans makes a fine, likable hero out of Bard the Bowman, the man who harbors the company in Lake-town. Although his character is a waste, the delightful Stephen Fry is another good call as the master of Lake-town. And let us not forget old friends: Ian McKellan gets a good number of badass moments during Gandalf's side-journey.Anyone unsure which format to view the film in should consider that the last sequence with Smaug and a few others occur in somewhat dark locales. This is a significantly less than desirable situation for traditional 3D, because 3D already makes the frame seem darker. Those looking to upgrade from 2D should make the jump to HFR 3D, which despite its many critics, definitely has less motion blur and doesn't have the same issues with darkness.Jackson, of course, continues to marvel with his vision for Middle Earth. The design of the locales and the sets (the wood-elves' kingdom, Lake-town, Erebor) show a great deal of technical sophistication and more importantly, imagination. The places truly come to life in all these films, and with a sense of eye-opening grandeur. Sometimes it even borders on too big and magnificent.""The Desolation of Smaug"" definitely sets the stage for what will surely be another memorable conclusion in both excitement and scale. The film ends on much more of an unexpected cliffhanger than the first film and the first ""Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Two Towers"" definitely unwound in the end, as ominous as it still was, but ""Desolation"" will leave viewers with a sense that what they just saw will be like foreplay when they witness the conclusion.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Slice of Adventure,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues to tell JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit in this overly stretched adaptation. What makes this different from the last one is this one finally steps up to focus more on its true epic form and toning down its playful goofiness a little bit. We got a warm welcome before and now the tone has become much bombastic. And just like the last one; even though this is just a piece of a story, it's already a gigantic experience. But even with all of its rich characters, exciting action, and lengthy runtime, the audience would still beg for more. So this sequel is basically a big bite of a special meal that you've been eating since last year.They sure know how to turn these pieces into actual movies by extending the exposition, fan service, and action to stretch out the runtime. The pacing is now somewhat less slower and the flashbacks are fewer compared to the other. It's all fun to be honest, but knowing the fact that it's a split has always been a distraction, especially when this one has a remarkable focus on the main plot. At least An Unexpected Journey had a theme for the characters to appropriately make it a distinct single story. Here, there is little else to tell and have to really depend on the next part, which is why they had to add Elvish subplots, explore more stuff around the story, and find a way to tease the audience so they won't be left out hanging. It does have a good tease, but it's exasperating when it teases too much, because you'll have to realize that this film is just a huge chunk of the adventure that slightly end up anywhere.The direction remains the same, there's always a sense of doubt and fortitude on the fate of the main characters, which makes it very compelling. But it was the special effects that once again steals the show. The filmmakers seem to have fun playing with their technical abilities which is why the CGI continues to get excessive, but the Smaug dragon was the impressive standout that looks more threatening and terrifying than the Orcs, while the exteriors keep everything look grand and beautiful. The cast are still terrific and charismatic as ever.Bilbo's line, ""Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of your enormity"", is too the best way to sum up The Desolation of Smaug. The film is wide large tremendous, if not just a fragment of an adventure. Despite of the excess, its largeness actually made the film work, it was able keep it beyond entertaining. It's still not the best way to tell its story, because this is the point of the series when anyone can admittedly say an economical single film adaptation would be indeed a smarter move. But there's really no denying how fun it all turned out. The next part, There and Back Again, will definitely end up like the first two, and all we have to do is wait (again).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
In six words story is being stretched too much.,"For the People who have read my First hobbit review you may remember that I wasn't really positive about it and I called it a boring video game movie experience because of the CGI usage. So was this movie better?? Personally I think it is almost the same as it is very mediocre and if I have to be honest it may even be a little bit worse.The reason why I didn't like this movie is because it felt like it was a very thin story held together with a lot of filler materials. Because of this the movie's pacing suffered and the rewards didn't pay off. Even though the first movie had boring action it at least had some scenes to develop the story. In this movie most dialogue's veld like exposition followed by action scenes plus fan service. I always wondered how Peter Jackson intended to split one book into 3 movies. Well, by extending the basic story line and adding fillers.Without spoiling the movie I would like to say that the movie tried to follow a three act structure (beginning middle and end) but it really failed at the third act. The movie was more like a beginning and a very long middle.Some titbits Character development was decent but it wasn't really noteworthy.Music was okay but it failed at capturing the moment when I compare it to the lord trilogy or even hobbit one. And that is because of the movies pacing.Cinematography was much better than the first movie with more scenery/nature shots but there was still a lot of green screen.In the end the movie continued the story and it is already laying down the foundations for the next trilogy. I'll give this movie a 6.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Positively Wonderful,"Once again Peter Jackson makes Middle earth come to life in this fantastic and heart pounding installment of the series.Peter does not so much make the book into a movie, as much as he captures the spirit and depth of Tokeins world and play it through the adventure. The final product is so much more than the beloved children's book could ever be, and by the end the entire saga will seamlessly connect with LOTR.This installment builds on the first by fleshing out many of the dwarfs that were background addition in the first and the end result is a company the you care about and know.Oh, and I never laughed so hard in my freaking life.

The chill of ""Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold"" is now long gone, hobbit 2 is now just a hack and slash action movie, where you'll find yourself caring for nobody. The first movie was much better than this, which really had some emotional moments. Hobbit 2 destroyed even its predecessor. I earnestly hope Hobbit 3 keeps up with the spirit of the great Lord of the Rings. Middle earth is the land of dreams and fairy tales. Please let not ruin them with meaningless actions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"I have to warn you that I am a huge Tolkien fun, have read the books 3 times and seen the Lord of the Rings movies more times than i can remember. This movie was in one word disappointing, and this is not due to the fact that they have totally disregarded the actual book and invented entire piles of new (and often lame stuff). The hobbit is a children's story not meant to be epic or a 3 movie thing. A simple, relatively small movie would suffice. I would really like to see 3 epic movies from Peter Jackson on the SIlmarillion. The audience of the Hobbit seems to e targeted at 15 year old. It simply does not do justice to either the book or the Lord of the RIngs movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fiery second part to The Hobbit.,"Out of the frying pan into the fire. The Desolation of Smaug is visually fantastic. You get another great insight into Tolkien's world in is the second giving of The Hobbit. Peter Jackson directs and makes the world look amazing in 3D – don't forget to look out for Jackson's cameo at the beginning of the film.Although Legolas (Orlando Bloom) isn't in the book it doesn't change the original works for the worst, but for the better. Ian Mckellen as Gandalf plays the role at his best in this slice of Middle Earth. Even though the film gets darker as the dwarfs and burglar (Bilbo, Martin Freeman) delve into Erebor The Lonely Mountain, and Middle Earth begins to get darker The Desolation of Smaug still manages to keep a comedic tone just like An Unexpected Journey.A must see, and a great cliff-hanger, for those who have and haven't read the book. There and Back Again cannot come quick enough, I can't wait for to see how Jackson depicts Middle Earth on the big screen for the 6th time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Astonishing, beautiful & full of cleverness","Well I just came back from a screening and I still have goosebumps. The movie just blew my expectations!I followed the development of the movies very closely as I'm a big fan of the book and the LOTR trilogy. In the trailers I saw Legolas in 'what looked like' Laketown, orks attacking elves, gandalf in Dol Guldur... I was wondering, how will this all fit. How will Peter and his crew make this work, since those things don't happen in the book. I must say, they did it perfectly. The story and the twists are so good. They link everything well to each other and all makes sense.The pacing of the first half of the movie is very fast and the beauty of every single image is astonishing. You should definitely watch it in 3D HFR. The cinematography was perfect! There's just so much happening with the dwarfs and other creatures.The pacing of the second half of the movie is a bit slower but there are tons of 'WOW' or 'DID THAT JUST HAPPEN' moments. In this half the film deviates a lot from the book, but as a big fan of the book, I didn't mind at all. The changes all make sense and it made the film even better.The ending of the film is, in my opinion, perfect! I didn't expect it, but without giving it away, I think they made a good decision to end the second film at that certain point. It'll be good for the beginning of the third. It'll surely start with a bang!There's only one thing I wanted to see more of in this film, and that's Beorn. His appearance was too brief for such a wonderful character.My god, this film is soooo awesome! Go see it already!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Desolation Row,"After being carted away by ""The Eagles are Coming!"", our troop is still playing Hide and Seek with Azog's Orc-Pack.But we have to have a Flashback First. Once again we see Peter Jackson walking around Bree with a Carrot in his mouth. In ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" we met his daughter as one of the cute little Hobbit kids. This time, she is a ""Butterbur"" (The Ostlers of ""The Prancing Pony""), carting tankards of Ale to Thorin and Gandalf, one year earlier. Just look for the girl that looks like Peter Jackson. Here is talked about Thrain's Disappearance, Thorin's father- Who wielded the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings. As Gandalf tells Thorin, they would need a Burglar...Fade to Bilbo spying on Azog's pack, and he sees a huge Bear. Gandalf tells him this Bear might be an Ally, he will either help them - Or kill them.So they take refuge in a House, Gandalf not telling them it's The Bear's house, until The Bear is chasing them into it. The Bear is ""Beorn"" (Mikael Persbrandt), and it just so happens that he hates Orcs and Goblins more than Dwarfs - So they have a temporary Ally.This film had a lot of the things I was waiting to see, Mirkwood, The Spiders, and the Wood-Elves Kingdom. Lee Pace is Thranduil, Legolas' Father. It just makes Sense that Legolas is there, and if he were true to character, he would have helped the band of Dwarfs just like he helped Aragorn and Gimli. Peter Jackson creates a She-Elf out of thin- air, ""Tauriel"" (Evangeline Lilly) who is very Elf. I don't have any trouble with this either, she neither adds nor takes away anything, and gives us something very pretty to look at. But she only has eyes for Fili, much to Legolas' Chagrin.Since The Hobbit was written as if Bilbo wrote it, these little facts and characters didn't need to be written in, so it's up to us to fill in the blanks, with Jackson's help. And Tauriel is very much an Elf, displaying many of the powers that Arwen had.While the Dwarfs plus Bilbo get ""wrapped up"" in Mirkwood, Gandalf has to go to the High Fells of Rhudaur. This is part of the back-story of the Witch King of Angmar, the leader of the Ring-Wraiths.These two stories get told side-by-side for the rest of this film and beginning of the last, much the same way Lord of the Rings told up to five stories at once, we have the Orcs - Azog and Bolg, who is introduced here, summoning Azog to Dul Goldur. We have the Wood-Elves Kingdom, we have Laketown, and the bargeman Bard's (Luke Evans) relationship with the Master of Laketown, and his history, Evans also plays Bard's ancestor Girion, the archer who shot the Black Arrows at Smaug at Dale and missed, but in fact causing a chink in Smaug's armor, to be abused by Bard 60 years later. Laketown creates the opportunity for many characters and interactions to take shape.But mainly, the Dwarfs get to Erebor on Durin's Day, even though their party has been split up, Kili and some others left at Laketown, where Bolg attacks, giving Orlando Bloom the opportunity to be Action Hero again. It seems that Legolas has the Skill to kill Bolg (Lawrence Makaore, who was the Witch King in Return of the King), just not the luck to do it this time.We finally get to see the Whole Smaug this time, not just his nostril or eye. This is one of the best Dragons of Film, CGI or Not, almost as good as the Dragon from the early 80's film ""Dragonslayer"".Some of the interaction between Smaug and the Dwarfs is expanded a bit, but in the end, Smaug smells Laketown on Bilbo and flies off for retribution. But not before he gets to take a kind of Swim and gets a shiny new coat...If ""An Unexpected Journey"" hinted at many of the things to come, ""Desolation of Smaug"" gets into the details much more, further connecting this trilogy to the ""second"" one. In a way, I wish this trilogy had been made first, or that less time had been between the two. That way the reaction to this one would have been less jaded.When it comes to film, what do people want? Three more Expendables films? More Schwarzenegger films? I think this era's moviegoers, well they may be fine - But it is all of these Internet Eberts who create 50 IMDb accounts, just to try to scrag the ratings of one film, that ruin the enjoyment of the people who went to see it. And if you check the join date of every bad review or 1-star rating, you'll see it was ""One Day Ago"" - And I'll bet they pirated a copy of it just to watch it - If they watched it at all, which I doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A rollicking ride through the cinematic universe so greatly devised.,"Much like the second installment of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy 'The Two Towers' , 'The Desolation of Smaug' is quite easily the hardest segment of this colossal fantasy epic to bring forward to the big screen - advancing upon the first film whilst setting up the final chapter. Luckily Peter Jackson knows his vision of middle earth- the realm in which this film takes place - to such a degree that the production of this follow on prequel never does anything less than progress the already impressive first movie whilst wetting the appetite most definitely for 'There and Back Again' - the finale of this filmy journey. Larger, bolder and yet still easily seen as a Middle Earth movie, 'The Desolation of Smaug' does a hell of a lot right, thus cementing itself as one of the grandest sequels to hit cinema screens. Through a rollicking beginning, progressive middle and exciting finale this middle piece easily transports its audience to the centre of the action, therefore making the film feel engrossing throughout and fast paced. Peter Jackson, and his team, have done wonders with the source material - stretching the small classic novel over three movies without making the plot feel prolonged unnecessarily, by incorporating added depth found in the authors other notes.Following on from the first film, 'The Desolation of Smaug' once again follows the exploits of Bilbo Baggins, and his company of thirteen dwarfs. With the characters having already been established within the filmy universe, the second installment can not only progress via adding depth and tension to the storyline. This means that overall the film brings across a more mature feeling, and thus a heightened engrossment. However, to achieve this the film has to also progress the subject off its plot. With more characters, more action and more set ups, 'The Desolation of Smaug' does enlarge the already big first film in practically every way. This does bring the content of the film to another level of excitement when compared to the first - however some aspects of the storyline does seem to feel rushed still. Characters that appear prominent within the source material are not given enough screen time, with the focus more directed at the climatic showdown with the trilogies chief villains - of which there is two. This means that for all its grandeur, 'The Desolation of Smaug' will not convert Tolkien fanatics into liking the cinematic experience if the previous films were not to their idealistic depictions of the source material.To conclude, 'The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug' is another triumphant return to a filmy universe in which such acclaim has already been placed, and through this resurgence, interest has bloomed. Peter Jackson once again showcases the fact that come Middle Earth based film productions, he has no equal. A perfect companion to the other already released films, the second part of the second trilogy is a sheer masterclass in what a fantasy epic can become. Once again the film rests on the shoulders of its lead actors, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Ian McKellen and once again they succeed in doing the film justice. Much like Serkis in the previous film, Cumberbatch is a scene stealer that is completely villainous within his roles. Balancing the two villains whilst making each seem different, he once again showcases the immense talent that he holds. A key factor to a key cinematic brilliance, 'The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug' is a fast paced, epically interesting film that will leave you breathless.

"HOBBIT DOS: Desolation of the novel, yet feast upon CGI","Nothing short of a good visual treat with impressive movie set-design again from the director who brought one of the finest trilogy with the crew of over 800 in LOTR-ROTK. Initially it was said that Guillermo del Toro would direct this movie. But finally it came to Peter Jackson. A decent story, yet deviated too much from the novel and since its neither the first nor the final part of the trilogy, there ain't expectation of an ending to the story. There are too much action scenes and times I felt like the team aimed to show off their CGI stuffs and for the Video game consoles.My review for this movie is that it is adventurous with awesome camera work with CGI but too much deviated from the novel. My stars are just for the special effects and the actors and not for story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Possibly the best Middle-Earth film to date.,"I feel I need to start by saying I have not read The Hobbit, nor any of the Lord of the Rings books for that matter. I will not be discussing any aspect of the film in relation to the book. I have, however, seen all the Lord of the Rings films, and An Unexpected Journey in their theatrical and extended cuts. That being said, and having thought about this for a while, I can honestly sum up my feelings on The Desolation of Smaug in one sentence.I believe this is the greatest Middle-Earth film to date.I enjoy the Lord of the Rings films, my personal favorite being Return of the King. Largely because of the fact that Peter Jackson brilliantly brought the story to life in a way that felt like you were watching an dramatized account of long lost history rather than a fantasy story. However, I do believe that the films are, put simply, too long. The films aren't terribly consistent in terms of pacing, and there are some great moments in between what feels a little dull at times. They go from genuinely engaging to sometimes flat out boring very quickly, and repeat that cycle throughout the films. (And, no I don't mean solely elaborate fight scenes when I say engaging.) This was my major flaw with the trilogy.In 2012, when An Unexpected Journey was released, I went in with mixed feelings. After seeing it, I found it had the same problems mentioned above, but without much engaging scenes in between what felt like filler. The movie moves at an infuriatingly slow pace, and it could easily be half as long and still feel monotonous. Not to mention the fact that the entire film has an atmosphere of silliness, which makes it impossible, when the characters encounter actual danger, to feel any sense of concern for them. This set my expectations nice and low for The Desolation of Smaug, and I'm overjoyed to be dead wrong.The Desolation of Smaug is brilliant. There is one thing that separated it from all the films preceding it, and that is that the movie was NEVER dull. Having been introduced to all the characters in the first film, we return to the group continuing their quest toward the Lonely Mountain. The movie immediately gets going at a fast, thrilling pace, and just gets more and more engaging. The company comes across many obstacles, while still being pursued by the Orcs, minions of the Necromancer (whose presence much more evident in this installment). But the film reaches its climax the second that Smaug the dragon appears on screen, who, voiced magnificently by Benedict Cumberbatch, is easily the best and most terrifying part of the film. The film ended wonderfully in such a way that screams ""the best has yet to come"". This movie is an all together thrilling experience from start to finish, and for the first time in this series, it earns every second of it's running time. I won't go into detail plot-wise, to avoid spoilers, but I have nothing but praise for this movie and urge you to see this at your nearest IMAX as soon as humanly possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Disappointed, but not overly so","The Desolation of Smaug is not a bad movie and will certainly find its audience. But where I found the first movie to be refreshingly entertaining, because it took time to tell the tale of the dwarfs' undertaking, this second movie brought back everything I didn't like from the original trilogy. Legolas surfing on a shield on the stairs of Helm's Deep or on an Oliphant's trunk. I found these over-the-top action scenes childish and unfit for otherwise really great movies.However, in this movie, there was simply too much of it. Peter Jackson's decision of bringing Legolas and Tauriel into play is not bad per se. But when these two characters add nothing to the story other than showing at least a hundred creative ways of how to penetrate orcish skulls, I could not help but silently pray for these scenes to just go away. It seemed that Legolas actually lost a lot of skill in the time between the Hobbit storyline and the Lord of the Rings story, because if he had kept up the same dead-orcs-per-minute rate, Gimli and the rest of the fellowship would have had a quiet vacation trip with Legolas enjoying his Orc genocide.Which is disappointing, because Bilbo's and Gandalf's performances are just as one would expect: absolutely fabulous. Smaug is a beautiful creation of modern CGI technology. I really enjoyed the movie's more silent minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another enthralling adventure in Tolkien's epic saga.,"Over a decade ago, J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy story, ""The Lord of the Rings"", was brought to life on the big screen in grand fashion. The prequel book, The Hobbit, was later awarded with a movie trilogy of its own. With part 1 of The Hobbit trilogy, ""An Unexpected Journey"", a year in the past, we now look to part 2, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", which is bigger and better than its predecessor in practically every way.The story once again follows the continuing quest of the Company of Dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey to reclaim their homeland of Erebor from the mighty dragon Smaug. Fans who have read The Hobbit book might not be too surprised at how the movie unfolds, however, its the way that the movie unfolds that is something to marvel at. The Desolation of Smaug swiftly and beautifully delivers high-octane action sequences supplemented by gorgeous CGI and a higher frame rate than its predecessor throughout the entire film, and with rock solid pacing, the action doesn't overwhelm the film while still delivering plenty of exciting action scenes. The dragon Smaug himself is a excellently created mythical beast, who is a joy to watch on screen. The world of Middle-Earth is a vast and adventurous land filled with numerous mystical creatures and races, both beautiful and dangerous and the film does a terrific job in bringing this great world to life. The Desolation of Smaug doesn't hesitate to pull your mind into its fiction, and when you let your imagination dive into the movie, it becomes a world of wonders that delivers spectacle by the ton.The Lord of the Rings movies quite possibly wouldn't have been what they were without the direction of visionary Peter Jackson. It was critical that Jackson returned to direct The Hobbit trilogy, and after a solid first movie, Jackson has heightened the level of the playing field to create a second part which leaves you even more excited for the conclusion. It's pleasing to see a filmmaker this in love with storytelling, this committed to creating entire worlds. That's a rare thing indeed, and for it to turn out so well is even more rare. It's a sight to behold, and The Desolation of Smaug benefits enormously from his stellar direction. This film is bigger, darker and deeper than the first, and more emotionally engaging with a great set of characters filling out the stunning world around them. Bravo Mr. Jackson, here's to an even better third act.The vast majority of the cast from the first film return for part 2, and again do a wonderful job. Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, and Richard Armitage lead the way as Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin respectively, and each of their characters are interesting in their own way. Orlando Bloom carries a heavy load of action as the Elven Prince Legolas, and he is a blast to watch as he mows down enemies. The fierce dragon Smaug, a computer generated masterpiece, is voiced and motion captured by Benedict Cumberbatch, and his performance is stellar. Smaug very well could be the best character in the film, striking a sense of fear and fantasy into the viewer's heart. The Company of Dwarfs are fun to watch and provide some laughs along the way as well. All together, the cast of characters are interesting and well rounded, giving Middle-Earth the occupants it deserves.The only negatives the movie suffers from is a fair lack of dedication to the source material, something some fans might be even more displeased with, but I found the way the story was told to be a wonderfully penned vision and a success as a whole. One other thing was that our favorite hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, was shorted the screen time he needed to further progress his character. A little more of Bilbo, and Gandalf, would have been nice, but this doesn't hurt the film in any major way.Now to wrap everything up. If The Desolation of Smaug did one thing, it was being better than its predecessor on nearly every front. The action was thrilling, the CGI and frame rate were top notch, the cast was awesome at portraying our lovable characters, both good and evil, and director Peter Jackson once again proves he's one of the greatest directors in Hollywood with his passion for storytelling and creating yet another grand trilogy set in the beautifully dangerous Middle-Earth. The Desolation of Smaug has raised the bar for the entire Hobbit trilogy, and with part 3, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"", set for a December 2014 release, we're not too far away from the conclusion of another enthralling adventure.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm sure fans of this series will really enjoy this but I had a hard time getting into it. I'm not a Tolkein fan though,"""You've changed Bilbo Baggins. You're not the same hobbit as the one who left the Shire."" After making it through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo (Freeman) and company must now make it through the dangerous Mirkwood Forest, this time without the help of Gandalf (Mckellen). When they arrive at the Laketown settlement Bilbo is told how to fulfill his dwarven contract. He must retrieve an artifact guarded by the deadly dragon Smaug. I will begin by saying that I was not a fan of the original Lord Of The Rings movies but did think the first Hobbit movie was good. I have just never really been of fan of the books or the movies so that will weigh into my judgment. That said I thought the last half hour of this one was exciting but up until then I found it much harder to get into then I did with the first Hobbit. I'm not sure why but historically the 2nd movie in a trilogy is usually the weakest one (Empire Strikes Back is the exception). I'm sure fans of this series will really enjoy this but I had a hard time getting into it. I am looking forward to the third one though due to the way this one ended and that I thought the Return Of The King was the best in the original trilogy. Overall, fans of the series will like this way more then I did, at least I think they will. I give this a B.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Lackluster and Frankly A CGI Mess,"Another long journey that pretty much delivers exactly what is expected of it. Frankly, I found that to be mostly a bore. The film has some nice action moments but too much of it felt like bad CGI. What could only be called the super powers displayed by the elves as they slaughter orges left and right actually pulled me out of the movie. It really gave off a video game vibe to me. Also, the chapter feel has grown tired because yet again they don't end the film but rather set up the finale. Despite the large budget, this effort felt very lackluster and I really did expect better. This coming from a fan of the trilogy. I really lowered my expectations after the first effort but this continuation is just more of the same but at a limper ratio.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The best Hobbit film, and a must see","After watching various impressive trailers of the film, I expected great things from The Desolation of Smaug. And I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.This second film offers more thrills and adventure, and doesn't have the hour long intro. The action is intense right from the start and is paced brilliantly with dramatic scenes scattered throughout the 2 and a half hours running time; not impeding the progress of the story or the other segments of the film, instead, funnels it on – in exciting ways. But it doesn't just jump into them: the transitions between scenes work brilliantly with the superb cinematography — and often the patented sweeping long shots, which show off the spectacular places in which the film takes place perfectly. It's pretty much down to good directing by Peter Jackson.And, yes! The sets and all that! They were perfect. Mirkwood was Perfect. Lake-town was Perfect. And the lonely mountain itself? Perfect. And then there's the sound, and that's also fantastic.The story flows fantastically with some great character development of characters that were very much side-lined in the first film: like Kili – with his interesting romantic side plot with Tauriel, a female elf, who seems a great addition to the film. However, some of the dwarfs were still left untouched in that department, just travelling with the rest of them, not really doing or saying anything of interest. Nevertheless, as a unit, the development is interesting: especially in the dragon scenes towards the end, where they act as heroes instead of the bumbling idiots they were portrayed as in the first film. But I'm not saying that was a bad thing given the slightly more comedic feel to the first film, I'm saying it's a good thing that they were not portrayed as 'bumbling idiots' in the second film because of the more melodramatic atmosphere it has.Most characters were portrayed brilliantly with great and expressive acting, for the most part keeping the characters true to the book (but tweaked when they needed to be). One actor that particularly stood out was, of course, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins; alongside Ian Mckellen, Orlando Bloom and Luke Evans. Also, Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin was especially good, on par with Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn – which is a pretty impressive feet. But these performances all paled in significance to Benedict Cumberbatch's incredible voice acting as Smaug. It was brilliantly expressive and stylized, and fit my favourite dragon perfectly, giving him an additional menacing air. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about it; it's truly awesome. Smaug really does steal the show; well, you'd want him to when he's the main advertising point of the film, in its title and the main focus of the film when it gets into the last hour and a half. Anyway! Benedict Cumberbatch, although I hate to say it, may well deserve the hype he gets (based on this performance, anyway).Furthermore, Luke Evans is fantastic as Bard: who is a fantastic character himself. Also, Steven Fry's appearance is completely fitting, giving his character's situation.Aside from the characters and their portrayals; the visuals and the 3D of the film were nothing short of spectacular – some aspects even impressing me more than Gravity (and that was impressive!). Although, the CGI was a little overused at various points where models would have possibly served as the better choice – of course considering whether the use of models is realistic. The Lord of the Rings seemed to do a good job with it, anyway.Of course you're wondering: did it drag with its length like the first one? Well, it is a similarly long film, but doesn't really feel like it is; because of the stimulating action throughout and its fantastic pacing. So, yeah, it doesn't drag at all.This film is obviously trying to be as good as The Lord of the Rings, and it is so agonizingly close to doing it; but that isn't the way I want to think about it, because no film in my mind can quite live up to the perfection of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But this Hobbit film is pretty damn incredible.PS. The best parts of the film are in Mirkwood and scenes towards the end involving Smaug.Verdict:In The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug, Smaug is the centerpiece of what is a fantastic thrill ride, with the perfect blend of action and narrative paced perfectly, helped by some superb acting and amazing cinematography. The only thing inherently wrong with this film I can think of is that it has a tad too much CGI; but, what the hell: it's a must see and definitely the best Hobbit film.So I give it: 96/100.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Questionable content, but the production values save a lot","I honestly and truly love The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Peter Jackson was a miracle director that suddenly appeared to our collective consciousness and somehow managed to film three films that were pretty much all we had ever wanted from LotR films. All the characters felt just right, the visuals were absolutely gorgeous and Jackson had this gift for selecting just the right scenes and filming them in just the right way so that the films, long as though they were, never felt like they were either too long-winded or too hasty in order to cover more ground quickly. Of course not every decision Jackson made was the right call and there were some things that could have been done better, but as a whole they earned all the hype they received.Alas, it would seem that Jackson cannot repeat this feat a second time. The first Hobbit film wasn't yet so bad. True, the tone was at the same too goofy to function as a proper prequel to the LotR films, yet it was too dark for it really feel like they were adapting a children's book to the silver screen. Jackson tried for the middle road and in the process didn't fully please either of the camps. This same problem continues in the second Hobbit film, in which all of Jackson's worst tendencies from the previous films come back with vengeance. The adoration of elves above all else (I'm looking at you Legolas), his disdain for dwarfs (they're more than comic reliefs, you know) and overly choreographed fight scenes (there's really no tension in it when your first reaction is to laugh at just how absurd some of the fight moves are). And this time Jackson even covers some new ground by starting to skip over certain scenes that all fans had been waiting for in order for him to add in new non-canon content that wasn't wanted or needed. Admittedly some of it works, like the upgrade to the legend of Black Arrow, but some of it falls flat instantly, like the weird romance between an elf and a dwarf. I would have much preferred to spend more time with Beorn instead of spending a single minute with that study in awkwardness.All that being said, I still can't deny that I didn't enjoy the heck out of this film. Most of the cast is still rock solid (McKellen, Freeman, Armitage are especially delightful to watch), the visuals are at worst just merely beautiful and at best they're mind-blowingly gorgeous. I was somewhat dreading the introduction of Smaug in this film, but he turned out okay. Not sure I understand why they with a wyvern-style design for him when the original Smaug in Tolkien's drawings clearly isn't one, but that's me nitpicking.Furthermore, the action scenes, while more than a bit silly and non-threatening, do look nice and are pleasant to follow. And as stated, some of the new additions are genuinely interesting and patch up some of the inconsistencies and flights of fantasy of the original book. It's a shame that we have to take all these good inventions with the bad ones.Is it worth watching? If you've liked the films so far, then sure, you'll get your fix of Middle-Earth from this. If you were dissatisfied with the first Hobbit film, this isn't going to change your mind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
can't wait for the next film!,"I really enjoyed the first Hobbit film, and I was not disappointed by the second. This Hobbit film is darker than the first one, with the darker story, visit fights and even the desolate grayscale color scheme. The story drags on a little in the beginning, and I wondered where the magnificent scenes are. When the gang finally arrive at the mountain, I was completely blown away by the amazing visuals of the Dragon and its flames. The ending finale is a series of wows, as the flames, and the color change of the Dragon is very impressive. The ending elicited another wow from me, as it is so abrupt. I really thought and wish there was more after the ending. Do I really have to wait a year or two to find out what happens after?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The second one is the best one out of the Hobbit movies,"(2013) The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug
FANTASY/ ACTION ADVENTURESomeone once remarked that this movie contains the most realistic dragon he had ever saw from a movie, and I just had to check it out for myself since I've seen other movies with dragons in them such as ""Dragon Slayer"", ""Dragon Heart"", and just recently I think on one of 'the Chronicles of Narnia' movies, and I just have to say that this guy is probably right. For the dragon shown on this film is a reminiscent of a dragon I saw before used as a front cover of a Harper's book called ""The Hobbit"" and that was only a drawing for director Peter Jackson turned it into a reality. If there's anyone today that's better at using special effects, I would have to give the honors to Peter Jackson which I remembered a quote from another director who once said that if viewers can't tell if it's CGI then it obviously means that it has already done his job correctly since I as a viewer at times have to second guess whether or not what I'm looking at on screen is indeed CGI or is it really happening. On the first movie ""An Unexpected journey"", has Gandalf(Ian McKellen) leading and guiding a group of husky dwarfs to an adventure who usually have to get them out of a jam constantly, and it was becoming very repetitively tiresome. I was like 'can't these dwarves who have swords as well do anything for themselves without having Gandalf to save them'. And then, it was a relief to see Gandalf, the Grey didn't have to save these dwarves anymore. This time around, Gandalf the wizard leaves them to continue their journey on their own with a meeting place. In this one, they take Bilbo (Martin Freeman) along with them who got these very same dwarves out of two jams, but it was ironically from the help of a ring that was supposed to be destroyed since he never would've been able to do had he not have worn the ring at all. Viewers already expect that the dwarves were going to travel far, but through what obstacles. The giant spiders was interesting and then to confront the dragon later was even better leading to viewers wanting to see the third.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Oscar?,"Another triumph for Peter Jackson. Like many people I questioned the wisdom of splitting this book into three parts. It smacked of profiteering from the franchise. However, having seen all three parts, I can't see how he could have done anything else. This final part is exciting and moves along at such a pace that I couldn't believe the time had passed so quickly. I won't go into the plot but suffice to say there are shocks along the way so don't expect everything to end happily. The battle scenes are as usual breathtaking - however I will have to watch again to fully understand who is fighting who. Nonetheless it is very exciting. Full marks to Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman for their acting but it is the blend of different characters that really make this film. I'll be the first in line for the box set!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Although better, still room for improvement","The internal debate. When disappointed by the initial instalment of a trilogy, do you bite the bullet and give the second part a chance or steer clear to avoid further upset? I believe that in most cases, if you truly strive to enjoy a series then the former seems the obvious choice. Going in with poor expectations occasionally causes the viewer to dissect the following film. On another occasion, the bar is set so low that you are unable to be anything other than pleasantly surprised.When The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released, I left my local multiplex completely underwhelmed. With almost a decade between The Return of the King and the initial prequel, I contemplated whether my tastes had simply changed in the passing time. Prior to Middle Earths resurgence on the big screen, HBO made a sizeable impact on the small screen with Game Of Thrones which offered a darker, more adult alternative to the fantasy epic genre. Where Jackson's envisioning of Tolkien's Middle Earth were condensed into three hour films, the television adaption of George R.R Martin's book saga was debuted weekly, allowing a higher threshold of character development without glancing over certain plot points.Regardless of these factors, surely the familiarity of such beautiful compositions as 'Concerning Hobbits' should have rekindled my past love for the franchise in those opening moments? It did, however the remainder of the film felt much different. Whilst the soundtrack felt familiar, including the new addition of the song of the 'Misty Mountains', the overall tone never seemed to reach a consistent note. Personally, it felt more akin to The Chronicles of Narnia adaptions than the previous Lord of the Rings trilogy with it's needless use of child orientated humour. Additionally, the creatures seemed to be heavily influenced by the input of Guillermo Del Toro with the Orcs taking a slightly contrasting appearance. Their presence moved further away from the more menacing, prosthetics based entities I had come to both respect and fear in my youth to a more CGI centric being.The Desolation of Smaug is a much leaner, more refined continuation of the Hobbit storyline. Having already established all of the characters, the momentum is able to build at a faster pace without repeated introductions, moving swiftly between each set piece,from a conflict with a cluster of giant spiders to the groundbreaking encounter with the dragon, Smaug which showcases some of the finest CGI I have seen. On the contrary I felt that, excluding these two action sequences, the remainder of the effects were rather flawed as though they had spent all of their efforts on those key scenes. The rest of the film is weighed down by a comparatively horrendous usage of green-screens which will accelerate the ageing of the instalment in years to come.Nevertheless, a balance between action and the progression of the cast seems out of reach. Perhaps prolonging the length of one book into a trilogy is the root of this problem with a limited amount of plot to cover. Some conflicts seem to border on filler and I felt there was a lack of conversation on some part amidst the hordes of Orcs although it did distinguish more defined combat styles. The Mongol-esque dismemberment of a spider by the Dwarfs and the graceful, honed battle skills of the Elves as they seemingly dance between their foes. The camaraderie feels less apparent than in the first trilogy and the lack of any fatalities to the company removes you from the same sense of danger that previous instalments emitted with Legolas or Tauriel rescuing our protagonists from any impending tragedies.Overall it was an enjoyable film, I just deem it lacks some of what I once felt was a more substantial part of the franchise and the essence of The Lord of the Rings; such as the emphasis on friendship and the adventurers persevering through hardships. On the other hand it did capture the undertone of how overpowering desires and obsessions can really contribute to someone's downfall. Despite some of the negativity within this review this sequel was a vast improvement full of excitement and ambition ensuring that it leaves viewers craving the conclusion to the Unexpected Journey.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Far over the Misty Mountains' rise...,"Although some fans of the Tolkien books have had mixed feelings regarding additional scenes and characters, I personally found this to be a non-issue. That disclaimer aside, this movie is the best I have seen in a year, and worth the year-long wait. IMAX 3D (if you don't mind forking over the extra cash, but it is surely worth it) brings the visual depth and storied richness of Middle Earth truly alive, and immersive like a tidal wave. The acting is cathartic, and Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch of Star Trek: Into Darkness fame) is beyond brilliant. All throughout the experience, I felt like I was on vacation; I didn't want the ride to end! You know a film is compellingly good when the film moments keep replaying in your mind for hours or even days after the end credits roll. If you are a fan of Tolkien, you will be entertained at the very least. If you are a fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings iteration, then you will get twenty times your fix. But if you are a fan of really good film - thoughtful dialogue, beautiful storytelling, spot-on cinematography, charismatic characters, amazingly brilliant action and choreography - this Christmas has just come early for each and every one of you.

What's wrong with this picture?,"Let me first say, I was a big fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' while growing up, and have overall enjoyed the movie versions. A few things have bothered me though. I noticed these things starting with 'The Return of the King':1. Why is every battle scene a handful or few versus and endless number of enemies? I feel like I'm watching a video game and not a movie. Can't it be just a little more realistic? Maybe a few versus a few more?2. Why do most of the Dwarfs, Hobbits, Elves, etc have capped teeth?3. Why does the new female character have Hollywood lips?

disappointing,"This movie is OK if you like 2 hr 40 min of sturm and drang. Scenery and special effects are good, and the movie is visually appealing. Much of the action was clearly driven by the 3-D format. However, any resemblance to the book is superficial at best. In essence, the title has been grafted onto a mostly different story. Anyone expecting a faithful recounting will be sorely disappointed. Based on the examples so far, it must be almost impossible to write a screenplay accurately derived from Tolkien's stories, or one that captures their grace and lyrical charm. Though this series of movies has been a modest commercial success, I suspect Tolkien would be aghast at Peter Jackson's work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Peter Jackson Returns to Form!,"The second installment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit adaptation is an immense improvement on the first, which (especially in the Extended Edition) is an excellent film, but falls far short of the historic brilliance of his LOTR. The biggest challenge facing Jackson and his fellow screenwriters in the entire adaptation was turning Bard into a full character worthy of Tolkien, and they have done so spectacularly well. A less obvious challenge was the fleshing out of the Elven King Thranduil (Legolas' father), and that's superb, too. The invented character of Tauriel doesn't have nearly the depth of those two, but she serves her plot purpose very well and is a treat to watch.Unlike the first movie, which simplified and dumbed down the back-story of the Dwarf and Goblin / Orc War for no good reason, the changes to the story here are nearly all well thought-through, and some are so smart that Tolkien himself might have applauded (e.g., what they've done with the moon rune inscription). There's a sequence from the back-story that has been moved into the time frame of this film that's just stunning. The relentless pursuit by Orcs that I thought marred the first film (too much, too soon) here feels organic. The result of all these smart decisions is a film that, much more than Part 1, feels like part of the same Middle Earth epic as the classic LOTR.Needless to say, the film is a technical marvel (although I don't think the 3D adds much), featuring some of the best action sequences of any of the films, and -- are you surprised? -- Best.

Improves on the book far better than the first part,"In my younger and more patient years I read The Hobbit and LOTR. I always loved the universe Tolkien created; but never considered the books truly entertainment In fact, after re-reading The Hobbit recently; I found it disorganized. This was really a tale for her children and the book looks like that. Enters Jackson who made a masterpiece of LOTR. He deserves all the praise; but he worked with very good material; which is not the case here. The book is underdeveloped. The quest is interesting; but there are many characters without any personality; and the way the events are resolved is not that interesting. In a decision I applauded; Jackson altered the book adding events and characters and resolving situations in more dramatic, dynamic way. The timid adjustments on the first movie made it just OK, This time; he free himself and the longer the movie is twice the fun and without really breaching from the book. ( I still do not see the point of Evangeline Lili's Turiel but she is involved in several action scenes and is always charming ). In terms of effects and action the movie supersede any action blockbuster since LOTR. The Dragon sequence is outstanding; but there are others on almost the same level. There are also several ""human"" situations that flesh out what otherwise could be taken as a total fantasy. In brief; clocking on two hours and forty minutes; do not miss it in cinemas and try to see it 3D since this movie really deserves that treatment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Epic,"The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug came to theaters a year after it's predecessor, but after the long wait, it truly delivers.Directed by the legend, Peter Jackson, The Desolation of Smaug is much better than the previous one, and much more visually stunning. Jackson's directing is better than ever, we see epic fight scenes, amazing camera angles and I loved the detail in his directing.The writing is amazing, I have read the book and when they announced that the hobbit will be a trilogy, I was worried, but they got it right, although a lot of things were added and some things were changed all was for the better and every element in the writing seemed to make the movie much more epic!I must say that I wasn't very happy with the soundtrack in this movie, unlike it's predecessor and TLOTR trilogy it does not offer the epic music that I would expect from a Peter Jackson film. Another thing that I was not very happy about was Legolas's make up it just seemed too much, almost like he was animated.The acting in the hobbit 2 is great I loved Lee Pace as Thranduil, for some reason i compared him with Loki, and he was a lot better!

The Desolation of Fantasy,"This movie is about what I expected it to be. Aside from the plot and scene padding with questionably added characters, the use of High Frame Rate/3D technology gave the movie an eerie realism and starkness that took a while to digest. It had the look and feel of a reality TV show, which was fine, except when the CGI figures appeared. They weren't as real and it muddled the whole experience and ruined the fantasy illusion for me. This is the first movie I've seen that is truly immersive and I'm not sure I like being right in the middle of the action. That said, I tried to view it on its terms instead of holding on to my expectations.I read the book many years ago and don't have a problem with the whole ""Jumping off point"" approach, but what is lost here is something every good director and author knows. Good storytelling is lean, efficient, and concise, not ponderous, overly detailed, and (dare I say it?) bloated. There simply isn't enough engagement or grandeur here to justify a telling lasting nine hours. LOTR was different. Three books/three movies was appropriate because they were dense stories. This story isn't and I found myself asking, ""what did that scene have to do with anything? It wasn't in the book and it wasn't really necessary."" On the whole, ""the Desolation of Smaug"" suffers from the cinematic equivalent of TMI. With so many added players, individual character development was sorely lacking. ""What was his/her name again?"" is not a question one should ask.Since I don't believe in plot-spoilers, I can only say that the film also exhibits the risky pitfall of having multiple villains who don't seem to be aware of each other. I'm reminded of the Chinese aphorism about the fallacy of chasing two rabbits.If you've invested your movie-going interest in the first Hobbit movie and you're a Tolkein fan, I'd say go ahead and see this film. It isn't going to offend you but it may tax your backside. You're supposed to like sitting there for three hours, right? If you're into cutting-edge filmmaking and love gratuitous CGI and jaw-dropping visuals at the expense of expert pacing, knock yourself out.To plagiarize a 19th century Richard Wagner opera reviewer, ""At 7pm I began to watch 'The Desolation of Smaug.'

"Light Entertainment, Laid on Thick","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is an okay movie, some nice fantastical elements, quite overlong, but provides great escapism. It is held back from greatness by wrapping its story around arguably the most pointless trilogy ever manufactured by large scale cinema and comfortably dawdling in the shadow of another great franchise it should only occasionally pay homage to.Before I continue I will say that the only Middle earth lore that I have read is the prologue ""Concerning Hobbits, and other matters"" from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I am strictly a film fan of the series, and my opinion of watching ""The Journey Begins"" was that it felt like a bit of a drag. Going into this installment knowing that the four screenwriters had written some original material outside of Tolkien's novels to go along with the movie got me a bit excited. I have to say I was a bit let down, it seemed like the filmmakers weren't really challenging themselves here.Getting my general complaint out of the way quickly is that at this point the series feels formulaic. — ""Where's Bilbo?"" Bilbo shows up, demonstrates courage, saves the day, cue Howard Shore's gently uplifting recycled Oscar winning score. None of the die-hard fans or at least the kind that represents the vocal minority on the internet seem to really be bothered by the way in which this adaptation is being treated into 3 somewhat-mediocre films rather than a singular focused masterpiece, and I don't blame them for wanting to stay in this richly drawn world for as long as possible, but for the filmmakers who are even fans themselves, I would ask for more quality over quantity.Here is Warner Brothers, sitting on a pile of money.My older brother pointed out to me once while watching ""King Kong"" that he thought director Peter Jackson seemed to rely a bit too much on CGI. I for one here would initially think that with ""The Hobbit"" aimed towards a less gritty adult style than ""Lord of the Rings"", the CGI would serve the lighter tone of the film better, but in the manner it's done here it comes across as lazy and inconsistent, with occasionally sub-par CGI used on some orcs (or parts of them) and not others it serves as a distraction.Speaking of distractions every single callback to the ""The Lord of the Rings"" that lasts more than a few seconds ruins the pacing and tone of the movie by getting in the way of the main plot, which I'm aware of but not quite as clear as I should be on. Fan-service doesn't serve a film very well when you refer to a brewing yet rather unrelated conflict that the audience knows was already solved in another film series a decade ago next Tuesday. Funnily enough for some reason, I didn't think the time-keeping in Middle Earth followed the Gregorian calendar.The screenplay for the film is a slight weak point, as it takes its time understandably it doesn't develop the dwarfs in any interesting or compelling way to justify its running time. There are sparks of interest that lie in each of the supporting characters but it is left at that. For Tolkien fans I suppose that'll do, since I imagine what was or was not presented in books was properly left to the imagination, but here much of what is feels like a waste or a wasted opportunity. I can't quite remember the names of all the dwarfs but considering the amount of screen time they've had so far you'd think they'd talk about something interesting other than the journey. These are the most focused characters I have ever seen on screen, five and a half hours in and they haven't bothered to really let themselves or the audience get to know one another.Maybe its because they were as taken aback by the sheer spectacle of Middle Earth as I was. The action in the film is more varied and plentiful than it was in the last film but of course much is still saved for the finale, and with a high production value I understand why Peter Jackson doesn't want to leave, the whole thing looks like a soft coloured painting. The scenery is brightly lit and beautiful, such a visually resplendent treat that it makes sense to sit and take it in, not for 2 hours and forty one minutes though. A little precious indulgence now and then isn't too hurtful, but it can lead to audience neglect and unintentionally boring periods of desolation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Fine Ramp for the Final Installment,"""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" starts 20 years earlier when Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the Grey meet for the first time. The hobbits plus Bilbo baggins and Gandalf start a stream like journey, which soon splits into various tributaries as the dangers around multiply exponentially.Escaping and Aiding from the Skin Changer (The last line won't make sense until you watch the movie), venturing into a far more dangerous forest, giving a slip to the Elves, barrel riding through the river, crossing the lake via a barge, through the invisible door, the Hobbits finally enter Erebor, the land that they ruled once, now guarded by a sword-teethed, spear-clawed, iron-armored Dragon, the Smaug that waits to feast upon anyone who shall enter his chambers.All leads up to the epic David(s) versus Goliath styled battle, thanks to Peter Jackson, J.R.R.Tolkien and the CGI team.The LOTR fans, including me, had a blast watching our favorite characters, minus a few, re-emerge on the screen to carry on the perilous journey that only gets worse with each passing step. Few side stories crop along the way which will make even more sense in the next installment.So much importance has been given to ""The Desolation of Smaug"", that it appears by itself on the screen rather than as a sub-title to ""The Hobbit"".Peter Jackson has once again proved his mettle as have Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman and the Hobbit brothers. Ben Cumberbatch's voice is totally unrecognizable as Smaug, which only makes it more eerie.Summing up, a fine ramp for the final movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"A slight improvement over the first entry to the trilogy. It might not be Lord of the Rings, but its pretty damn entertaining!","Lord of the Rings has become the bible for the geek community. Now I'll admit, that I have never read The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, but I am huge fan of the films. I adore Peter Jackson award-winning trilogy and really dug the hell out of the first Lord of the Rings prequel The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Now this year we've gotten the second installment in this trilogy, which is called The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.Before you see this film, you need to do your homework and see the previous installment or you will be completely lost. The film picks up where we left off last time. Bilbo and the Dwarfs are on the mountains and the movie goes from their. In this film the they are back on their quest to take back the city of Erebor and to do that they must take down the dragon known as Smaug, voiced by the menacing Benedict Cumberbatch.When it comes to acting in this film, it is excellent! Martin Freeman is still awesome as Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage is so great as Thorin, the leader of the dwarfs. Luke Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch join the cast for this installment and are both fantastic, especially Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch voices Smaug the dragon, and gives one of the best performances I have seen by a voice actor. Ian McKellen is wonderful as Gandalf but it is disappointing to see that he isn't in the film as much as he was in the first film.It seems that archery has become something big in media all of the sudden, with characters like Katniss Everdeen, Daryl Dixon and Hawkeye. Back in 2001-2003, the most bad-ass archer in media was Legolas and he is back in this film. Orlando Bloom was awesome back the Lord of the Rings trilogy and he is still equally as awesome in this Hobbit film.When it comes to special effects, this film does not skimp on them. WETA Digital has been the effects force behind some of the most visually impressive films of the last decade like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Avatar, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers and much more. They do a phenomenal job on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, by making this world look beautiful and by creating Smaug, who I would say is one of the most visually stunning CGI characters of all-time. For a huge-ass CGI dragon, he looks pretty damn great.The film is full of action-packed scenes from beginning to end. Peter Jackson is able to juggle action and drama very well and everything flows perfectly. You can tell Jackson really has heart in these films and it defiantly shows in this installment in the franchise. The movie is paced very well for a two hour and forty minute film.Now I do have a problem with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The first fifteen minutes or so of this film didn't totally have me. One thing about the Lord of the Rings trilogy and even the first Hobbit film was that from the start you know you are in the world of Middle-Earth, that's not the case in this one. It took me a couple minutes to really get me back into this world. I might be the only person who thinks this, but it was honest problem for me.One word that can describe this film is ""epic"". 'Desolation of Smaug' really is an epic film that improves on many things that were wrong with its predecessor but does have some little issues. When it comes to good things in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, it is full-of-them. The acting, action, effects and story of the film are great. Even if this film wasn't a good film, I would still be excited for the next one and I am very excited. When this film ends, it gets you even more excited for the next film, The Hobbit: There and Back Again due out December 17, 2014. I had a great time with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and I hope you check it out because it is truly a great time at the movies!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A huge improvement on the previous installment, this takes our adventurers into uncharted territory and delivers spectacle by the ton","If the first Hobbit film was hampered by a treacherously slow introduction as the dwarfs wooed Bilbo, here Jackson jumps right into the action — and make no mistake, this is an action movie above all else. The battles are visceral and physical, Jackson's horror roots shining through in the vie's fondness for decapitations, and while there's no mistaking the aid of computer-generated imagery, the polish is so high it all comes together in a delirious frenzy.This film was always going to be subjected to high expectations, and while Smaug is certainly an improvement over An Unexpected Journey it never hits the heights of Jackson's first forays to Middle-earth. Unto itself, that's fine; this is a different story, after all, with a different kind of appeal and charm all its own.

Pass the Popcorn review,"It is no secret that the first Hobbit movie – An Unexpected Journey – was somewhat of a let down. The fact that it makes no sense to create a trilogy from a 300 pages book has often been reasonably ridiculed/criticized, and because of this unorthodox (money grabbing) approach to the source material, An Unexpected Journey suffered from serious pacing problems. And when it didn't suffer from pacing problems, it suffered from poorly executed action scenes which looked like something that came straight out of a video game (the sequences in Goblin Town) and from unrelatable and undeveloped characters. After this disappointment, it was hard to tell what to expect from the second installment in the trilogy – The Desolation of Smaug. After watching The Desolation of Smaug, I can safely say that is, if nothing else, better than it predecessor.The Desolation of Smaug continues where An Unexpected Journey ended. Our party, consisting of thirteen dwarfs + Bilbo (Martin Freeman) & Gandalf (Ian McKellen), are hiding from the orcs and their leader Azog (Manu Bennett). Fortunately, they find a shelter inside a house of a strange being called Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), who is a skin-changer (shape-shifter), and they spend the night there before leaving for the strange mystical forest of Mirkwood, which is nearby. In front of the entrance to the forest, Gandalf leaves the party since he has to tend to more serious business. Without him, the dwarfs + Bilbo enter Mirkwood where more adventures await.Without any exaggerating, I think The Desolation of Smaug is the most beautiful movie in the whole Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit franchise to date. The scenery and the cinematography are breathtakingly astonishing. It's worth to see this movie on the big screen for the imagery alone. Everything is beautiful: from the mountains of Erebor to the haunting city of Lake-town. The Desolation of Smaug is a magnificent example of amazing eye candy. Moreover, the characters in the movie are handled better than in An Unexpected Journey. We see how Thorin's (Richard Armitage) dedication to his goal is slowly taking the best of him, and even the other dwarfs have more screen time and lines of dialogue (mainly Fili, played by Aidan Turner). Of course, I have to mention the dragon Smaug, who is definitely the movie's best aspect. It was worth to sit through almost two whole movies to see that dragon. Benedict Cumberbatch (who also voiced The Necromancer character) did an awesome job at voicing and supplying the motion-capture for the dragon. In addition to all this things, I thoroughly enjoyed the sequences in the 'trippy' forest of Mirkwood, up until the elves arrived.Speaking of elves, they are what nearly ruined the movie for me. Prior to the release of this movie, everyone was wondering how will they deal with the character of Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), a character who was completely made up for the sake of this movie. From my perspective, her character was dealt with rather poorly. She serves no actual purpose, other than being a generic romantic interest, and her whole relationship with Kili was rather cheesy – especially the dialogues. Unfortunately, the problems with elves don't stop here – most action scenes including elves look ridiculously goofy and campy. Furthermore, the character of king Thranduil (Lee Pace), Legolas's father, is as charismatic as a bowl of soup. Apart from the elves, the only major problem I had with the movie is its length and pacing. The Desolation of Smaug handles its pacing much better than An Unexpected Journey did, but I can't shake the feeling the movie would have been even better if it were 20 minutes shorter. However, if you can overlook the flaws I mentioned here, you'll probably enjoy The Desolation of Smaug more than almost every other blockbuster movie released this year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not a bad movie by any means, just not as good as it could have been","Before going in to The Desolation of Smaug, I had been given the impression it was quite simply one of the best films this year. Apparently improving over the original in every single way and being just as entertaining as Peter Jackson's previous trilogy, it seemed almost a little too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was.The film begins almost exactly where An Unexpected Journey left off, with Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the group of 13 accompanying dwarfs heading towards the Lonely Mountain to reclaim it from the terrifying dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The ring Bilbo finds in the first movie however, is having a clear impact on his mental well- being, which is comparable to that of Frodo's in The Two Towers. The group soon make their way through the insidious Mirkwood Forest, unaccompanied by the great Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), and eventually seek brief refuge in Lake-Town before heading to the mountain itself to confront Smaug.Strangely, the first third of the movie is noticeably slow, which is odd because it would be expected all of the build-up would take place in the first movie. Yes, there are some action sequences early on, but they weren't as engaging as they probably should have been. That's not to say they were boring, but when compared to the expansive fights in The Lord of the Rings, they weren't really anything special. Also, certain scenes seemed to lack very much musical score, which may have been an issue with the cinema I went to but it detracted hugely from the on-screen events. Returning characters such as Bilbo and Gandalf were just as enjoyable to watch as in the first movie, it's just a shame that they weren't in The Desolation of Smaug quite as much as I would have liked.Before it sounds like I hated the movie though, I want to make a point of saying when things went well, they went very, very well. Despite the lacklustre action at parts, there were specific scenes (such as one involving white-water barrel rafting) which were not only exciting, but they redeemed many of the slower moments of the film. Couple this with the inclusion of characters such as Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and a genuinely intimidating dragon towards the closing scenes of the movie, and it's easy to see how there were several things which worked in The Desolation of Smaug's favour, it's just a shame that the negatives often overshadowed the positives.Smaug himself was easily the highlight of the film for me. Although he is shown briefly in the trailers, you haven't seen him properly until you watch the movie for yourself. If Peter Jackson does one thing correctly, it's scale. The combination of the vast environments with clever camera-work and exceptional CGI meant that Smaug appeared incredibly sinister throughout all of the scenes he appeared in, and the choice of Benedict Cumberbatch to voice him could not have been made better. If there was a single reason to see the film that I could think of, it would be for this infamous dragon.The Desolation of Smaug definitely isn't a let-down, it's just not quite as good as I had hoped it would be. The CGI was consistently breath- taking and the majority of the film was entertaining, but that doesn't save some segments from being boring and drawn-out. Also, it ends on a cliff-hanger which has scale rivalling The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Fans of Tolkien and Peter Jackson will definitely love this second Hobbit instalment, but it's difficult to recommend it to an average movie fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing Movie,I felt compelled to write a review after watching this amazing film. The Lord of the Rings sequels are great but seeing these Hobbit movies just amazes me to see how far CGI has come. If you're looking for a movie with plenty of action and amazing cinematography then look no further than The Hobbit trilogy. These films will keep you on the edge of your seat and it's a family friendly trilogy as well.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Bigger, better and more entertaining than the previous edition, but falls incredibly short from the adventures of middle-earth we have seen before.","Definitely more exciting and entertaining than its previous installment that was inevitably burdened with introductions and setting up the base which to my opinion was a little sluggish. With more references to the LOTR storyline, this would appeal better to the fans of the popular trilogy. Shot and released in premium 3D, the number of effects are comparatively very minimal considering we should wear those glasses for its exhaustive runtime. However due to lack of enough interesting characters to root for unlike the LOTR series, the screenplay completely relies on the adventure element which is again a little unsatisfactory having seen similar if not better content already.In a prologue, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) reveals the reason why Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is part of the 'fellowship' of dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage). To reclaim their Kingdom Erebor, Thorin has to unite the 7 dwarf families which is only possible with the possession of Arkenstone jewel lying beneath the fire breathing dragon Smaug inside the lonely mountain accessible through the hidden door. Bilbo as a burglar is expected to steal that. With a little help from the Elves especially Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) who is smitten by a witty dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the dwarf pack manages to keep the Orcs off their tail, but would they be able to do the same of Smaug comprises the remaining storyline.LOTR's effectiveness comes from its multi-layered story with characters coming from a wide variety of backgrounds each having their perceptions and approaches to the common objective and the presence of Gollum. With none of those elements present, this edition of the Hobbit still comes out to be entertaining (sans the awe element). Another major drawback was that none of the lead characters actually standout. Having mastered the craft in presenting the beauty and wonders of middle-earth, Peter Jackson's experience, expertise and his aesthetics play a major role in the making of this enormous project. The climax of the movie doesn't go too well with the title of the movie, but leaves you lingering as good as 'The Two Towers'. The special effects, locations, costumes are directly progressed from past experience, but the action set pieces were a far cry from the middle-earth battles we have seen before. The background score doesn't leave a note you would recall. Having discussed quite a few drawbacks, there is still some good we can take from this movie like the following 1. The dwarfs escape from the Elves 2. Introduction of Smaug 3. Prologue featuring the town Bree and the famous tavern 'The Prancing Pony' 4. Legolas and Tauriel's incredible battle skills 5. Witty lines from Bilbo and KiliBigger, better and more entertaining than the previous edition, but falls incredibly short from the adventures of middle-earth we have seen before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is tremendously enjoyable,"This second Hobbit movie was for me not just a pleasure, but a revelation. For the first time, I ""got"" the JRR Tolkien/Peter Jackson experience. I tuned into the frequency. I tasted the fusion cuisine. I heard the eccentric but weirdly rousing choral harmonies. And this is despite – or more probably because of – never having been a Tolkien fan and being agnostic about the myth-making and, indeed, the prose quality. I never had any dogmatic sense of how the original should be represented or any loyalty to childhood fandom, and in fact I came to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in 2001 with some unbelief, though as the Rings series progressed I was forced – with some churlish ill-grace – to admire those movies' mighty ambition and scope. With the Hobbit series, the penny is properly dropping: it's not about Tolkien, it's Tolkien-plus-Jackson, of course. It's morphed into something new.This movie is tremendously enjoyable, and considering how exotic it is, The Desolation of Smaug is weirdly unassuming. It rattles along, never drags, and is always terrifically likable: open, genial and good-natured. The legend is revealing itself to be a rich and potent source of entertainment. Perhaps the point is, as Graham Greene once said about God, you need a sense of humour to believe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A far more impressive outing,"Having recently seen the first hobbit movie for the first time, I wasn't expecting to watch the second one until after the Oscar nominations, where I was hoping to watch it as a contender in the technical categories. By a stroke of luck, I attended a midnight showing with a few family members, and left the theater amazed by how this picture had captivated me.Following the quest started in ""An Unexpected Journey"", this movie begins with an initial flashback as to how the whole plot to take back Erebor came to fruition through a meeting between Thorin and Gandalf. Having set the foundations for those that missed the first part, the story then moves us to where we left off from the previous film. From then on you will be taken on a ride full of thrills, as you witness the perils of The Company facing the constant threat of the vicious orcs. But all is not gloomy as allies will arise in the form of two rebellious elves (the return of Legolas) and the despaired lake humans, with it all leading up to the epic encounter with Smaug, the dragon everybody had nightmares about when they were kids.As a whole production, The Desolation Of Smaug is a movie adventure of epic proportions that provides us with a variety of aspects to enjoy, from the incredible visual effects that bring Smaug to life, to the beautiful photography that takes us to Middle Earth once again and makes us glare at its beauty, all while adding a little light humor to amuse the audience. The acting is once again on par with what is required, as leading man Martin Freeman brings his witty and goofy charm to the character of Bilbo Baggins. Other standouts include Sir Ian McKellen as the wise and determined wizard Gandalf, and the voice of Smaug, done splendidly by Benedict Cumberbatch. Peter Jackson manages to make this second entry more exciting and riveting, by never directing an action packed story that never lets us breathe. One particular scene that wowed me was a chase fantastically choreographed through battles between the elves (arrows), orcs (wooden clubs) and the dwarfs in the barrels (pieces of wood and stone), that closely resembled the one in The Adventures Of Tintin (produced by Jackson)Running nearly three hours long, Desolation Of Smaug once again stretches the story so that the one book can be accommodated to three feature films. Nonetheless it doesn't drag at a slow pace like its predecessor, and with the combined efforts of the effects and narrative, it flows perfectly towards an ending that leaves us sizzling for the final entry in the series.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Tremendous fun, and a great expansion of the world of Middle-earth","I have read absolutely everything that JRR Tolkien has ever written, and consider myself a Tolkien fanatic. This is my perspective on The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Please stick with me to the end, and I'll try not to lose you. Let's begin. So...if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was Peter Jackson giving the purists their dues with a relatively straightforward and book-faithful film, then THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is Peter Jackson saying: ""You've had your fun. Now stand back and watch what I can do.""And the ride he takes us on is absolutely exhilarating. SMAUG is darker, moodier, and more mature than any Middle Earth film we've seen thus far. Evil hangs over our heroes like a black pall (literally). Beset on all sides by revenge-seeking orcs, wargs, terrifying spiders, pale creepy- crawlies, double-crossing elves, treacherous humans, a growing Evil in a ruined Elvish citadel, and a huge, vain, fire-breathing dragon...both the heroes and the audience are plunged into a terrifyingly new world. And there's a lot of new stuff to feast your eyes on along the way.Castwise, Tauriel is a welcome female addition to the gang, played with charisma and spunk by Evangeline Lilly. Lee Pace's regal and scheming elf- king Thranduil is absolutely astounding, delivering a tour-de-force in a few minutes of screen time. Luke Evans could not be better as Bard, simultaneously grim and noble. But of course, the real draw here is Benedict Cumberbatch, wearing two very villainous hats. The first is as the Necromancer, who, in addition to manifesting himself as an inkblot, is really quite scary. And the second...is the reason that you came here in the first place: Smaug. The Terrible. Smaug just so happens to be the greatest dragon ever! He is everything I wanted him to be and more: vain, seductive, manipulative, terrifying, and of course, absolutely huge. I'd just like to congratulate Cumberbatch and the conceptual crew on his tremendous design.Our returning cast is also fantastic. Richard Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield is electrifying, with gravitas and stage presence enough for a character twice his stature. His grave eyes and deep voice tell of a lifetime of war and sorrow, and every line he speaks could be delivered by a king. Martin Freeman continues to be perfect as Bilbo, and Ian McKellen's Gandalf is just as crusty and warm as you remember him. Oh, and Legolas? Legolas is awesome. Like, web-swinging, spider-slaying, arrow- shooting, orc-killing awesome!Speaking of orc-killing, The Desolation of Smaug has, in THIS Tolkienian's perspective, the best action scene of the year: the barrels. The breathless, crazy, confusing, insane three-way-battle sequence (don't tease me for it) had me LITERALLY crying with sheer unadulterated glee! The rest of the action, including a hard-hitting spider attack, and a sprawling, rather one-sided battle between 10 dwarfs, a hobbit, and a dragon shows that Jackson has absolutely outdone himself!Well, now for the cons. If Desolation of Smaug has a con, it's that it really, really wants to keep moving to newer, darker territories, so whenever it slows down it feels, well...like an intermission between set- pieces. And the ending will divide the audience: you'll either love the breathless cliffhanger, or hate that you have to wait another year to find out what happens! And as a Tolkien purist, I have to address the fact of accuracy. SMAUG really isn't that accurate to the books. But you know what - I actually like that! I enjoy having absolutely NO IDEA what Peter Jackson has cooked up next. God knows what he's got cooked up for Part Three!So in conclusion, The Desolation of Smaug is a terrific ride. Filled with amazing action, excellent performances, and the requisite gorgeous New Zealand landscape shots and Howard Shore score, SMAUG is everything I hoped for and more",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson: Creator of Middle Earth,"A lot of Tolkien fans are upset because the trilogy seems to neglect the content of the book. It is true that the story line goes off, nevertheless it is an interesting plot.I'll explain why I didn't give it a 10. First of all, it seems like a problem that the dwarfs and Bilbo barely interact with each other. Also, the movie has the tendency to need an elf to ""come and save the day""; which draws much mood from the movie. Some shots seem to be made to show VFX rather than using VFXs to enhance the story.Staying away from these mistakes, the perspective of the Desolation of Smaug from a film point is fantastic. Amazing cinematography, I have to say I enjoyed the 3D with the extra frames. I am a big time Tolkien fan, and being able to travel through all the unexplored areas of the North Eastern region of Middle Earth is fantastic! The story being told outside the book is mainly taken from Tolkien's unpublished notes, of course they need a made-up story line because Tolkien never made a story out of the notes.A lot of people fail to see that Jackson is creating the rest of middle- earth and at the same time he is giving insight of how Sauron came back to power before the War of the Ring (LOTR trilogy).Great job and production, I do hope to see more dramatic danger in the last movie as Sauron appears to gain more power. I am also curious to see how they make the connection between the last movie and the Fellowship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Desolation of Smug (not a typo),"Peter Jackson took a trilogy of books, and made it into three movies. He then took a single book, and is trying to stretch it into three more movies. Do the math--if the Lord of the Rings had rec'd the same treatment, there would have been 9 movies in that series. Way too much. Wayyyyy to much. The Hobbit, if anyone needs to be told, is a wonderful book, but it is short on story and long on character development. This movie tries to flip that script and make it a wonderful story about a hobbit, and a dwarf seeking his kingdom, and making it an elf chick flick, and the redemption of a Bard, and let's skip the neat character of Beorn altogether, and add in Orc parties (and forget that the orcs couldn't/wouldn't travel in daylight). Let's change the character study of a odd hero and make it such a stupendous story that the title character, the Hobbit, is lost in the shuffle. Bilbo, for those that don't remember, barely did anything in the book. He forgot his walking stick. He only succeeded in delaying the trolls. He did wake up and holler when the orcs attacked their midnight camp in the mountains, but then he fell off the dwarf during their escape. He did fight in Mirkwood, and was instrumental in their escape, but after that, he is basically just tagging along with the group. And, that's OK! And even though, in the book, he is the linchpin for all the changes, it is more by his inaction than by his actions that he succeeds. Funny thing...that's what made him seem so believable, and accessible, and loved by millions of fans. The Hobbit is not just the most successful fantasy novel because it is the grandfather of all fantasy novels, but because the Hobbit was fleshed out and seemed like an actual creation. He seemed exactly like what we would be like in a fantasy setting. There is a reason that first edition The Hobbit sells for the same thing as first edition works of Twain. This movie has drawn upon the story, but it forgot to tell us his story, and instead is about ten different stories all shooting off in all kinds of arcs. Not a bad movie...but not the hobbit. I blame the director for this. He did the same thing in LOTR...he changed the characters to suit his purpose and forgot that it wasn't his story to tell...he should stick to telling the story and only show us his vision of what it looked like. He is not the creator here...Tolkien was. To think he can improve on such a story is, well, could be defined as smug. And thus, we have the Desolation of Smug.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Keeps Getting Better,"Contrary to popular opinion I actually liked The Hobbit an Unexpected Journey, I no it had some tempo issues but in all honesty as a Tolkien fan I easily overlooked it. However, The Desolation of Smaug starts off more or less right where it left off and certainly proceeds at an entertaining pace. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) witnesses the ferocious beast Beorn who looks pretty spectacular on screen. The party then make for Mirkwood forest, a dangerous and ominous route on their quest.Their journey through the forest has plenty of action as the party of travellers are tormented by the forest and battle against giant spiders. During their dark, dank walk through Mirkwood, Bilbo climbs a tree popping his head above them into a sea of autumn leaves and fluttering butterflies. He inhales the warm fresh air as the reassuring sun shines upon his face. It's a beautiful scene and despite perhaps a lack of narrative explaining the journey these sort of scenes manifest it clearly. They eventually run into a group of woodland elves and once again the hobbit makes use of his magic ring to their advantage.The viewer has the pleasure of seeing a tremendous barrel sequence were the travellers flow down the fast moving river. It's a long scene but not for one second does it bore or linger. We also see not just Azog the Defiler but another intimidating orc named Bolg both of which answer to a much darker evil.The love triangle between Kili (Aidan Turner),Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) however feels slightly insignificant as we don't really connect with these characters very deeply and on the whole is very brief. I would prefer to of seen a happier Legolas, a character we are already familiar with from Lord Of The Rings pursuing his love for Tauriel against his farther Thranduil's (Lee Pace) will.Despite my minor issues there is a lot to be loved and enjoyed in this movie and holds true to Tolkiens English style. Smaug the dragon was executed superbly as were all the special effects for that matter. We get a closer look at Thorin (Richard Armitage) which is definitely needed and as usual Bilbo and Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) play their roles brilliantly.We are left with a heated and action packed ending as the party continue their search for the Arkenstone, the heirloom of Throins kin, which will crown him king and unite his people once more.8.5/10MattRigby",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson﻿ kills the story with an endless series of battles,"""Stories are the most important thing in the world. Without stories, we wouldn't be human beings at all.""The Hobbit is not a battle. It's a story. A brilliant, beautiful story. The Desolation of Smaug is, in contrast, an action movie which bears little resemblance to the joy of the book. The mesmerizing chapter in the House of Beorn? Forget it, Mr Jackson doesn't want to waste time with such crap. Bilbo's stealth endeavors and hopeless situation in the Elvenking's halls that you live through with the characters for weeks? No way, we need to rush to yet another battle scene.On and on, the viewer is being robbed of any chance to emotionally connect with the story. I'm very sorry for everyone who hasn't read the book because you must be totally confused what (and why) the hell is going on. In the end, you can stay assured about only one thing: that there's another battle just around the corner (and that some elves are gonna come out of nowhere to slay the orcs).For me, it's the most useless movie of the five LOTR/Hobbit installments. Let's hope the battling nature of the last one will make up for this misstep at least a double times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The bigger/higher they are ...,"And I'm not only talking about Smaug here, although this being part 2 you can imagine there is a lot more to come (obviously). No I'm talking about Peter Jackson and the Tolkien universe in general. It's obvious that some people will get fatigue after a long series. Especially one that gets stretched even more than necessary. The movie itself is technical on a level that is really great. The acting is solid and the story holds its own.Still I won't tell anyone how to feel about this. Especially considering the fact that we get a teenage formula integrated into this. The very well known two male fighting over one girl thing that worked for Twilight, Hunger Games and other movies that came out recently. It's obviously to reel in a bigger female audience or at least to keep them interested, while the male audience is there from the get go (Fantasy, action, adventure, who could say no to that, with Special effects to enhance it all).So while it feels stretched and Jackson does take liberties (giving us new characters like the one played by Lilly or inserting ones that weren't there in the original book), you can still have a lot of fun watching it. You just have to find a ground to enjoy this for what it is ... a bridge to part 3 ...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It is a great movie indeed But...,"let me just make it clear that i'm one of the biggest fans of the lord of the rings franchise .. it is my childhood's best movie .. i remember every single scene in the 3 movies with its background music , what the actors say and how they act it and even how the camera moves !! ,, i remember every single detail of the movies .. and I still watch them and enjoy them too ! ... the desolation is a really wonderful movie.. however it is not as good as any of the lotr movies and its not even close .. in fact the only reason i gave it an 8 is because i'm still loyal to the lotr movies.. i will just compare the two movies so i make my point...although lotr movies are much older it feels like they are more realistic.. the environments ,the creatures the orcs everything was stunning and realistic !in the hobbit movies the excessive usage of CGI makes the movie look cartonish and feels more like a game than a movie .. every thing looks fake .. even the horse that legolas rides in the end of the movie is CGI ! why is that ?! couldn't they afford a real horse ?? .. some environments look really really fake and shouldn't 've been included in the movie in first place .. And the movie's Score !! for god's sake I still watch lotr movies because of its score ,, each scene has a perfectly matching music that feels like it was made for this scene .. this doesn't happen in the desolation .. In my opinion the lotr movies are a one time experience in a lifetime ,, i don't think that there will ever be a movie that matches these movies .. even their creator can't make a movie that is close to them ..

A fast-paced fantasy action blockbuster!,"Desolation of Smaug is a marked improvement from the first installment of The Hobbit. From the onset, I was quite surprised at how much of an action-movie this actually was; it barely tries to settle down to breathe. Despite being impressive, I noticed via the editing that many scenes with Beorn and in Mirkwood forest were left on the cutting floor for Jackson's inevitable extended editions. The adventure develops a new sense of urgency as we are now exposed to lands & characters previously unseen in Middle Earth and the escapade gets darker harking back memories of the greatness of LOTR. I have little doubt that once all 3 movies are released and seen as one, these will be worthy, but slightly lesser, companions to the LOTR trilogy.Once again, Jackson nails the epic adventure feel and the material is immediately transportive and captivating. We are introduced to some compelling supporting characters with varying screen-time. Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) is visually rendered quite differently compared to the book and thankfully is not generic as described therein. He is given 'manimal' features & an alluring mystery that will surely make him a memorable character by the time we get to the final movie's climax & extended edition. Thranduil gives of this ethereal vibe and is superbly played by Lee Pace; giving us a different side & hence more weight to the Elves.Smaug, an iconic beast of Middle-Earth, is as magnificent as the book describes him to be. Cumberbatch's heavy vocals (with the help of some digital alterations) and movements (yes this is our first motion- captured dragon) make the villain more intimidating than merely size. Peter Jackson also nails his interactions with Bilbo as he did with Gollum in the last movie. The attention to detail on to the dragon is sublime and watching it talk and move is a truly mesmerizing & unforgettable experience. Avid fans were hoping Smaug would be the greatest dragon in cinematic history and that is the case as the character delivers in terms of both menace & personality. Smaug on screen encapsulates greed & bloated ego just as Tolkien inscribed.Even the characters not in the book, Legolas & Tauriel, added substance to the subplot. It's not a far stretch to imagine that Legolas would be present at the time the Dwarf-company passed through his father's realm. Also, I found Tauriel very likable indeed (nothing to do with her looks I assure you); her character brought both warmth & fierceness whereas the source had completely overlooked the gender.Other than character moments, the choreography of some of the action sequences was impressive. The spider attack and the barrel escape were tremendous; but the Bilbo's banter with Smaug & his resulting rage leads to an unexpected battle & fantastic cliffhanger that sets us up for another 12 painfully long months of waiting.Overall, while Desolation of Smaug deviates significantly from the book's lighter tone, it marvelously captures the grandiosity of the LOTR films & is technically masterful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Feels More Like a Theme Park Attraction Than a Trip to Middle Earth,"Guess what this middle Hobbit has a distinct lack of (see title)? Setting the inherent issue of spreading a 350-page book into nine hours aside, this installment falls, to quote, ""utterly short."" Though An Unexpected Journey was nothing if not flawed, there were certainly high points that could ring well with the right set of mind. Unfortunately, there's a distinct lack of effort to help its sequel stand out, other than the looks and pedigree of its predecessors.Being a mid-point movie, The Desolation of Smaug has the disadvantage of no real beginning and ending; though the opening scene does a fair job setting the stage and getting us back on track. Beyond that, it's a long, rough ride. The movie feels like it's going from scene to scene while doing little to leave an actual impression. Technically a lot of ground is covered, but this journey wears you out due to the runtime, as opposed to the impact of its scenes.Many of the film's key moments (action) feel more like theme park ride attractions. In fact, shortly before the film's abrupt ending, I found myself thinking, ""this is a three-hour pitch for a Middle Earth theme park."" Speaking of key moments, the more serious points are always short-lived and tough to feel invested in. Why? Because this movie tends to have such a comical overtone, whether intentional or not, that the few seemingly dark points come off as out of place. The absence of blood during scenes where orcs upon orcs are slain only makes the entire movie feel more like a Saturday morning cartoon.Then there's the part everybody wants to see: Smaug. The build up for this movie rests entirely on the last half-hour to forty-five minutes, where the dragon is woken up in a gold mine of a city. Not only that, but the dragon has a voice (Benedict Cumberbatch, no less). How is this entire sequence? Think back to how the Witch King died in Return of the King, oh so abruptly. Smaug's appearance is anything but brief, but the entire time I felt out of the experience. It's tough to pull off a talking dragon, but given the crew, I imagined a more convincing and intimidating beast. Instead, the best part about Smaug is what leads up to his awakening. Then the talking started. For every shot that Smaug appears in, I kept asking, ""Do I like this? Do I buy this? Am I enjoying this?"" Yet the answer resides in the fact I kept asking these questions in the first place.As you can undoubtedly tell, I have a lot of issues and complaints to go around for The Desolation of Smaug. Though there are good aspects to find, they were also superiorly present in its predecessor(s). Even when Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers ended, they at least had enough of a transition to avoid that awful, arbitrary cliffhanger effect. Here, however, I could feel the air of disappointment and frustration in the theater. Rather than shock, excitement and anticipation, the reactions reeked of moaning and groaning.

"Bigger, Louder, and Bolder!","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is the middle movie of the fantasy prequel trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The movie still has an enormous runtime, but the film moves at a steady pace backed by fantastic action sequences, excellent CGI (I'm looking at you, Smaug), great acting, and even a forbidden romance. We get some old, but welcome faces returning, most notably Legolas. The movie continues the same tone as An Unexpected Journey, but it is a little darker and at times, I felt like I was watching the Lord of the Rings tone-wise. Also, Smaug was impressive. His very words reeked of evil and Jackson did a great job bringing this literary beast to life.Peter Jackson's film continues the journey of Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs as they continue their trek to the Lonely Mountain. They must fight through hungry spiders, blood-thirsty orcs, stubborn wood elves, a shapeshifter named Beorn, corrupt men of Laketown, and of course the dragon Smaug himself.The acting is very good, I think. Martin Freeman makes a fantastic Bilbo and he is good at making some great quips. Ian McKellan is fantastic as always as Gandalf. Richard Armitage continues his kingly manners as Thorin Oakenshield. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful return as everyone favorite elf, Legolas. We have some good newcomers here: Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, the she-elf who falls for the dwarf Kili, Lee Pace as the cold-hearted leader of the wood elves, and Luke Evans as Bard, a man who helps the dwarfs and yearns to kill Smaug.Overall, the Desolation of Smaug is an excellent movie. The Hobbit movies deserve a lot more credit than people give them for. They are different in tone and story from the Lord of the Rings, but they are still entertaining in their own way. This movie is led by many action sequences. I particularly enjoyed the barrel sequence as the dwarfs escape from the wood elves while be attacked by the orcs. That was an entertaining sequence highlighted by the fiery moves from the elves. The movie ends on a high note and I'm eager for what comes next. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointed but greatly amused,"*** Minor Spoilers*** The good: If you're looking for a visually stunning, edge-of-your-seat film with an awesome dragon and a hint of romance (or miss the Super Kill Action of Legolas from LotR), you absolutely must see this film! The bad: If you love Tolkien's work or are a die hard fan of authenticity... drop the word ""Hobbit"" from the title and you can still immensely enjoy the film.Bias: Huge Tolkien fan... read The Hobbit at least 14 times, LotR 8 times, blah blah. That said, I don't watch a movie expecting it to be word for word, scene for scene with the book it is based on.The bad: After watching a loosely interpreted LotR in the theater with Hollywood embellishment I felt prepared for ""An Unexpected Journey"". While it journeyed off the road many times, it still managed to find a side path to the same destination and held on to the playful and light climate from the book.Part II, however, was so loosely based on the book that ""Bored of the Rings"" seemed a better retelling of Tokien's trilogy. They took the standard big screen cheese and heaped on all the cheese from the LotR films on top, then tossed in the beans.Don't misunderstand... I think it is inventive and enriches the story when they break away for a flash-back of Gandalf's adventures that connect it more strongly with LotR. But to add in ridiculous characters, drama and love scenes that are not only absent from the books but in fact distract from the movie and ruin the essence of the book is completely demoralizing to Tolkien fans.On top of the unnecessary and confusing scenes to add an extra hour to film, taking away from the focal characters and scenes from the book make the movie simply an exercise in futility (except making a wonderfully scenic and exciting super-CGI film!). For example, making Beorn into a Neanderthal was upsetting and completely altered the fun scene in how they met with the intelligent animals and booming laughs, and only to drag on the ridiculous ""orcs can now comfortably travel in daylight"" hunt of Thorin that never existed.Next film: Dwarf-Elf marriage legalized, Smaug is a protected endangered species, Sauron the Boy Scout Troop Leader, Galadriel drops to 1/4 speed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An adventure we won't forget.,"Putting Middle Earth on screen and making Middle Earth are not the same thing. Jackson didn't create Middle Earth but he pictured Middle Earth and made it cinematically visual for all of us to watch. By doing so he is strongly influencing us and making millions of people around the world today, and generations to come, see what Middle Earth looks like. I am incredibly grateful for the world that Tolkien created, which later went on to Peter Jackson and they together created such a wonderful fantasy world.I have seen the Movie twice now and it continued to entertain me as much as it did on it's premiere or maybe more?!I thought to myself ""Finally i have been waiting for this since last year"" I was so hyped and happy because i knew that Peter again had created a fantastic movie. From beginning to the end, i was stuck to my chair with a big smile on my face!This trilogy has the lack of seriousness and with that comes people that finds this movie not as enjoyable as the former Jackson's Middle Earth movies had, I didn't really care because i found it funny and entertaining.I really think the jokes and the humor fits perfectly in this movie because of it's softness compared to the LotR movies. The thing which i find most touching is the character growth, For a little Hobbit like Bilbo who was scared to leave his home has now evolved into an entirely new character and i can't wait to see him the next time on the the cinema screen!!! It really felt like the characters and not only characters but also Tolkien himself came back to life and put on screen, although I could not see him, I knew that it was he who took me on an adventure. somehow Peter has managed to create this visual world of middle earth that we all know and love. I am very very grateful for the hard work that Peter Jackson has put into making this movie and i really look forward to the last part!Score: 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
No longer a children's movie...,"If you found 'An Unexpected Journey' too childish, you can breathe more easily. 'Desolation' is more serious than its predecessor; gone are the silly songs and even then slapstick jokes have been reduced. Especially the Dol Guldur storyline and Lee Pace's portrayal of Thranduil add to the noticeably darker tone of the movie.Evangeline Lily does a good job depicting the non-canonical Elf Tauriel, and while the resulting romantic tension might not have been necessary, it's good to see some variation among the Elves apart from the strict Sindar. Stephen Fry cuts a delightfully corrupt Mayor of Laketown and I hope we'll see even more of him in the next movie.Book-purists might be somewhat miffed that a few plot details were changed, and some scenes were cut short while others, especially towards the end, were padded to ridiculous lengths, but that was to be expected considering the sheer size of the project. Needless to say it will be interesting to see how things play out in the trilogy's conclusion. However, once again it's great to see Dol Guldur, and the inclusion of this story feels natural and integrates well into the rest of the movie.Overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is more grown up than 'Journey', with good acting throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, as far as watching a train wreck can be","The last go around in Unexpected Journey, many liberties were taken. Yet, with all the extra characters and walking about in the woods, it somewhat felt passingly like the book. This ""sequel"" of sorts is a big, boated thing that shares only names with the novel namesake and none of the spirit. In common with the first film, Bilbo seems to have an awfully small role. The manufactured elf Tauriel soaks up more lines and screen time than Martin Freeman. It continues...Where Unexpected Journey was mostly loafing about for three hours, we're nearly pummeled into submission on the way to lonely mountain this year. The music score never lets you absorb a moment quietly. Every single camera or character movement is backed up by incessant audio cues. There are sub-plots of sub-plots. There is a love triangle and double crosses. There are lots of decapitations for a PG-13 movie. There are a lot of forced and unnecessary connections to the Jackson LOTR movies. The editing is often a blurry mess of nonsense, but to be honest I was never all that bored. Without Bennedict Cumberbach, the whole show could have been a lot worse than it is. So it isn't a great film, but it is a decent action movie. Albeit one that could shed an hour or more of fat. Overall, Desolation has even less in common with the book than the first film. But movies are movies and books are books.So Desolation of Smaug is an absolutely awful adaptation of The Hobbit, but it is also generally an entertaining movie. This may be as good as it gets. When the dragon is gone, I'm assuming in the next movie, we will be barraged by a lot of shots of CGI armies numbering in the thousands throwing spears, arrows and swords. I was bored of that before Peter Jackson did it ten years ago.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Great Adventure,"The thirteen dwarfs commanded by Thorin (Richard Armitage), the burglar Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) travel to Lonely Mountain to steal the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug to join the dwarfs. Along their dangerous journey, they need to fight against giant spiders and Orcs and they are captured but flee from the Elves. But Smaug is not easily deceived and flies to Lake-town to destroy the town and the dwellers.""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is another great adventure of Thorin, the dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf.

Getting darker....,"Saw this yesterday and thought I'd share first impressions.Firstly, it's a BIG film at nearly 3 hours, with an awful lot to take in, ( I realised even as I was coming out of the theatre that I would need to see it again to ""get my head around it all"").The none Tolkien additions, It is an adaption after all, fit in seamlessly and help contextualise some of the events not only in this story, but also in The Lord of the Rings follow on. Smaug is suitably terrible and terrifying. There are no weak performances and the story clips along at a fast pace.If you've read the book, then most of the key elements of the story are addressed. If not then you are in for a real treat as this wonderful story unfolds for you. The cliffhanger ending of this film is excellent!A brilliantly realised mid section of this classic story.

The Destruction Of A Classic Story,"I honestly can't believe how well received this film has been! I am a huge fan of Tolkien and his books including The Hobbit. I was quite shocked when I heard they were making this into 3 movies when the whole book is not even as long as the first LOTR book.However I accepted it and went to see the first film which was better than I thought it would be but still not that accurate to the book. The Desolation Of Smaug however is a disaster. I came out of the cinema in shock at how they have destroyed such a beautiful story. I wonder if they have even read the book as this was just so different.Sure they added certain things in from the book but overall it was a completely new take on the book. It is like they said to hell with the brilliant story lets just make this into an over the top special effects extravaganza.I was very excited for this film, as a huge fan of LOTR and The Hobbit but now I kind of feel very angry and upset that this was allowed to be made. The only people who will like this Film are people who have not had a chance to read the book. Fans of Tolkien will be upset I am sure. The barrel escape was embarrassing and well so was the whole film.I can't believe I am saying this but I am certainly not looking forward to the third and final part. I already know it won't be accurate to the book and it will just be another 'Lets see how huge we can make this look'",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Still a fairly unique monster,"Peter Jackson operating on one cylinder still beats any other blockbuster director operating on all. This film is a strange amalgamation of horror, physical comedy, and epic fantasy storytelling that I really can't compare to anything except the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies. (In the 80s these types of movies were also known as Indiana Jones films). The action scenes are definitely praiseworthy, especially the orc-elf-dwarf-in-barrel battle scene, where the fighting is complemented by a kind physical humor that still somewhat sticks to physics in between all the CGI. Compare this to the prototypical modern blockbuster-Fast and Furious, Marvel films, Dwayne Johnson flicks-and note the difference. Those movies get all their 'humor' from snarky, meta dialogue straining so hard to be clever and usually not succeeding. (Avengers Endgame was the worst offender here). You could place all the Marvel and Dwayne Johnson action scenes end to end and never get something so ridiculous and entertaining as Bombur impaling an orc with his barrel and then rolling down the riverbank smacking more and more over.Anyway, the film isn't perfect, especially because of the extensive, bad-looking CGI which somehow doesn't apply to the dragon, thank goodness. It also appears more rushed, which it was because Jackson had a studio breathing deadlines down his neck. I don't care though. It's magnificently creative, Jackson's camera work is more stylish than ever, and world doesn't have a lot of good high fantasy movies anyway.A note: the hobbit trilogy is often compared to the Star Wars prequel trilogy which I think is a pretty apt comparison. However, it insults the magnificent acting from everyone in this trilogy. The performances are better than critics would have you believe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Just to the next level of Journey with Entertainment.,"No doubt I love the series. The way the things have make alive, shows the hard work of Peter Jackson and others. Though it's difficult to compare the book and movie. But he is trying to put everything from the book to movie.Good: Like other movies, Peter Jackson has made a true entertaining fantasy film. Direction, Screenplay & Story is truly amazing. People complaint about the last part having less action and more drama. This time it's full of action. And it's fast too !Bad: Nothing as such.

The adventure continues mostly in fine form,"(80%) The second chapter offers more in terms of action, a degree more excitement and more peril for the group of adventuring hobbits, but also the is a tad degree less charm and humour than the first instalment, which had it in spades. And despite the series now looking very likely to turn out to be nothing more really than ""Lord of the rings Jr"" this still remains a mighty fine, well made, fun adventure movie that is well worth a cinema ticket and 2 hours 40 of ones time.

Thorin reclaims his place in movie history!,"Last night I watched ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" and it was really good. The movie was exiting all the way throughout the 161 min run time. It was way better than ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", though I did enjoy the first one as well. This movie is really action-packed and keeps you at the edge of your seat. The 3D looks great in this movie and there are a lot of great images. Though the ""Lord of The Rings"" trilogy is way better, so don't go into the cinema with too high expectations.There are many cool characters. All the dwarfs are back as well, and THERE'S NO SINGING!! :) I wasn't that fond of the dwarfs in the first movie, but now they're starting to grow on me. Now I'm finding myself really caring about each and every one of them. The movie also introduced a new character to the Tolkien-universe. This character isn't written by Tolkien, but by the movie writers. The characters name is Tauriel, and she's a Wood Elf (Legolas is also a Wood Elf). She's played by the actress Evangeline Lilly, which is most known for playing Kate in the hit series ""Lost"" (2004-2010). I thought Tauriel was a great/awesome character. She's one of my favorite characters in the movie, so Peter Jackson made a great decision when he added her. She kicks ass all they way throughout the movie, and she has about the same fighting style as Legolas. It was really cool seeing another ""Lord of the Rings"" character, and I was glad to see Legolas again. Gandalf is cool as always, and is my favorite Middle Eart character. Gandalf has great the greatest quotes and is a very likable character. Martin Freman plays Bilbo perfectly yet again. He's the funniest character in the movie and you've got to love him. We also get introduced to Smaug (the dragon which lives in Erebor) played by Benedict Cumberbatch. His voice and performance really makes Smaug the greatest movie dragon since Falkor the luckdragon.I really liked this movie and I recommend it to Tolkien fans and fellow fantasy lovers. It isn't perfect, but it's a great effort. The soundtrack is pretty good but quite forgettable compared to the other movies. Every moviegoer should give this ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" a try, and I give it 8,8/10For more movie reviews visit http://stiannielsfilm.blogspot.no/",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic Action Fantasy Movie!!!!,"The Hobbit: The Desolation Of SmaugI LOVED IT! So much better than the first one. Its fast paced and exciting. Feels allot more of a quick sit then the first one. But how is the movie in detailThe Characters are once again great. And even the new characters are really cool. Beron, who I had a bit of a concern about, is a fun character. That bear design alone was so cool. I love Legolas in this; he's such a showoff, almost Gaston like to try to impress his girlfriend.BTW, Tauriel, I'm in love people. Not only a badass fighter who can hold her own in battle, but DAMN is she a fine elf. I wasn't really all that invested and got all goo goo for the previous female characters in the other films, hell most of my favorite female characters are in Anime. But, this elven warrior is gorgeous. :DAlso, Thrandull is a cool guy too. You can tell that he's got a bit of a David Bowie Labyrinth tone in him.And then there's Smaug. WOW! WHAT AN AMAZING DRAGON! ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN! He's almost ties with Draco from Dragonheart. He's that good. Bennedect Cumberbatch is bone chilling in the performance. It's almost Sh*t Your Pants terrifying. I also noticed something in his design and behavior. It seems looking at him closely; Jackson obviously wanted to create something larger than life, which he succeeded in. Smaug was gigantic. The BIGGEST Dragon I've EVER SEEN. But I noticed that his design was based on a combination of different reptiles. With the teeth of a crocodile and almost snake like movements, his design and behavior was more of that of a Water Monitor Lizard or Kamodo Dragon. Now keep in mind, I've worked with large sized monitors in the past, and I've seen how they moved and behave, although granted, most of them acted like house cats, I'm not kidding. Smaug was defiantly that of a wild one, his head was indeed that or a monitor along with movement. And I thought that was really cool.The Action is FANTASTIC & TOP NOTCH! Its great fun! The whole Barrel Sequence from beginning to end was a roller coaster ride. Especially the Jump The Shark moment with Bomber. It felt like something outta Donkey Kong Country. Legolas's fight with each orc is great, he's decapitating them left to right. The scenes with Gandalf in The Old Fortress were a WOW to be hold. This is the Gandalf I've wanted to see for a long time, using lots a lots of Magic attacks. He's even able to put up a good fight with Sauron.Then the 3-D. That was great, some of the best 3-D I've seen. The scene in Mirkwood Forrest with the spiders is really trippy and scary, with lots of jump scares.However, I do have a few nit picks...There are probably two or three scenes of the group giving up and then like minutes later say ""We can do it!"". It's a cliché that is mostly found in kids movies, and honestly its about as painful to sit through as ""The Liar Reviled"" cliché. Especially in one scene, that was only put there for padding and filler. Its the scene where they find the gate to the hidden passage. They say in order to enter they have to be at ""The Last Light Of Durins Day."" so they think it's the sun when it turns out its the moon.Remember the scene in Fellowship where we find out that most dwarf doors can only be seen by moonlight? Well since most of the movie going audience had probably seen that film, when that scene is on, we know most of this. But OMG, they drag it on and on when the sun sets and ""Oh Boo Hoo, its hopeless. Game Over. We done, finished. Let's cry in the corner"" I felt that whole bit could have been cut out. And you think the dwarfs would know their own designs on how these things work. They could have just said ""Hey, wait, it's the moon. Let's just wait till tonight.""Its just so painful to watch and you think ""Oh God, get on with it."" I think that's just one of a few tiny complains I had with the film. But lets get onto what I missed and the other stuff I liked.Well for one thing, when Kili get shot by a Morgal arrow, I'll admit I was shocked and hoped he'd make it though. But seeing it a second time, it's actually really funny why he can't join the group. I'll give you a hint.""I was gonna help slay a dragonuntil I took an arrow to the knee."" XD No Joke.I do wish it was allot more focused on Bilbo, since its called The Hobbit! Also the business with Sauron felt like it could have been toned down and not so obvious.I felt the way it ended was kinda Bullsh*t. It ends on a cliff hanger and cuts to black. But it didn't bother me too much.Finally, the song ""I See Fire"" What a GREAT Song. I just recently downloaded it. It fits the end and the movie so well.If I could recommend on how to see the movie, defiantly on the biggest screen possible, IMAX 3-D or AVX HFR. It truly is an experience.So overall, this movie is AWESOME! If you have no clue what I'm taking aboutread the book. 10/10. One of the series best! You've done it again Mr. Jackson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the Hobbit Trilogy,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) is easily the best movie of the Hobbit Trilogy. With that being said, there are still a number of problems with the movie, but that doesn't make the movie any less good.Positives for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013):
The movie does a fantastic job at continuing the story from the last movie and while I have my criticisms with one element in particular, overall I had a fun experience. You still have the fun banter between these characters on their journey. Everyone in the cast is still giving it their all, but the standout performance in this movie for me was easily Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug the Dragon. Cumberbatch does a fantastic job with his vocal performance as he gives Smaug the intimidation and presence that you would expect from a character like this and I say the same for his motion-capture performance which makes the character even more intimidating and terrifying when our main heroes encounter him. There are some funa action sequences with the Orcs and the fight choreography is fantastic. And finally, the third act with our heroes against Smaug was awesome.Negatives for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013):
I'm still not that invested with these characters and again the actors do a great job with their performances, I just didn't find them to be all that interesting. This is also one of those middle chapters of a movie trilogy where it wastes a lot of time just so the filmmakers could make a third movie. The first act of this movie was a little slow as our characters are walking to places because Peter Jackson said we need a third movie. Speaking of that, my final negative with this movie is that this movie doesn't feel like a complete script because the movie cuts off at a point where nothing feels resolved by the end of it.Overall, I had a great time with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013), it is the best of this trilogy. Unfortunately, it still has the same problems the first movie and the ending left me bitter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"""I do believe the worst is behind us.""","The worst of Sir Peter Jackson's Tolkien series - last year's An Unexpected Journey - is now behind us, and it was still better than most blockbusters since. The Desolation of Smaug is a rung above. Show me a more heartfelt, inventive, well cast, exciting, and sumptuously detailed realisation of a fantasy world on screen and I will eat a sorcerer's sandal.Thankfully, a year on, fans are now in a position to be able to sift out of professional reviews the irrelevant criticisms. 'These films are too long!' Not long enough for those of us who want more Middle Earth. 'Shallow CG spectacle!' cry the same critics who just hurled five stars at Gravity. 'Three films means three times the money!' Yes - and it is money some of us are more than happy to pay.So here we have the continuing adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and his crew, the Company of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage, now minus his oaken shield). Part Two of Jackson's sumptuous trilogy brings greater life and depth to John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's source novel - a tome small in width but wide in vision. The best addition is Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), an overdue she-elf heroine, who feels like a full character lifted from literature.The Battle of Five Armies always felt a bit rushed on the page, so after An Unexpected Journey it was apparent that this mighty mash-up would constitute the third movie. That leaves the middle chunk: the elves, the spiders, the lake, and that dastardly dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch). But, strangely, sadly, we're left without any of those merry songs.The dwarfs aren't such a merry bunch this time around. Bilbo's final line from the last outing echoes throughout the encounters of this second instalment: chattering spiders (arachnophobics beware); a nefarious Necromancer; and a new orc-nemesis in the form of Azog's son, Bolg (Lawrence Makoare). Like The Two Towers, a shadow has descended on this story. And, like The Two Towers, a new narrative complexity is introduced: Desolation is less linear than Journey, the action leaping between story strands like elves through woodland branches.Perhaps as a result of having (original director) Guillermo Del Toro on board as a co-writer, there are some scenes of weird horror, particularly an early sequence in Mirkwood, where VFX and editing combine to bamboozle both characters and audience. It's as if the mighty Mexican has unlocked in Jackson the playful auteur - he of Braindead, Heavenly Creatures et al - who was conspicuously absent from The Lovely Bones and reined in for King Kong.Towers was my personal favourite of the Rings trilogy, so my expectations for this bridging instalment were naturally high and mostly met. While the setpieces - particularly the head-hopping barrels sequence - are some of the most thrilling in the Middle-earth series, thematically there's nothing here to rival the bereaved drama that we once watched unfold at solemn Edoras. But it's clear that this trilogy's unique selling point is its levity. Tolkien's tome was equally whimsical but never this witty. In Freeman we have an expert comic actor, naturally likable and fussily British; almost the antidote to the imperious Hollywood superhero.The flaws are few and forgivable. Lee Pace's Thranduil comes dangerously close to the wrong side of salted ham. There are some odd narrative decisions late on - the intercutting between Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain kind of removes some of the tension from the dwarfs' ruckus with Smaug. It seems churlish to expect a symphony a year, but Howard Shore's score seems to be strangely lacking in variety this time around. And perhaps Alfrid (Ryan Gage) is no more than a cartoon version of Grima Wormtongue - although he and the Master of Laketown (Stephen Fry) are a fun combination nonetheless. Also, some will probably turn their nose up at the suggested romance between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel, but I found it quite touching.All the elements of direction, performance and design combine for a joyous romp - and, better still, we've moved beyond the Shire and Rivendell to romp in luscious locations new. It's the world's most spectacular fan fiction: Jackson and co have built a giant on the shoulders of Tolkien's Hobbit. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Bilbo: what was that? Dwarf: Bilbo that was a Dragon,"This second Installment in The Hobbit films was great and one of the best movies that I have seen, I loved everything that this movie showed us.

"A good movie, if you've never read the books.","The movie varies so much from the books, when watching the film, and trying to picture where you are in the book (which I always find myself doing) you get so lost, until you realize that 90% of the movie is just made up.Even for people who have only watched LOTR films, you wont be satisfied, as the hobbit has lost all sense of immense epicness which you get in LOTR.I like the way the added the bit with the Necromancer and explaining how he got to power, and what he was doing during the time of the Hobbit, as this explains allot to the book readers. But the epicness of Gandalf was also lost during his fight scenes with the Orcs, the Orcs looked like cartoon characters from a Disney film, whilst Gandalf seemed to of developed arthritis and fought like a 90 year old with a walking stick, not a the bad ass Gandalf the Grey we know and love.They skip the bits I was looking forward to so much, like meeting Beorn, and having to come in two at a time, like in the books, but they don't even talk to him properly. This was probably because they where being chased by Orcs throughout the WHOLE film, which is such bull s***t from the books. In the film you just get bored of orc fights, start anticipating them and soon enough dread another dull fight.Peter Jackson has disappointed me as he has included absolute awful humor, in places like Laketown, which is first not in the book, and for a reason, but it is just aimed at such a young audience... I loved Martin Freemans humorous comments, but that's enough, just like the occasional comments from Gimili and Legolass in LOTR, they are funny, in small doses.That brings me to the elves, they where great (apart from the fighting scenes, which had the same textures as a Nintendo Wii game) but elf's like Legolas' dad (Thranduil) where great, as they represented the true wood elf personality, shown in the books. The female elf Tauriel, after completely plucking her out of thin air (at least Legolass was alive during the Hobbit time), they decide to have her falling in love with a Dwarf... Yes Tolkien fans, she falls in love with a dwarf. At this point, all hope of redemption had well and truly gone.Smaug was good, but they dragged his scene on for far too long, and mocking him seem thick, with the dwarfs running around him.Last of all is character bonding, which in LOTR films was great, shown almost as well as the books, but so far in the hobbit films, it may as well be non existent. The only Dwarve I really liked was Balin, and you could see Balin and Bilbo bond, but that was about it.If you're looking for a fight filled (however good they are) film, and you haven't read the book (so you wont find yourself correcting and being confused at the majority of the film) then you will probably enjoy it. I understand that things have to change in films, but I wish Peter just kept to this LOTR film ways, keeping epicnes, a tad of comedy and only removing minimal from the books, and of course not adding loads of crap.I did enjoy it at parts, but mostly disappointed, even more than I was with the first Hobbit film.(sorry for lots of typos, couldn't be bothered to go through the whole thing!)",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"More Excitement, Less Charm","Some parts about this second installment in Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' franchise are better even than those of the excellent first one. For example, I found this film to be more intriguing and exciting than the first and the ending had me eagerly anticipating 'The Battle of the Five Armies'.However, 'The Desolation of Smaug' features some parts which feel superfluous and some characters which feel redundant as well. It feels more commercialised and less 'charming', so to speak, than the first for this reason. I did it enjoy it a lot anyway, truth be told, as I stated in my introduction. It is just not as excellent as 'An Unexpected Journey' in my humble opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The most unusual of the Tolkien/Jackson films.,"All in all, very disappointing...and here's why:-Characters were no where near as fleshed out as the characters in the LOTR films. In those films, I felt Aragon's shame. I felt Frodo's pain. And I felt Gandaulf's concern. Not so this time around, and I thought Bilbo's character was second fiddle. Unlike the Hobbit: Unexpected Journey, which was a better film than this was IMO.-No Gollum for the first time in a Hobbit/LOTR film. I love Gollum!! No Saruman, no Galadriel (except for a 2 second scene) Legolas was nice to see again, but he didn't have that chemistry with anyone, like he did with Aragon and Ghimli.-Did I mention the few extras, with no large battle scenes with hundreds of horses and REAL people!. The movie felt small. Sure, the CGI was grand, but that doesn't add to the grandeur in my opinion. A couple of ORC's might be shown in make-up, the rest behind them were CG. I liked the Spider scene, and the best scene was when Gandalf faced off against...well, let's just say, someone very familiar! But, I can honestly say that my eyes got heavy during some of these action scenes...there were way too many...and I rather get some character development instead! This film is a prime example of being over-funded.Despite my complaints, I absolutely loved Smaug. I just felt as if they spent so much money on his scenes to digitally create him that they forgot to pay Andy Serkis!! And I didn't even mention the simple, plain, mellow-dramatic soundtrack! The beautiful music of past films...don't expect to hear it in this film, or anything as masterfully composed.Nevertheless, it's hard to rate a film of this magnitude under a 6. The end was fantastic, and the last 40 minutes of the film made up for the other 2, boring hours. I am a huge fan of the LOTR films and the Hobbit so I'm too committed to rate this any lower.

The Hobbit: When a Dragon Acts Like a Diva and Dwarves Go Full Fast & Furious,"Back to Middle-earth, where our pal Bilbo finds himself amidst a merry band of bearded, grimy dwarves who have clearly never heard of a shower. Guided by Gandalf, the old wizard who never does the dirty work, they embark on an epic road trip to reclaim their stolen home. Because, yeah, these guys let a dragon squat in their mountain in ""I'll just stay for the weekend"" mode, and now they're back centuries later to demand rent. Makes sense.Between moldy forest adventures, you run into elves who are as beautiful as they are annoying. And surprise: there's even a love story between an elf and a dwarf. If you find that hard to digest, don't worry, you're not alone. It's like watching an episode of Love Island set in Skyrim. And yet, somehow, it works. Well, almost... until you remember this movie is supposed to be epic and not a Christmas TV special.Where things get really fun is when you meet Smaug. This dragon isn't just a big beast; he's a spoiled millionaire rolling in his gold like Scrooge McDuck in his money bin. The guy is so loaded he could buy an entire Quidditch team. He breathes fire, threatens everyone, and delivers lines like a dictator in the middle of an existential crisis. And let's be honest, the scene where he faces off with Bilbo as the final boss is pure art. Special shoutout to Benedict Cumberbatch's voice, which makes this dragon even more arrogant than an English teacher pretending to speak fluent Tolkien.But where Peter Jackson really hits it out of the park is with the barrel chase scene. The dwarves turn into race car drivers, like Fast & Furious but with barrels instead of cars, and it's pure madness. They jump, spin, and crash all over the place while orcs try to catch them. If you still had any doubts about the movie's epicness, this is where you realize even Vin Diesel can take a back seat with his muscle car races.And then bam, the movie ends on a cliffhanger. Just when you're all in on the action, Jackson pulls the plug like a kid unplugging your console in the middle of a Dark Souls boss fight. You're left there, mouth agape, more frustrated than ever. All you want is for Smaug to burn everything down and be done with it, but nope, you'll have to wait for the next one. Good luck until December 17, 2014, because patience is clearly not our strong suit.In short, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an XXL spectacle. Between dwarves running all over the place, a dragon acting like the king of influencers with his pile of gold, and elves giving you as much pleasure as frustration, you get a full-on sensory overload. And even if the story drags a bit, there are enough epic scenes to make up for it. So, if you love fantasy, big battles, and arrogant dragons, go for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! It exceeded my expectations!!,"It is still a bit far from the LOTR movies but not too much . The Smaug CGI is the best I've ever seen (so far) but yet other CGI at the beginning was a bit bad for WETA to have made it. It may not be 100 percent close to the book but I think Peter Jackson managed to adapt it well to the screen. I liked Tauriel even though she is'nt in the books. Legolas' appearance was a little bit forced I think the movie could have gone well without him. Martin Freeman was practically born to play Bilbo, Ian Holm was alright but Martin Freeman IS Bilbo! Benedict Cumberbatch's voice is great for Smaug,everything about Smaug was great,It's just how you would imagine Smaug to be.I gotta say I was expecting much less,and it exceeded greatly my expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great 3D and loved the new camera work features,"I had very much fun watching this sequel and seeing known locations from LotR, in fact I loved the new type of camera work and sometimes also with action cameras. It felt so grown :) And holy gr**, I've never seen a dragon so realistic and absolutely amazing animated before.Negative: - the beginning of the movie was a bit annoying for me, few times they switched too fast the camera perspective (for 3D).I thought at the beginning that this movie is just a filler between the Beginning(part 1) and the End (part3), but its definitely not! Every Sci-Fi Fan should see this amazing animations and actors.So fasten your seat belts and make you ready to see something very amazing, because this train is only stopping in a mountain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Hours later, I am still moved.","This is what a movie should be like. I have only had a few movie experiences like it before. Braveheart, The Matrix, Lord Of The Rings... You know what I am talking about. That feeling that lingers, not just for a few hours, or a few days, but that resonates and stays with you the rest of your life. It's almost sacred, when art is this good.I didn't enjoy the first Hobbit as much as the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, but this one was just as good, if not better. It had everything you could wish. Spectacular landscape settings, memorable characters, memorable romance, great story telling, high packed action, I just.... am speechless.If at all you are able to see this one in the cinema, on a great screen with great sound, you should. This one of those movies... The rare ones. The kind that places on your top ten list immediately. I will watch this movie many times. I can't wait for the extended edition.

Probably best to see this film in 3D,"I say that because I saw it in 2D and it was mostly boring.OK, so going in I had a fair idea of what this was going to be like. An overstretched telling by a director known for his special effects movies.And that what it is.There is no suspense. Lots of sword play and rumbling sounds from the audio track.Endless CGI and a dizzying string of sweeping camera movements - which perhaps come across well in 3D?There is precious little acting. Lots of reciting of words.One character named Bard is actually acted well and that makes him look a little out of place in the movie.All in all it is for the video game generation who have heard that the stories are based on a famous book - but will never read it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Part 2 is Necessary for Developing the Richness of Middle Earth,"Another triumph for Peter Jackson and his fantasy creative team! The visuals and special effects were superb, and the best dragon rendition yet. Benedict Cumber batch did a great job with this performance modeling and voice of the dragon. In addition, who could not like the beautiful New Zealand scenery reworked to make it Middle Earth.I read Tolkien when I was young, so the story is not new to me. I think Jackson's enhancements for this 2nd version of the trilogy were interesting and necessary for building the characters inner dimensions and to develop the richness of middle earth.In the 1st part of the trilogy, I loved Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin. He really captured the strength of the character and his desire to save his people, and regain their homeland. I felt the 1st sequel of this trilogy, dragged me in because of Richard's acting. He really had me believing in the quest. His relationship to Bilbo, and Gandalf gave the storyline its interest. To me the 1st part of the trilogy was all about Thorin's strength of character, and leadership as a displaced King of the Dwarf's on a quest as Tolkien wrote it. In this 2nd part of the trilogy, we begin to see the other sides of Thorin's character developed further (his pride, his inability to forgive and make concessions to the elves even though he needs their help, his despair when the keyhole could not be found) along with his strength and leadership in fighting the dragon and other creatures found along the quest. This gives Thorin's character a more well-rounded humanness with his flaws, as well as his strengths displayed. Again, I have to say so well acted by Richard Armitage, who has such a great dramatic range that he can portray any of the character he takes on well.Martin Freeman's character was also developed further his intelligence, courage and bravery as he saved the dwarfs and their quest over and over again; proving his true value to Thorin, and the quest which totally would have failed without him. Part 2 was more about Bilbo's growth, his improved relationship to Thorin, and his value to the quest.Although Richard did a great job with Thorin's character development in this part of the trilogy and Martin with Bilbo's character, and they were was still prime to this storyline. Part 2 of the trilogy was not so much about Thorin, Bilbo and Gandalf but rather it allowed Peter Jackson to introduce more of the characters and to further develop all of middle earth's richness. The enhancement of the elves storyline was such a nice addition. I loved the addition of Tauriel character so well played by Evangeline Lilly. The story did need a female heroine as it was too male dominated for us liberated women and the female children who will flock to the movie (perhaps not in Tolkien's day, but a definite necessity for the year 2014, Thank-You Peter!!!) And what woman wouldn't swoon over Orlando Bloom's Legolas and Aidan Turner's Kili, every girl loves a bit of a love story. I know the Tolkien purists will find this difficult, but to me it was such a nice addition. I also like Laketown and its characters. I think Luke Evan's character was also being set-up to take a more dominant role in Part 3. Luke did a great job playing Bard. Perhaps I'm wrong but I can see how Bard/Girion will be the one to really finally destroy the Dragon in the next part of the trilogy.So yes, this Part of the Trilogy is needed to complete the development and richness of Middle Earth, and give substance to the quest. I think Tolkien if he lived today would totally approve!If there was any flaw in this part of the trilogy, it was in its title (which like many others I totally misinterpreted the word ""Desolation"" to mean ""Destruction"" vs ""to lay to waste or deprive"" the Dragon of his treasure) My fault entirely LOL!!! But because of that lack of understanding, I was expecting the Dragon to DIE when the dwarfs covered him with gold. So until I reflected on why he was still flying away at the end, I was a bit disappointed in the ending of Part 2. It didn't seem to have the movie conclusion I expected. I suppose again this was by design so I will want to come back for part 3!! Kudos to you Peter Jackson, you do have me hooked and I will definitely be there for the conclusion. Although, I know I will miss Richard's Thorin when Part 3 concludes, for it was he that got me here to begin with and allowed me to experience the richness of Middle Earth and all its wonderful characters. Well done to all involved, and great fun for children and adults of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
How to Fight a Dragon,"I'm glad I was able to watch the first Hobbit film before watching this film. This film did not really go into much detail in explaining who the characters were and what they were up to for those who missed the first film. Though you may eventually pick the story up if you were very attentive, those with less concentration may get lost.Desolation of Smaug picks up from the first film where our hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the 13 Dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) continue on their way to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the lost Dwarf kingdom of Erebor, as Gandalf (Ian Mc Kellen) went looking for the Necromancer in Dor Guldur. Along the way, they encounter deadly Orcs, Giant Spiders and Elves who throw wrenches into their quest. With the help of Bard, a human from Laketown, they reach their destination and encounter Smaug, the fire-breathing dragon that had taken over the Dwarfs' old realm.Again like the first film, there are several memorable action sequences that make this a film to enjoy and remember. That scene with the vicious Giant Spiders will chill your spine. Then there was that entertaining and breathtaking sequence where the Dwarfs were escaping on wooden barrels down a river while being attacked by Orcs, then the elegant Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and she-elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) come to their aid with their awesome bow and arrow skills.Most of all though, this film will be most remembered for Smaug himself. The special visual effect was very convincing that this was a living breathing beast. Its voice, lent by the versatile Mr. Benjamin Cumberbatch, is tauntingly sinister and evil. That entire last hour with Smaug as the Dwarfs were doing all they can within their ingenuity and ability to kill him was worth the price of admission in itself.The story telling of Peter Jackson dragged or stretched on a lot of occasions during the film, but you will eventually get your bearings straight when the next scene comes on. Editing could have been more judicious. A romance angle was introduced by Jackson where there was none in the book, which though not really necessary, was not distracting at all from the main story.The cinematography was as usual top-notch all throughout, though the CGI was overwhelming. The production design was hiked up another full level from the first film with such spectacular sets as the Elves lair and dungeons, the Lake town and the lost glory that was Erebor. The sound and the music were all very effective in establishing mood and atmosphere.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Breathtaking Tolkien,"When Jackson adventured making ""The Hobbit"" a film in three parts, I thought it was doomed to be overkill. It was actually, in contrast to The lord of the Rings, a mere children's fairytale. But I am overwhelmed: Jackson has achieved to lift ""The Hobbit"" to almost rival The Lord of the Rings in grandeur, drama and epic storytelling, much more than even Tolkien had imagined, I think, when he wrote it. The deep and weighty matters of the world are understated, but lurks under the surface. The desolation of Smaug is a breathtaking journey. Starting with the meeting with the mysterious Beorn, the clamp and misty Mirkwood, the meeting with the strange and hostile wood-elves and the incredible hunt of the hobbits in barrels on the the wild river. Jacksons adding of a little love story between an elf and a dwarf is a little masterpiece, and adds only to stress Tolkiens points in the overall theme of middle-earth. The nearly Dickensy description of Lake-town urges for a deeper investigation. And in the end, the grandiose meeting with Smaug, with all the layers of Tolkiens description of the little hobbit's meeting with the great cunning dragon. Every scene is a masterpiece in itself. The only minus: The scene of the dragon pursuing the dwarfs in Eriador is far too long! I hope very much, that Peter Jackson has prepared a spectacular film number three, which will wind up all the threads from the six films, and make this an epic masterpiece to stand out in film history..

Peter Jackson fell short of capturing the essence of Tolkien's masterpiece.,"Not much of this film is on par with the book. Being a fan I took the film for what it was, Peter Jackson playing around with his new digital equipment and as a result losing focus of the essence that Tolkien captured in the original novel. Imax 3d is an experience for sure, however due to it's faster frame rate and extreme resolution, some of the acting looks poor and some of the digital scenes look fake. Smaug the dragon is very impressive, those scenes alone are worth seeing the film. Jacskon's best achievement in this film is capturing the magnificent creature and keeping it on par with the book, it far proceeded what I expected the dragon to be, and yes, Jackson adds some scenes that are not on par with the book under the mountain. Smaug should be up for an Oscar with his performance. Despite smaug, the film overall once again, left me unsatisfied and fell short of the classical masterpiece published in 1932. For the average movie goer this film should make your B or A list, but for the avid fan of middle earth it will disappoint.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A human journey,"And so the journey continues. With The Desolation of Smaug, Peter Jackson has now presented the middle part of his trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. A difficult task as it has to serve as a bridge between the beginning and the end of the story but also be capable of standing on its own. In his Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson decided to narrow the view, focus on key episodes and thus offer a contrast from the panoramic vision of parts one and three. Still, The Two Towers was arguably the weakest installment of the series. This time, Jackson again departs from the style and focus of the first part: Whereas there he adopted a much slower pace, allowed scenes to play out for as long as they could and chose a much more comical as well as fairy-tale like tone, he now gets down to business. The Desolation of Smaug is faster, narratively tighter and way more serious than An Unexpected Journey. Thus, it is much closer to The Lord of the Rings.As it is meant to be. Much more so than I the first part, Jackson adds characters and story lines not in the book that serve one purpose mostly: embed the adventure tale in a darker, larger one, an approaching battle of good and evil. So the film basically tells two stories: that of the company of dwarfs and a hobbit to reclaim the old dwarf kingdom from a dragon and the buildup to the events of the earlier trilogy. For much of the film the two strands run parallel to each other, but Jackson succeeds, as it goes on, to atmospherically intertwine them, lifting the adventure tale to a battle in a much bigger war. This does not go without some arm twisting and results in a not entirely consistent film but it works better and better as it progresses, suddenly infusing the smaller story with an importance it might not have had before.As the tale gets more serious, so do the characters, first and foremost hobbit Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman. His is a true coming-of-age story (despite his advanced age), enfolding like a Bildungsroman. It is fascinating to watch Freeman subtly add muscle and courage to his character, augment the comfort-loving Bilbo with a maturity he did not have in the first firm. For this is still a story of the most unlikely of heroes, a – literally – little man rising to the stature he needs to make himself and those in his charge survive. The darker the surroundings, the brighter his light shines and the more he can inspire those around him. Jackson's strength lies in creating three-dimensional characters in just a few sketches – and Freeman is the perfect actor to achieve this.Sure, not everything works out. Such as the addition of the elvish woman Tauriel and her love story with dwarf Kili. This adds little to an otherwise very tightly-knit narrative, threatening to derail it occasionally. On the other hand, Jackson's obvious love for the powers of the current generation of CGI is less pervasive here. The visual effects are mind-boggling again, but they serve the story. Easily Jackson moves from place to place, episode to episode without any sense of the fragmentary. There is a wholeness to this that the first part lacked, everything belongs together, woven delicately into a rich and fascinating texture. Far from being a stretch, embedding the tale into what is basically the eternal struggle of life, to live and make sense of it, makes the film stronger and the individual journey at its hard even stronger. For this is what the film is: a tale of human perseverance, far from naïve but not without optimism. This way, The Hobbit becomes a parable of human life. And a convincing one, too.http://www.stagescreen.de",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Awesome Addition To Jackson's Middle Earth!,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a film directed by Peter Jackson, and stars Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Ian McKellen and Benedict Cumberbatch. The film picks up from where the previous installment, An Unexpected Journey, left off, with Bilbo, Gandalf and the dwarfs venturing to Erebor. Along the way, they meet elves, orcs and eventually, a great dragon, in one hell of an adventure!I wasn't a big fan of An Unexpected Journey. It didn't, to me at least, feel like a Lord of the Rings film. It certainly wasn't bad; it just didn't compare to the trilogy that we saw beforehands. I gave it a 6.8. An admirable, but disappointing score for a film so hyped. Desolation of Smaug, on the other hand, feels like a proper Jackson Middle-Earth film. It's grand, emotional, epic and ultimately, a bliss to watch. We finally get into a rhythm which I enjoy, and this time, we don't have to sit through half an hour of Shire to get to the good stuff. We can dive in from the word go!Performance wise, this film does really well. Martin Freeman is fantastic as Bilbo Baggins, although he doesn't get nearly as much time to himself on screen as he did in Unexpected Journey, to my disappointment. It's not too much of a problem, fortunately, because the rest of the cast performs pretty damn well! Ian McKellen as Gandalf never fails! He's amazing as an old, but certainly badass wizard, who actually gets to do some badass action scenes here, unlike Unexpected Journey! And Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield... He was formidable and awesome in the previous installment, but here, he really stands out as the leader. The rest of the dwarfs do well, as well as the rest of the ensemble. Performance wise, I think this is a really awesome film!The score... Something I have mixed feelings about. As a solo listen, it's not fantastic. Not nearly as good as Unexpected Journey or any of the Lord of the Rings scores, although it does fairly well within the film. It conveys dread, which is a real theme within the film, so on that count, Howard Shore has excelled. The post credits song, I See Fire by Ed Sheeran is something I truly adore! I think Peter Jackson made the right call on getting Sheeran to give us a song which wrapped up the film in spectacular fashion!I love where the story goes here. Desolation feels a little like Two Towers, for me. They just get straight into the thick of it from the beginning, run with it, and send you off on some really awesome notes, leaving you anticipating the next film. I loved seeing Bilbo become a popular figure in this group in which he originally was a complete outcast from. From saving the group in a fight, to figuring out a puzzle, to, you know, running into a mountain in which an incredibly dangerous, gigantic, powerful dragon lays, Bilbo helps the group out and gets his hands dirty, which was good to see. I certainly liked the pacing, as well. I feel like Jackson can make long, drawn out scenes work very well, and this film is a perfect display of that. From beginning to end, this film keeps you invested, interested, and ultimately, incredibly entertained!I do have some specific positives and negatives that I feel I really do need to talk about. Smaug the dragon. Honestly... One of the coolest things in general, I've seen from a film in 2013. Benedict Cumberbatch as the dragon was a stroke of genius, and to be honest, it made the character so much more menacing than he should've been. When Smaug crawls out from under his pits of gold, it literally takes your breath away. Smaug is huge, terrifying and quite mesmerising. He easily sold the show for me. To add to this, I also found the action so much more better than the action in the previous installment. Whilst this film does defy logic and physics a few times, it does turn a little grittier than An Unexpected Journey, which refused to cut off a single head! How dare Jackson! Fortunately, we get some brutal, awesome action here, that remedies the lack of brutality An Unexpected Journey had. On the negative side, I do have a problem with the character of Tauriel. As we all know, Jackson added her in despite the fact that she wasn't included in the source material. Was that a good move? I don't think so, unfortunately. Yes, she was formidable and she was slightly interesting, but when she suddenly falls for a dwarf, I just couldn't take it seriously! It was a bad story telling decision, and one that really didn't need to happen! As well as my hate towards Tauriel, I do have a problem with a little of the CGI. WETA seem to have stuffed up various shots, and there were a few CGI characters which felt so disconnected to this world that Jackson had created. Fortunately, WETA did very well for the majority of the running time. It was just a few stuff ups here and there that bugged me a little.In conclusion, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a powerful, awesome addition to the Peter Jackson Middle Earth film collection. The film advances all the characters, includes some awesome action and gives us one of the best CGI monsters I've ever seen in Smaug. Jackson may have stuffed up at few points, and they aren't all forgettable; nonetheless, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Desolation of Smaug is a wonderful film, and one of the best films of 2013!9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular!,"Nr 1 was spectacular. This one was SPECTACULAR with capital letters. It felt like 5 hrs but not because it was boring. Oh no, on the contrary. It felt longer because there simply was so much going on. Just like in the old Republic serials there seemed to be a spectacular action scene almost every 5 minutes. I may be wrong, but I wonder if this one even had almost as much action as the 3 LOTR movies taken together. The rest was magnificent, too. The characters, sets and locations etc. I just can't understand HOW they could pull off something as spectacular as this.

I love how Jackson can manage to combine ancient feels from Tolkien and fresh action installment together so tasteful. Compliment to VFX and CGI.However, I'm a hardcore book fan my self,and I worship Tolkien's work a lot. But you have to understand one thing before go see the movie ,is that 'This is not 80% Tolkien', it's Jackson 60% + Tolkien 40% together.So DOS is the new taste of middle-earth which I think a lot of people are longing to experience too. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
THAT Was a Dragon,"""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is the quintessential fantasy movie, with quests, monsters, fair maidens, heroes, villains, revenge, intrigue, magic, dungeons, and, of course, a dragon. All of these elements are present in Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"" (with the exception of the ""fair maiden"", that is), but not all of them are there throughout the novel; so, in trying to turn one novel into three movies, Peter Jackson had to stretch a lot of elements across all three movies, and introduce whole new elements in some places. It's less of a problem with ""Desolation of Smaug"" than it was with ""An Unexpected Journey"", which is partly why people say this film is superior to that one; but it's still a problem.Jackson has taken some serious flack for reusing characters from The Lord of the Rings in a trilogy based on a novel that never even mentioned them. But, there is a valid and even important point to adding these characters. In the novel ""The Hobbit"", when the company enters Mirkwood, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) leaves them, claiming he has business elsewhere. While this may seem like a vague justification to give Bilbo an excuse to step up, Tolkien did actually have something important for Gandalf to do at the time. He leaves to investigate reports of a Necromancer in the crumbling stronghold of Dol Guldur. Many dark creatures in Middle Earth have a connection to this place, as you'll see in DoS. Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) alerted the White Council to the Necromancer's plotting in AUJ, which is why we see them all together there, and why Gandalf travels to Dol Guldur in this film. I mention this to show that not everything Jackson does in the Hobbit films is about pandering.On the other hand, some of what he does is all about pandering. While Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and company are battling Spiders in Mirkwood, they are ""saved"" by Wood Elves, who promptly take them all prisoner as trespassers. Included among the Elves is Legolas, who, in the Tolkienverse, is the son of King Thranduil (Lee Pace), so at least there's a logical explanation for him being there. But the female warrior Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) is completely new.I understand that Tolkien didn't include a lot of female characters in his stories. But the least you could do is not include a woman who has only two roles to fill, one of them being purely romantic. Sure, Tauriel is seen slaughtering at least as many orcs as Legolas, but that doesn't make her a strong character; that just makes her a character who happens to have a talent for killing.Her other role was, apparently, being in love with Legolas; and with the Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner). Between the awkward flirting with both men, the lack of any substantive contribution to the narrative, and Jackson shoehorning in a brand new subplot for Kili just so Tauriel would have some more screen time in the final act of the film, there's no real reason why her character should have been added to DoS.The main problem I had with Tauriel is she seemed completely out of place in the narrative, and not because she had never been there before. They interspersed tense and dramatic moments between Bilbo and the dragon Smaug with ""romantic"" and, frankly, quite silly moments between Tauriel and Kili. If they had eliminated the ""love triangle"" between Tauriel, Kili, and Legolas, even if they had left in the romance angle between her and Legolas, then it wouldn't have wrenchingly distracted from what were, in my opinion, the most powerful moments of the film.Setting aside all the ""extra"" plot lines, whether Tolkien intended for them to exist or not, the ""Hobbit"" parts of the film were, in a word, fantastic. The way they wrote and handled the scenes with the Spiders, the escape from the Wood Elves' dungeon, and the climactic confrontation with the magnificent Smaug were my favorite moments, and Freeman's Bilbo virtually carried every scene. He melded tension, suspense, and even humor into a performance that kept me grinning from ear to ear.Smaug the Golden, the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities, in no way disappointed me. Dragons are magnificent creatures, and Smaug has set the standard for dragons for over 75 years now. Benedict Cumberbatch's voice undoubtedly lent to the powerful portrayal, but there's nothing that quite matches simply seeing the massive beast on the screen, emerging from beneath a sea of gold and jewels (with a cowering hobbit in the center adding no small amount to the feeling of awe at the sight). And to hear the words, only slightly altered from Tolkien's original text, as Smaug taunts Bilbo with his insignificance, teasing him with the prospect of near-instantaneous destruction, and even taking time to instill a sense of doubt in the hobbit's mind about his companions, the conspicuously reluctant-to-enter Dwarfs. I could watch the film over and over just to see Smaug again.I shook my head several times throughout the film, though not as much as during the first film. I think some scenes (and characters, obviously) just didn't belong. But, some scenes that Jackson added helped the movie, and the larger narrative of the trilogy. And, as I cannot say enough times, the dragon was incredible. Much more so than after An Unexpected Journey, I'm looking forward to the next film.(Read the full review at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2013/12/that-was-a-dragon/)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Well paced and action packed,"""Desolation of Smaug"" picks up the proceedings quickly unlike ""An Unexpected Journey"" where much of the time has been wasted. DoS is well paced and action packed compared to AUJ.Visually the film is stunning. It takes us through the dark forest, Kingdom of Elves, the beauty of Lake town and the grandeur of Erebor.Its no wonder the film feels a bit stretched because these Hobbit films have thin story lines. Of course we don't expect much from them because its a small book. Smaug episode was promising but it takes too much of time for the final act.Gandalf didn't have much screen presence this time. Its the Elves leaded by Legolas that bring smartness to the film and Tauriel is a scene stealer. In the end the Dwarfs, Gandalf, Elves, Orcs, Smaug were thrown to different places so they have to get together for ""There and Back Again"". 'Arkenstone' and 'Black arrow' will have much to play in the grand finale.Its always a treat to watch middle-earth films but Mr.Jackson please do not stretch ""The Hobbits"", they aren't ""The Lord of the Rings"".Overall, DoS is a better film than AUJ.

"An improved, but still not at its best movie","Again, we are back into the Middle Earth. Nothing could be more exciting than this! After the disappointment of watching the unexpected journey, this time, I just went in and tried and enjoy, and it did not disappoint. I think there is a few reasons for that I am convinced this one is an improvement. 1.) The storyline has a greater diversity, since more and more characters would get involved. 2.) All the characters got a good development of who they really are. 3.) The ambition of Jackson finally makes it an independent trilogy. Obviously, in the Unexpected Journey, there are too much connection Jackson tried to build between LOTR, and it turned out somehow weird. This time, everything looks in place. A 60 years younger (in reality, an older Bloom) Legolas somehow impressed me! And the lack of romance things in Tolkien's story, definitely had its improvement here, although somewhat unnatural. Of course, there are more than a few things you can be unhappy about, like the music (and oh god, when will there be such a masterpiece again like LOTR?). But overall, I could see Jackson is finally trying to get on his new trilogy and make some attempts for new elements of his film making, rather than trying to copy the old things he did, which is nice to see. Next year, hopefully we will see a great ending. Personally I do not hope it can top LOTR anymore, because, to be fair, it is impossible....",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good quality-whaaat,"Firstly I want to say, I am an enormously fan of Tolkien and his books, and all the films too. I know everyone think the first movie was a little boring and less interesting than what was about to come in the second and third. What I think is, the first movie was excellent.When I saw the Desolation of Smaug I don't know how I felt afterwards, the watching experience was not as I expected. I know there's been talking about Peter Jackson's picture resolution and HD quality but I didn't quite enjoy the experience. The scenes looked weird and disturbed and badly executed. The acting felt weird, and the mood of the previous films was totally missing. The music was way too dramatic, and it didn't match, as I would have wanted it to, with the scenes and happenings. I don't know if it was my bad luck, but it kind of ruined the experience. I think I'll go see it in 2D, and maybe then it'll get better.That said, I really liked the film, I thought it was thrilling and exciting, I especially want to praise the scene where Bilbo enters the mountain and have a chat with Smaug. That was my favorite part of the movie, Smaug was insanely good made, and I just loved that part.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Hobbit 2: Long, boring, redundant and forgettable","It took me about two days to go through this movie. I saw half one night, got tired and watched the rest the next day. Sadly it was a very forgetful experience. It seemed like the whole movie was about the Dwarfs getting captured, miraculously escaping, getting captured again, magically escaping, getting captured once again, escaping somehow, etc. It just got too redundant quickly. Not to mention the movie is well over an hour longer than it should have been. When it ended I was relieved, kinda like the feeling you get when you leave the DMV after waiting around all day to get your license or registration renewed.Jackson really blew it with this movie. My wife, who loved LOTR fell asleep through this movie. She didn't care what happened at the end.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Much more LotR-esque!,"MILD SPOILERS! For me there were three issues with An Unexpected Journey, first, the uneven pacing, second, the silly tone, and third, bloodless swords and weapons (which for whatever reason just irritates me in many a fantasy movies, but hey, Lord of the Rings had bloody weapons). As far as I'm concerned, all was fixed in The Desolation of Smaug, except maybe the latter even though the violence is really ramped up here. After seeing it last night I've come up with two things that I really disliked, though one is minor; first, there are some terrible GoPro POV style shots in the water with the barrels, and second, Azog and now Bolg, are simply pitiful villains. But really, this was so much better than the first and more akin to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I adore.My favorite scenes were all the stuff with Gandalf in Dul Guldur, just badass, and also Smaug and Bilbo, very tense actually, I thought. Oh also, the scene where a baby spider gets close to the ring and Bilbo goes crazy on it, good stuff. Beorn was pretty cool too, and I wish we spent a bit more time with him. A lot more character development with the dwarfs (and others) happens here too, I still wish Bofur would speak in Dwarvish though! Another plus, multiple stories/perspectives! I think that's something that was also probably sorely missing in An Unexpected Journey. So yes, the dwarfs get split up, there's Tauriel and Legolas, Bard, Gandalf, and Bilbo separated with Smaug for a time. It made things all the more grand. Last bit, this is much darker too. More violence, darker themes, and even a literal darker colour palette, which I really prefer, as stated.The Fellowship of the Ring: 9.0 The Two Towers: 8.9 The Return of the King: 9.5 An Unexpected Journey: 8.3 The Desolation of Smaug: 9.2A very solid second entry, I and many others are eagerly awaiting There and Back Again!

A Wonderful Follow Up To The First Movie,"I read these stories when I was in High School in the 80's, and they weren't new at that time. The movies followed some 20 to 30 years after that. I have been immensely entertained by all of them, and think that it is a testimony to Tolkien's stories that such movies could be made and be so successful on all levels, financially, popularity etc. The books are books, the movies are movies, true fans I imagine had images in their minds what Bag End and all the rest of Middle Earth must look like, and that is the wonder of the truly fantastic stories. And I have to confess, the first time the scene rolled up of the path leading to Bag End in the Fellowship of the Ring, my eyes softened and my breath was taken. Wow, absolutely beautiful and amazing. Was it exactly like the images I formed in the 80's, well no, but it certainly wasn't a mediocre effort and it was truly wonderful. Movies don't follow books, there simply isn't enough screen time, and they do cost a substantial amount of money and work to bring to the screen. There success has proved it was worth the investment, and the creators are to congratulated for bringing them to us. For all who can do nothing but complain about what you see in the movie, no one is stopping you from doing it the way you think it should be done, but to complain as you do is an insult to the rest of us who are thrilled to have lived to see the stories come to the screen at all. Your loathing of the movie and your ridicule suggest that you didn't go to enjoy a movie, but to nitpick at everything about it that deviated from the book and suggest that if we left the movie having had a terrific time watching it that we couldn't possibly be fans of the books is a sad event. I went, I enjoyed it immensely, and my books still have a prominent place on my bookshelf in my bedroom. If you think that you can do better, go for it, fans will go see it, and if you stick to the books more closely then you can be at peace. Good luck with your financing and all, it is, after all, designed to provide entertainment and make money, and you'll need more than a movie admission to bring your version to us on the big screen. Sure, I would have liked to see Tom Bombadil in FOTR, and others things that didn't make it in to the various movies, and I am sure that all of this was thought out very carefully, and that those in charge did the best they could to satisfy all the requirements of the project, and I am delighted that it happened at all. Can't wait for the conclusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hobbit comes of age !,"Well, to start with, let me answer the most fundamental question which everybody's been asking. Is this movie better than the first Hobbit? The answer is Err  you will find below :) It's very difficult to make sequels which are better or at least on par with the original movie and you can imagine the herculean task it takes to make not just one but multiple sequels (and prequels too) which arguable are as good if not better. Only a couple of directors can do that and without a doubt Peter Jackson is one of them. LOTR series was an outstanding success and one of the major reasons for that is every time a sequel is released it didn't only exceed the expectations of the viewers and critics alike but it also remained true to the original story. May be it's due to the fact that Peter directs all the movies at once and then splits it into three during the post productions. Okay..hmm. So now, what about the Hobbit movies? Hobbit movies brings with them an aura of their own, different from the LOTR but as much immersive. Everyone would like to see middle earth more but without getting bored. An important thing to note is that although, Hobbit and LOTR may be connected in more than one way, they are as different as it can be. Peter again takes us through the amazing places (real or CGI?) but each one of them different from what that has already been shown. Take an example, Lake Town which feels like Rohan from the LOTR with its decaying ruler and all that but that's where the similarity stops. As the case with earlier movies, you will feel that you have actually transcended into a different world with its own chaos.The movie starts immediately after the events of the last Hobbit movie. Thorin and the gang continues with their quest of the Misty Mountains with Gandalf and Master Bilbo and in the process makes few friends and foes (more foes actually). Last time, Bilbo found his courage (a la The Ring) and this time he makes sure to use it to the fullest, there were quite a few instances where Bilbo's obsession with the Ring is shown but then, he also utilizes it to bail himself and the Thorin company out at the same time. After going through elves, human settlements they finally reach Dragon's Dungeon, and oh boy! Smaug is truly stupendous. You need to see it to believe it. Many people criticize HFR but in fact, the true beauty of the work that is gone in making the movie can only be appreciated when you watch this movie at 48FPS. Every frame looks so crisp and clear as if you are standing right in front of them. The river stream chase is so masterfully done that it would surely put many a car chases to shame. There is may be one another reason why Peter went HFR and that is, he is so confident with the CGI work that is done on the films, that he can show you the movie in the clearest way possible. I am not exaggerating but the CGI work is best, in fact better than the last movie. It's very sharp and incredibly life like. The dialogs could have been better and the scenes look like a bit stretched sometimes, but then when you have a visual spectacular going on, it can compensate that a bit. The film follows the basic modus operandi as with the previous movies. There are parallel stories which pan out and finally start merging in to a big climax and that's exactly what is going to happen in the next. The buildup is pretty awesome this time and I would say better than the Two Towers and the next movie is surely going to be an epic finale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Jackson Back On Form. An Easy 10.,"Although I enjoyed Jackson initial return to Middle Earth The Hobbit:the desolation of Smaug is undoubtedly a vast improvement on its predecessor, as was the case with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Now the Hobbit has found its feet with in middle earth every element of the film has grown stronger, it is compelling from beginning to end with some of the greatest fight sequences Middle Earth has ever seen of which are both funny and technically superb. Thankfully there is no milling around in hobbit hole's for unnecessary amounts of time in this film.Although the Tolkien lovers will most likely disapprove of Legolas and Tauriel making an unscheduled appearance I personally found both characters a very gratifying addition to the narrative as undoubtedly many of the best action sequences fell to the elf duo. Legolas's presence provides a sense of nostalgic glee as witnessing the elf glide across a battlefield brings back memories of Helms Deep and the fields of Pelennor; although it must be said the action sequences in the Hobbit certainly stand on their own two feet and do not leave any viewer wanting. If anything technically Jackson has improved swapping sheer numbers for intricate choreography.Although evident in his first outing as Bilbo Baggins casting Martin Freeman as the unwilling adventurer was truly a master stroke. In his second epic excursion into Middle Earth he has has grown yet further into the role. He plays the part superbly capturing the vulnerable but brave hobbit who if you do not already, will love by the end. His encounter with Smaug is enthralling as Freeman captures the moment perfectly, he is a pleasure to watch and if anything the encounter doest go on for long enough. Jackson certainly found the perfect Bilbo.Peter Jackson's Middle Earth is as beautiful and captivating as ever with the cinematography on this picture possibly outdoing even that of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. You find yourself unable to take your eyes off the screen for even a second as every change of setting provides something new and stunning to look at, certainly the crispness of the visuals benefit from the film being shot at 48 frames per second.This film provides great entertainment with massive spiders and literally barrel's of laughs, a must watch. It gets a 10 from me for sheer entertainment, a brilliant return to Middle Earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Average action flick in great Middle-Earth setting,"Absolutely fail to compare with original LOTR trilogy. In Hobbit 2 there are too much CGI, and, for my surprise, it wasn't the best kind of CGI. Every action scene looks clearly CGIish, fishy. Aimation could be so much better, it feels SUPER cheap. I didn't get ANY fun from action scenes. They all are predictable, repetitive, dull.The story - same here, characters try to joke, but they fail miserably, there is not real depth in characters. This ""Finding his father"" story weren't in the book, Dwarwes just wanted their gold back - and it would be better in movie to add a little grey color to characters.I can't find anything spectacular about this movie. Just an average action flick in much-loved Middle Earth universe - that's why i rated it not 5/10, but 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"5+ hours so far, with more to come.","Peter Jackson continues to stretch out Tolkein's timeless classic, no doubt building himself a pile of treasure almost as impressive as that of Smaug in the process. In this second part of three, the thirteen dwarfs, accompanied by one brave hobbit, continue their quest to reclaim their homeland of Erebor and retrieve the precious hoard guarded there by an ancient evil dragon. On their way, they are attacked by giant spiders in the forest of Mirkwood, escape from the woodland elves in barrels, travel to Laketown and find their way into the heart of the Lonely Mountain to confront the mighty fire breathing reptile. Plus lots of other stuff that wasn't written by Tolkein.With the rather slight book (at least when compared to LOTR) being turned into a trilogy, there is a lot here that has been completely made-up by Jackson and company, a fact that will no doubt upset many Tolkein purists. Those viewers who are not that bothered about the additional new material might be rankled by the overuse of CGI, the overblown set pieces that see our death-defying heroes surviving numerous dangers against the odds, and an unnecessary romance. Anyone not bothered by these trifling matters will probably have a whale of a time, happily sitting through all 161 minutes with a big dumb smile on their face; I wish I could be so easily pleased.To be fair, I did have a marginally better time with this part than I did with An Unexpected Journey: there's not so much puerile humour or singing this time around, there are no silly battling stone-giants, and my favourite bit of the book—the barrel escape—is in this chapter (although Jackson does his best to muck it up by having the dwarfs pursued by orcs along the way). Overall, however, I still consider this another disappointment from the once great director, a ridiculously padded adventure that could have and should have been absolutely awesome, but which ends on a particularly duff note by pointlessly drawing out the confrontation between Bilbo and Smaug by chucking those bloody dwarfs into the mix for an over-the-top CGI-fest of a finalé.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The sounds of Tolkien shouting ""Fool of a Took!"" from his grave won't be worrying Jackson","When we finally get to meet the magnificent dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, at the climax of Peter Jackson's second instalment of his The Hobbit trilogy, we find him curled up beneath an enormous stash of gold coins and jewels, blissfully in the land of nod. After sitting through over two hours of this slog of a film, it's precisely where I wished I was. The Desolation of Smaug is yet further evidence that 9 hours worth of movies is not needed for Tolkien's delightful - and slim - novel. It feels like - to quote Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins from The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) - thin, like butter scraped over too much bread.The story picks up as the dwarfs evade capture from the orc general Azog (Manu Bennett) and seek refuge in the home of Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), a skin-changer who often takes the form of a giant bear. Setting of again towards Erebor to reclaim the dwarfs homeland, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) et al reach the Elven forest of Mirkwood. Gandalf departs to further investigate the strange goings-on at Dol Gondur, where the mysterious necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch) seems to be building an army of sorts. In Mirkwood, the dwarfs meet the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom), who imprison the dwarfs following an altercation.The Desolation of Smaug is simply a collection of things that happen - not much has a relevant impact on the story, nor does it develop any of the characters or make much of the film particularly interesting to watch. It's a near-3 hour film that barely has any time for its characters, preferring instead to repeatedly throw them into situations that apparently call for an extended, CGI-laden action sequence. It felt very much like a Middle Earth Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) - vacant and almost soulless. The Lord of the Rings trilogy used CGI when it had to, and chose instead to welcome the natural beauty of the New Zealand landscape. And thanks to some gorgeous set design for the interiors, it felt like you could reach out and touch Middle Earth. Here, everything feels digital.There's also too much padding. When the dwarfs arrive in Lake Town, smuggled in by the revolutionary-type Bard (Luke Evans), it develops a strange love-triangle between dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), elf-warrior Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas. This can be argued as character development for one of the much underdeveloped dwarfs, but its portrayed so blandly that it's nothing more of a distraction to Bilbo and Thorin finally encountering Smaug. Bard himself is also relatively one-dimensional, not much more than a rugged face that has been spawned by destiny - a reluctant hero that has chosen a different path to the one that seems lined up for him. Sound familiar?It's not all bad of course, so although Peter Jackson has been caught up in the special-effects machine, he still shows his talent for the spectacle with one action scene that sees the dwarfs escape Mirkwood and a micro army of rampant orcs in barrels down a river. It is a silly, overblown set-piece, but it proves funny and thrilling, a genuinely exciting highlight within one of the film's most drawn-out chapters. Also, Smaug himself doesn't disappoint. Although he's entirely CGI, the giant beast is entirely real and, thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch, uncomfortably menacing. His exchanges with Bilbo are the movie's best moments, as they both try and outsmart each other with words and tricks. Which makes it all the more disappointing when the film movies into yet another overwrought action scene.I'm sure the obvious lack of heart and storytelling quality won't worry the producers (the film is already the 49th highest-grossing film of all time), nor will it Peter Jackson. This adaptation is now so far removed from the book's original vision that I don't think the sounds of Tolkien shouting ""Fool of a Took!"" in his grave will be giving Jackson sleepless nights. I remember in 2003, when The Return of the King (2003) was reaching its first climax at three hours, my bum was glued to the seat and my palms were sweaty, hit with the tragic realisation that this film trilogy would soon be over and all I had to look forward to was the Extended Edition DVD. At the 2 hour mark of The Desolation of Smaug, my bum was numb, I was shifting in my seat, and I was wondering what food I had in the fridge for later.

Exciting Film,"This 2nd Hobbit film is an exciting continuation of the first Hobbit film - lots of action to go with the fantasy and adventure in this installment. I loved it! After Gandalf leaves them behind for another quest, Bilbo, Thorin and the rest of the Dwarfs end up coming face to face with the wood-elves king Thranduil, his son Legolas and Tauriel - after escaping the clutches of king Thranduil, Bilbo and the dwarfs meet a bargeman called Bard who smuggles them into Laketown - some scuffing goes and and they finally reach their destination: The Lonely Mountain. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes to Dol Guldur - Sauron's keep in Mirkwood to find out if the enemy (Sauron) has indeed come back to take over Middle Earth. Gandalf is held captive there and watches helplessly as the orcs descend on Lake Town at the foot of the Lonely Mountain.

Fun but Fruitless Fantasy; Bilbo's Second Ride is Quite Fluffy,"The jist of this one? A lightweight fantasy trifle with an all-world effects budget and a seriously inflated sense of self-worth. There's a classical adventure formula stuffed snugly at the core of this letterbox behemoth, but it's so thoroughly entrenched in a world of fluff and fat that it can sometimes be difficult to keep in view. A certain degree of self-indulgence for the sake of fan service and depth can be excused. In fact, The Hobbit's light moments of fancy are where it has the most fun, showing off the strange little touches and quirks that make Middle Earth the puzzling, appetizing realm it truly is. At some point it's time to cut to the chase, though, and like a drunken slacker on holiday, this picture often hasn't the willpower to heed that call. For a hundred-thirty minutes it lingers, drowning its audience with padding, and just as the getting's finally getting, er, got... we slam headfirst into a flat black wall dubbed ""to be continued."" It has its strengths: the aforementioned visuals are a true revelation, the cast is wildly varied and dazzlingly colorful, and the dragon at the center of it all is truly awe-inspiring, a sight well worth seeing. The weaknesses, however, are just as numerous: most of the action scenes are carried-away bits of unreal CGI madness, it's overloaded with cameos and redundant, over-acted characters, and the constant pacing issues are downright crippling. As daydreams go, it's magnificent. A complete story it isn't, though, and it's rife with holes and faults.

Reals fans will be disappointed,"It physically pains me to give a Tolkien film less than 9, but this movie was closer to a 6.5.Gripes 1) The most overpowering is also not new: the story told in this film doesn't match the one in the book.To get that mini-epic feel from an ambling adventure story the pacing is relentless. It's like being on a 5 day tour of 12 countries around Europe. Where Thorin and Co. spend weeks recuperating in the book, they spend a single night in the film. There is no sense of wonder, only urgent CGI action.2) These prequels are destroying the continuity of wonderful Middle Earth created in the trilogy.Honoring the history and depth of ME, in LOTR all the races clearly have different origins, folklore, language and civilization.Due to what I can only imagine as temporary insanity, this film consistently humanized the enemy, sometimes in direct conflict with the book. Though the Goblin King in the first movie was probably the worst offender, there are several scenes in this film where untranslated orc grunting, mob mentality or simple snarling would be better than English voices coming out of monster mouths. (And no, I'm not referring to the dragon who was played perfectly)3) Extra characters that hurt more than they helped.The Hobbit is supposed to be about the hobbit. And Bilbo absolutely crushes it in the book. Time after time he gets the dwarfs out of scrapes with no loop holes and stacked odds. And he does it by being clever and quick and all kinds of lovable underdog ways. He becomes the quiet hero.Don't get me wrong--I'm happy we got the elves. Tauriel is utterly a dazzling addition to the story that fits seamlessly into Middle Earth. Watching Legolas in action is pure satisfaction. You don't realize how much you missed him until you see the iconic jump-shots with his old Mirkwood bow. But so much of the flash and glory was given to the elves at the expense of Bilbo. The connection to our unlikely hero was traded for blatant fan-pandering where pretty people kill a lot of orcs really, really well.I want to love this movie that way I love the annually watched extended LOTR films.

"Extravagant, Brilliant, Mesmerizing.","It rarely happens that you return back to a franchise and you are as mesmerised by it as you were the first time around, achieving that feat 5th time in a row is outstanding in itself, and Peter Jackson does it with such ease and charm that one is left breathless. The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug, is one extravagant adventure that is a treat for your eyes. The camera catches every scene every piece of action and adventure as it its happening right in front of our eyes. The sheer epicness of this can be can be seen in the chase and fight sequences, but if you are watching closely, you will find the same epicness in the scenes where Jackson introduces the landscapes to us or creates these imaginary worlds. Jackson introduces new characters and they do justice to the part they are to play. All the known and little known characters are given enough screen time for us to not forget them. This movie might be just a fragment of a novel but the way Jackson tells the tale is mesmerizing. It is story telling at its very best. This movie is one of the best examples of a well oiled machine, the actors play their part well, the story holds you and the scale at which the movie unfolds is simply breath-taking. Special mention goes to Andrew Lesnie for catching this movie in the true essence of the world it belongs to. The CGI in the movie are also at par with any of the LOTR movies if not better, check out the scenes with smaug and you will realise we have come a long way.

Rankin-Bass,"... made The Hobbit in 1977 and Return of the King in 1980. Great songs, excellent dialogue and voice characterization, and memorable.LOTR from Peter Jackson was awesome, everything I'd hoped for. Elijah Wood kicked butt and everyone was on task. Great effects and scenery, super battle scenes (even if the siege looks directly from Army of Darkness). Characters have plenty to do, and we CARE!The first Hobbit from Jackson was a travesty. Rude dwarfs invited by a disjointed Gandalf plunder a pleasant Baggins abode, and this take an HOUR. By the end of the first film, I actually wanted half the dwarfs to die. Arrogant, not worthy of anything. The ""roller-coaster"" rides were unending, and the fall through the Goblin kingdom was worse than a video game. Bilbo was cool, as was Gollum, and so I gave it B+.This Hobbit is better, but not by much. Smaug, as many have pointed out, is an idiot. He may have a fine speaking voice and a vocabulary, but he has ADHD issues, and it's not funny, and not TRYING to be funny! Sad. The dwarfs are even MORE ungrateful, and Thorin's turn for the Arkenstone is tired after knowing the Ring is of the same persuasion.I also found there to be many problems with logic. For example, if the eagles are willing, why bother with a land quest? Just take Eagle Airlines to Lonely Mountain.As well, I'm really tired of Orcs who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, and have no talent with weapons. Remind me again why we should be afraid of these pathetic creatures? Oh yeah, there's lots of 'em. Like cockroaches.Bilbo's innocent act also wears thin. He doesn't grow weary OR that much more courageous, as both Frodo and Samwise do in LOTR. Bilbo acts like it's just a ride at Disneyland.I'll stop now.

Still a worthy fantasy action adventure epic to watch,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues the exciting adventure of the hobbit Bilbo with 13 dwarfs and Gandalf (although he left halfway to investigate an important matter) to reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor, which happens early before the events of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.As a prequel to famous The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug proved to be an entertaining, engaging and enjoyable fantasy adventure epic, much better than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in terms of action, humour and CGI and makeup effects for the beasts and creatures of the lore. The scenery shots for the film were magnificent as well. It's nice to see an old character again, the fan favourite (for females), Legolas, the brief mentioning of Gimli and the resurgence of Sauron and his dark forces.Although there are various subplots found in the film (introduction of a movie-only character, the meeting with Beorn and elves of Mirkwood, Tauriel and her brief romance with Kili, Gandalf's investigation and his eventual confrontation of an old and powerful foe, introduction of Bard and the people of Lake Town, the appearance of Smaug), Jackson managed them well by balancing the subplots with some exciting action scenes. Notably, the barrel chase, confrontation between Gandalf and 'Necromancer', Bilbo and Smaug scenes were well made enough to be considered the best scenes of the trilogy so far.Tauriel, the silvan elf is a great new addition to the LOTR lore, proving to be a capable fierce warrior like Legolas. It's always interesting to see a strong, capable woman in a male-dominating story. On the other hand, the appearance of Smaug is truly a presence to behold as we don't often see dragons of this scale in films.Despite its merits, it might be too far of a stretch to make a trilogy from a single book as it never feels as epic and grand as the LOTR trilogy...seemingly lacking a compelling central plot to move the story forward for a 161-mins film. The film also suffers from numerous contrivances, a common problem to many fantasy films...just to name a few: the spiders that manage to catch the group are not eating them immediately, Legolas & Tauriel seemingly always arrive in the nick of time to rescue the main characters, Bard the Bowman just happens to be around when they need help to cross the river, Smaug doesn't kill Bilbo immediately when he knows that he's there to steal the Arkenstone for the dwarfs...Although the film ends in a cliffhanger (and its shortcomings), which may upset some audience or fans, it's still proved to be a satisfying fun watch and I find myself excited to watch the last instalment of the trilogy, The Hobbit: There and Back Again next year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

They've really tacked on a whole bunch of embellishments, including new characters and subplots, that simply aren't in Tolkein's The Hobbit. If it wasn't clear before, it should be clear now that the Hobbit films are more like a massive compilation of bonus adventures for film fans who adored the Lord of the Rings films.As one of those viewers, I personally welcome the expanded narrative and universe, no matter how absurdly thin the plot is spread out. At the time of this writing, The Desolation of Smaug has got to be the most epic and action-packed film of all the Middle-Earth films to date (second only to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). The film wastes little time in getting the ball (or barrels) rolling; it picks right up with everybody being chased by orcs, giant spiders, and wood elves. I always thought that the barrel scene was clever in the book, but the film takes it to a whole new level. The wood elves (among which, one familiar face appears, and Turiel might be a new favorite heroine) pull off some insane fight moves, the likes of which I can only describe as some kind of crazy elfin kung-fu (elf-fu?). The film maintains tension throughout the Laketown and Erebor scenes, before finally bringing the heroes face-to-face with Smaug. This massive dragon is easily one of the most menacing villains of all time, and the last act of the film is a long and exhausting sequence in which all the characters slide down mounds of treasure, bash through walls, and careen through underground mines, while being pursued by this fire-breathing monstrosity. And that's not all either: while all this is happening, Gandalf comes face-to-face with another evil opponent, and his scenes are impressively epic as well.Then...THEN...the film ends. Of all the excesses this film goes through, it's the sudden stop at the end that I find most bothersome; it's every bit as disappointing as cutting off a piece of music before its crescendo. On the inevitable home video release, this won't be much of a problem, since you'll probably just be able to pop in There and Back Again and continue the action. In the cinema, I sensed a collective disappointment in the knowledge that we'll have to wait one more year before seeing the actual battle of Laketown, in addition to wrapping up every other conflict that's left hanging (and a LOT is left hanging). The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was able to stand on its own, with a full climax at the Battle of Helm's Deep; if that battle's conclusion was cut off and left for The Return of the King, then you can imagine how it is with The Desolation of Smaug.There are other issues that might throw viewers off: there are quite a few scenes where deus ex machina are in full swing, with characters appearing as convenient. The film still plows through a bunch of subplots that might not really seem necessary (although, the whole Necromancer thing seems more tightly developed now).Regardless, the film still adheres to the fundamental plot structure of The Hobbit novel. It's very much a one-thing-leads-to-another structure. What matters the most are the characters; Bilbo seems to be in the spotlight more, with more maturity and strength being explored. The dwarf characters show even more nuances of their own. Various other characters have their moments, and it is especially intriguing to see a lot more to the Bard and the Laketown drama. There are numerous connections drawn among all the different characters and tangents, and the larger structure of all six Middle-Earth films is much more apparent. At its core, the film still explores key themes involving the adventure of life, the corruption of greed, and the classic struggle of good-vs-evil.As before, this film is made with exceptional skill. Photography and editing continue to be superb. Acting and writing are still top-notch; Martin Freeman proves to be quite impeccable as Bilbo, Richard Armitage still plays it tough as Thorin, Benedict Cumberbatch is truly menacing as the dragon's voice, Evangeline Lilly is both lovely and badass, and Luke Evans is alright. You also can't go wrong with Ian McKellen; the man really IS Gandalf the Grey. Writing is as good as ever. This production uses great-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is still good too.This is still quite a bloated saga, but I personally don't mind one bit. The spectacle is huge, the storytelling is still very tight and engaging, and the film is still very well-made. It's only a shame that the film ends the way it does. Regardless, if The Hobbit series follows in the same path as the Star Wars prequels, I have no doubt that There and Back Again will be the best of the lot, and one hell of a spectacle. This is still just the middle part of the saga; there's still more to take care of in the Middle Earth.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing!,"The second installment of a three-part film series based on J. R. R.

Spectacular.... Awesome..,"PJ did it once again.... this movie is awesome.. with grear direction... acting and punch with action....This must be the best movie of 2013. There is no movie that comes close to it recently. I must say, if you enjoyed the first one, you will enjoy the second one by far. I had the experience of seeing it early, and man, I made the right decision.""The Desolation of Smaug"" is sure to satisfy those who thought the first installment dragged its feet. From the first frame to the last, the movie is a thrilling achievement of Peter's. The action is none like we've seen in any middle-earth installment. The visual effects are much improved, the pace is seamless, and the danger is ever more present. Yet through it all, Bilbo and the company's journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain is not forgotten as the driving force of this tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing like it,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, is the 2nd part of The Hobbit, which is written by one of the most well known and talented authors of all time, J.R.R Tolkien, and is directed by Peter Jackson (who i personally think as one in a million, because of his incredible originality with films and special effects).I just got out of the cinema and The Hobbit (2) is still paying on my mind. The movie was such a marvellous MASTERPIECE that i can't really find words to describe how absolutely outstanding it was.From the beginning we have a little interesting flashback of the past, and then it goes straight into amazing action. There is NOT A DULL MOMENT throughout the movie. I strongly recommend you don't drink a lot in the cinema because you would have to go and pee a lot ( like i did), but there will not be time as something epic will keep on happening. I felt sorry for the dude sitting next to me, he kept on having to let me through.Another thing i want to mention are the special effects. Me, being the critic that i am, constantly kept on carefully looking for movie mistakes. I found none. You'd think with all the special effects there would be quite a lot, huh? Well, i didn't see ANY. There was so much detail and i was literally sitting in the cinema overwhelmed and astounded by it all, and finding it impossible to believe how talented the crew AND actors were. Just unbelievable.The cinematographer did a fantastic job on keeping the camera straight, and giving us different angles to see things from.In truth, i feel like this movie is FLAWLESS. I can't remember myself enjoying a movie this much since Avatar and Rapunzel hit the screens, much less one that's nearly 3 hrs long.The characters in the film are fabulous as well. They are one of the things i love the most. Their personalities are very different and unique. I CARED about them all, and it felt at times as if i KNEW them. I wanted to be there with them on that adventure. Because, and if, you care for them, the movie will be much emotional for you, like it was for me.My emotions were flying all over the place. One minute i'm laughing, then i'm at the verge of a panic attack, next i'm rooting the characters on, swooning over someone or wanting to slap a character across the face (i'm talking about you Thorin), and lastly i'm at the verge of tears. For a movie to tug at my heart strings like this is a miracle in its self, and it really proves that The Hobbit (2) is an extraordinary film that cannot be missed.The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug is a movie i recommend to all Fantasy and adventure lovers, and to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit: An Epic Adventure (1) fans. You will not be left disappointed. There was so much stuff going on. The majority of the time i was literally at the edge of my seat, holding my hand against my mouth to not squeal in either excitement or shock, and biting the edge of my popcorn box. TWISTS AND TURNS AROUND EVERY CORNER that had me hooked and holding on for the ride. I am DYING to see the next one after that cliffhanger at the end, and i bet you i'll be the first to buy the tickets, even if i have to wake up at 6 am or stay up till 4 at night. WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! That's an order.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best film in the series yet!,"I'm surprised this movie gets so much hate. The acting is good, the action is intense, the characters are likable... I'm not seeing the problem. I liked this movie a lot better than the first one. In my opinion, it was paced better and more immersing. The effects were amazing (especially in 3D), however they could have been a little better at some parts. The first film was too much cheese and not enough macaroni, depending on slow, character developmental scenes to get by. Basically it was all just one big exposition scene. However, thanks to that movie, we get to jump right into the action with this next film, which does a better job of showing, not telling. Despite all the hate this film will continue to receive, I will still view it as one of my favorite movies, and I am happy to say that I am definitely looking forward to the third one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing visuals but overall movie a letdown.,"Turning the book into a trilogy was a big mistake after all.Despite the stunning visuals and awe-inspiring wide angle shots, the movie is so needlessly dragged it surely has to bore a tolkein fan.The movie is rife with needless plots, dramatized dialogues, poor acting, painfully boring romance. In short, PJ has desperately tried to put in as much stuff as he could in a 3 hr period.But when the film falls terribly short in most of the major areas, the visual effects team comes out best than ever before. Alan Lee and John Howe (the illustrators) have done an incredible job in creating the smaug, which is nothing short of a spectacle and perhaps the only saving grace of the film.To put it short, the movie packs in the best visual effects as compared to the previous lotr/hobbit movies and should be your only reason to watch the movie, everything else is a disaster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The desolation of Smaug is a ground breaking film for the book industry,"Peter Jackson's trilogy based on Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" is a huge trilogy, and that the quality of successful fantasy is evident in part two, ""The Desolation of Smaug."" This middle chapter is about a half-hour too long, and the final third splits the story up into three pieces, but by the time Bilbo Baggins confronts the dragon Smaug, the real work has been done. Thematic elements are in place, emotional tension is highly strung, and the action unfolds in a wave like the fire erupting from the dragon's mouth, overtaking all in its path. The Desolation of Smaug follows Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and his posse of rowdy dwarves on their journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the dwarves' lost kingdom. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) join forces in a dark and beer-soaked pub. Bilbo is now resigned to his fate and shows resourcefulness and pluck in one harrowing situation after another. He also has the mysterious golden ring he found in the goblin tunnel. Gandalf tries to keep the team together, but forges off on his own solitary spell-breaking mission to force Bilbo to gain the trust of the dwarves on his own. The heroes of The Hobbit find shelter in the home of a shape-shifting Giant-slash-Bear and are pursued by a galloping army of Orcs. To save time, they cut through the Mirkwood Forest and run into a herd of gigantic attacking spiders. Saved and imprisoned by the isolationist-minded elves, the dwarves and Bilbo find a way to escape in a bunch of barrels down a river. There is a new elf in town, Tauriel, who is drawn to one of the dwarves. Stephen Fry has a great cameo as the Master of Lake-Town, a despicable and gout-ridden person lording it over his fearful constituents from on high. Jackson and his team have created three-dimensional worlds that are visually stunning. The Long Lake is swathed in mist with mysterious structures rising out of it, the misty dark wood filled with shadowy waiting creatures, and the elegant vertical fortress of the elves. The dragon's lair is gorgeously imagined, an undulating and ever-changing landscape of coins and gold. There are many great moments, such as a gigantic tapestry falling from the wall in a rippling wave, huge collapsing columns, tiny walkways over the abyss, and the dwarves' awe at their ancestors' ingenuity and power. Throughout, the viewer feels like they are in a lost and glorious world. Bilbo is told to climb one of the trees to peek out of the top of the forest and see a carpet of autumn leaves spreading almost as far as the eye can see, with blue butterflies flitting about along the leaf-tips. The sun shines brightly, and for a moment Bilbo is awestruck. We know that what happens next is bound to be grisly and terrible, but beauty is there to be appreciated. It was the love of home that kept people going in the dark years during which Tolkien wrote these volumes, when the shadow of war overhung Europe. The sunlight-drenched green fields of the Shire are long gone by that point in Bilbo's story, but the memory gives Bilbo his power. It is worth fighting for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
More of the same and Smaug is not worth the wait,"I didn't see this in cinemas. I was so disappointed in the overlong nonsense of An Unexpected Journey, I refused to watch the second and third movies. Reluctantly I eventually watched Desolation of Smaug on DVD, and well, I don't know. It's technically better than the first film, but still has all the same flaws; the unnecessary characters, the bloated length, the side quests that go nowhere and the jarring tonal shifts.Things start off promisingly enough, but soon devolve into an awkward mix of slapstick and pratfalls. And it seems that all the FX work on Smaug consumed the production, and the rest of the CGI was rushed in a week. I hate that Azog is a CGI character, he has no depth whatsoever. And the barrel ride with the dwarfs has some of the worst blue screen work I've seen in recent years.Once the film gets to lake Town, I gave up, the film just stops dead in it's tracks. The pointless politics, the endless discussions, and the ridiculous master of the town. I love Stephen Fry, the man is a genius. But from his first scene, I couldn't stop giggling. He's less Master of Lake Town and more Monty Python.After an eternity of needless exposition and characters that go nowhere, our forgettable (Thorin and Balin excluded) dwarfs finally encounter the title character. Just like the riddles in the dark scene with Bilbo and Gollum in the first film, Smaug is worth the wait. He's everything I wanted and more. It's just unfortunate that Jackson just can't figure out what the tone of the film is. The scene with the dwarfs fighting Smaug goes on way too long, shifting from genuinely exciting to comical, to ridiculous (And back again).So do I recommend it? Not really, if you're a Tolkein purist, you'll probably hate it (I am one of them), if you're a casual film fan, you'll be bored by the excessive running time and bloated second act. And if you're a kid who read the book and you want to see a film version, the film is too violent and intense. For a film based on a children's book, it's all over the place. Rent the DVD, chapter skip to where you first see Smaug, then watch it to the end. Everything else is rubbish.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing to do with Tolkien,"Amusing. But apart from the names and a slight similarity with the book these films have almost nothing to do with Tolkien and his philosophy. The gall of Peter Jackson is impressive. His bank account too, I'll wager.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining... But lacking in the Peter Jackson quality we've grown to expect!,"Although the movie was entertaining.... It is lacking in several aspects?? In my opinion, Part-1 was far superior in special effects & story... Even though I still wasn't able to pin- point and remember which dwarf was which, where as in LOTR, I can name ALL or most the characters (including minor characters)!?!Smaug looked & sounded fantastic, but some of the other effects were mediocre. Without spoiling anything... The early battle in which we are introduced to the main elf characters of this film was very cheesy & cartoonish! To make it worse... You can plainly see that it was all CGI. I think I would rather watch a stunt-double or stand-in, with an outlandish wig running around! I expect much better quality work from Peter Jackson!This isn't a George Lucas film! Not to say that I didn't enjoy the original Star Wars Trilogy... but the New Trilogy did not hold a candle to its predecessor...

SMAUG Steals The Show! The Great and Terrible!,"From adventures into confusing woods, to meeting with a gigantic/bear-like man, to Laketown, to the lonely Mountain, The Hobbit 2 is fast paced, and perhaps the fastest pace film of all Peter Jackson's adapted J. R. Tolkien films. The best moment of the film arrives when Bilbo enters into the lonely Mountain, to retrieve the King's Jewel, there he is met with the great/treacherous SMAUG.

I really like the incorporation of Tauriel and Legolas in the movie and their roles.What i didn't like from the movie is that the music in the scenes is gone, there is no music!.

Many scenes where its actually boring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Smaug is better than the sum of its other parts,"I want to give it an 8, but that's just because the third act leaves a lasting impression that makes you almost forget many of the flaws in the film, which I'll begin with.One major issue is that the movie is hard to look at. Being a hardcore Lotr fan, the cgi orcs looked horrible compared to the gritty make-up wearing actors from the original trilogy. I understand the Hobbit story is more cartoony by nature, but cgi was overused to the point of stupidity. Even all of the scenery and structures look bad and every shot seems overexposed.The Hobbit trilogy had a much bigger budget than the original, and it's clear they were too trigger happy with their money. Also, one thing I noticed was the overuse of decapitations/headshots to try and make you forget how cartoony the movie was. The fighting just looks like Legolas dancing around a green screen. Also, out of the 5 films made so far, Desolation deviates from the book the most, continuing the storyline of Azog, who I hated since the last movie, and Tauriel. Adding a female elf to a male dominated movie is a change I don't mind, but her love story with Kili seems forced. Lastly, the pacing was very odd, with some parts going to fast and others too slow. I assumed that would happen considering one book is being dragged out over three movies so I was ready for that.Now for the good things. The acting was great as expected, and I enjoyed the dialogue driven scenes more than the many action ones. Smaug, with the talents of Benedict Cumberbatch, is amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with Bilbo and the dragon. The ending was great, although it does worry me how they plan on executing the 3rd film. And of course we all love Gandalf, even if he wasn't in it for much. It's hard not to compare the new trilogy with the original, but even so, it is an enjoyable film the problems I had were mainly personal preference over visuals. Overall, Desolation of Smaug is definitely worth watching if you like fantasy movies or just want to see an awesome dragon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"""The Desolation of Smaug"" is King Under the Mountain!","It's hard not to chuckle at the irony hidden within the fabric of the Hobbit trilogy. The Hobbit films are based on the 300-page story of the same name that contains such prominent themes of greed and materialism-was stretched into a 3-part ""cash-grabbing"" epic by Warner Brothers (it is not the first time they have done this). The good news is, despite the somewhat disconcerting motives, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is a fantastic adventure that establishes its place in adventure-cinema as one of the best.In ""The Desolation of Smaug, the band of 13 dwarfs plus a hobbit and a wizard continue their journey towards the lonely mountain in hopes of reclaiming the dwarf kingdom of Erebor back from the dragon Smaug. I was one of the few who actually enjoyed ""An Unexpected Journey"". While far from perfect, the movie boasted superior performances to those in the LOTR trilogy and a lighter tone that I felt was in the spirit of the book, with the exception of scenes bordering on the ridiculous (i.e. any scene containing Radagast), though it was hard not to feel as if something was missing. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" fixes those problems, and in its place provides a tighter, more purposeful narrative, impeccably choreographed action sequences and a whole lot of valuable character development, while providing a darker tone that somehow maintains the spirit of the book. Director Peter Jackson takes a lot of creative liberty by drawing material from some of Tolkien's other works. The integration of this material works surprisingly well in ""The Desolation of Smaug"" due to the fact that most of it pertains in one way or another to Lord of the Rings and that ""The Desolation of Smaug"" feels a lot more like ""The Lord of the Rings"" in its presentation. Jackson and co. should be applauded for their work in this regard.Although much of the ""excess"" material was taken from the appendices of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the same cannot be said for all of the additions. In particular, I am referring to the addition of Legolas and Tauriel. Nowhere in the book does Legolas appear, although his integration is logical in ""The Desolation of Smaug"" due to the fact that his father, Thranduil plays a large role in the story. Tauriel on the other hand is a character that was created for the film, as Jackson felt that a 21st century adaption of the book could not go without any female characters (the book has none). Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly is part of the elven- guard and is established as a fierce warrior from the first shot she is in. Her character was more interesting than I expected, which should be credited to Evangeline Lilly, who is the best actor of all of the elves that appear in this film. Overall, her character was awesome, while also giving meaning to the term ""wood-elf"" (from my adolescent perspective).As for the rest of the crew, Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman was as good (if not better) than he was last year in ""An Unexpected Journey"". Freeman perfectly conveys the effect that the ring is starting to have on Bilbo, as well as having the adept ability to be a hobbit. You also start to see more shades of Thorin as the dwarfs near Erebor and the gold within. Thorin beings to falls prey to the seductive power of the treasure that plagued his ancestors and begins to care less about his comrades. Richard Armitage displays this transition admirably. As for the other dwarfs, it is more of the same, although more emphasis is placed on Fili and Kili this time around for reasons that those who have read the book know. The most impressive performance in this film belongs to Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug, whose voice shook the theater every time he spoke. The representation of Smaug is exactly as I imagined in the book and makes the third act the highlight of the movie.Even though ""The Desolation of Smaug"" possesses a darker tone than its predecessor, the film still has that charm that distinguished ""An Unexpected Journey"" from the ""Lord of The Rings."" The dark tone is relative, as the action sequences are filled with improbable acrobatics, minimal blood and little resistance from the attackers establishing the lower stakes and lighter tone simultaneously. The orcs in this film do not seem to have any ability in combat, even though they are bred warriors. While it is incredibly entertaining to watch these sequences, the movie does drift dangerously close to your typical action flick without ever being one--We have Peter Jackson's obsessive attention to detail and long run times to thank for that.In conclusion, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a vast improvement over its predecessor. The ""meat"" of the story consists of the most iconic and memorable moments from the book. This movie contains the best action sequences of the year, some impressive visuals, great performances, an amazing representation of the iconic barrel riding scene that made everyone in the theater laugh out of pure joy, the best movie dragon ever, and an amazing cliffhanger ending in its purest form. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" does what a good sequel does. It improves upon it predecessor, increases the stakes, and makes you excited for the next installment.

Thrilling from a non-book reading perspective,"I've never read The Hobbit. Nor do I care to at this point. I loved the first film and after hearing fans of the book complain, I decided I didn't want to ruin the movie magic for myself. From the perspective of having never read the book I can honestly say it was incredible! I love that it has the ability to bring out so many different emotions. There were moments where I couldn't stop laughing, moments where I felt heartbreak, and moments where I was overcome with joy.

Excellent Film,"This movie for me is perfect unlike some reviews state...from filming to acting to the storyline, it all adds up to one extraordinary film. I have been a huge fan of JRR Tolkien and LOTR trilogy are my favorite movies and i think The Hobbit Trilogy should earn at least as much appreciation as LOTR. The first Hobbit Movie (An unexpected Journey) has already been taken out of the IMDb top 250 thats already a mistake, but after seeing the Desolation of Smaug, i thought that this one would at least earn as much acclaim as the two towers. anyone who gives this movie less than an 8.5 is wrong in my opinion because it deserves much more than that. it keeps you interested and hooked till the last second and even after the last scene, you still want more. i agree that the addition of the love story between Tauriel and Kili isn't the highlight of the movie but it still adds a feminine touch to the film that is absent in the book. Plus,i think that it is crucial for us to know about When Gandalf wonders alone into Dol Guldur to check for the evil there. It is part of the story and it is crucial for the third movie where the Battle of the 5 Armies occurs knowing that dwarfs, elves and humans are uniting against this evil coming from Dol Guldur and also knowing that Sauron was trying to come back slightly before LOTR started.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent combination of Tolkien and Peter Jackson,"I went to the midnight premiere to watch the second part of Tolkien's The Hobbit and I wasn't disappointed. I had waited a year for the second part to come and was really exited to watch it. I know a lot of the reviews has been very negative and hasn't come with any constructive criticism, but to those who hasn't watched the movie yet, should definitely go. It's one of the most beautiful and magnificent movies i have ever seen, i watched the movie in 3D HFR and it was absolutely stunning. One of the things i think was best about the movie was that Peter Jackson didn't follow the book to the detail, and that's because the book was written for children, and not for adults which is the target group of the movie. I also liked the length of the movie, because it made it possible to get so many details in the movie and the landscape overview scenes are stunning in 3D HFR and is worth the time!My advice is not to look at the little mistakes the movie makes, but to look at the beauty and magnificence of the movie. I will finish withe the words of a review from a big danish newspaper, who wrote: the Hobbit Desolation of Smaug, is like a pure Wagner opera. It's definitely worth to watch and i personally can't wait for the third part of trilogy to come out!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug Review,"So the second installment of The Hobbit came out this past weekend, Peter Jackson's newest blockbuster film from the world of Tolkien that acts as a set of prequels to the original Lord of the Ring movies that came out from 2001-2003. These films were considered the most ambitious film projects ever attempted in terms of budget and scope; they were also a critical success. About a decade later in July 2012 Peter Jackson made the announcement that he would be making The Hobbit into another big epic trilogy and it earned him heaps of backlash. After all, JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit is a 300 page kid's book. It would require a ton of padding, little artistic liberties and additional character development to draw it out into three whole Peter Jackson length films. The whole thing still smacks of exploitative franchise marketing kind of in the same vein of George Lucas's Star Wars Episode 1-3 prequels. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey didn't really do much to help negate this opinion at all since it felt slow and suffered from bad prequel-itis, trying to tack on as many tie-ins as it could to the original movies. If you weren't a big JRR Tolkien fan like myself than you would have found it dragged in places.That being said, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug has accelerated the pace and it is a much stronger and more thrilling film than it's predecessor. There are still parts of the film that sedate you into a bored stupor but then you have incredibly exciting scenes that instantly knock you back into consciousness. The barrel scene feels like the roaring rapids 6 flags ride, with dozens of fights going on between elves, orcs and dwarfs up in the trees above the water, in the water, the amount of stuff going on speeds these exciting segments along and turns what was originally barely two pages of brief narration in the book into a good half hour scene. I was really glad that some of the parts in The Hobbit were drawn out longer than they needed to be in this movie because they make the characters seem less like fanciful fantasy creations invented for children and more like the action-oriented badasses that belong in the same world that The Lord of the Rings movies created. The Desolation of Smaug takes a much darker turn, abandoning the dwarf songs and quirky snot humor, focusing on thematic elements of greed and possessiveness that go beyond just the dominion of the ring. Thorin battles with his desire to obtain his kingdom under the mountain once again even when it comes into conflict with what's morally right. These are little conflicts that were considerably downplayed in the original Hobbit story but they make for interesting character development in a film. Though regardless of how long Peter Jackson makes these movies no one is ever going to know every dwarf's name by heart. JRR Tolkien didn't even bother giving each and every dwarf nuanced and defining personality traits; it's interesting the lengths that the director is taking in order to create memorable characters here.On the subject of memorable characters I'm going to move onto the real reason that you want to go see this movie. Smaug the Terrible, Smaug the Impenetrable. Smaug the Magnificent. This could easily be one of the most malevolent movie characters of all time that should be included up there with Darth Vader, the Joker and Hannibal. Peter Jackson mentioned in an interview that more than anything he wanted to convey terror with this character by the impressiveness of his size. So this monster's head would be the size of a bus. His body would be the size of a 747 and everything else would be to scale accordingly. I highly highly highly recommend going and seeing this movie in a theater and in 3D because Smaug is well worth it. A little television screen is not going to do this character any kind of justice. Benedict Cumberbach is the voice of the dragon, which fills up the entire theater and rattles every bone in your body as he plays psychological mind games with Bilbo. Without a doubt the Smaug scenes are the most impressive and for me personally, just for this particular character, I am very glad the divided the book up into a trilogy just so the audience could spend more time with this famous dragon.Read entire review here-> https://www.facebook.com/jen.tedmon/posts/776910072334863",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A disloyal epic that yet entertains as it should,"Somewhere along this Unexpected journey to Erebor, The Hobbit found his courage that transformed him from being the Baggins of Bag-End to a burglar who repeatedly saved the lives of the dwarf company through many an adventure. Tolkien's beloved tale takes an evil turn as Peter Jackson stretches the storyline for 3 films, meandering about with new characters and old. Be it studio pressure to cater to larger audiences rather than just its fan base or Jackson's self- consuming digression in support of more action and violence, 'The Desolation of Smaug' loses the charm of a coherent story with enjoyable characters and turns into a tale of evil in Middle- Earth with a Hobbit.Right out of a frying pan and into the fire, the company of Thorin Oakenshield is rescued by the eagles (summoned by Gandalf) who carry them all to the eastern edge of the misty mountains. There lies before them a treacherous path through the Mirkwood forest that will bring them to Long Lake and Esgaroth before they head north towards the lonely mountain and Erebor wherein rests the cunning dragon Smaug. But before that, they find refuge and rejuvenation in the house of Beorn the skin-changer. Their journey through Mirkwood thereafter resumes without Gandalf, who leaves them in lieu of urgent business. After struggling through the bewildering forest and battling spiders, the company gets captured by the wood-elves who incarcerate them in the halls of King Thranduil. Legolas (Orlando Bloom) re-emerges for Jackson as the King's son who, along with the beautiful lady Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) fights spiders and orcs with adept shots of arrows and swords. Using his ring, Bilbo plots an escape with the dwarfs during a feast. They roll down the river in barrels, chased by orcs and elves alike. This sequence is thoroughly enjoyable and even with all special effects, makes it the film's action highlight. The company reaches the shores of Long Lake and after spending an infinite time there, the company journeys into the the desolation of the dragon where the hidden door is opened at the right celestial time and the hobbit is asked to perform his burglar duties in the dragon's lair. Meanwhile, Gandalf ventures into the abandoned fortress of Dol Goldur where the Necromancer reveals himself as the enemy of past and future. The epic climax leaves you on a cliffhanger that will guarantee a big opening for next year's 'There and back again'.Martin Freeman's Bilbo is even more convincing with a bit of courage now and Armitage is excellent as the transforming leader. Evangeline Lilly forms a beautiful elf who can seriously cut through some orc flesh while Orlando Bloom is a much more violent and fun to watch Legolas. Ken Stott's Balin brings wisdom and much needed emotional balance to the company and Luke Evans rises above his controversial character of Bard. Sir Ian McKellan's commanding voice and diction yet again prove to be a compelling force among the performances.The film charges along faster than the previous one on account of having gone through the introductions already. The journey of the dwarfs moves along rapidly and yet, it clocks in at 2hr41min. It seems that the well intended Peter Jackson went too far with his digressive story- telling to the extent that he began to sub-plot his sub-plots. The appendices were useful to propel the story into a thrilling 3rd installment as long as Jackson stuck to the plan of Gandalf's business in Dol Goldur, introduction of the fan-favorite Legolas and imposing the threat of orcs who will eventually come in bigger numbers. However, his liberty brings a curse upon the Tolkien folk who shake their heads in dismay as these events unfold before their 3D spectacled eyes: > Intoducing Tauriel as an Elf warrior is quite welcome as she is the only female character but to put her through a mundane love triangle was completely unnecessary. > Dwarfs depart from Lake town after celebrations but they leave some of their company behind due to injury? Only to lead an orc attack with Legolas and Tauriel to defend them? Jackson is in a parallel universe at this point. > Bard, the respectable bowman is now a bargeman who smuggles dwarfs into town for coin? He will need a convincing character change when he has to raise the giant bow onto a fiery Smaug and lead his men to Dale. > Smaug's terrific creation justifies a bit more screen presence but certainly not at a complete twist in story that engages him with the dwarfs! The subsequent chase sequences involving fires and forging of gold that pass through as rivers turns into a blasphemous preview of next year's Godzilla. Oh! Peter Jackson what have the fans done to deserve your betrayal in such manner? There is enough material in Tolkien's Hobbit itself to warrant 3 movies if you must but the compulsion to make them in such lengths at the cost of digressions and self-consuming reinventions will disappoint a legion of fans.... but they will still flock to the theaters next December for the midnight screening.For the regular audience, Jackson's Smaug is intense fun with a sense of urgency in the journey of the dwarfs as they get ever closer to their quest's completion. As a grander vision, the impact of the imminent danger pertains not only to the dwarfs but to the world and therefore the added focus on the wood-elves, men of lake town and orcs. The essence of the story is of course that Smaug wasn't the cause but merely a symptom of greed that led many to battle and doom. Through his adaptation of Tolkien's appendices, Jackson adroitly renders this aspect and is sure to showcase that in full glory in the final installment of the Hobbit's tale. Just hope that his deliberate inventions find their purpose as the quest comes to its fateful end.8.68 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I see it and enjoy it very much,"As a rather quiet, conservative person, it's surprising to all I know that I am so hooked on this series of movies. From a visual perspective, the scenery is gorgeous and the backgrounds stunning with marvelous attention to fine details. The action scenes lend themselves to breathless anticipation and quite a few hearty laughs. Smaug is as awesome and fearsome as Bilbo declares in his wonderful encounter with the dragon. Overall, the characters develop with layers that lend a richness I see in very few films. I enjoy Bilbo and his rise from a somewhat shallow existence. Gandalf is secretive, humorous, and determined. I love the fresh background on Legolas, and Lee Pace is captivating as Thranduil. Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin is masterful when it comes to building his character with the finest nuances of expression. I know this movie in particular doesn't follow Tolkien to the letter, but the result is no less satisfying or captivating for the changes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Going beyond two movies for a 300-page book lies the greatest danger of all.,"This may be actually the first time that I'll complain of an adaptation (of a book that I love) being unnecessarily prolonged. Seriously, a trilogy??? Of one little book?! While the first installment was enjoyable though in a juvenile way, it becomes apparent in Desolation of Smaug the fillers that Peter Jackson has to add just to make the main plot last all the way to the third installment. And that irks me. It really does. It would have been kick-ass if it was a two-part adaptation, but a trilogy it never should have been.Despite my issues, I didn't regret seeing it (you should too, if only by principle) and I would still watch the last installment. Imagine us audience being Radagast The Brown when he asked ""What if it's a trap?"" and Peter Jackson as Gandalf The Grey replying ""It's undoubtedly a trap."" The Hobbit trilogy indeed is a trap disguised in more or less 9 hours of CGI-fest, beautiful elves, cute dwarfs, an amusing hobbit, & a majestic dragon set up by PJ to make us say ""Shut up and take our money!""my full review on Blogger: http://strangereview.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-hobbit-desolation-of- smaug-peter.html",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best film I have ever seen in cinema!,"I already had high hopes for this film: the first film in this trilogy set the scene ready to jump straight into the action in the Desolation of Smaug. An obvious congratulations goes to the production behind the creation of Smaug itself, the dragon is breathtaking and the use of Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best casting choices ever made! His low, euphonious voice suits the part of a revengeful dragon perfectly. A second applause goes to Martin Freeman, who's acting never ceases to amaze me. Without giving any of the plot away, his character development is tracked superbly and is a highlight of the film. The whole film wasn't a slug to sit through either! The pace of the film was balanced and enjoyable at every moment. I certainly can't wait for the final film in this trilogy and I seriously recommend anyone to go and see it if you weren't planning to (who isn't?!)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson breathes fire (and makes more magic) in the middle chapter of The Hobbit,"Just as I predicted, a middle chapter, like ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", that manages to be better this time around. As we all know back in 2012, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (or ""snooze"", if you didn't feel like sitting through another Middle-earth journey), we got to know Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and the dwarfs as they go on their quest to destroy the vicious dragon Smaug and to reclaim the dwarfs' homeland of Erebor. As if we didn't know, but giving the fact that it is based on one whole book by J.R.R. Tolkien (Author of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), the first part of the three-part series took them on unexpected adventures and it felt kind of natural to see it come to life. Now we enter with ""The Hobbit 2"" or as we like to call it ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and thank Durin for Peter Jackson for bringing us a spectacular adventure that is magical, epic and sharp as a sword. Continuing on their Quest, Bilbo (the always reliable Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the dwarfs, including Balin (Ken Stott), Kili (Aidan Turner), Fili (Dean O'Gorman), Dwalin (Graham McTavish) and Bofur (James Nesbitt) are hiding from killer Orcs including Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett) and their Wargs who wants nothing more than Thorin's head on something. Gandalf (The always remarkable Sir Ian McKellan) joins too, but goes away to search for more clues involving The Necromancer along with Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy). Along the way, as they make their way back to Erebor, Bilbo and the dwarfs encounter some wickedly dangerous spiders, Mirkwood Elves, including returning regular Orlando Bloom as Legolas and Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, and also traveling in a town full of Men called Lake-town before trying to reach the almighty dragon known as Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). When they go back to Erebor to find Smaug and the Dwarfs' heirloom known as the Arkenstone, you wouldn't believe me when I tell you that it's one of the most spectacular moments ever brought on film. Here's the thing: You have to wait 108 minutes of that to get to see Bilbo meeting the dragon. Other than the meeting with Gollum and a rather nasty run-in with three trolls, Bilbo seeing Smaug is one of the more iconic passages from the book. And Peter Jackson brings it to life, proving once again that he is a visual genius who refuses to back down and let the special effects, no matter how brilliant they are, tell the story. ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" surprised me from beginning to end. It had to, despite the fact it's 8 minutes shorter than the first film and I still happen to be one of the skeptics who believes that 1 book does not create a trilogy of films. But having seen both of the films, I actually realized that, so far, they are not that bad. It breathes the story a bit more and the characters happen to grow a bit more stronger and the films tends to get a bit more darker while it happens to be lighter than ""The Lord of the Rings"". And while I admire Bilbo's bravery, Thorin's stubbornness and courage as well as developing some impressive leadership skills and Gandalf's wiseness (even though he has limited screen time than the rest), it's the supporting characters that gives ""The Desolation of Smaug"" a bit more sting, like Bilbo's sword. Lilly's Tauriel, a new addition to the film, is feisty, strong and rebellious and she's got a crush on Kili. Bloom as Legolas is awesome and is always good with a bow with arrows. Mikael Persbrandt drops by as Beorn, a skin-changer, a character I remembered very well from the book. And Stephen Fry commands his scenes as the likable but very corrupt Mayor of Lake-town. But for me, the scene-stealers are Lee Pace who is excellent as the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father and Luke Evans (from ""Immortals"" and ""Fast and Furious 6"") who delivers a exceptional performance as Bard the Bowman, a character very expanded from the book, but amazingly, it works. I hope that everything falls into place when ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" hits theaters later this year and that it does not disappoint Tolkien enthusiasts and audiences who are so desperate to know what happens next, when it ends with a few wickedly stunning surprises and a cliffhanger so stunning that proves that when the time comes, all Hell will break loose. I'm so relieved that ""The Hobbit"" has managed to get an upgrade this time with the second chapter, and it's not just because of the awesome special effects, but those who love the story will get to see that there's a bit more heart and soul and that the magic of Middle-earth is not going anywhere. Plus, you get one cool barrel ride and some good Orc decapitations to go along with it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Exceptional,"Desolation of Smaug is a masterpiece and well explains the build up throughout An Unexpected Journey. The acting is top notch and the action is nearly flawless. The visuals were more polished than in An Unexpected Journey; wherefore, it was grittier, darker and at times breathtakingly majestic, and such made the world believable. There were moments when I was gripping the edge of my seat or clapping along with the audience. I reckon the slower moments in the first movie made us care much more for the characters in the second. Without the long dialogue and merrymaking of the An Unexpected Journey we would less understand the Dwarfs of Desolation of Smaug. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A good movie, but unfortunately pointless.","THE HOBBIT: DESOLATION OF SMAUGPart 2 of the pointless trilogy.The movie continues on from the original one where Bilbo Baggins goes on an adventure with Gandalf and a group of dwarfs... they are heading towards a mountain which homes a very dangerous dragon.The movie is made very well. The effects are again very good much like the original movie... and you can tell Peter Jackson made this just by watching it. It has the same feel to it as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.What I love about the film the most is the fantasy element. The creatures look amazing and really does drag you into their world. It is a great form of escapism. The dragon, Smaug, was amazing. He looked really good and huge. I was very impressed with the effects.The acting again was brilliant. These movies really have been cast so well, I can imagine this Bilbo growing old into the Bilbo at the beginning of LOTR. The movie stars Martin Freeman as Bilbo. It is great that Hollywood is starting to really see the potential in some of the better British comedy TV stars. Some of them really does deserve a shot at the big time... and Martin is one of them. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf. Ian is a legendary actor and can be very intimidating in places. He is the perfect Gandalf... it is hard to imagine anyone else playing him. Other cast members were Richard Armitage, Ken Scott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman... the list goes on and on.I suppose the main thing I have against this film is the whole point. I loved the Lord of the Rings movies and you had 3 very long movies to cover 3 very big books... that I understand. Why must Peter Jackson and the greedy movie industry make the Hobbit into 3 long movies for 1 small book? The movie has a lot of filler in it that the book does not have. I liked the book a lot and was happy that Peter Jackson was making it... but I am disappointed that it is a long trilogy. It seems a waste.My favourite bit in the film though was the barrel scene. If you have seen it or read the book you know what bit I am talking about... it was really well shot and a lot of fun and action. By far the best scene of the film.I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is very good, but not as good as LOTR.""If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together!""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Fun action and characters at the cost of common sense,"Desolation of Smaug has the job of convincing audiences that this new prequel Tolkien trilogy is still worthy of their attention, after a somewhat dragged out and toned down first part.This time the action has been boosted and the pace has been increased. The introduction of Elvish characters, especially the return of Legolas, is essentially the introduction of acrobatic super-warriors, but the dwarfs also do more fighting this time around and even the titular hobbit turned into a fighter. And, as the title suggests, we also finally brush up with the dragon, Smaug.But while the action is nice, the script of Desolation of Smaug really starts to get on your nerves towards the 2nd half of the movie. Characters say and do whatever serves the story at that particular time. It's contrived and obvious. It is clear that the animators wanted to create particular scenes or special effects, and the characters serve to make those set pieces happen, whether it makes sense or not.The increased reliance on physical action undermines the point of Tolkien's stories, which is that the Hobbits are physically small and weak creatures but they accomplish great things through bravery and perseverance....not through becoming sword wielding spider fighters like Bilbo did at one point.The actors are more fleshed out. While most of the dwarfs remain nameless background characters, at least a few of them get developed a bit more and get their own scenes. It's nice to see more variety in the types of characters and Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a great evil dragon.The movie is a CGI fest, but effects are generally effective, except in the end, where there is a certain scene with liquid gold that looks far more fake than the molten metal effects in Terminator 2 from the early 90s.The movie does have charm and it is fun to see known characters mess around gorgeous environments, as long as you don't think too hard about anything. At the end of it, the only thing you will probably remember about this part 2 is Cumberbatch's dragon and the dwarf king's corruption.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Up to lord of the rings standards !!!!!!,"The Hobbit: the Desolation of smaug was exactly what this trilogy needed and peter Jackson did an excellent job!The first hobbit movie to me was a great movie but didn't have the intensity like the lord of the rings first movie did and it didn't feel like much was on the line but while watching the Desolation of Smaug i once again felt the amount of pressure and intensity like i did when first watching the lord of the Ringsthis movie straight away is filed with action and shows us middle earth like never before, each character does get there own special moment in this movie which i think is great and martin freeman really is the best possible choice for Bilbo.The things i thought might go wrong for the movie like having legolas in it worked perfect and i didn't know how peter was gonna do smaug but what he did was amazingSMAUG no doubt earned himself a spot as one of the greatest villains of all time along with villains like the joker,Darth vader etc.. he really was terrifying and the scenes with smaug are some of the most intense moments in the hobbit or lord of the rings... Benedict cumberbatch voice for smaug is as memorable as andy's gollum voice...if you are worried about this not having as much action as lord of the rings then fear not because this movie has one of the greastest action scenes i have seen this year and is filled from start to finish with amazing action scenesThorin and all the dawfs are still as amazing as they were in the first hobbit film and Gandalf the Grey is one serious bad ass as usualthe only problem i have with the hobbit is some of the cgi!! i much rather the orcs to be real people dressed up instead of cgi. i find it lazy and doesn't feel as real but other then that i have no problem with the film and enjoyed it..a must watch film and defiantly one of the best of the year",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing...,"When I first heard P. Jackson is planning a Hobbit trilogy I was more than excited cause I'm a huge Tolkien fan. However, as the movies come out, they disappoint me more and more. 'The Desolation of Smaug' is just another proof that P. Jackson and the whole team are literally sucking the juices of the book as much as possible, adding even their own details, just to manage to make 3 movies out of a 320-pages book. Of course, no one can doubt the well-made and well-directed production. All I'm saying is this trilogy becomes more and more disappointing and does not meet the expectations as a prequel of Lord of the Rings. Now, as far as this movie goes, the plot is kind of slow and there are scenes that weren't included in the original book. On the other hand, the acting is great, of course. Oh, small detail here but i thought i should include it, the soundtrack ""I see fire"" by Ed Sheeran, is a good song but does not fit the whole Hobbit/Tolkien atmosphere for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Keelhaul,"This film is marginally an improvement over the first because now we're building to something, the dragon is a bit further down the path across the lake, the necromancer. It's still padded but we make that contact, have the encounter so we don't feel like we completely wasted our time and money.The same deep-seated flaws persist on this path. We don't actually inhabit a world, only the semblance of one. The resemblance to a world or history only there because the external mythology and heroic posturing has been amplified in place of narrative depth. But it has no consequence.When the dwarf leader near the end gives a rousing speech in Laketown about how they're going to take back the old kingdom under the mountain and how riches will flow and a crowd cheers him on as liberator; I can choose to ignore the emptiness of its epic sentiment, its lack of world, at the consequence of numbing that part of me that expects to grapple with a fuller sense of things. It's what we all do when we 'turn our brain off' with a film like this.. We numb.We're left with one rousing spectacle after another and here's where the lack of world appears in a different light, more interesting because it's tied directly to the cinematic eye which is the most fundamental question in film.There's a cinematic evolution afoot bringing us a step closer to immersion. It's currently spearheaded by Malick's philosophy of the eye, and 3D and computer landscaping in the nuts and bolts. Twenty years down the road I expect the first full integration of the two in films other than demo reels of destruction, serious films that take their place in the space leading up to the eye.Cuaron, Del Toro, Lee, even Snyder try to be a part of this advance. Nolan is tweaking with mechanics of narrative, a different sort of advance. Jackson, like Tarantino and Burton, isn't bothered to be a part of it. He was a toymaker when he started out, still is, but now, like Cameron, the toymaker's sensibility has shifted from contraptions to the overall world.You'll see all over this that he favors a video-game camera which takes up usually arbitrary movements in space, vertical or lateral. It feels unnatural and clunky because it is not tied to or derived from the movement of any of the elements in motion, it is digitally imposed after the fact as navigation. It is an artificial, non-human eye.We do have some mildly attracting sculpting in the river escape from the elftown, but even this is ruined by other decisions like surfing Legolas. Overall it feels stale and tiresome, a huge tinkertoy mechanism.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

absolutely awesome!,"Peter Jackson did it again: an absolutely entertaining, exciting, authentic movie. The Desolation of Smaug is 100% Middle-Earth just like the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Unexpected Journey.I know, Pete didn't follow the book word by word, he introduced characters that don't appear in the books, but always stays in the sense of Tolkiens books. The Hobbit is a child's book, without any additions it would have been a pretty boring movie. All (or most) additions are based on text from Tolkien himself (annotations of Lotr, ...). So I don't understand why so many are upset about that. Be glad to see more of Middle-Earth which wouldn't have made it to an own movie. Pete shows Middle-Earth as he sees it, it's an opinion not every one has to agree to, but nevertheless these are f***ing great movies. I can't think of any other movie with more love for detail and more passion of the filmmakers. And I'm sure Pete didn't split it into 3 films just to make more money, he wants to give the real fans as much of Middle-Earth as he can and I'm so glad he does! For me, he could have split it into 6 :D I enjoy every second of it, actually I'm even more excited about the scenes that are not based on the Hobbit book: the white council, Dol Guldur, Radagast, ...Last but not least: to see Smaug and Bilbo together on the big screen is worth every cent I've paid and I'm sure I'll go and see it again in cinema.

Fantastic,"Fantastic addition to the Hobbit trilogy. I was thrilled to see so much of the Elves, especially Legolas (oops) and Laketown in this film (by far my favorite parts of the book) people who aren't familiar with the issues of adapting a book into a film tend to complain about the plot inconsistencies, but I think that tonally this film matches the previous Lord of the Rings film trilogy much better than the hobbit book matched the Lord of the Rings books. ""Purists"" will complain about the plot inconsistencies, but anybody who has read the Lord of the Rings appendixes or parts of the Silmarillion will recognize the elements of other works of Tolkien woven in; very little ""made up"" if you're familiar with his works. Tauriel could have fallen flat, but as it is the ""captain of the guard"" who briefly appears in the Hobbit realized as Tauriel in this film works quite well. Hm... all in all, cons: a little heavy on the fight sequences. The cgi on the orcs & wargs could have been closer to Lotr and a little less cartoony but that's an afterthought; other than that, great character development. Pros: Incredible production design, especially Laketown and Mirkwood; beautiful character design on Thranduil. Tauriel is a much needed breath of fresh air, a beautifully complex and realized character; a nice balance to the other, more serious attitudes of Thranduil and Legolas. I think if you can appreciate the books and the films as separate entities in their own right, and go in without too many preconceived ideas, and willing to experience the beauty of the incredible artists who have worked on realizing Middle-Earth, it will blow you away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfection!,"What an amazing movie! In my opinion The Hobbit series is on par with The Lord of the Rings series- they are just quite different, and people need to realize that. I will not say it was an improvement over An Unexpected Journey because I loved the hell out of that movie, but this one's just as good. First of all, the acting was brilliant. Martin Freeman again creates a mesmerizing Bilbo- a very believable character (he isn't a master swordsman as soon as he picks up a sword, and he relies on his wits more than his brawn), and his wit and humour really add some heart to the movie. His subtle, slightly humorous reactions to Smaug waking up are great! His funny little mannerisms and facial expressions and hand gestures really give his character a sense of uniqueness among the other hobbits we've seen. Also, his relationship with Thorin is very well handled, although the best of it will be seen in There and Back Again. Speaking of Thorin, Richard Armitage gives a truly magnificent performance. The right balance of determination, arrogance, and charisma. Thorin is a much darker, more complex character than Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings, and you can really see his arrogance and greed taking over his being once he reaches Erebor, and just the slightest hint of madness (the scene where he holds Bilbo at sword point), which will come into play more in the third movie. In regards to Gandalf, we really didn't see much of him, but he was as amazing as ever, and his duel with Sauron was incredible! As for the dwarfs, it is Ken Stott and Aidan Turner who shine this time, and much to my displeasure James Nesbitt's Bofur falls to the background a bit (but he still has his moments- ""Bless my beard, is that the time!""). Stott creates a very memorable Balin, bringing depth, kindness, and heart to his role. Aidan Turner was great as the young, dashing Kili, and his hero moment at the river scene was very well done. Some of the other dwarfs fall into the background a bit, but Dwalin, Bofur, Fili, and Gloin all are given some time to shine. As for the new characters in this movie, they were all excellent and well integrated into the story. Mikael Persbrandt had a short but memorable role as the Skin-changer Beorn, and his performance was very powerful (and he had a really epic Swedish accent). His speech about not liking dwarfs was one of my favourite quotes in the movie. Lee Pace was excellent as Thranduil, who is a very interesting character. Pace provides regal arrogance and a slight unsettlingness to the character, and his scene with Thorin was very powerful. Orlando Bloom is back as Legolas, and this time he provides more three-dimensional acting, as his personality and personal life are fleshed out more here, and we get to see a meaner side to him as well as a softer side. And his fight with Bolg at the end was bad-ass! Tauriel, as played by Evangeline Lilly, was a very good addition to the story. Her character was even more interesting and in depth than I thought before the movie came out, and she was acted very well by Lilly. The romantic subplot with Kili was very well handled and not over done. She is a very interesting character- curious about dwarfs, determined, and sticking up for what is right (which means going against her king). In Lake-town we are introduced to Bard and his family, and Luke Evans did a great job as the ""Robin Hood of Middle-earth."" His family was a nice touch and makes the audience care more for him and adds depth to his character. We also meet the Master of Lake-town and his conniving servant, Alfrid, played by Stephen Fry and Ryan Gage respectively. Both were very good characters. Stephen Fry was hamming it up as the sleazy master, and he was a joy to watch. And now on to Smaug. What can I say besides that he was the best dragon, cgi character, and villain ever to hit the screens! Perfect vocal and motion capture performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, seamless visual effects by WETA, and some great dialogue. The scene with him and Bilbo was one of the best scenes I've seen in a very long time! Freeman and Cumberbatch were great together. His epic fight with the dwarfs was great too. The writing in this movie was very good. I thought each character was developed enough, and the side subplots, like Gandalf's investigation of Dol Guldor and the Kili/Tauriel subplot, were woven into the story smoothly. Also, the decision to split up the company was one of PJ's best deviations from the book. The visual effects, costumes, makeup, and art direction were flawless as usual- no point going into details there. But they were truly top notch. The score was also amazing (I particularly like Tauriel's, Smaug's, Thranduil's, and Lake-town's themes). Howard Shore is a genius. Special mention should be made to the Barrel scene. It was awesome- the best action scene of 2013 for sure! Legolas and Tauriel were bad-ass, and Bombur's orc-annihilating barrel run was hilarious and epic at the same time! The movie was action-packed and fast paced. It was dramatic, intense, and fun. It was perfect!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not for Lolkien Fans,"For Tolkien fans, probably the 'best' section of the movie is Galdalf in Dol Guidur - though there is the White Orc who is completely outside the book's storyline. In spite of this, this aspect of the original story, which Tolkien did not flesh out, expands the story a bit.Beorn - a major character is poorly portrayed, with a chase scene to his house rather than what could have been a fairly entertaining take-off from the book's approach.Mirkwood - should have been handled as was Frodo crossing the Plains of Gorgoroch. Clockwise not a large investment but maintaining the importance to the story.Elves - Too much. Their presentation did need to change since the book's elves and those in the Lord of the Ring were not compatible. So I agree they needed to fit the mold of the later books, but their role in the story was too enhanced.Escape from the Elves - The book would have worked - it was somewhat fanciful but no more than the movie. Would have decreased the time to the Lake-Town and made entry easier.Lake Town - Sure OK.Gandalf - Ian Murray McKellen does a great job with the character. And why does he seem 'lower or less powerful' than Galadriel? The dwarfs - I guess Oakenshield needed to look more 'human' to be one of the main leading characters, but really is overdone in that regard.Radagast - Why the bird sh** on his head? Does this enhance the character? The rabbit drawn sled??? Where Beorn was aloof and distant this would have fit an Istari that was more aligned with the wilderness and wildlife of Middle Earth than it's human and humanlike races.With the LOTR movies, though there was not strict adherence to the books, his artistic license remained very true to the story. The Hobbit movies are more akin to the Asimov ""I Robot"" and the movie. The names the same, but that is about it. The later did a better job because it was clearly a completely separate story. The former comes up short by flirting with following the storyline and then fails.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"More briskly paced than its predecessor, this second chapter gallops from one impressively staged action sequence to another","For those who felt that the first verse of Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' trilogy was a meandering slog, the good news is that his second proceeds at a gallop right from the get-go. Save for a brief prologue that flashes back to the snug bar of the Prancing Pony where our old pal Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield first hatched their plan to reclaim the lost dwarf kingdom of Erebor, this episode moves from one adventure to another with newfound energy, so rest assured that it is certainly a more engaging adventure than the first movie.Whether it manages to capture the magic of the 'Lord of the Rings' films is yet another matter, and we're sad to disappoint fans that, in our opinion, it falls short on several counts. Indeed, even though it does offer the same sort of sweeping fantasy action of the 'Rings', it doesn't quite match its poignancy, owing to a thin plot that goes all over the place and a distinct lack of character development. Yes, at its best, it is a collection of impressively executed action set-pieces strung together by the quest of one particular hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and 13 dwarfs in search of lost treasure.The highlight is no doubt a thrilling sequence in which a dozen dwarfs flee their elven captors by riding inside wooden barrels down a rapidly rushing river, only to encounter an even more dreaded enemy - the hideous looking Orcs - that force a temporary alliance between the Elves and the dwarfs. That sequence alone is testament to Jackson's ability to mount elaborate action with considerable flair and imagination - and worthy of mention is not just how he manages to find moments of levity in between a brisk edge-of-your-seat segment, but also how he juggles important character details amidst the flying arrows and numerous beheadings.Nothing quite comes close to the level of fun and excitement of this centrepiece barrel chase, not even for that matter Bilbo's eventual encounter with the fire-bellied Smaug. But not to get ahead of ourselves, our protagonists also pass through a couple of obstacles en route to their assault on the dragon up in Lonely Mountain - a trek through the enchanted forest of Mirkwood brings them face to face with giant CGI spiders, and following their imprisonment and escape from the stronghold of the woodland elves, they find themselves among not so friendly human company in the village of Laketown. Like we said at the start, there is an urgency to the proceedings which was absent in the first movie, and aside from their time spent in Laketown, unfolds like a supercharged Saturday morning picture.There is a tradeoff though. First and foremost is the fact that there doesn't seem to be much meat to the tale. Despite the efforts of the original 'Rings' screen writing team of Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens as well as the series' original intended director of Guillermo del Toro, there is no shaking off the feeling that there simply isn't enough in what was a book of less than 300 pages to fill roughly nine hours of film - not even with the interpolation of sections of ""The Quest of Erebor"", one of J.R.R. Tolkien's so-called ""Unfinished Tales"".Neither for that matter is there much of the characters to speak of. Bilbo feels sidelined in his own tale, spending much of the time in the movie resisting the temptation of the ring he riddled out of Gollum in 'An Unexpected Journey'. Thorin is left to the end to do a little soul- searching whether he has allowed his obsession with regaining the throne to cloud his better judgment. Gandalf, on the other hand, goes off on his own to Dol Guldur to investigate the appearance of the Necromancer and a purported gathering army of darkness. The rest of the characters in the book are largely there to fill the backdrop.Perhaps the most fully realised character here is Smaug himself, whom voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, is a mesmerising presence to behold. It is only after the two-hour mark that Bilbo confronts the serpent, and the faceoff between hobbit and dragon over dwarf land and gold is a sparkling exchange largely scripted with wit and purpose. Beginning with a glimpse of its open eye amidst mountains of golden coins, Jackson's rendition of Smaug is an awesome sight to behold, both in majesty and authority. Over and under the walls of the imposing castle under the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and Smaug trade barbs and quips trying to outsmart and outguess each other's next moves, before Thorin and the rest of the dwarfs arrive to lend the newly brave hobbit some much- needed assistance. In all though, the confrontation is too drawn out for its own good, losing much of its own momentum during the concluding frames right before the cliffhanger ending that is supposed to whet your appetite for the third and concluding chapter.And therein lies our central gripe with 'The Desolation of Smaug' and it seems with 'The Hobbit' series – borne out of essentially a kid's tale, it never quite reaches the epic heights of the 'Rings', lacking in compelling plot and character despite Jackson and his writers' efforts to augment Tolkien's tale. Sure it picks up considerably from the amiable pace of its predecessor, but it relies too much on spectacle to distract its audience from an absence of almost everything else. The familiarity with the 'Rings' trilogy is unmistakable – from composer Howard Shore's lush strains to production designer's Dan Hennah's elaborate sets to Weta's top-notch visual effects to Andrew Lesnie's lensing of the breathtaking New Zealand locations – but this middle instalment still fails to recapture the magic, the wonder and most importantly the heart of the 'Rings'.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Back to Middle-Earth! The Hobbit 2 - Noodles Review,"While it's still not the perfection I hoped for, it's still a treat. The second installation in The Hobbit trilogy (serving as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy) brings us back to Middle Earth with style and houses a grand feeling of adventure which is the main element I wanted out of this series. The Lord of the Rings is collectively my personal favorite movie of all time. I can say that it's pleasant to have read the book yet not completely know how all the events in the film will unfold. Though some die-hard fans will say that it's too starkly different from the book, I say that's what we should come to accept now. The outside story arcs that aren't in the book (such as Gandalf's personal quest to see if darkness has returned), all make sense and, for the most part, don't feel out-of-place at all. Desolation of Smaug has the right tone throughout the movie; the tone I was looking for in the first movie. In the first one, it held more of a familial tone, and while this film is still a fun-for-family movie, I feel like it grew up and became more like a Lord of the Rings movie (and that's exactly what we want!).The casting is so well done that the actors/actresses fit their roles so well. They look like essentially exactly what I would imagine them to look like while reading the books or thinking about the characters. Just as well, the acting is pretty much stellar. Martin Freeman proved to me in An Unexpected Journey that he is the definitive Bilbo. He kills it in this role and he nails every expression, mannerism, hobbit-ism, and line in the exactly the way that he should. Also, you can see that his character has grown. I like to see character growth, especially when it's not overtly- clichéd. We saw in the first movie that he was still a homesick peaceful guy, even on the adventure. But he grew since then, and we can see here that he's grown quite courageous, as well as cunning. He even is responsible a lot of the time for getting the gang out of trouble in a bunch of situations. The company of dwarfs is still well acted done and the leader, Thorin Oakenshield, feels even more heroic and leader-like in this film. As well as Gandalf, but we all already know that he's an inherent bad-ass. And then we have the elves. Legolas, who was my favorite character in The Lord of the Rings trilogy for most of my life, is still awesome in this movie. His actions scenes make this movie so much cooler and appealing. However, it's noticeable that he's like a different character in this movie. He's arrogant and comes off as a jerk. I realized that this comes to play in his overall character arc over the span of the entire series, and imagine he'll grow into a more humble warrior in the next movie. The other elf is Tauriel. However she's not in any of the books whatsoever; she was completely made up for this movie. However, she definitely feels like she belongs there and she's acted well. The one thing is just that there's a bit of a small romance and it feels a little bit forced and childish, so I don't think that really fit. A lot of things in this movie, you can tell were shoehorned in by Peter Jackson, especially the involvement of Legolas and Tauriel, but it's executed in such a way that it feels like it belongs there. But the character who really belongs here is Smaug. Smaug is the dragon who lives in the Lonely Mountain, which is where the Company of Dwarfs is journeying to in order to reclaim it as their kingdom. Smaug, is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch; and they could not have picked anyone better. He lends just the right tone of voice and speaks so articulately; it's amazing. Smaug gives off the perfect vibe of arrogance; you can tell he condescends upon everyone. He was a memorable character and he was so menacing that I don't think I'll ever forget him as a movie antagonist.The special effects are also breathtaking. The dragon is designed so flawlessly. The CGI in other scenes was mostly on point; however it did slack a little bit at some moments, so there's a minor gripe there. The goblins are done better in this movie though. One of my major gripes with the first movie is that firstly, the baddies were done with CGI, and secondly, I could easily tell they were. Thankfully in this movie, a lot of them are done with makeup and prosthetics so there's a more realistic and gritty feel to them. The feel of the entire movie is much more exciting. One of my main problems with first movie was that it had pacing issues and lot of it felt slow or uninteresting. But Desolation is turned on for pretty much all of it 161-minute runtime; it's exciting and something's happening, almost all the time. It slows down a bit, but that could just be in relativity because the rest of the movie there's so much stuff happening.All in all, Desolation of Smaug is a greatly welcomed installment to the series, and it's a great improvement over the first movie. It's more-so like An Unexpected Journey was actually just building up to the events of this film. This movie capitalizes on a lot of what it's got; the characters and action are spectacular, while the overall scope and tone are going in the right direction. Hopefully, the final film in the trilogy will veer towards even greater excellency, as there is still room to improve. However, The Desolation of Smaug as a movie is the opposite of a desolation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Peter,something wrong happen here!","10 reasons why this Hobbit didn't work for me:1.No magic at all.Everything is here,the darkly picture,mystic places and castles but..no soul in it.I think the main reason is because there was no thrill in the air,like in LOTR movies where at all time you can smell the fear of things that will come unless the task is being done and the ring destroyed. 2.I really don't care about none of the protagonist.Filly,Killy,Dory,bla bla etc..I'm lost.I mean its not their fault they didn't get enough time to like them(Hobbit 1 failed in that).And its not only with dwarfs,its a problem with all others.I didn't remember the names of elf's too-reason again is poor writing(screenplay). 3.Too much mindless action and killing.For all i care Legolas and that elf girl could kill an entire army(they did)of orcs and all i want at that point is to be done.In LOTR every orc they killed was one less too worry about,and i really mean one orc. 4.No pace,no tone and rhythm.Screenplay is disaster and is dancing and jumping all around like it is retarded. 5.One of the main reason why i didn't feel this movie is because i really don't care about dwarfs quest.OK,what is there to care,they want to reclaim their kingdom and gold and to awake a sleeping dragon Smog.Dragon is personification of death,but he is sleeping and didn't kill nobody in years.Let him have his gold and chock in it for all i care. 6.Whats wrong with Thorin and Bilbo story?From the beginning Thorin has no thrust in Bilbo.At the beginning of the quest that was nice but after Bilbo saved him and his company 15 times and stood in front of Azog nothing has change.Absolutely nothing.Thorin is still dumb ass. 7.The One ring supposed to be the source of all evil and Bilbo is playing with him like a child with a candy..should i putt the ring or not..should i putt the ring or not...just to remind us that the ring is all the time here..bad,just bad. 8.The movie is tryng to be funny but its not.I don't wanna see Legolas jumping on dwarfs heads and kill orcs while doing it.I don't wanna see a useless fat dwarf at one point and the real killing machine trapped in barrel at other point.Sorry,I'm not 10 year old kid. 9.I think Hobbit movies are made without any passion.In LOTR you can feel it,all of them was in just to destroy the bloody ring.Here, i forgot whats the reason of all this race and even dwarfs seems and looks like they don't know too and now and then they remind you by saying something like ""hey,we must get there before Durins day..""or something like that. 10.NO DIALOGUE AT ALL.AFTER I SEEN THE MOVIE AND COME HOME,I SAID TO MY GIRL:DID YOU REMEMBER ANY DIALOGUE OR A WORD AT ALL?WE BOTH SAID NO.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why Are We Overlooking the Brilliance?,"Bottom line this movie is an experience! If you go into it looking for something other than such, you probably will leave whining like the other pundits of this film. A lot of people are wanting another Lord of the Rings film, and by doing so their missing out on ""THE HOBBIT"", which is quite an awesome experience in it's own right. The genius of Peter Jackson is he did not make the Hobbit to be anything like the Lord of the Rings, rather it is something completely different, and if you accept it as something different, you will be amazed how much you will fall in love with this film. I personally enjoyed the first Hobbit, but agreed with most that it lacked something. But what the first installment lacked, it makes up for ten-fold in this film. Simply put this movie is brilliant! Beginning to end, the film just pulls you in and doesn't disappoint. Sure the ending leaves you hanging, but honestly was there anyone who didn't see that coming? The Cinematography, visual effects, score, and writing all exceeded expectations in this film. It was a long film (running 180 minutes), but you never got the sense that it dragged on like the previous Hobbit and even some LOTR films did. As the end approached I found myself not wanting it to come to and end. Everybody has there own opinion but this is one of my favorite films of the year. I guarantee anyone who watches it for the soul purpose of wanting to see a brilliant and entertaining film, they will certainly not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good as the lord of the rings,"The first one The Unexpected Journey was good but not memorable or as good as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. But this one is finally as good as the lord of the rings. The story starts off very strong with the continuation of Thorin's company Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins. There is still a lot of CGI like the first one but it didn't bother me as much as the first hobbit. The CGI is really good mostly on the dragon. The characters are developed so much better in this one now I really care for all of the dwarfs even though I don't know all of them but now I literally care for the characters. I was worried about putting Orlando Bloom as Legolas and the chick from lost in the movie because I thought they would feel forced but both did a fantastic job and it doesn't feel forced. There is a lot of memorable moments in the movie like the lord of the rings. The villain Smaug is amazing he is the best villains of all middle earth history even better than Sauron he is the big bad guy of the movie but Smaug feels so much bigger. Benedict Cumberpatch has the best deep scary voice and he works so perfectly. Smaug is even very scary the size, the sounds he makes, and his voice. I only once I jumped when Smaug was playing around Bilbo. Overall I loves this movie best film of the year and finally it is as good as Lord of the Rings.

Middle Earth is back...,"REVIEW WRITTEN BY HAMZA POONAWALA http://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/desolation-of-smaug/The Hobbit is back with a bang with Then Desolation of Smaug. One would assume, that the dwarfs reach Erebor, slay the dragon, and claim their homeland! Well we'll find out shan't we.....Bilbo Baggins, the young well mannered hobbit (which he's not any more....Just kidding) is drawing closer to the mountain day by day but, his journey is not over yet. He'll have to go through Mirkwood forest which is a perilous task across the lake and through Lake town, find the secret passage which is a problematic task and finally slay Smaug the Dragon, which is dicey.But as the dwarfs are moving, so is evil. Gandalf the Grey goes to the Nine Tombs and discovers that the evil dead spirits have been summoned by, our fellow Necromancer. But who is he, someone from the past or someone else?The action is mind blowing. I love the last scene of the battle with Smaug with fires everywhere, resulting in molten Gold! The fight between the elves and the spiders, read GIANT SPIDERS, in Mirkwood and the chase of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) along the river are amazing.The 3D was legendary. The scene I loved most was when Smaug took the gold off him. It looked like gold raining from the sky. Just breath taking. I strongly recommend you to see this film.See you for the last time in Middle Earth..The Y Factor Review by YusuF: All LOTR fans, rejoice cos we have Peter Jackson back once again to transport us to the land called Middle Earth.....Continuing with his new HFR (High Frame Resolution) technology, of shooting the film in 48 frames per second, Jackson along with his writers adds a lot of his own matter in this film. Whilst The Hobbit did stick a lot to the book, this instalment has Jackson introducing characters such as Legolas, who were never a part of the original story, to bring in more twist and pace in the tale. For it is the chase of the Dwarfs and Orcs on the river by Legolas, the son of King Thranduil (Lee Pace), that takes the film way above the standard set pieces offered in some other such flicks (and even in this one too). The river chase is by far the best action sequence of late, highlighted by 3D, especially in IMAX!Benedcit Cumberbatch, as the evil voice of Smaug, is simply brilliant. Again a brilliance of CGI and motion capture by Jackson.Don't jump off the cliffhanger of a climax!Does it have The Y Factor : YESRating : 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Extremely Enjoyable Epic.,"Peter Jackson's second installment in his highly controversial Hobbit trilogy sees the addition of some new and exciting characters, as well as some stunning never before seen locations. A multitude of elements combine to make this film a marked improvement on the much maligned first part.The Desolation of Smaug is the second leg of Bilbo, Gandalf and the company of 13 dwarfs' quest to reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor and slay the dragon Smaug. They encounter many complications in the form of Azog's vengeance seeking band of orcs, the distrustful elves of the woodland realm and the formidably cunning and terrifying dragon Smaug.What makes The Desolation of Smaug significantly better than its predecessor are its gorgeously ambitious and executed action set-pieces. Highlights include a typically Jacksonian river barrel chase and a beautifully choreographed fight scene which takes place in the center of the scenic Laketown. These types of set-pieces ensure that the pacing problems of the at times lethargic first film aren't repeated, as the film furiously jumps from one action scene to another, ticking many of the boxes of what an epic blockbuster should be.The new characters blend in seamlessly with the world and the already established characters, mainly due to the skill of the actors playing them. Evangeline Lilly's Tauriel adds some much needed oestrogen into such a testosterone fueled world, making love rivals out of the handsome dwarf Kili and returning fan favourite Legolas. Lee Pace is very convincing as the extremely inward looking leader Thranduil, who Richard Armitage's Thorin has every right to distrust. Benedict Cumberbatch really nails the sinisterness and underlying intelligence in Smaug's personality, more than playing his part in the creation of one of the greatest CGI creations in cinematic history. However, it's newcomer Luke Evans who steals the show as family man and people's champion Bard the Bowman, giving him the steely resolve that Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn was imbued with.From the established characters, Martin Freeman's Bilbo is still undergoing his fascinating character transformation that will span the full trilogy and will ultimately see him become a true hero. Freeman is a bit short changed in terms of his screen time but still manages to show off his talent, in particular his impeccable physical comedy. Ian McKellen once again lends his experience and gravitas to the role of Gandalf the Grey, while Richard Armitage does well in conveying the dark turn in lead dwarf Thorin's personality. The same few dwarfs that distinguished themselves in the first film play an important role, particularly Ken Stott's Balin who is quietly becoming the heart of this trilogy, constantly reminding everyone about the significance of the quest at hand.Thematically The Desolation of Smaug feels very similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as it deals with how wealth and power corrupt, as is evident in the cases of Bilbo and Thorin. The interesting thing about this film is that many of its themes derive form the source material and the inter-war period in which Tolkien wrote the book. The inward looking elves are clearly meant to represent the isolationist America that existed in this inter-war period and refused to join The League of Nations. Furthermore, the totalitarian society created by Stephen Fry's dictatorial master of Laketown, is almost certainly meant to represent the totalitarian societies being created by dictators Hitler and Mussolini in this inter-war period, with the suppression of elections and public participation being alluded to in the film.The new locations Laketown and Mirkwood are like rich tapestries, as is befitting of Jackson's Middle Earth legacy. Their beauty is complimented and magnified by the typically excellent score from Howard Shore, which gives the whole production an epic feel.The only problems in this cinematic milestone, stem from the source material and Jackson's wild ambition and limitless love for the franchise. Devoting enough screen time to all of the characters was never going to be possible given the nature of the source material, with only half of the dwarfs being established characters two thirds of the way into the franchise and the increasing feeling that Bilbo may no longer be the lead protagonist of the franchise. Jackson's ambition causes the final climatic action sequence to feel needlessly long and his love for the characters. means that the returning Legolas is given a ridiculously large amount of screen time.Ultimately, Jackson has put his ambitious Hobbit trilogy back on track, with a far more confident and exciting middle film. While the heights of the Lord of the Rings trilogy can never be reached, this film comes as close to reaching them as is possible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Movie, not so Great visuals","This film was almost 3 hours long and should have been longer... also should have been shorter, because we get to see some of the best Fighting scenes i have ever seen, and for me it was satisfying to watch because the last film gave this film permission to do so and i wanted to see more so the film should have been longer. i say this because the first film gave The desolation of smaug a perfect set up as the first Hobbit was at least 90% walking which means that in this film i was expecting more action, and i got what i wanted. The reason i think it was a bad thing to be expecting more from the film was because there was so much dialogue, and obviously i knew this would have happened but it took a way some of the impact and made the film longer than it should have been.The acting in this film was superb because they all told a story on what their characters believe in, it was just fantastic and they all immersed me into the film. There are too many actors and actresses to congratulate.I was not so lucky enough to see this film in 3D which for me and for many others was a terrible decision to make, because this kind of film is not made for 3D it is made for perfectly good 2D. what 3D did to the film was just make it blurry when the fight scenes came on, the film was also blurry in many other scenes. i recommend that anyone and everyone should watch this film but watch it in the perfect 2D screen (IMAX).overall this film was great and satisfying, the film makes you want to watch the third and final one right after you have watched this film. i believe Peter Jackson has done himself well for making a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A fast-hitting, magnificent film","Having seen the LOTR trilogy on a number of occasions, I never cease to fall in love with the fascinating characters and intense plots.Having then watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey for the first time, last Christmas, I initially felt that this movie could not have been improved and possibly better than any of the LOTR pieces. I then watched it for a second time and retract my comments. Despite being a very good film, I felt that it relied too much on graphics and less on the 'action' as we saw with LOTR, I therefore feel that the first Hobbit movie deserved an 8/10.Now onto the important bit, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. I went into the Movie Theatre with mixed expectations, I was not expecting the movie to be as good as I expected the first, but I was also excited to see what Jackson made of it. In all honesty, I was blown away by this movie. The fast-paced scenes left you wanting more and more by the end of the film. I agree with other reviews too that the new characters in the movie are instantly likable and left their own individual mark on the film that I cannot wait to see progress in the final film.I returned to watch the movie again to see if I would fall into the trap I have laid myself for the first film. I can safely say, my views on the film have nothing if not improved.Furthermore, I found the end of this movie to be the best of any of Jackson's interpretations so far and I seriously look forward to December 2014.I feel this movie rates at a 9.5, falling more on the side of 9.0, hence the rating of 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Great epic rendition to a standalone children's fantasy...and then some!,"Peter Jackson did a brilliant job in taking liberal creative license in bringing out the epic feel of this continuation from a rather innocent book meant for children. This installment is very much different from the first film not just of its epic scale but particularly Jackson's input to incorporate darker themes with more adult-oriented storyline which includes romantic plots.Right from the beginning I felt that there was some sort of a disconnection or that certain lacking of association from the first film even though this one is a continuation from of the first.For those who have actually read the book you would have known that one significant addition to this film was the inclusive of the female elf, Tauriel, and her lingering romance with Legolas of whom the latter was not even written in the book.To make things even more complicated or rather to have that somewhat tasteful twist to it, Jackson even had Tauriel to be emotionally attached to one of the dwarfs, Kili, that in my opinion was the hottest one of all and did not look anything like a dwarf.But I appreciate Jackson's approach to bring Tolkien's beloved children's book in another direction.If THE HOBBIT book could be regarded as a standalone fiction on itself then I'm I'm glad that Jackson and his co-writers, Phillipa Boyens and and Fran Walsh, actually took the painstaking effort to link THE HOBBIT films to THE LORD OF THE RINGS especially with familiar characters of Sauron, Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond.As the title suggests, the film obviously reveals to us the dragon Smaug in all of his glory. And all I can say is that the fire-drake's appearance was simply breathtaking. That was how a dragon is suppose to look like. Somehow, I can't help but to make a comparison between this dragon Smaug to that of the one in Dennis Quaid's DRAGONHEART especially with the authoritative vocalizations provided Benedict Cumberbatch that sounded eerily similar to Sean Connery's vocal portrayal. Nevertheless, I'm impressed by Smaug's presence.**SPOILER**However, I do have to say that ending was not what I'd expected at all even though I am fully aware that there would be a concluding episode to the whole HOBBIT franchise coming out next year. And that is the film's super abrupt cliffhanger. As you could imagine from Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy the ending of the first two films had their share of cliffhangers of their own. Yet in THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the ending was so abrupt that it practically choked many of the audience in the theater. It was that abrupt as if Jackson himself had no idea of how to end the film subtly like THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING or THE TWO TOWERS or other films for that matter.But needless to say, I am pretty pleased by the outcome of THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: The Desperation of Slough,"This film is recommendedMore is more in Peter Jackson's second installment to his latest fantasy trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The director has better success this time around. Jackson still know how to move his camera and stage his action masterfully and he has again assembled a gifted crew of artists that create wonders with their respective talents; the production values, especially in the areas of art direction, make-up and CGI, are top notch. The many action sequences are indeed well choreographed and worth viewing (just not in 3-D). Still, the story rambles on endlessly as the director sets up his plots and myth-like exposition. Some judicious editing could have eliminated the ennui and helped to make the film even more effective. (And speaking of endless, the film leaves the moviegoers ultimately dissatisfied with its abrupt cliffhanging conclusion.)Yes, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an epic fantasy adventure film that has more to offer. There are now more engaging characters in place (excluding most of the dwarfs who still have no distinct personalities and are mere storytelling fixtures). There are also more liberties taken with Tolkien's original story, adding an unnecessary love interest between the handsome but height-challenged Kili (Aidan Turner) and a new character not found in the sacred novel, a female warrior elf named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). There are more energized set pieces that build suspense well, although some of the film's overabundance of sub-plots undercut the continuity of the action, especially in the climatic showdown between Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smaug.The screenplay-by committee script by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro and Jackson is serviceable enough, but it lacks clever dialog and complex character development to make the film compelling and memorable. The story is a continuation of the first film with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) leading his gang of adventurers on on a perilous journey to reclaim their homeland from a fire-breathing menace named Smaug and make Thorin (Richard Armitage) its rightful king. All of the actors deliver their lines with a yeoman-like precision and, while they never garner genuine emotion, they do make their characters believable.Unlike Jackson's first disappointing chapter in this series which bored me completely, this sequel has a more serious tone and a darker edge to it. The silly slapstick antics of the merry dwarfs are thankfully gone and the film stays more focused on the journey and its dangers, although it takes forever to get to the main villain in the subtitle. In fact, we don't even see the evil dragon until close to the 90 minute mark, but Jackson has created an entertaining saga with fine production values and strong visual effects along the way.Nowhere is it more apparent than in three pivotal scenes: a creepy episode involving a giant spider attack that will easily bring nightmares to any child and adult in the audience; a harrowing escape by barrels down rapid waters while being sieged by those nasty Orcs, in which the fluidity of the camera-work and editing heighten the tension and show off the the cinematic skills of this talented director; and the film's highlight, a battle of wits between one little insignificant man, played ever so delightfully by Mr. Freeman, and one terrifying Goliath reptile, marvelously voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. (Smaug's scaly details and slithering movement are absolutely sensational.)While the action keeps coming, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a marvelously thrilling ride. It's the down time in-between that's a bit of a slough. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Movie Critics have no taste for an expected journey!,"Firstly being a massive Hobbit and Lord of the Rings fan before the films were made I was very sceptical and reluctant of any theatrical releases. After seeing how much care and attention to detail Peter Jackson took with the Lord of the Rings trilogy I was immediately impressed and any scepticism went out the window in a flash. A truly great piece of film work and eagerly awaited the Hobbit. After the first part of the Hobbit; an unexpected journey which was also fantastic I couldn't wait too see what Jackson would have in-store for next instalment. I can safely say Desolation of Smaug lived up to my expectations. Smaug himself is fantastically done and Benedict Cumberbatch does a great voice over. The story is true to the book with adding extra bits that have crucial consequences in the following film/books. The critics have to idea. Those who say the film is ""long winded"" or ""slow and unfaithful to the book"" have clearly not read the LOTR and their appendixes. Jackson has backtracked setting the stage for LOTR and adding all the bits that you don't read about in the Hobbit but are discussed later on in LOTR. This adds an extra dimension to the Hobbit as a story and in Jacksons style as he did the the LOTR trilogy. So what if Jackson has added a few little bits that are not in the book it is still entertaining and faithful to Tolkiens work so what's the problem! I think the people who have been reviewing this movie thus far would much rather see an hour of Downton Abby and give that 5* (which I would rather stick pins in my eyes than be subjected to) and dislike fantasy movies who want something ""in the real world"" and under 2 and a half hours. If so why would you go see this film. In a nutshell if you like the books, like the films so far GO SEE THIS MOVIE its not to be missed on the big screen you will love it!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Truly Magnificent!!!,"While watching the movie in theater, I was absolutely stunned by the special effects, characters and the behemoth creature ""Smaug The Dragon"", seriously the most dangerous and enormous dragon I have ever seen in my entire life. Talking about the film, Peter Jackson has made a wonderful movie and totally justified Tolkien's book. I liked the first installment of this series, but it was lack in action and creatures (still was a beautiful movie). While in theater, my eyes were wide open by seeing the imagination of Peter Jackson and how beautifully he created every character, creature and mountain. I have read the book and i can recall every moment from it and watching this movie was like the book has come alive. This movie will make you laugh at some point and will also force you to hold your breath. Though, Peter Jackson did some changes and additions in the story, but still, you will love to watch those scenes which you didn't read in the book.I would give 9 stars for this splendid movie. It should definitely go to the Oscar, at least for the amazing special effects.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
B rated version,"Just went to seem the movie with high expectation and let me just say how disappointed i was. Peter Jackson who i dearly admire and love, took a 15 minute bit out of the book and made it into a two hour film which you could sleep through and awaken from time to time just to see the special effects. The movie in this part continues by the book as we join our merry companions on there way to the lonely mountain, but from there about 90% is just made up and has no connection to the book what so ever,what are all the extra characters for? why do we need more plot lines that amount to nothing at the end? let me add that the ""HOBBIT"" as you know is a children book and has many parables about: Friendship,camaraderie, being brave, being possessive, good and bad and so on, but it pains me to see how all of this impotent parables are quickly cast aside just to make time for more special effects, whats the point of the story if not for that. I was very disappointed and i think that its a shame because the first one was so lovely and this one really ruined it for me",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Huge Improvement over the First film.,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Spoiler free reviewThe second film in the The Hobbit Trilogy is a HUGE Improvement over the first film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The pacing is fast and exciting with some huge action set pieces. There is this Barrel sequence that is just plain awesome.The characters are more fleshed out in this movie though some are still not developed properly. New additions to the trilogy are Legolas and Tauriel. Both were Bad-Ass. Though I know they were shoe Horned into the movie but they made some of the action scenes awesome. There is a love triangle in the movie. That could bother some people.The Best part in this film is Smaug the Dragon voiced and motion- captured by Benedict Cumberbatch. Smaug was menacing. The CGI of Smaug was Amazing. The performances are still good especially Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lily, Lee Pace, Luke Evans and Sir Ian McKellen..There are a few problems. The movie has a lot of differences from the book but it does expand the universe. There are a few CGI shots that could have been polished.The soundtrack by Howard Shore is good but no the best. The credits song ""I see Fire"" is pretty good, too.Overall rating 10/10 Fantastic thrill ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why split the book it in three movies??,"Now. When I watched the first movies of Hobbit (An Unexpected Journey), I felt that it was justified to dedicate just a bit less than half of the book to it. It was very much like the book, with few added scenes, like of ""Radagast the brown"" that is barely mentioned in the book and actually gave a better understanding of the story. A perfect adaptation of the Book!After watching the second part (Desolation of Smaug), I see only one reason of why the remaining +/- 60% of the story were split in two parts, which is, putting it plainly - Why not kill the chicken that lays golden eggs one year later and squeeze as many eggs as you can? Makes sense, right? (Money rules the world!) The difference from the first movie, however, is noticeable - to maintain, more or less the same length of the movie and leave enough material for the third part at the same time, more scenes had to be invented. Elf-dwarf romance felt unnecessary, just as the ""catch me if you can"" game that dwarfs played with Smaug in the halls of the Lonely Mountain (visually impressive, bravo to that!) also left me wondering of it's actual necessity. The movie ends where the chapter ""Fire and Water"" of the book starts - leaving not that much to tell, about 20% of written story. Unless the makers of the third part of the movie have some aces hidden in their sleeves, I am afraid that the third part will need to be filled with even more, even less necessary scenes.Concluding. If you are of fan of fantasy and of Tolkien's world as such, of course, you will not doubt to go and see this movie. Just as you will wait for the third part to come out and, as a faithful fan that you are, you will go and see that too. Still, to me, it left a bit of a feeling of deception and I can give it only 6 stars VS 9.5 that I would give to the first part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dark but alive with action,"The Hobbit's journey is getting more interesting with more characters thrown in with a lot of action. All the actors have done their part well. But the climax could have been crispier. Good movie, Lots of Grey canvas, so we enjoyed it more than our son. The actors cannot be envisaged as the stars any more as they sink into their respective characters and we can empathize with each one's loss and see them for what they are. The barrel scene was great to watch. The wood elf king was impressive in a short role too. But we did miss the green glory of Bilbo's Shire and the fascinating Elf Kingdom. The Elf clan's arrival at every turn at the last minute to help out the dwarfs is quite repetitive and we could predict their appearance beforehand in some places. But our hobbit and his company is lovable still in spite of all their flaws.It's a good movie, go for it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Desolation Of Smaug Review,"Being someone who didn't like 'An Unexpected Journey', I wasn't looking forward to The Desolation Of Smaug at all. In fact, I didn't just not like 'An Unexpected Journey', I hated it. I think it's an awful movie and easily the most disappointing movie of 2012. The decision to split The Hobbit story into three movies is completely stupid and doesn't work at all. After seeing Desolation, I still think that decision is stupid, as the movie feels more like an action-fantasy epic that's inspired by The Hobbit rather than a straight up adaptation of the book itself.Desolation is a much better movie than it's 'An Unexpected Journey', but that's not saying much. I enjoyed Desolation for the most part, but I still don't think it's a particularly great movie, albeit far better than it's terrible predecessor. I was always a bigger fan of The Hobbit book than The Lord Of The Rings ones, and it's disappointing that it's not getting the adaptation it deserves.One element of the book that was done justice in this adaptation is Smaug. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his scenes and they were probably the most entertaining in the movie. However, I didn't think the CGI in this movie was particularly good. It seemed to be a large step down from the Middle-Earth movies that came before it. Also, I want to comment on a particular shot during the barrel scene (which, by the way, was completely unnecessary and could have been left out) where the perspective switched to first person, and this shot is so awful it looks as though it were filmed with a GoPro camera. It was very ugly, off-putting and completely took me out of the experience.The main problem Desolation suffers from is the same biggest problem that it's predecessor had: it's too damn long. There could easily have been at least half an hour cut out, but it's not. Peter Jackson includes countless scenes that serve no use so he gets his movie as close to three hours as possible, because after all; Jackson is SUCH a master at fantasy storytelling that anything short of 150 minutes is criminal, no? Whereas a long running time was well suited to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, it's not a good fit to The Hobbit movies at all. However, I still have hope for the next installment, 'There And Back Again'. It should be more like the LOTR movies what with the (hopefully) epic Battle Of The Five Armies. And maybe Peter Jackson will fill the inevitable 160-180 minute run time with things that are actually essential to the plot for once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Hobbit: all Hollywood filler, no substance.","As a lover of all things Tolkien, I'm vastly disappointed with the 2nd installment of The Hobbit. It seemed like ""filler"" and thankfully my ticket was only $8.00. In fact it had very little substance from the actual book. Apparently the film relies on special effects, characters, and scenes that are entirely superfluous. It's a pity that producers are more concerned with box office returns than actually making a true work of art. No attempt was made to be true to the written word of the literary master that was J.R.R.Tolkien.That said, one thing I must say in Peter Jackson's favor; introduction of materials from the appendices can be pertinent and interesting. I don't mind him doing this at the time of his choosing either.The earlier installments of The Lord of the Rings had their detriments as well but taken as a whole, they far surpass the first and definitely the second installment of The Hobbit.Basicsally The Desolation of Smaug is a romp for an ADHD modern audience. I'll stick to the book.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

In conclusion, this movie is an unbelievable improvement from the last one. An all around great and amazing film, so stop hating please(but to each his own).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Please disregard 'Hated It' reviews if you're planning to see this movie!,"I went to see the movie last night and felt compelled to register and write a review @ 03:00 because I very nearly didn't see this movie. I was put off going to the cinema as there were so many 'negative' reviews due to IMDb's ridiculous policy of plotting all ratings below the average (mean) rating (8.2 stars at time of writing this review) as 'hated it'.I'm so glad I ignored the grumbles of the many reviewers who have complained that PJ's interpretation of the book fell so far short of their expectations because this film was a fantastic action film and was brilliant when watched in 3D HFR.In my opinion, PJ did not make this movie for those people who want to see a faithful representation of the book. He wanted to make a film out of a much-loved classic children's book that would appeal to many and, of course, make a lot of money! What's so wrong with that? If you are hoping for a faithful adaptation of the book, and will be disappointed by anything less, don't go to see this movie at the theatre, wait until it comes out on DVD or don'i watch it at all.However, if you want to see an enormously entertaining action-packed fantasy movie with exceptional quality CGI, go and see this film. I can pretty much guarantee you will enjoy it and will feel you got value-for-money. I can't understand how anyone would describe this movie as boring; it was action all the way and I couldn't believe how quickly the time went.I've given this 10 stars on principle to ensure this will be a 'Loved It' review but actually rate it a 9 because there wasn't quite enough character development for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Exponential Improvement by Orders Of Magnitude!!!,"I'm giving this a 10 because trolls will give it under 8. This is not a movie. It is a theatrical, artistic and visual masterpiece of a great story written almost 100 years ago by a brilliant professor and scholar that fought in WWII. My friends, this is a very long cinematographic work, it is ingenious and phenomenal. I saw it in Ultra AVX (increased frame rate) 3D and it was vivid, crystal clear and deep. The team of pure talent and intelligence that created this epic visual portrayal literally succeeded in bringing life to myth and making legend real... Production on The Silmarillion will undoubtedly begin. This is a vast improvement from the last Hobbit film. See for yourself, just go to the theatre well rested, it's worth it.

"Different from the book, Still a good adaptation!","I went to see The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug on its opening day and it totally made my day. Firstly, I must say it is quite different from the book. All the middle chapters are there, but the details are different, and there are many additional scenes apart from the book. The additional scenes of Gandalf and Legolas served well as a connection to LOTR, while the addition of Tauriel character seems to serve fan girls and add some love story to the adaptation. In my humble opinion, the additional scenes work pretty well. However, let's wait and see how it will unfold in the third film.Now that I've seen the film in both HFR3D and 2D, I'd say I recommend the HFR3D. The images are far crisper. The action scenes look more thrilling, especially the spiders scene and the barrel-riding scene. However, the 2D version is also good for the dramatic scenes. I tear up a bit when watching the dwarfs finally back in their home, Erebor.I can say that fans of Legolas, Thranduil, Kili and Bard will be happy watching this second Hobbit film. They have lots of scenes. A little disappointment may be for Beorn fans (actually myself included). Beorn scene is quite short, compared to his long chapter in the book. But that's understandable because film is different from book. Anyway, it would be better if they reduced some air time of Smaug and give it to Beorn. The Smaug scene, though important, is somewhat overlong.Overall – 9.5/10 This is a great film, so please go watch it with your own eyes. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It's just a movie with orcs and dwarfs, plus some pointy ears and stupid lines. I did't read the book, but i can't believe Tolkien wrote such a superficial story. When a writer is out of inspiration, he can't write, but when a director it's out of inspiration...,well...he can still make money. Again, if you like this kind of movies, go see the movie.

This might be my favorite movie ever!,"One word to describe The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug...Holy-sh*t-this-movie-f*cking-rocks!I don't know another way to put it. Peter Jackson created a better if not just-as-good sequel to An Unexpected Journey. This is easily my favorite movie of the year, sorry Pacific Rim and Man of Steel.Martin Freeman is the visual definition of Bilbo. His sarcasm, his cleverness, his cautiousness, his walk, his talk, it fits Bilbo's description flawlessly. Ian McKellan is always great as Gandalf, and his 5th appearance is no exception. The rest of the bunch does a fantastic job supporting and carrying on in the ever-so-slightly parts that tend to drag.The action is dynamic and captivating, and the suspense is easily amplified from most films, which is led by one of the biggest yet satisfying cliffhangers in a film I have ever seen.However, if I am to review Hobbit 2...I need to review the stand-alone title-bound character that kicks the bad-assitude level to 11:Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug the Magnificent Dragon.Holy. Sh*t.Smaug just fills the screen with sheer beauty. The way he slithers in the gold, the way his facial expressions curl as he speaks, and his size in general made me need a new pair of pants! His fight scene is pure awesomeness, and the end, when he is briefly encased in a body of gold, it may have been the most beautiful creature scene I have seen since I first saw Godzilla in action!Peter Jackson has created, once again for the 5th time, a remarkable experience of Middle Earth. The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is...just reminiscing of every scene is enough for me to say it.The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is my favorite movie ever.11/10, if you leave the theater disappointed and annoyed, you probably saw a different movie, because there is just no way you will not leave satisfied...unless you hate cliffhangers-but that only adds to how much you will want to see how Peter Jackson closes out the Hobbit Franchise.F*CKING SEE THIS MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The female elves didn't fight the way they're portrayed to in the movie, and an disproportionate amount of time was spent on the chase scenes and not spent in more of the major elements of the film. There could have been less comic relief and more character development in my opinion.While the film was fun and entertaining I didn't enjoy it as much as the original nor the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.I recommend it for those who have never read the books or for those who just want to go and be entertained.

A book that's fantastic by the way.The first one was disappointing and the second one was horrible. And i do compare the books of Tolkien in real life so i will compare this movie to LOTR.

Fantasy Forged to Film Fantastically,"Before I get started, know this: HFR did not, in my opinion, take away from the experience. Instead, I felt like I was watching the next step in the evolution of cinema, and it was not unlike the first time I experienced 3D.Peter Jackson, you are an asset to the college of film dear sir. It has been awhile, and only a handful of times, since I've actually set on the edge of my seat at the movie theater. Desolation of Smaug caused my eyeballs to attempt transfusing with the screen for the entire last quarter of the film.Desolation of Smaug feeds off of the wide-open stage that most of us trudged our way through to build by first viewing An Unexpected Journey. Thanks to that, this second film was a non-stop barrel ride down the rapids of anticipation, and my friends, I got drenched.I'm not going to go into details on what this film does in the animation department that sets the bar for other films. Also, there will be no details on how well the story does, or does not, adhere to the text from J.R.R. Tolkien. Since I've not read the book, and the animation can really only be truly appreciated by viewing said film yourself (seeing how HFR is 48fps, and a picture is worth a thousand words, and it's nearly three hours long, that's more words than I care to type), I'll leave those details for you to discover.The one thing I would like to add, since I can't seem to find the subject matter online, is that that Smaug seems to be an analogy for religion if I followed the story correctly. Basically, the dwarfs are set to be the equivalent of humankind. The dwarfs (humankind) became greedy and things started falling apart. Along comes a dragon (religion) to take control of the wealth, since humankind couldn't resist the disease of greed. And, well, that's as far as I've taken the idea, but I think there's merit to the theory.To wrap up my transient flash of this film fan's take on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, I'll simply say this. Go see this film. At the theater I went to, there were children as young as seven or so in attendance, and given the fact it was nearly a three-hour movie and I didn't once hear the impatience of young jabbering, that tells you something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A fruitful re-imagination that hits the spot,"As I scroll through the reviews of this film, I can't help but get the impression that a vast majority of people exert a sense of misconstrued discombobulation, many whom expect something that resembles perfection and complete accuracy - That's where many fall short; frankly, Tolkien never intended for the Hobbit to follow an exact path but more so to serve a churlish prelude, a foreword for what would become a successive Lord of the Rings trilogy. To put it simply, this re-imagination is synchronised with the nature that Tolkien essentially intended. And I think that people are seldom taking the film with a pinch of salt (If you know what I mean)Onto the film itself. The Desolation of Smaug gives a refreshing perspective onto the envisioning of Middle-Earth, initially provided by the esteemed Tolkien. It may seem stretched for material at times, (I'm referring to Legolas and Tauriel here) however it never held the viewer astray from the fundamental attributes that really formed what is conceived so effectively in this title, that being the almost fairytale natured approach that I believe is necessary. - Think of it like a typical quest for gold from a Dragon; myth and maverick is all that is being portrayed here in the shadow of the Lord of the Rings. This film serves well for what it is, we need to remember that this is a prelude aimed at younger audiences and for forming the story behind the ring and the rise of Sauron. NOT something to be taken with overt 'high-fantasy' seriousness. It's light hearted fantasy at most, and I think delivers in regard to Tolkien's intention for the Hobbit.Now in regard to criticism, and I'm being reasonable. I didn't approve of how fighting was constantly used between scenes as an interval, I think it needed to be split into pieces for visual digestion and not just thrown at the viewer as a filler. Also while the CGI was beautiful it became repetitive and I felt that not enough of the characters were shown as a result, it was more a distraction from the story than an enhancement most of the time.And because of that, I can't rate it any lower or higher than 8, it was thoroughly enjoyable and I eagerly anticipate the sequel coming next year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent,"This is a perfect movie, I loved Lord of the rings and watching this movie because of it. The story is very awesome and I found the first Hobbit movie tolerable but this one stinks.There was also some really weird editing here too. The movie is already way too long and they still include absolutely pointless scenes. For example, when Gandalf is climbing the stairs by the mountain and the ledge gives up, the movie suddenly cuts to a sweeping shot of the mountain side. Why not just stay with Gandalf, it would provide more intensity. There's many examples like this. In Mirkwood when Bilbo is snapping at the spider web they shouldn't zoom deep into the web with the camera. Stuff like this tells nothing and adds nothing to the film. This also takes time away from the character development. When one of the dwarfs oversleeps and misses the boat to Erebor, I couldn't even remember who he was and why I should care that he was stranded in Laketown. Also, the most puzzling and distracting choice in the movie was using that weird POV camera footage in the barrel scenes, it looked so utterly different that it took me out of the movie completely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A review for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug,"The latest installment of the fantasy extravaganza The Hobbit, titled as Desolation of Smaug, has just released this week on the big screens. It is a direct sequel to An Unexpected Journey, and the second entry in The Hobbit film trilogy.Peter Jacksons' revival (An Unexpected Journey) of the perennial tale, The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, garnered respectable reception and recognition both from fans and critics. As for me, I've had moderate expectations with the film, as I didn't find the first part to be 'that' amazing as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Regardless of the upbeat tone of the book, the light-hearted take on the subject took the dread and the feeling of the true menace out of the film, making it essentially a 'prelude' with the characters to the real deal. On another note, Desolation of Smaug, with it's more matured theme, reclaims this perk, and improves greatly on the storytelling.The film opens with a flashback in the human town of Bree, where Gandalf persuades Thorin to reclaim the Arkenstone in order to become the king of Erebor. To do this, he must recruit a group of twelve dwarfs, and a burglar hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, to steal the stone guarded by a dragon.Just after we learn the details of this quest, the films cuts back where the An Unexpected Journey ends. Bilbo and his company seek refuge in a house nearby from an impending orc attack, led by the ominous leader, Azog. After having spent some time in the haven, they encounter a shapeshifter, Beorn, who aids the company with horses to outrun the orcs. The bunch continues their journey through a misty forest, Mirkwood, unbeknownst of the dangers that this quest has in store for them.The movie is packed with an incredible content, as the story never drags on for over two and a half hours. Every frame has a little nuance, a thing to it: either some incredible acting, a great dialogue with good writing, a rich and colourful scenery, or simply a showcase of a breathtaking landscape, and this way the film is gifted with incredible variety and diversity.Speaking of variety, this film is beautifully shot as per usual. There are valleys, villages, caves, mountains, streams, abandoned ruins, grandiose elven towns, all visualized in great detail. However, this visual package is often marred by some stiff animations and low-resolution CGI (the lava), but the overall picture second to none.Every single member of the cast deliver sublime performances. New characters has been introduced in addition to the old ones. Orlando Bloom made a great return as the cunning elf, Legolas. We also have Evangeline Lilly (known from Lost) playing Tauriel, a beautiful elf, who only makes an appearance in the film(s). Lee Pace pulls off a convincing portrayal of the elven king, Thranduil. Luke Evans is portraying a likable human, Bard, who assist the dwarfs along their adventure. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves recognition for lending his low-pitched voice to play Smaug, the dragon guarding the Arkenstone.The rest of the cast, and the old crew are still in the highlight though: Martin Freeman plays the crafty Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit with great effort. Then we have the dwarven company, and their leader, Thorin Oakenshild, played by the great Richard Armitage. Ian McKellen returns as the lovable mage, Gandalf, the brain behind the operation. Sauron also makes a brief and ominous appearance.Few film can give me goosebumps in the first ten seconds, but Desolution of Smaug has achieved that, with the soundtrack: Howard Shores' iconic ""The Shire"" theme starts to play as the title fades instantly creating the feeling of adventurousness. Just when the menace appears, the musical momentum continues: more and more instruments are starting to appear. This momentum switches to a more low-key, and mysterious sounding that accompanies the journey through Mirkwood. The piano part transits to a grand and pompous sonority as the elven kingdom appears.The soundtrack dynamically keeps getting better and better right until the end. I See Fire performed by Ed Sheeran concludes the film as the credit rolls. Although at first it may seem a little off considering the genre of the movie, it's still a powerful song, and a great way to end the film.The only negativity I could find, apart from the minor visual inconveniences, is that the plot often relies on the ""deus ex machina"" device. That means, when the main characters are confronted by the evil, they are often saved right before they meet their fate. For example, when Legolas avoids getting hit by an arrow, denied by another arrow shot by Tauriel, or when the elves somehow make their way to Lake-Town and save a dwarf that was hit by a poisonous arrow earlier. I realize the film must stay true to the book, but these scenes could have been pulled off better.All things considered though, Desolation of Smaug is faithful to the original trilogy in every way, and a major improvement over An Unexpected Journey. It's a must for fans, and heavily recommended for everyone else if you are in for an incredible journey.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"As much as I liked the film on technicality , I think it wasn't enough to keep me stuck to my seat.","The second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the ""whitewater rafting"" scene which also seems like a water park ride! That part and the whole movie has good editing. In this one, two of the non- King dwarfs' presence is stronger (Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her works, adding some heart to the film. One could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, when complete, will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. (The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced, even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR.) Incidentally, Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished, Jackson's six Middle-earth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology. Gandalf didn't have much screen presence this time. Its the Elves leaded by Legolas that bring smartness to the film and Tauriel is a scene stealer. In the end the Dwarfs, Gandalf, Elves, Orcs, Smaug were thrown to different places so they have to get together for ""There and Back Again"". 'Arkenstone' and 'Black arrow' will have much to play in the grand finale. Jackson has also given us a smoldering elfin heroine, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), whose skill with a bow and arrow matches that of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien may like sitting through a 169 minute film,but I didn't! this easily could have been trimmed by at least 50 minutes. Yes,Its long, VERY LONG.Coming to the end part,I thought that the dragon will be killed. At least I hoped so but no! The last a few sequences are fun. As much as I liked the film on technicality , I think it wasn't enough to keep me stuck to my seat. I would give this one 6.75 on 10.

A sad schlocking of a subtle tale.,"They stripped the book to it's basic plot, subtracted a whole lot of the actual story, then added comic-violence, action scenes and hokey new characters. What they've added never rises above nonsense on it's own right and coupled with what they extracted, wholly detracts from the true tale of courage and friendship that Tolkien wrote.Who is this one armed Ork? Where did this Elf woman come from? Why does Radagast get more than a mention? What the hell is Orlando Bloom doing there?Why isn't it Bilbo, getting them out of everything, all on his own after Gandalf leaves? Wasn't that the whole point of the book? Why Tolkien called it ""The Hobbit"" and not something else?The slapstick action scenes even seem designed to become future theme rides in whatever amusement park the studio is connected to.Beyond the visual candy, this is a wretched and whorish adaptation of a wonderful story.Sad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
People ask too much of this series,"I knew this would happen.In 'An Unexpected Journey', Jackson and co. copped a pasting from fans, many who have submitted reviews for this movie as well, stating that the movie dragged on.So, he goes out and provides an action-packed movie this time around, and is smacked again, this time for not staying true to the book? Can the guy ever win? What 'The Desolation of Smaug' provides is a fantastic action-adventure story. Bilbo continues to build into a stronger, more courageous character, Thorin's obsession begins to come to the fore, and Gandalf has a side-story of his own that starts to blend the overall story-arc with that of Lord of the Rings.I read a complaint that this movie feels as though it is directed at a younger audience. Of course, the person making the complaint fails to acknowledge that the overall tone of the book he holds so dear is also directed at a younger demographic. I was 12 when I read it. Others I know were around the same age - THAT is who the book is directed at, so why not the movie? The adaption of Smaug to the big screen was brilliant and I loved his scenes with Bilbo, and I LIKED the involvement of the elves to the level they were used. Their action sequences were breathtaking, and it was great to see a little more depth added to the character of Thranduil.I guess you can't please all of the people, all of the time, but I've long thought that many reviewers look for things to have a whine about, and reading the user-reviews for this movie confirm that.Take care.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My boyfriend makes me watch these movies.,"My boyfriend has made me watch all of the Lord of The Rings movies, the past Hobbit and tonight we saw this one. All of them are confused in my mind and I can't recall what happened when and what was supposed to be before or after, it's all out of order, but most of the time it's just people walking far distances and overcoming obstacles so it's almost irrelevant anyway. The filming, editing, characters, music and effects about these movies are amazing it's just that the story line for me is not the most captivating which I know is an unpopular opinion so I won't bother factoring that into my rating. One thing that confuses me is why Orlando Bloom's eyes keep changing colour. I actually thought he was supposed to be an evil cousin from his other character who had brown eyes because Gandolf said something about beware of the elves who are less intelligent than their relatives and then Orlando Bloom was living in this other town suddenly and seemed to be jealous and less like the beautiful magical being I had remembered him as. My boyfriend was confused as to what evil cousin I was talking about after the movie so I guess I had that all wrong the entire time. The creators of this movie are amazingly good at creating these lands, villages and kingdoms that I wish really existed so I could go and live there forever. This film introduced some good characters such as the barge guy who helped them and Stephen Fry's cute little assistant guy. I can never remember their names. The dragon was also likable for being an unlikeable character. Love when that happens. However, I was sad that the best character of all didn't make a single appearance in this movie: Gollum. I love him, he's adorable and he makes it all worthwhile. But that's okay, I still paid attention the whole time. I give it an 8 out of 10 because the creators of it are crazy good at creating worlds, characters and excellent movies that many people love. I take away 1 point for the eye confusion and another for the lack of Gollum. It's not my favourite type of film but it takes a lot of time, talent and creative genius to put things like this together. Great work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm waiting for next year!,"First off I wanna state that I am in fact in between a regular human being and a LOTR/hobbit fan etc. This review is not based on a full fledged fan but a viewer of this movie. So this is the second installment of The Hobbit series directed by the same director of LOTR's by Peter Jackson. If you didn't already know this takes place before any of the LOTR movies. Although one book, Peter Jackson split it into three films to fit all of the book at an equal pacing. I thought of the movie as being great and very similar to the LOTR. As in traveling loads of the movie with a melody going and than stopping at a important plot point, than doing the same. Smaug is a very very big dragon and from all these wide angle shots, he looks ginormous. I didn't keep my eyes away mainly the whole movie it was like taking me back to the LOTR days. Throughout this movie it sets up for the third and final installment coming next year, making it not a new concept rather continuing what little scenes were shown and help the start of the story of the final segment. In summary, I liked it and i'm looking forwards for the final movie in 2014.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson do not fails! (the fifth time),"A lot of people were waiting for this movie. One year passed and here it is!Same music, same faces in the big screen!I liked this movie almost the same as I liked the first one. But I can't give it 10 points. I don't know why, maybe I don't liked some actors, maybe some scenes or the movie was a bit too long, maybe HFR 3D sometimes wasn't so good, and I thought how it will looked in the good old 2D format...As I understand some viewers of this film are die-hard fans, some just like it for one or another reason, some are angry for changing the storyline from Tolkien's book.Now I want to say that it's know only about LOTR and Tolkien. Now it is about Peter Jackson too. He does what very little people have done. All in all, Peter Jackson do not fails. This is why he enters the cinema (and popular culture) history. This director put Tolkien in the whole new level of understanding, he showed us new perspective to this brilliant piece of literature.This is how I look at The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Not as this film could be understood on it's own, but in the wider perspective of popular culture and fantasy cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Jackson's a kid in a candy store -- and we get the diabetes,"Peter Jackson's 3-episode interpretation of The Hobbit is turning into a sticky, gooey mess. What a horrid series of films.This isn't about book purism or Tolkien loyalty or any of that. I understand the difference between writing and filmmaking, and why one can never translate directly into the other (especially when the latter occurs 75 years after the former). My contempt for the Desolation of Smaug concerns filmmaking itself: storytelling, dramatic tension, character development. Even the framing, action and stuntwork do not work in this film.The root of the problem is PJ does not have an internal filter. He dreams up ideas of increasing ridiculousness, and throws them on the screen whether the story benefits or not. He dreams up wonderful elvish combat maneuvers: they're in the film. He dreams up various orc prosthetics: they're in the film. He dreams up goofy, hammy character appearances: they're in the film. He dreams up immense set pieces and constructs unbelievable battles in the midst: they're in the film. But you can't do filmmaking that way! Good films, even good action films, need to be built on a solid core of character and story.In fairness, the Hobbit itself is not particularly meaty in those areas: it's a bit goofy, a bit sparse. It was a children's book, after all. But that's what a good screenplay needs to reinforce in such cases. It's what PJ and his writing team did in LOTR! They beefed up the story and added emotional context to the characters to make the audience care about what was happening. When Frodo was confronted by the Witchking in the Two Towers, you were afraid for the guy because the film, up to that point, made you care!In the Hobbit, however, they are not shoring up the character and story in this three-layer cake at all. Instead, they are slathering on such a heavy coating of empty frosting in the form of goofy action sequences, sticking on gumdrops of forced slapstick comedy, and pouring on a thin crust of chocolate sprinkles in the form of CGI (much of which is poorly done and pulls you out of the film). In the end, you have a cake that's inedible because of all the sugary crud slathered on top. All this ""stuff"" totally overwhelms the cake in the center, completely obscuring the overall storyline, and smothering the characters of Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin, and the rest of the poor dwarfs (who mumble along in complete obscurity for the duration of the film). Even Smaug gets short-shrift (he is a marvel of visual magnificence, but is also reduced to a slapstick fool before too long).What PJ does not have is a filter. You can tell he's gained so much power as a filmmaker that no one is challenging his decisions. He gets away with everything no matter how ridiculous, no matter how distracting, no matter how smothering. He has no sanity check, no capacity to self-edit. And the film suffers for it: it's so overdone in action and set pieces, you become bored with it. I was praying for the movie to be over by the end.When you engage in any creative endeavor, it's important you get all your ideas on the table, no matter how outlandish. But then you ALSO need to learn how to edit, how to scrape away everything that is not helping you tell your story or portray the vision. It can be a hard thing, giving up that great idea, but if it helps you reach your goal, you drop it by the wayside, and focus on what's important.PJ did not do that, and as a result, we have a sticky, gooey, sickly-sweet mess of a cake that will surely give us all diabetes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Much Better Than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey!,"To begin with, the greatest credit for this amazing film goes to Late J. R. R. Tolkien and his genius storytelling.I am posting this review having just watched The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug in a Cinemax situated in my neighborhood and was not disappointed one bit. I found the acting very genuine, relatable and believable unlike the last one; especially Martin Freeman was outstanding once again as Bilbo and Benedict Cumberbatch's voice effect as Smaug and the Necromancer was, partly, both scary and funny (I don't know why did I felt funny; maybe because of Sherlock). The Dwarfs fared much better than they did last time, especially, I felt as a viewer and a big movie enthusiast, Richard Armitage as Thorin and Aidan Turner as Kili were notably more mature in their acting and were more relatable on an emotional level (but still, I think, there is lots of room for improvement). The rest of them didn't get much dialogue and impact scenes, so it is hard for me to tell how they were. Other than them, I was so glad to see Legolas back again. Orlando did justice to the role and was very good in his scenes, the same way he was in LOTR. Evangeline Lilly was a breath of fresh air and looked stunningly beautiful as Tauriel. Another important character was the character of Bard played by Luke Evans; I am personally rooting for him. As so far, he is the only character with some substance, representing men in this series.Ian McKellen was awesome as Gandalf, the Grey wizard, as always! (Do I really need to mention that?!) :)When it comes to directing, I believe Peter Jackson (finally!) was just at his best here. The pace of the movie was just right this time and the scenes felt neither too fast nor too slow. The locations were just breathtaking and I was glued to its beauty, drooling with awe. The technology used in making the movie has to be one of the best because, it felt THE BEST, by far. This is the first time, I have seen such wizardry with 3D technology. While watching the movie back then, for a second, I almost forgot the Dragon cannot possibly harm me when I jittered in my seat, spilling all the popcorn I was having unto me, which fortunately no one seemed to notice. LOL. Phew!Lastly, I will conclude by saying that, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug will surely be a big success (if it isn't already). I am giving it a 9/10 this time only for the sole reason that I am saving the perfect score for the third of this series. Hopefully, I won't be disappointed.

a very enjoyable film,I am fan of the LOTR movies but I have not read the books. I know its really hard to please the people who loves the books especially if its a classic book like the hobbit so I do understand completely anyone who have a problem with this movie. god knows I have issues with few adoptions of books that I like. I enjoyed this movie a lot i was waiting for it since the last hobbit movie and it did not disappoint ** pros ** -lets address the big elephant in the room the smog was amazing as a villain Cumberpatch did an amazing voice acting it is in my opinion one of the best dragons i have seen in a movie.-it had chair griping moments the action was great.it had me wanting for more i want to know the story so bad i cant wait for the last movie-always love to see the characters of LOTR and some references**cons** - it is the 2nd part of the trilogy that means they will try to put most of the story in it which make some parts of it slow and feels long- same problem i had with the two towers (both are awesome though)its more darker than the 1st hobbit i liked it a bit less because of that i found the 1st movie to be so hilarious i did laugh a lot this feels more like LOTR but its just a preference i like comedy,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Return of the form...,"Have to say that I went into the cinema with a feeling of trepidation for this sequel, seeing as how weak and dull I found the first installment. It wouldn't have surprised me if it was as bad as the first one, which would have put in mind George Lucas' Star Wars prequels (where the final chapter was the only decent one of the lot) or The Matrix sequels, which diminished the legacy of the first one.In any case, I'm happy to report that the trilogy is on track now, which is a good thing...I can't imagine being motivated to continue watching the trilogy if the first two were plain rubbish.Even though I haven't refreshed my memory of the first one (why would you?), I sort of bluffed my way into the sequel, despite wondering on occasion whether this was the sequel to the great ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy or the prequel. So, for those of you playing at home, it might help to watch the movies in quick succession so you don't forget the narrative. The sequel doesn't make things easy for the absent viewer by jumping straight into the middle of things without a preamble along the ""Previously on The Hobbit..."" line.The movie was pretty action packed but not in a bad way. It was all entertaining stuff in other words. Can't say that I was engrossed/entranced by the story, but I liked how it was on track as far as the major threads of the story go (the dwarfs quest to reclaim their kingdom and vanquish the dragon living there now). Speaking of the dragon, into this movie I was wondering what a ""Smaug"" was...one of the cons of only seeing these movies during their cinema runs. 'Interestingly', I 'learned' in the first movie that dragons ""covet"" gold. In this movie I learned that dragons can speak. I initially thought that this was an effect of the ring worn by Bilbo Baggins, but turns out not to be the case. It kind of made more sense if you attributed that power speech to the ring (...!).One thing I liked about the movie included star of ""Lost"" Evangeline Lilly's turn as an Elf...she was quite nice as an Elf.Managed to recognise some actors in this movie...picked Stephen Fry right away, despite all his makeup, as well as Sylvester McCoy, but that may have been due to having recently watched ""Doctor Who: The ultimate guide""...because I'm pretty sure McCoy must have played the same character in the first movie. I also thought that perhaps Fry did the voice for Smaug in this movie, but I was mistaken on that front.In my review of the first movie of this trilogy, I go into the things that bothered me about it. For this movie, I suppose the best that I can come up with is to question whether barrels really do have the floatative properties that they have in the movie. Hmm...actually, I forgot to mention how the Elves in this movie seem to knock the Orcs down like ninepins. Hell, one Elf would seem capable of taking out an entire Orc army!Just a minor observation...I could have sworn I saw the infamous name ""Alan Smithee"" in the credits...around the bottom, right hand side of the credits...but now that I think about it, maybe it was in that section...I do remember reading somewhere that the director makes an appearance in this movie...so, perhaps he didn't use his real name? If this movie had turned out as bad as the first then it would have been fair enough for good ol' Smithee to take the credit for the directing in this movie too!Hopefully the final chapter of this trilogy will really make up for the poor start...something which really captures the imagination more and engrosses you. Whilst this movie was entertaining, it felt more like it was joining the dots as far as action and narrative check points were concerned. I'd like to be absorbed by the next movie and not just entertained.One last thing...I mentioned the Easter egg of the director's appearance in this movie...I also remember reading somewhere, I think, that Peter Jackson included a character from LOTR who doesn't feature in The Hobbit. Perhaps it was Legolas. Maybe that's a bit of a plot hole? As in, is it coherent that Legolas would be in that part of the world at that particular point in time? Since its been a while since I saw the LOTR trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, I have to say that at times I wondered ""Is that Legolas? Or is it the other blonde guy?"". They kind of looked similar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A well made movie,"I thought The Desolation of Smaug was a very well made movie.It wasn't a literal adaption of the book, which I think is only normal. After all you can't compare reading a book to watching a movie. Reading a book 'only' requires to let your imagination run free to create the story, the characters, the scenery, ... in your mind. If you missed something or didn't get something right away, ... you just read back. A movie has the challenge of showing you the story and doing so in a convincing way.In my opinion The Desolation of Smaug is a rather intelligent retelling of the story, with amazing quality of visuals (nature, sets, ...).Sure the pace of the movie isn't all that high, and it makes one wonder if it was really necessary to make three parts. However, allowing the time to get to know the (many many) characters (especially if you didn't read the book), to let the magnitude of the scenery sink in, and to properly tell the story, I thought the slow pace was a plus and reason enough to forgive the sometimes lengthy passages.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst of the lot-It's deeply frustrating,"This film is the epoch of how Jackson's style can be such a mixed bag. There are several brilliant sequences that feel utterly like Tolkien brought to life. I.e. The game of cat and mouse that Smaug plays with Bilbo and the pre-elves part of Mirkwood. At the same time there are absurdities that render the film very silly, i.e. The barrel escape, battle and the giant gold dwarf. The film whiplashes between the best and worst of what Jackson has done with middle earth.That said I want to defend Tauriel. I like the character and I like the romance she has with Kili. I think the relationship gels with the friendship theme between Legolas and Gimli in LOTR and as elf-mortal pairing that crops up again and again in Tolkien. More to the point, the lack of feminine characters is a huge issue in Middle Earth and just having another woman present breaks up the masculine energy. Alfred is the (basically) invented character that deserves scorn.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This film maybe overlong but it ain't no King Kong.,"Has some pacing issues and is perhaps too character cluttered but the second chapter of the Hobbit is a great romp. It starts with a bang with the chase still on from the previous film leading onto some trippyness and great action scenes in the forest, to the inclusion of Legolas and his lady friend Tauriel who's appearance isn't as forced as it could have been.The film grinds to a halt once Bilbo and the gang enter laketown where not a lot of consequence occurs but the grand unveiling of Smaug makes plodding through these scenes worth it. Smaug the dragon is definitely one of the best CGI creations in a movie. The size and scale of this character is immense with Benedict Cabbagepatch lending his refined and silky voice to the vain unstoppable dragon.An amazing score from Howard Shore, just heightens the tension and the atmosphere of these middle earth movies significantly. Although I think Tolkien must be rolling in his grave hearing Ed Sheeran's warbling.The Hobbit part 2 is most memorable for it's inventive action set pieces such as the barrel sequence, the spider fight and Gandalf's showdown with some evil dude in a tower. All these scenes make the film very episodic like a Saturday matinée. Martin Freeman is also a delight to watch as Bilbo Baggins, he is a great physical comedian as well as verbal and all these qualities are very chaplinesque which adds great character to this unexpected hero.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Oh Smog,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an exhilarating and visually stunning installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's classic tale, deserving of a perfect 10 out of 10! This film continues the adventure of Bilbo Baggins and the company of dwarves as they journey to reclaim their homeland from the fearsome dragon Smaug, and it does so with remarkable flair.From the moment the film begins, it captivates with its breathtaking cinematography and lush landscapes of Middle-earth. The visual effects are top-notch, particularly in the depiction of Smaug, brought to life with incredible detail and menace by the brilliant work of CGI and the voice acting of Benedict Cumberbatch. Smaug is not just a terrifying dragon; he is a complex character, and the interaction between him and Bilbo is one of the film's standout moments.The pacing of The Desolation of Smaug is expertly handled, blending thrilling action sequences with moments of character development. The film does a fantastic job of deepening the relationships among the characters, especially the dynamic between Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the dwarves, as well as the budding connection between Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). This added depth enriches the narrative and makes the stakes feel even higher.The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, particularly the thrilling barrel chase scene that showcases Jackson's flair for creating heart-pounding sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The film balances these intense moments with quieter scenes that allow for reflection and growth among the characters.Howard Shore's musical score continues to enhance the story, weaving in themes that evoke the essence of Middle-earth and amplifying the emotional weight of pivotal moments. The music seamlessly blends with the visuals, creating an immersive experience that draws you deeper into the adventure.The Desolation of Smaug successfully builds upon the foundation laid by the first film, An Unexpected Journey, and sets the stage for an epic conclusion. Its exploration of themes such as courage, loyalty, and the allure of power resonates throughout the narrative, making it not just an adventure film but a profound tale of growth and discovery.In conclusion, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a fantastic film that brilliantly captures the spirit of Tolkien's work while providing a thrilling cinematic experience. Its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and masterful storytelling make it a standout entry in the Middle-earth saga. For its ability to engage and excite, I wholeheartedly give it a perfect 10 out of 10! This film is a must-watch for fans of fantasy and adventure, as it continues to bring the magic of Middle-earth to life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A well done sequel,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug I thought held about the same quality as the first Hobbit movie did.

I thought the movie was very entertaining, exciting and was once again filled with amazing settings. The adventure continues and once again it is one that should not be missed. I even gave this sequel one rating point more than its predecessor as I thought it held and even higher quality than the first one did.

Martin Freeman delivers a nuanced portrayal of Bilbo Baggins, and Ian McKellen continues to amaze as Gandalf. The addition of Evangeline Lilly and Luke Evans as Tauriel and Bard respectively adds depth and complexity to the story. The climax, featuring the titular dragon Smaug, is a visual and auditory feast that will leave audiences in awe. Overall, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a must-watch for any fantasy or action fan, and is a worthy addition to the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely more substantial than the other two Hobbit films.,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is easily the most potent film in the now infamous trilogy of films based on JRR Tolkien's classic children's book, that would result in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy of novels. The second film in The Hobbit Trilogy is, I believe to be, the strongest out of the hastily extended three-part series; unfortunately, try as it may, it does fall short of the wonder The Lord of the Rings films gave audiences worldwide.The Desolation of Smaug does have some notable set pieces in it, like the barrel sequence and of course Samug's scenes in The Lonely Mountain make for some very captivating scenes that qualify the story's controversial morphing into a three-part film. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a great motion-captured performance that shows one of the best looking dragons in film history, and The Desolation of Smaug was probably key to transforming The Hobbit into a trilogy, from the studio executive perspective at least. This film essentially becomes a villain showcase for one of the best dragons realized for the big screen.I personally think that The Desolation of Smaug is the chapter that makes this (reluctant) trilogy show its worth: there are so many payoffs that the preceding film couldn't muster, thanks to there being more substance to this film than An Unexpected Journey.This is the film out of The Hobbit movies that will (hopefully) convince naysayers to not ignoring the series completely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Hideous goblins fight nice, handsome elves","Throughout what seemed like an endless sequence of attacks by giant spiders, chases by hideous goblins riding monstrous wolves, Jason-Bourne-type choreographed fights between nice, handsome elves and hideous goblins, and hideous goblins being dispatched in a variety of imaginative ways by nice, handsome elves, I was wondering, how will Jackson handle the Thrush at the secret entrance to the Lonely Mountain? In the end we saw about 5 seconds of the Thrush (maybe real animals are more difficult to render than imaginary monsters) and the chance to offer the audience something enchanted, understated and mysterious was missed.Maybe I'm being too demanding - if you want magic, read the book, just don't expect it from modern films.In truth, the film isn't bad and heaven knows we're lucky to have in Mr Jackson a writer/director/producer who is thoroughly acquainted with the source material. The magical kingdoms are breathtakingly imagined; Smaug is magnificently malevolent; Lake-town is grittily realistic. The Necromancer is suitably thrilling and adds welcome detail to events only vaguely alluded to in the book.Despite some liberties with the plot to introduce unnecessary romantic interludes and to ensure consistency with the earlier filmed versions of Lord of the Rings, the actors are largely sympathetic and the film more exciting and better-paced than the first instalment.Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a children's fairy tale, so I think he would be surprised to see his gentle story transformed into a sequence of CGI battles. Somehow though, I don't think that he'll be spinning in his grave. He probably will, however, be wearing a rueful smile...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darker continuation and a good middle part of the trilogy,"Compared to the first part, here, the atmosphere gets darker and grimmer,the character developments, especially Thorins', are more complex about the motivations that drive them,the tension increases as the real enemy is revealed,the set design, the productions values, the costumes are masterfully crafted, so much details in each character, each picture. The world building is great.For my taste, the action is too exagerated, on the other hand, the camera work and editing are playful, masterful and breathtaking.Martin Freeman in one of his best roles as Bilbo.Great watch.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
8 stars? You MUST be joking.,"I really enjoyed ""The Trilogy of the Ring"" and I liked reading ""The Hobbit"", so I was very disappointed when I saw ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013).There is no compelling plot. There is no character development. The dialog is uninspired. There is not a single character who connects with the audience; or with any other character, for that matter. Gandalf appears at the beginning of the movie and then reappears at the end... he was missing throughout most of the movie.The entire film consists of ugly orcs (they all look a lot alike) who are hypo-testosteroned half-wits who love fighting anything they see, even rocks. They're bulked up and covered with war paint and they have fearsome weapons. Fortunately, they are no match for two elves and an unarmed hobbit! Every fight scene looks like every other fight scene, which look like the worst fight scenes from the trilogy... swarming orcs somehow being defeated by the greatly-undermanned but truly-inspirational hobbit community.The special effects are not bad.Here's the thing: Peter Jackson is running a scam on us. Groupies like me come running back and we contribute our money in the hope that we will see a good movie, hopefully even better than the trilogy. What we get is... (What? I can't say that?).You might be able to watch this movie and enjoy it, if you prepare correctly. The first step would have to be liberal application of mind-numbing pharmaceuticals with optical enhancements. Then get someone to drive you to the theater, please.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Well made movie.,"Unlike its predecessor the focus here wasn't slow emotional storytelling but rather a string of roller coaster action sequences. The right dialogues were adopted from the book, some nice quips were left out but they made up for that with the amazing and creative action sequences.There's elves killing goblins more gracefully than you could imagine, hobbits in barrels and even Gandalf battling pure darkness head on. There is so much more that can be done in a movie based on imagination as rich as Tolkien's and they used the scenarios at hand to seam in some awesome moments. Of course as a trade off the emotional parts seemed a bit rushed sometimes.IN terms of performances, Martin freeman was the perfect Bilbo in this one and Cumberbatch's voice as Smaug was a great choice. The soundtrack was very similar to the earlier ones and the effects were better than ever. I was very impressed and satisfied and I saw it on a regular screen so I suggest you go for a full on IMAX 3D version at the best theater in town.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent sequel despite a slightly bloated narrative,"I do have some misgivings about The Hobbit being split into three parts, as I'm sure many others do too. If it needed to be split at all, two parts would have done just fine, as the book is also divided into two parts. Still, I can't complain with most of what I've seen. Visually and in terms of spectacle, Peter Jackson continues to outdo himself with every successive film. Still, that doesn't change the fact that these movies have been padded with extra material in an effort to tie them more strongly to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, what Peter Jackson has given us is just fine and quite enjoyable. Riveting even.This film begins a year before Bilbo and the company start off on their journey at a meeting between Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. While this might have been more at home in the previous installment, it does add character depth and clarifies the motivation behind wanting to take back the mountain. The film then proceeds to continue where the last one left off. On their way to the mountain, they encounter all manner of creatures, from giant spiders and orcs, to elves and humans. At times it feels a little episodic, with the company going from one setpiece to another, but the overall narrative thrust and ultimate goal keep the story going along at a nice pace.If there's one major complaint I have, and not just with this installment, it's that Peter Jackson has grown very reliant on CGI to augment, and in other cases completely replace practical effects. In no case is this more apparent as in the orcs, which are largely CGI. They worked very well in the Lord of the Rings as actual people with makeup, and I don't understand why they couldn't have continued that way in this Hobbit trilogy. Still, I digress slightly. There were also moments where it was clear that they were on sets. It took a little bit out of the magic of it all, but I was still wowed by the depth, breadth and level of detail in the landscapes. Also, for a movie with a lot of walking and talking, the action, when it came, served its purpose well. I kind of wish I had seen this in theaters for the sheer spectacle of it all. Two sequences that stand out in particular were a barrel escape from the elves, while being attacked by orcs, and the moment when the company finally meets Smaug. These two sequences stand out as being among the best in the trilogy so far, full of action and tension.Acting-wise, everyone gives a great performance, although I still can't really distinguish between most of the dwarfs. I'll also give major props to Benedict Cumberbatch for some outstanding voice work as Smaug. However, there were also a couple of small roles, one in particular (which I won't spoil) which kind of took me out of the movie. One final positive I'll mention is the incredible (as usual) score by Howard Shore. It really helps to set and maintain the epic tone of the film. Overall, while not perfect, THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a stellar production of a classic story (or at least part of one) and sets up the finale quite nicely. Any serious film fan should want to see this, and I highly recommend watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"I'm afraid I still really struggled with the lightweight casting here, but once I'd convinced myself to get over that, I found this to be a far more characterful and entertaining adventure. With the dragon ""Smaug"" now safely in possession of the gold, it falls to ""Thorin"" (Richard Armitage) and his band of dwarves to make their way - via the misty mountains and the realm of the elves - to the human settlement of ""Laketown"" where the nimble-fingered ""Bilbo"" (Martin Freeman) must find and use a secret way into the lair so he can try to repossess the ""Arkenstone"". Meantime, the mischievous ""Gandalf"" (Sir Ian McKellen) is off having escapades of his own in the South? Will they rendezvous in time to thwart the increasingly narked fire-breather. What is clear here is that some of the philosophising from the book is very much on the back burner. This is an out-and-out action movie with loads of combat scenes, some very clever visual effects that almost rendered me a bit sea-sick at times - all built around a solid story of companionship and determination. Characters are playing to their strengths and weaknesses; relationships are being forged and challenged; courage is being found - and lost and it's all enjoyable and engaging to watch on the big screen. Maybe I could have been doing without the romantic interludes (yuk!) but for the most part this is a great looking and visionary interpretation that just happens to have a cast that really should have been so much better. A good, not a great, watch that tees us up nicely for the finale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Mundane second installment,"While the hobbit an unexpected journey started off on a good start the hobbit desolation of Smaug does not offer the same adrenaline as the first part of the hobbit. Most the backstory given near the end of unexpected Journey there's not much going on in the desolation of smaug apart the hinting of Smaug himself. not as many memorable scenes are found in this with the exception of the Mirkwood Forest Scene,the lake town scene & of course once they finally reach the mountain Bilbo,thorin and the other doors take a back seat for a good chunk of the movie showing off what's going on with Gandalf and the other wizards preparing for what's coming even though it's quite obvious what is to come The movie succeeds it's excellent Fighting choreography between the wizards and also the elves present in the film. Well not revealing much I will say one of the biggest highlights in the movie is the dragon Smaug himself is hands-down one of the best depiction of a dragon ever shown on film and not a dragon that you really see in pictures . Overall the desolation of Smaug suffers from the fact that while you see characters return certain new characters introduced are not at all that welcome. A romance between two of the characters but it has no development and it's just added just to appeal the young demographic. There's a lot more dialogue in this film and it's not the informative kind",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Hobbit Suited Best for Video game Enthusiasts, not Tolkien Fans","This is not a movie for devoted Tolkien fans. Or even for true fans of ""The Hobbit."" This is Peter Jackson's fan-fiction ""re-imagining"" of Tolkien's first book. He's known for taking liberties with the source material. It worked well 90% of the time in the extended editions of the LOTR films. But the reverse is true with this prequel series (so far.) His changes and additions are jarring, annoying, and pointless.Like Lucas with his digital tools at ILM, Jackson has taken the Weta CGI SpFX and turned Middle Earth into a cheesy theme park full of action rides for adolescents. The overuse of 3D computer graphics in place of actual real-life sets and characters resembles a Pixar cartoon more than a fantasy-adventure epic. The orcs and villains in LOTR looked solid and believable. They were played by actors on-set. In The Hobbit, the goblins, trolls and orcs are video game characters with no substance. It's a shame what can happen when directors like Jackson, Lucas and Shyamalan, who held such promise, are given carte-blanche and huge budgets to feed their inflated egos. They lose all restraint and the ability to edit themselves. Every crazy idea is implemented. Nothing is too far-fetched or ridiculous.If you thought some action sequences in King Kong (2005) went overboard and on screen for too long – the dinosaur stampede being an example – that's nothing compared to what Desolation of Smaug has in store. It's mostly one implausible, dizzying roller-coaster ride after another. I'm all for thrill-rides, but enough is enough. At some point you need a break from the constant camera shots weaving in and out, up and down ad infinitum. Loses its impact after the first 4 minutes, then proceeds to make you nauseated or bored, or both. Whatever happened to story, character development, and emotional involvement? Marginalized in favor of Saturday morning cartoon fare. Battle sequences galore.By now, my initial joy at hearing that PJ had taken the reins of The Hobbit has been replaced with a regret that it wasn't directed by the first choice, Guillermo del Toro. He could not possibly have ruined it any worse than Jackson. Did somebody pull a switcheroo on us – exchange the fat, talented PJ for this new thin hack masquerading as the guy who gave us the beautiful LOTR trilogy?",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Triumph,"So here is the sequel to the brilliant ""an unexpected journey"" and what a film this is.

We are also introduced to some new characters such as Bard the Bowman acted by Luke Evans he is another solid, interesting character. There is also a new villain, Azogs son Bolg.

An Improvement on The First But Still Very Flawed,"I don't have much to say about this movie but overall it's pretty entertaining. There is some really dumb stuff that makes absolutely no sense. There's also, once again, a lot of unnecessary stuff (just to show that this shouldn't have been a trilogy). It's super unfunny and the comedy's really bad. Also, there's some poorly executed scenes in terms of the score, sound design and pacing in general. Not a bad movie at all, still does well in many other departments, but still far from perfect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Improvement over the first one,"I did not hate the first, I enjoyed it for the most part, but it had its issues. This movie resolved most of those issues. It's much more polished, focused, and a stronger structured film all together.Taking where the first one left off, Bilbo and his dwarf team continue toward Lonely Mountain to reclaim it against the dragon Smaug.Right away it starts the film by building in the tension of Smaug, which immediately puts us in build up mode, as the journey becomes more and more epic. There's much more going on in this one. The action is common, but it's very well executed, with some great choreography, and graphically impressive brutality. The characters are more involved and more likable in this one. You feel the desperation of Oakenshield to reclaim his specie's glory as they get closer and closer to the mountain, and you get scared for Bilbo when he comes face to face with Smaug. The introduction to other characters such as Legalis, Thranduil, and a reference to Gimley is also done well. It makes you feel more related to the original films, and it's very enjoyable.One thing that bothered me is Bilbo. He didn't feel as much like a protagonist in this one. In the first one, it's his retelling of his experience throughout the story, getting the ring, adapting to the group and what not. In this one, he feels like a side character supporting the cause of Oakenshield or Tauriel and Kili's chemistry. He has his moments, don't get me wrong, but most of the time he just goes with whatever he's told to. He has no passion or journey of his own to complete, it's mostly about Oakenshield's vengeance.With that said...Smaug. Good gracious, when that dragon appeared in the film I about pooped. Not only is the CGI really sharp, but the voice of Smaug by Benedict Cumberpatch is phenomenal. Plus it's not too often a dragon in a film gets development.The film really ends out of nowhere. Like obviously it's to set itself up for the next film, but the last one had an official ending. This one just kind of stopped. I didn't dislike it, but it was kind of strange, it didn't seem to fit with the epic tones of the films before it that officially concluded each chapter, then this one just stops in plain sight. Either way, the film is an improvement over the first one. Like I said I enjoyed the first a good amount, but this one just had more of what I was looking for in the series. And with what i'm hearing about the 3rd film, that's gonna surpass this one, so i'm super excited!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, but too long","The movie was fun for me, who never read ""The Hobbit"" by Tolkien. I liked it more, than the first hobbit-movie.Even if I enjoyed the movie, still many of the critics are true:1. It's a constant action ride, probably focusing on future computer game franchises.2. There is no real character or story development. Characters have almost nothing to do or say in the movie. I like Dean O'Gorman since ""The almighty Johnsons"", and I always wondered, when he will do or say something, but except a few lines his role was not more, than an extra's, when he finally appeared.3. There are many illogical turns and actions in the story. Maybe caused by deleted scenes...4. The motivation of the characters are sometimes hard to recognize.5. Like Spielberg, also Jackson can't decide where to end a movie. The last scene is obviously too long, confusing and hard to follow.In 3D I always had the feeling, that I am watching a MMORPG game. I am now very motivated to log in to the Free To Play ""LOTR Online"" MMORPG by Turbine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A  Key To Middle earth,"From the day that I read this news on IMDb which mentioned ""The Hobbit"" as a trilogy, I had this question in my mind that whether it's a right job to do or not. Its unbelievable but, what which was just a question for me, used by critics as a tool to start arguing with producers of this flick. They all had this opinion that decision made by producers regarding to breaking ""Hobbit"" into three parts was just and only because of the predictable financial profit which had been expected.In my opinion, making such movies, needs a great talent and also requires an experienced team behind the camera. You need to get accustomed with all the characters who have been mentioned in context of the book and you need to be much more talented in finding appropriate ones, to convince everyone they are exactly those whom all the audiences expected to be! Choosing Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins can be mentioned as a success. Great job done by cinematographer and fantastic jobs which have been made by sound editors and mixers of the movie all at the same time can be used to evaluate the actual value of this movie. Like most of the trilogies, ""The Desolation of Smaug"",the second episode of the series, is the best of it, better than ""An Unexpected journey"" because of more action scenes it has and better than ""Battle of the five armies"", because of the unity its screenplay has and surely, higher technical level in both visual effects and sound mixing which made this movie, a good sequel for its main title, ""The Lord of The Rings"".As a conclusion, despite of all the problems that you may mention, each as a deficiency for this title, based on what which has been mentioned above, I do believe in this fact that second episode of this challenging trilogy has that special something and proves how talented Jackson is in collecting the required data from available sources of Tolkien masterpieces. I myself enjoyed watching this movie and do recommend you to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The crucial portion of the story narration of 'Hobbit' trilogy.,"The second installment of the 'Hobbit' trilogy which is the prequel to 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 365 days of wait is over, last year around the same day I saw 'An Unexpected Journey'. It totally blew me away with those awesome thrilling adventures and great graphics especially to watch a favourite movie in high frame rate gave a new dimensional experience. Also to see the 'The Lord of the Rings' character in digital 3D especially Gollum was amazing.The movie kick starts with the director Peter Jackson's cameo as he crosses over from left to right on the screen having a bite of a carrot in a town called Bree. Then the missing scene from the first part of 'Hobbit' commence where the great wizard Gandalf the Grey offers the help to the dwarfs to reclaim their kingdom. After that the narration continues from where it ended in 'An Unexpected Journey'. The nonstop exciting journey of dwarfs proceeds in the middle-earth nothing lesser than its earlier part with the company of a Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. So the hope remains in Thorin, the next king of Erebor to fight back their enemy and take a revenge.The missing in this movie is the Gollum, I don't think he will come back in the next installment as well. A little disappointing for Gandalf fans as well. He was not in action as much we aspired to see his magical stuffs. If you are a die hard 'The Lord of the Rings' the list goes on. In another way it is great to see new faces around. But you must remember it is not the movie(s) about the 'ring', it is the dwarfs tale where it all happens before Gimli, son of Gloin.Like I said the good thing is the reintroduction of the Elvin prince of Woodland Realm, Legolas. Last time we saw him in the final battle of middle-earth in the movie 'The Return of the King'. The 'Lost' fame Evangeline Lilly was the newest major addition of the series and she was amazing. She lonely fulfilled the due of women's contribution of this particular movie of 'Hobbit' trilogy. Like she Luke Evans was also had a prominent role but I guess his major action sequences will come in the next part.In this and next paragraph I gonna write some good's and bad's of this movie. I wanna begin by saying HFR was unbelievable, the picture quality was very good with no blurs in fast panning camera sequences. I know few people may get hard time to adjust with smoothness in motion but you will get used to it if you already saw the first. Compared to 'An Unexpected Journey' it had a little more drama in story narration but as usual it had the adventures that happen in a tight situation. There's a similar kind escape scene what we had seen under the mountain kingdom Goblin. Here which happen in the water I mean the river where dwarfs are getting escaped from the Elves and of course the Arcs.""My arm is like tenfold shields, my teeth are like swords, my claws are the spear, the shock of my tail is a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane and my breath death"" is what the Smaug describes himself angrily. In this whole movie all I expected was to see the Smaug, the last great dragon of middle-earth. As we know it was an adaptation of children's book so I was curious to see Smaug to talk. In all the last four movies I have not seen talking animal as per my knowledge. The first time I got the impression of the root base of fantasy touch like we had seen in 'Narnia' and 'Harry Potter' movie series. The British actor Benedict Cumberbatch gave his incredible voice and performance through motion capture to the Smaug.There's nothing we can do than have a peek while it is in the cinema hall. As usual this movie will bomb the box office. I am already beginning to think about the 2015 Christmas holiday, without 'Hobbit' it will be most disappointment festival season. As for now I gonna end 2013 with this masterpiece.Tolkien would have been blown away to see his own creation in a breathtaking motion picture. He wrote it keeping in mind children, as based on a children the movie achieved the heights that no one ever imagined which attracted the adults more than children. So all the credits go to the man behind it, Peter Jackson and then the his cast and crew. Now I have to wait another 365 days to have the grand finale of the 'Hobbit' series, feels like one more decade to go. In the mean time I might see it again and wait for the Blu-ray. So what's your plan...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The only demerit that ""The Desolation of Smaug"" gets has to due with its length. It's too long by about forty five minutes.

An excellent film,"OK, so I may have been a little generous in my review of this film, but it was an excellent film in my opinion. In terms of character development, the film has not fallen short. Because of Martin Freeman's excellent display of hesitancy, the Bilbo character has nailed, and I feel the same about the other characters. My primary issue arises in terms of plot and story. I am an avid fan of the books, and while I felt the directors took a lot of creative freedom in The Hobbit part one, I feel like they almost completely ditched the book in this movie. Sure, the companions end up in the same place by the end of the movie, but damn if they took a lot of extra turns before then. If you have never read the books and can enter the movie with no idea as to what is going to happen, than enjoy an excellent film. If you have read the Hobbit, enjoy a rendition that has a Tolkien base. All in all, a very good film, unless you believe the movie should be the book in visual form, with nothing added or removed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great fun, if not exactly the same as the book","Last year Peter Jackson released the first part of his long anticipated Hobbit trilogy to large audiences and generally good reviews. It didn't match the sheer awesomeness of his Lord of the Rings films and was a bit slow in places, but it worked thanks to a talented cast, good action, and the director's love of- if not absolute faithfulness to- the source material. Starting where the last movie left off, Desolation of Smaug follows the formula and tone of its predecessor, but marks a general improvement in the direction of the trilogy.Anyone who saw the first movie will already have a pretty good idea what to expect from part two; everything that was in the book, plus a whole lot that wasn't. Not that this is entirely a bad thing. It may not be as faithful an adaptation as his Lord of the Rings films and the tone often varies greatly from the children's book it's based on, but the additional material is quite entertaining in its own right and blends well into the rest of the story. Which it should, considering that it's based on later supplementary writings by Tolkien which flesh out events that are hinted at in the book. And even if the additional scenes do take the film away from the tone of the children's' novel, they do bring it closer to the feel of Jackson's Ring trilogy.As with those films, there's a lot of epic combat here. Possibly more than was needed, but not so much that it becomes repetitive or impedes the story. The barrel riding sequence is one of the more unorthodox battles I've seen, and rather humorous at that. The encounter with the spiders of Mirkwood is fittingly creepy and makes a fine display of WETA's creature making skills, rather like the spider cave scene from Jackson's King Kong, but without the stomach churning gruesomeness. Most impressive are the fight scenes involving Legalos. Orlando Bloom doesn't look like he's aged a day since Return of the King and his moves are every bit as gorgeous as they were then.It's a bit odd that a character who wasn't even in the book should steal so many of the scenes, but there's no denying that he can fight and he looks awesome doing it, whether in a running archery duel or in an extremely physical slugfest with orc chieftain. Another section that was very good despite being nowhere in the book is the battle between Gandalf and the forces of the Necromancer. It is highly impressive from a special effects standpoint, and nicely fleshes out important events which the novel only hinted at.Of course Legalos is not the only one to chew the scenery. In the later sections, a certain dragon makes a very BIG impression. Vain, arrogant, and very well spoken, Smaug is the kind of callous predator who likes to play with his food before roasting it alive. His every word brims with anger and condescension, and his physique more than backs up the menace in his voice. He is absolutely massive, towering over the dwarfs and their grandest creations. It's clear that Thorin and his companions have no chance of defeating him, but their attempts are certainly entertaining.I will admit that the ending was a disappointment. It's not that they changed it from the book, but rather that it came at an earlier point in book than one would expect. When it became apparent that the movie was over, there were incredulous groans in the theater, but I suppose that this movie's less is the next one's gain. If anything, Desolation of Smaug has reinforced my opinion that The Hobbit would have worked better as two movies, and could easily have been fit into one, but admittedly it is grand adventure and good fun. It's still not equal Jackson's earlier trilogy, but it's a very good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Overlong, childish and full of plot holes","I adore Tolkien, and adored the LOTR movies. I didn't have a problem with the departures from the original - different genre, different person at the helm. I don't have a great problem with Jackson departing from the plot of The Hobbit as such, except that the original in no way justifies three movies.No, the problem for me is that the content that has been added is just so dire. There's a weight of unmemorable characters and the interaction feels stilted and wooden. There's even an added romance that's gratuitous and flimsy. The plot makes limited sense, and I spent most of the movie saying ""Why are they doing that? But surely they knew that already...? Oh, that's just silly.""To add to that, the CGI is pretty unimpressive. At its best - Smaug - it looks like a video game. As its worst, it's ridiculously over- choreographed fight scenes that had me yawning at their predictability - surfing on shields and bouncing on enemies' heads is now compulsory only because we can. This makes for good guys who are able to gallop around dispatching baddie after baddie while never getting a scratch - with one exception, itself neatly sidestepped. This makes for almost zero suspense.I was never entirely sure who was supposed to enjoy this movie. The scenes in Dol Guldur add some of the darkness of LOTR, and the spiders of Mirkwood are much more threatening, although Bilbo cuts through them like butter. On the other hand there's romance, there's slapstick, there are pointless shield-surfing fights every few minutes, and needless distracting cameos from LOTR franchise characters.For me, the movie's biggest crime is in its departure, not from the plot of the original, but from its spirit. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the story of an untraveled young man given a job that takes him on an adventure beyond the confines of a comfortable life, to which he ultimately returns grown and changed. The Hobbit movies seek to make the story over into an epic, a prequel to LOTR, but lose focus horribly whenever they lose sight of Bilbo's journey.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Smaug is HOT,"Benedict Cumberbatch and the WETA team did a truly AMAZING job on Smaug, the titular ""sexy porn star"" dragon.This beautiful mythical creature is brought to life, with seamless motions and voice. Smaug is an aesthetically pleasing spectacle of burgeoning heat and primal, organic movement. The voice that has been touted as a ""jaguar in a cello"" has been unleashed with bite and fire.It is definitely worth seeing this in IMAX 3D HFR. When Smaug raised his head, I reflexively reached out to pat him, it felt so real!It is fascinating to see so much of the actor imbued into the creature. The long fingers in the talons, the biceps and sharp angle of the elbow in the wings, even the cheek bones and bushy eyebrows in the face! It was a brilliant idea to use the motion capture as well as the voice. The directors vision of the fire building in the belly of the beast was also brilliant, adding just the right finishing torch...ahem...touch. ;)It is no wonder that Peter Jackson carefully saves this for the grand finale of this film. Which is not to say, the rest of the film doesn't have it's charm and merit.The beginning leaps right into where the last one ended, picking up the storyline immediately and quickly bringing the audience up to speed, be it to refresh the memory or to invite new viewers. You know upfront, that Gandalf (Ian Mckellen), is rounding up the dwarfs and the hobbit, to go claim back the dwarven homeland.The Hobbit, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), is as endearing and funny as ever. Tickling the audience with his antics and mannerisms, with flawless comedic timing through out the film. It is especially impressively flawless timing when he does finally encounter Smaug, because during the making of the film, they were never in the same room. However, you never get a sense of the flow of conversation between them breaking. In fact quite the contrary, you feel the a natural rhythm and chemistry between them as if Smaug is looming over Bilbo, and Bilbo is shivering in his foot fur at Smaug's feet!Although purists may frown on the inclusion of the elven folk Tauriel (Evengeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), (as they are not present in this book) I found their involvement in the plot to be interesting and supportive of the overall story arc.It has been said Tauriel was written in, ""to balance out the wang"" in the film. It is pretty clear that there would have been a lack of female presence without her. I think, including her was a very good choice, and naturally provided the ensuing romantic storyline, that was quite beautifully unfurled. I also like that her story just hinted about the morals of the strong protecting the weak, but didn't get preachy at all.The action sequences do go a bit over the top and get a bit ridiculous with the somersaults and spinning weapons, but it does invite you to laugh about it and get lost in the fantasy of it, after-all it is a fantasy movie.I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm planning on seeing it in the cinema for a third time. (I usually do not see a movie more than once in the cinemas, but this one is so epically large, in so many ways, it is worth experiencing it on the big screen.)As I mentioned at the beginning, I highly recommend seeing it on the IMAX big screen and in 3D, as this is conducive to the immersion of this rich fantasy world. However, the second time I watched it in 2D and it was still very entertaining, particularly when the BIG FIERY DRAGON BLAZES ONTO THE SCREEN. *FOOOOM!!!*I really feel this is one of those movies that ""if have to see only one this season"" this is that movie. I hope you will see it, and enjoy it as much as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A definite improvement on its predecessor, an entertainer that is bound to grow on you with repeated viewings.","A definite improvement on its predecessor, but falls slightly short of an ardent fan's sky-high expectations— nonetheless, an entertainer that is bound to grow on you with repeated viewings.Plus Points: Good to see Jackson venturing into the relatively uncharted sections of the book, things that J.R.R. Tolkien left to reader's imagination or just briefly mentioned, for example:Expulsion of Sauron from Dol Guldur by Gandalf and co.Jackson also gives some identity to the otherwise generalized evil characters in the novel, like, Azog the Defiler, Bolg. This does give evil-side some counterparts to match against plenty of known good characters.Addition of Tauriel and Legolas in the film was a masterstroke too, and will work really when film reaches the crescendo in the battle of five armies. Inclusion of Legolas in the 'Hobbit' storyline is quite a shrewd move, since there in nothing in Tolkien's writings that denies it. However, it means Legolas and Bilbo were acquainted to one another prior to the fellowship's meet at Rivendale (in LOTR)—there is nothing in LOTR film that indicates this or otherwise! Open barrel ride was another great modification; the low-key and secretive barrel-escape of the novel, wouldn't have worked with the audience not familiar with Tolkien's work.Some Drawbacks: In Hobbit 1, exclusion of Gwaihir the Windlord—the king of magnificent talking eagles—was the one of the biggest disappointment for me. In this film, it is the mistreatment of Beorn's character; got his grandiose represented horribly wrong. To rub salt to the wound, script completely abridges Beorn's role to a meager sneak peek. Hope they redeem Beorn's to its deserving glory in the final battle.Length of the film is not an issue here; it is the improper utilization of length that makes the film drag at times. Could have worked on Visuals and special effects are undoubtedly brilliant...just like all the previous films. Hence, 'humdrumness' of visuals work well for someone new to the franchise, whereas, for someone who has followed it all through, film's special effects offer nothing new. It wouldn't be counted as a drawback for any lesser director...but from Jackson we expect magic every time! Overall, a good film that seems more of a stepping stone to the grand final, or so I hope! 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest of Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations!,"'THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The second film in director Peter Jackson's trilogy, based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 novel 'The Hobbit'. The three films also serve as prequels to Jackson's 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film trilogy (which were also based on books by Tolkien). This film picks up where 2012's 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' left off and once again finds the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman once again) and the wizard Gandalf (once again played by Ian McKellen) assisting a team of 13 dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (played again by Richard Armitage). They're on a journey to the Kingdom of Erebor in order to reclaim it from a vicious dragon named Smaug (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). This chapter also stars Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Ken Stott and James Nesbitt. It was written for the screen by Jackson and his usual writing partners (and co-producers on the film) Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh (Jackson's wife) as well as Guillermo del Toro (who was originally set to direct the 'HOBBIT' films). Despite all the rave reviews (from critics and fans alike) I found the movie to be the weakest of Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations.The film begins shortly after the end of the last one (after a brief flashback of Gandalf meeting Thorin) with Bilbo (Freeman), Gandalf (McKellen) and the dwarfs still being pursued by Azog (Manu Bennett) and his army of Orcs. The team receives aid from a skin-changer, named Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), in the form of horses and a house to rest in. Gandalf then separates from the group and promises to meet up with them before they enter Smaug's lair. Bilbo and the dwarfs must continue to elude the Orc army while also dealing with giant spiders, Wood-elves and the people of Lake-town before taking on the dragon (Cumberbatch). In the mean time Gandalf investigates the whereabouts of the Necromancer (also played by Cumberbatch).The movie is of course visually spectacular and it does have a lot of awesome and gory action scenes (in Jackson's usual style) but there's too much pointless fighting and not enough drama and character development. It's the shortest of all the films in the series (at 2 hours and 41 minutes) but it seems like the longest (to me). Despite the movie being extremely action packed it feels incredibly slow paced (due to the story going nowhere) and really drags on. I felt the same way after seeing 'THE TWO TOWERS' for the first time (which is my least favorite film of that series) so maybe it's just the curse of being the middle movie but I think stretching this book into three (nearly three hour) films was a bad idea. Of course not from a money point of view, the first movie made a billion dollars and I'm sure this one will as well (or at least close to it) but based on artistic film merit this one fails (pretty much). It is a good action flick and a visual feast but that's about it. I'm not one to complain about filmmakers taking creative liberties, when adapting their source material into film, but this movie detours so much from it's story that it weakens the overall viewing experience, even when not comparing it to the book. 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' is slower paced but I still think it's a better (and more enjoyable) film; it also at least stays true to the essence of the book. This chapter is made just to please action junkies (which it should), it does have a minor love story (involving a dwarf and two elves) but that's about all the character drama we really get here. I still enjoyed the movie (and will probably like it more upon repeat viewing, when I know what to expect) but it is disappointing and not as good as the other four films. It's funny how similar these 'LORD OF THE RINGS' prequels are to the 'STAR WARS' ones; Peter Jackson and George Lucas are very similar filmmakers!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Smaug's majestic presence is reason enough to watch this.,"In an otherwise mediocre (or just good enough) trilogy, this one gets an extra star only because of the majestic presence of Smaug; from its digital detailing to its voice by Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug is magnificent in every scene it's present in. Never before on screen has a dragon been presented with so much character and intelligence. Bilbo's conversation with Smaug is quite fascinating to watch; it's reminiscent of the one Bilbo shares with Gollum in first part, but this one is filled wit more wit and humour.Martin Freeman truly embodies the character of Bilbo; from his walk to his mannerisms, he's truly a hobbit. He is the only character worth caring about.The barrel ride across the stream is really well-shot; it's rider point-of-view camera angles really makes us part of the adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
As Awesome as the first part.,"I was satisfied with the first entry in the trilogy. Still for the past year and a half, i think the idea of making one book into a 3 part movie is stupid, but when i watch the movies, i forget about it. The movie's story is a continuation of The Hobbit story line. The Characters are still the same with addition of some new characters. But for some reason, there's not as much comedic relief from the characters. Which is weird to me, but i think it was a good idea because of the darker tones of the movie. The setting is perfect, the creepy fog, the woods the lakes. All perfect for this chapter in the series. The acting is still really good, the interaction between characters was still really good. The action was really good. And Smaug Was awesome. I'm not going into the character of Smaug, because I don't want to ruin anything. Everything for a nearly perfect sequel is there, can't wait for part 3.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Two films in one,"A filmed to be looked upon in two ways, either a disaster or a worthwhile attempt.As a second installment of 'The Hobbit' it's an unmitigated disaster. Even more so than Pt 1 'An unexpected journey' it deviates, omits, twists, changes and even adds to the narrative of the book so much as to make it barely recognisable from the original text.I'm not going into detail here as this could run to a 3,000 word draft but if you're expecting a version of the children's book full of its quirky characters, sections of humour, general sense of danger that's not too dark or threatening.....well forget it. You won't see that here.However, as the second prequel to the Lord of The Rings film trilogy it works fine. Full of dark brooding danger, lots of loud music, incessant Orc killing (some of which is veering on pantomime though), loads of scenes referencing to events which will be revealed in the LOTR films, and if you haven't read The Hobbit, you'll probably enjoy it.Either way, the final section with Bilbo & Smaug just about works, but the film condenses their conversations to a single visit. In the context of the film this is a bit overlong, but it additionally preludes another far too long, and unnecessary section where the dwarfs (without wishing to add a spoiler) run about a lot and the special effects team go bonkers.Viewed the film at the cinema in a party of six (5 had read the book). 4 thought it was really good - the one who hadn't read the book can't wait for The Hobbit 3 to be released - 1 thought the dragon sequence far too long (like myself) and I, well the review above.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An improvement of what was already great.,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an improvement on the already great An Unexpected Journey. The story about Dol Guldur starts to really take hold with it taking a surprising turn into something that links it more to The Lord of The Rings(As it should, being a prequel.) As a big fan of Tolkien's work, i like all of the added features from Tolkien's unreleased work and as the movie goes on you never want it to end. I think the movie is allowed to sway away from the source material as long as it is to the movie's benefit. Speaking of which, i don't care of the length of the movie as long as everything in it is good and well done.All the way from beginning to end, the movie keeps you on your toes, clawing for your next breath and ends on a magnificent cliff-hanger. The special effects are absolutely incredible and the characters extremely interestingFor my money it is the best movie of 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Elementary, my dear Wat (ahem) Bilbo...","One the first things that struck me was this - how much better this would have seemed on IMAX 3D (not the DMR variety, which IS playing in limited release in India, but if they had actually filmed few sequences using that format, and then we got to watch it in a good IMAX cinema - not DigiMAX/LieMAX).The next thing that struck me - why did it have to be another cliffhanger ending? I get it. The story continues. But, why not have each movie be self-sufficient as well? I don't think it's too much to ask. I've read the books, so I know what happens, but still I felt cheated. Esp. coming off 'Catching Fire' just last weekend (in India at least).The 3rd, and possibly more important, more responsible thing - when the initial LOTR movie came out, there was an uproar about PG13 rating allowing filmmakers to get away with a certain amount of gore, as long as there's no bleeding. We have Orcs in this, who get decapitated in all sorts of gruesome ways, and we're used to it all now, considering the 4 movies that have had 'it' abundantly. Perhaps this is the one that has it the most, flying at us in 3D. I'm all for hard R-rated stuff, but considering this is what our kids are gonna be watching, I am skeptical about the PG13 being awarded to this. It does help that we do not feel sorry for the Orcs in any way, but I think that was by design, and makes it all video-gamey, allowing us to immune ourselves to the violence that is being meted out, and somehow, that's not a good thing, IMO.All that apart, this is one rousing, spectacular swashbuckler, with all the fat trimmed off, so naysayers of the first one have literally nothing to crib about (but you never know with cribbers, seeing how I spent my first 2 paragraphs ranting). Jackson has made better movies, but it is nevertheless great to watch this one on the big screen. Sure, he could have avoided the Twilight-triangle, but it does not consume much screen time, and 1 of those scenes is actually tender, coming off of an unintentionally funny sequence (you'll know it when you see it).Holmes and Watson (ahem), Cumberbatch and Freeman, get together again, and do quite a bit of (this time, unintelligent, when compared to Gollum's and Bilbo's 'encounter' in the 1st one) verbal jousting before (literally) taking off. Armitage, McKellen and Bloom all continue to be good, while Fry, Pace and Evans are wasted.One of the big items on my wishlist (for this series) has been the re-creation of the battle from which Sauron has vanquished, and when I heard that Jackson was actually adding stuff not there in the books, I dared to hope. Alas, that is not to be, though he seemingly has added a lot of exhilarating stuff that's also not present in the books, along with plot arcs and characters.Here's hoping I catch it once again on IMAX, and await the final instalment next year, when Jackson takes us all 'There and back again'. Knowing how he chooses to tie everything with a bow (think 'Return of the King'), I think we're all in for a spectacular finish.Note: Freeman acts by never allowing us to acknowledge that there's an actor under all that hobbit makeup, and that's no mean feat. Here's lookin' fwd to more from dear Watson......",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very nice!,"First, before I go with the review I want to say that just before I entered the movie theater I met Oscar winning director Danis Tanovic.

"A cartoonish, overwrought mess of a film","Before getting into the meat and bones of what I have to say about The Hobbit part 2 I'd like to point out that I'd be giving the film a 3/10 and be happy to leave it at that if it weren't for the extremely inappropriate use of 3D. It added no depth to any scene that could not have been accomplished with proper lighting and cinematography, it only served to distract and obfuscate as soon as anything moved across the screen. This pointless gimmick only ruins the experience.Now onto the actual film, saying it's no good is putting it lightly. The screenplay is an incoherent garbled mess that makes a mockery of the source work. Scene after scene we get to see characters we love and hold dear behaving inconsistently, hamming it up with lines that make you shake your head and wonder whoever thought it was a good idea to introduce a triangle drama for no discernible reason, among many major complaints. It's downright disrespectful how badly written this tripe is.And of course there's a whole bunch of completely unnecessary and needlessly drawn out action sequences shoehorned into the movie for no other purpose than filler. Legolas' nonsense athletic feats challenge the suspension of disbelief so frequently and so egregiously that eventually you just throw up your arms in the air and give up.What purpose is there to an action scene where you don't care for any of the characters? What tension is there when the bad guys are so ridiculously outmatched?All this added action just ends up ruining the pacing because now you've got too many subplots going than you can reasonably allot time for.Even the audio is noticeably bad. The music from the LotR films will stay with me forever, the music playing over the end credits here just made me leave the theatre in haste.Well, at least Smaug was great, and we get a noticeably improved Bilbo this time around.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
PJ has perfected the desolation of smaug and hopefully will carry on with  There and Back again,"With all due respect to those who are criticizing the movie and calling it a lame effort by peter jackson by missing this and that....they all should consider one big fact that reading a good book again and again, feeling and imagining every single line of it in your warm bed or sofa is something else and making a movie way beyond the imagination with running and talking and fighting characters in mountains, rivers or lakes is surely a very different and hard thing to do.I love to read books and books have got a vital role in building our philosophical and intellectual as well as imaginative ability. But if someone takes this challenge to make a very good movie based on a book then he is surely doing nothing but an impossible thing and peter jackson has done something very close to this impossible thing. Millions of people who didn't even know about respected J R R Tolkien and his written work now know about him and there will be many who will find themselves fascinated to read his books.I personally have found DOS a lot better and improved than first one and if there is any single area where we can take that one score away from 10 is the background music, it has not been as good as lord of the ring and can be rated as good but not very good. I surely can wait for the 3rd and final part as i got one more good movie to watch again and again till next December. good luck to peter jackson and i hope we gonna watch some as amazing as DOS",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
MY REVIEW: The Charm of Smaug!!,"Peter Jackson never fails to impress. He amazed us with immortal LOTR trilogy and my personal favorite the grand remake of Kingkong. With Hobbit 1, he set the stage for a thrilling adventure and with Hobbit 2 he has raised the bar again by his lucid imagination and magical touches. Like Hobbit 1, Hobbit 2 is also a long tiring journey often testing your patience but your patience is awarded big time when the terrifying fire breathing gigantic dragon Smaug appears on screen and you are glued to the 3D screen like a kid. His interactions with charming Bilbo are delicious. Out of the dwarfs Bombur makes you laugh without a single dialog. Other actors also fit to their relevant roles. But the movie belongs to the Peter Jackson and his technical team for setting up the terrific set pieces like grand water chase, flawless 3D experience and taking you to the world of magic and courage. Purposefully, at least four sequences are being kept open at the end so that you start counting the days for Hobbit finale to appear on big screen.

Golden Dragon ... The new name,"I don't want to say "" The best"" but it was near to say that. The action and the people at the movie almost good. I thought as a second part of this movie to be more attracting and more powerful. Really when I watched this movie with my wife was was not able to go to bathroom or leave our sofa. Attraction only...... like a magneto but.... we expected more of this type of movies... Why I say that??? Lets begin at the forest where all spiders hunting the hobbits. It was slow action and any small kid can watch without attraction. I thought this to be more fear and frighten especially as the forest is too much maze!!! Anther thing I loved the way the spider become to net the body. Other note I have for the people named as JIN. As we know the JIN is too much powerful creature than humans,, why they already shown as weak?? And how the master of them was not able to detect the invisible person??? The best action of this movie was at two place only (in my opinion) 1- the river action when the fat hobbit was jumping from one point to the other and still fighting at the same. 2- the flying of the golden dragon. The movie was not concentrating about the dark power (the devil eye).. I hope the next part do that... at the end I say it was nice movie and I give these point to it: Music 22/25 --- Visual Effects 25/25 --- Story 20/25 (as it a continue to lord of the rings) -- entertaining 25/25 --- so the total is 92/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Also, I have to say that Bilbo's character is played perfectly, along with the rising inner conflict he has with the One Ring.

Worth seeing but only once,"This movie is just alright. It is most definitely a step up in action from the first hobbit movie but at the cost of character development.

I would recommend all Hobbit fans to at least see this movie once. But unlike the Lord of the Rings movies which I have seen countless times I will only watch this movie at most twice.

"A different kind of ""desolation"" happened here.","The first three Lord of the Rings movies were excellent. Gorgeous scenery, solid acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a decent script true to the books. The trilogy really brought Tolkien's world to life.Then we had The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in 2012.

This was a mistake, and many parts of the movie suffered from these artistic liberties brought it. There was potential though, so I hoped the next film would do more. Unfortunately, it didn't do anything good.Desolation of Smaug continues what An Unexpected Journey began, sinking a fantastic series of movies even deeper into pathetic mire of misery that will make most Tolkien fans wince. This film is just terrible and 80% or more of it can be skipped over with no real loss.Suspension of disbelief is out the window. Some scenes are BREATHTAKINGLY awful. I can't even begin to describe how utterly ridiculous and campy they are. Particularly the barrel-riding sequence. Desolation of Smaug devolves into something so unbearable, calling it ""typical Hollywood"" would be a compliment. It's trite. Banal. Hackneyed. Clichéd.

An Incredible Evocation of the World of Middle Earth.,"""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013), directed by Peter Jackson, is the middle film of the three part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkein's novel ""The Hobbit"", first published in 1937. Surprisingly, it manages to avoid most problems associated with a second film of three, such as a sense of redundancy, maintaining interest throughout and actually surpassing ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (2012), the first part in the series. The prolonged introductions and establishment of the major plot line of the first film, while embraced by some, where criticised by others. Here, with the clarity of a straightforward aim for the multiple characters, there is a new sense of direction and lucidity in Jackson's storytelling. Jackson's aided by the script written by himself, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro.While the acting throughout is never less than fine, and Martin Freeman continues to impress as Bilbo, the true star is Middle Earth, a world that Jackson has managed to transform into a living, breathing environment that thanks to the wonders of modern special effects, never looks less than real. From the dark Mirkwood forest to the seemingly 15th century Northern European inspired architecture of Lake-town, this is an incredibly rich and diverse setting for any tale that like all the great fantasy films, transports you into another world, another time, helped in part by the high frame rate 3D. The production design, by Dan Hennah, and the costume design, by Bob Buck, Ann Maskrey and Richard Taylor, is extraordinary in realising and texturing Jackson's world (which is filmed on location in New Zealand).The screenplay however, isn't quite as perfect as one would wish, superior though it is to the first film, continuing the introduction of elements not present in the novel. A divisive move that does tend to reinforce more conventional action elements along with an underplayed romantic triangle concerning Orlando Bloom (reprising his role as Legolas from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy [2001 – 2003]), Evangeline Lily (as the Wood Elf Tauriel) and Aidan Turner (as Kili the dwarf). This perhaps reveals a lack of confidence in the source material stretching across three films.These doubts don't dispel Jackson's major directorial achievement on display here and it is his grasp of Middle Earth, taking it from J.R.R. Tolkein's imagination to the silver screen that leaves this one of the best films of 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great transition from the first film....,"Bilbo Baggins and the company of dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield must continue on their quest towards Erebor, the mountain home of Smaug. Their mission is to retake the Kingdom Under the Mountain, the true home of the dwarfs, from Smaug. This terrifying dragon has made the mountain his home since he defeated the dwarfs many years before. Along the way they are forced to contend with a band of elves unwilling to aid them. Bilbo is able to prove his worth as they continue towards the mountain and their goal.The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 4The continuation of the story started with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an enjoyable film. Once again director Peter Jackson (The Lovely Bones) proves his ability to stay true to the subject material. Jackson wrote the wonderful screenplay for this movie alongside Fran Walsh (King Kong), Philippa Boyens (The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King), and Guillermo del Toro (Cronos). The cast is also great, bringing back all of the familiar faces from the first film in the trilogy. This includes Ian McKellan (Gods and Monsters), Martin Freeman (The World's End), Richard Armitage (Captain America: The First Avenger), Orlando Bloom (Black Hawk Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hurt Locker), Cate Blanchett (Babel), and Benedict Cumberbatch (War Horse).The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 1This is a visual splendor, much like the first film. The movie does a wonderful job of remaining true to the vision of Middle Earth created in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The visuals are impressive, not only from the landscapes and settings, but also the characters created for the film. Smaug is perhaps the most impressive dragon I've ever seen in a film. The many creatures and other characters also created are wonderful as well. Adding in great set designs and camera work, this is an awesome technical display. Overall, this will not disappoint anyone hoping for an impressive beautiful movie.The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 2The acting in this film is equally impressive. Taking into account the difficulties involved with the green screens and all of the other technical challenges, the actors did an awesome job. Ian McKellan is as wonderful as always, making Gandalf a complicated and compassionate person. Martin Freeman is equally impressive in a role that is required to evolve throughout the story. The rest of the cast does an impressive job in their roles, bring together a myriad of characters that bring Middle Earth to life.The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 3The story for this part of the series must have been incredibly challenging. How do you decide where to end a film when you have another movie in the works to complete the story. I'm glad that it wasn't a decision I was forced to make. Thankfully, Jackson and the team of writers made an excellent choice on how to script this one. Unlike the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, this is not just a placeholder in need of an end. Unfortunately there are a number of loose ends throughout the movie. This was bound to happen due to the multiple story lines and the number of new characters introduced at this point in the film. This doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable, but it will leave you wanting a little more.The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 8This is a wonderful movie that takes The Hobbit and brings it to life much like I imagined it as a kid. If you're a fan of the books of Tolkien, or The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is one for you. I would definitely suggest seeing the first film before diving into this one. I would also recommend this for fans of action-adventure films. I give this one 4.7 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Smaug the glorious !,"I enjoyed this movie, very much ! I will be honest I am really effected by other peoples reviews and Desolation sadly had a mix bag. But mate were they wrong. The time flew past and I didn't notice it at all. The acting was superb, action was good and Smaug was glorious !Martin Freeman was a superb choice for the role of Bilbo !Although not in the book I also really enjoyed the addition of Legolas !Desolation of Smaug is better then its predecessor, with better action and for being darker too. However I can't underline enough that it is not LOTR, if you want to enjoy this movie you should come to terms with that! its different it is its own thing and that's OK.Now if you like middle earth go and see the movie ! I'm glad I did and I watched it in HFR 3D it still feels a bit odd but my eyes thanked me for it. My eyes normally feel really tired by 3d but it wasn't so this time around.

Great and interesting movie.....,"Superb movie.. awesome visuals, worth the money..! Go for it. I'm waiting for the continuation.. the next blockbuster of 2014!Bilbo Baggins as he journeys with the Wizard Gandalf and thirteen Dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield on an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor. The movie went very interesting and thrilling with excitement. The sound effects where really good. well, the dragon got escaped and the dark force rises in this movie. The wizard got locked by the dark master. overall the plot was good. I'm a great fan of this story and i was waiting for this movie over a year, but my expectations was full filled. A big movie with fantasy, mystery, and entertaining throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A mixed bag,"The second Hobbit movie is sort of the Back to the Future II of its series: at times thrilling, at times confusing, and ultimately a little unsatisfying. It boasts terrific effects and choreography but perhaps a little too much plot, too many new characters, and a lengthy running time.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug picks up more or less where the first film left off; the dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins, and Gandalf have left the Misty Mountains and continue their quest to the Lonely Mountain, former dominion of the Dwarf race, aiming to recapture it and the treasure below it from the demonic dragon Smaug. (Interestingly, Smaug himself doesn't even make an appearance on screen until the final half hour of the film.) The outfit is led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), descendant of the last King beneath the Mountain, before Smaug took over; the other dwarfs are more-or-less interchangeable, much like those who accompanied Snow White in her adventures. Their names are, I think, Palin, Marty Balin, Gerald McBoingBoing, Doink, Coin, and Gilligan. I'm not sure.Now, the movie's title implies that Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) is desolate - he sort of is, living beneath the Lonely Mountain and all - but since this is more about the journey than the destination, we are treated to concurrent plots and unexpected encounters. The troupe loses Gandalf when the latter rushes off to deliver one of his legendary Important Messages, so he's absent for much of the film, and within some time the gang finds itself within the forests of Mirkwood, which is inhabited by Elves who aren't really like the stern-but-nice ones at Rivendell. (You know, from the last film.)And these Elves are a heck of a lot more suspicious of, well, everything. They're led by Thranduil (Lee Pace), who wishes to keep his realm closed off from the problems of the outside world, much like Elrond would for Rivendell in the later LOTR films. Thranduil's son is Legolas (Orlando Bloom), whom we're well acquainted with; he's smitten with the chief of the wood-elf guards, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) - but, like Shakespeare's star-cross'd lovers, Papa would never let the sylvan elf be with his offspring. You know how it is.But lest you think this is all about the Elves and Dwarfs and how they dislike/despise each other, there's another fun thread to follow: it looks like a certain Evil is gathering strength, both in body and in numbers, although remaining hidden from view. Thus the Orcs are both tracking Thorin and his merry men and helping their Master - you know who I mean - to become more corporeal. And then, to riff on an old 1970s TV show, there's Smaug. So there's truly no shortage of Bad Guys, and nor is there a shortage of ominous foreshadowing.The movie never drags, and it makes good (judicious) use of 3D, but it suffers from a real lack of personality. Bilbo and Gandalf, who have the most charisma and charm of the bunch, are given less to do here than in the first film; the Dwarvish leader Thorin, by contrast, isn't a sufficiently interesting character to hold extended attention. In addition, you have all of these Dwarfs whose names aren't entirely memorable, so when one is left behind all one can do is shrug and wonder who else is left.Which brings us to the the truly positive aspects of the movie. The fight and action scenes are supremely entertaining to watch, with Elf versus Orc, Elf versus Dwarf, Dwarf versus Orc, Dwarf versus Human, Wizard versus Orc, Wizard versus Something Evil, and Dragon versus Hobbit and Dwarfs. The intensity of each of these scenes is almost poetic, with Lilly and Bloom miles beyond everyone else in their seemingly effortless Orc-slaying abilities. Lilly in particular is remarkable, both beautiful, humanistic, and cunning beyond her years; her Tauriel (oddly enough, not really a Tolkien character) is savvy, level headed, and soft hearted.The final scene, more than two and a half hours into the film, is a bit of a letdown, a mere gateway to the final part of the trilogy. It's true that the first Hobbit film took the same tack, but this time out the denouement feels abrupt; we left not just wanting more but simply hanging.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Much, Much Better (it didn't drag-on)","When Bilbo Baggins suddenly loses his ring... The Ring... during a scene where hungry spiders have captured his dwarf friends, there's the kind of desperate edge needed for a last minute rescue and some truly exciting swordplay (later on, a few more small but important things are lost and found in a similar fashion)...Eventually, two characters not in J. R. R. Tolkien's source novel join in: although one is an important part of THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Tolkien purists have already frowned at the decision to include Legolas, but he's a decent addition as is (surprisingly) Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, the subliminal love-interest who also has eyes for vulnerable dwarf Kili...But we'll leave the sporadic kitsch aside. One of the best scenes in the movie is a standout in the novel: Our little heroes escaping from their Elf captors in river-riding barrels...Director Peter Jackson ups the action-ante from AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, a bloated/brooding mess that never quite knew where it was going...Thankfully, DESOLATION OF SMAUG provides the much more intriguing, fleshed-out characters an ironclad destination so the action really matters... That being the place where Smaug the Dragon hoards tons of gold, once belonging to dwarves and taken very seriously by the pivotal Thorin Oakenshield (although Ken Stott's wise Balin steals the show).Here's where Peter Jackson brings us into a truly formidable, nightmarish region, visually exceeding even the plush, gorgeous exterior of Middle Earth, whether computer-generated or actual footage of the director's New Zealand playground.Meanwhile, a subplot where Gandalf investigates an Orc castle, tying things into the RINGS trilogy, adds peripheral suspense, but there's enough excitement in rousting the sneaky dragon into a vengeful frenzy to merit a satisfying finale, making up for the sudden ending that will most likely conjure audience groans:And yet it sure beats the three-hour groaning many of us suffered the first time around.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Peter Jackson team, triumphantly wielding the Ring of commercial success, miss their footing and plunge headlong into the fiery depths of Mount Doom artistic fraud.","One of the central themes of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is the manner in which different personalities are affected by the corrupting effects of wealth and power. Some, like Bilbo, are completely able to retain their integrity. At the end of Tolkien's novel he accepts only a small parcel of treasure for his part in the quest, such as one pony can carry. When he finds the Arkenstone he does not claim it for himself but bestows it in a manner that he deems morally fit. Thorin Oakenshield has a fatal attraction to the dragon's hoard of gold, but on his deathbed is able to retrace and find himself again. Smaug the dragon is hugely greedy, use his great powers aggressively, and is undone by his vanity (believing himself invulnerable).It's quite clear, and ironic, that the makers of this trilogy were similarly blinded by the lure of gold.Tolkien's novel is a literary classic, written in beautiful prose, and illustrated by himself. His special gift was to depict a magical world where characters are nevertheless wholly believable and realistic, and their actions faultlessly motivated. My question to the filmmakers is: why change anything? Why was it necessary to change the story in so many, many, many ways? And whence the presumption that they are entitled to do this? Overweening arrogance ... And embarrassing, actually.The makers evidently felt they needed to pad out the original, but in the process they have lost so much. I'm still waiting for a definitive version. I imagine something animated, and faithful to Tolkien's original illustrations.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great interpretation of the beloved book,"Having read the book several times by myself and to my children, I had my own set of expectations of course and was especially hoping to find certain scenes in the movie.The fear of finding a movie which ruined the story wasn't there, because I trust these film makers.The movie was even better than I expected. Yes, some scenes I hoped for weren't in it, one of my favourite ones from the book included and there were new additions, but it was all done in taste and it didn't hurt the story the way the movies are telling it. And we should consider this movie more of a prequel to LOTR movies instead of just a screen adaptation of the book alone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"An Improvement on the First Hobbit with much more Action,","The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline that is beautifully directed by Peter Jackson with a brilliant cast.I really enjoyed the first Hobbit, but I think this movie improves immensely,there weren't any scenes that I felt went on much longer than they needed too and there was much more intense scenes and action packed moments, it definitely gets much closer to the standards of The Lord of the Rings.I think the cast also improves, Martin Freeman does an outstanding performance as Bilbo Baggins, I think since on this we see a darker side to Bilbo because of his possession of the Ring and because of that we got to see just how great an actor Martin Freeman really is.Benedict. Cumberbatch is absolutely brilliant as the voice and motion capture of Smaug ,his voice is frightening and certainly the highlight of the whole movie.If your a fan of the first Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings franchise in general then you will not be disappointed by the Desolation of Smaug.As Bilbo (Martin Freeman) becomes more sand more insane with his possession of the Ring,himself,Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs continue their quest as they come across more danger.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It took a deep breath and then blew me away,"The Beorn scene: I see it as taking a deep breath. Insecure one, for sure, but deep enough to blow me away after wards. In that scene I kind of had a felling that Jackson intention was to ""correct the mistake"" from the previous one, on which critics had pointed out. He rushed into really serious tone, being ""afraid"" that he will be criticized for silly humor again. I think, that the Beorn scene, in the book, belongs to that silly and childish part of the story, and then, slowly, gets serious. Maybe then Tolkien realized he could write a story for everyone. But, thanks to that deep breath, nevertheless Beorns segment was left out of the competition, the movie accomplishes to rise in speed of light to a level of a real spectacle. Using the ""further reading"" and his imagination, Jackson finally succeeds to place this trilogy very close to his old one, on the scale of epic adaptations of Tolkiens Middle-earth. Luke Evans in the role of Bard proved to be an excellent compensation of Beorns ""shortcomings"", and Orlando Bloom finally passed the exam. Evangeline Lilly took his title from LOTR trilogy, being the weakest link in the cast. This sequel cleverly and seriously maintains tension and brings new breathtaking scenes, it also leaves plenty of space for third to catch the momentum. I wouldn't recommend it to the youngest, unlike its predecessor, because it has completely lost children's atmosphere, as the book itself was developing in that manner, so that's commendable. Scenes with Smaug represent homework for any film maker out there. Highest level of cinematography. Brilliant!9.7 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dragons should be seen and not heard....,"Like its predecessor, this second Hobbitt film is visually stunning,tells a good tale, but is so protracted that the enchantment inevitably becomes tedium. The original LOTR trilogy was handled much better, in that the theatrical releases were mercifully edited of at least half an hour each of running time, with the protracted lengthier versions released as extended cut for those who just can't get enough and have to beat a good thing to death. Both of these films would be improved by that method, being shorn of at least a half hour each of unnecessary footage. And it could well begin with cutting much of the dragon dialog...there isn't much point in threatening to burn all the little buggers into oblivion if you're going to talk them to death first! What nonsense! All we should hear from the dragon is the pounding of his heavy footfalls and the beating of his leathery wings or scorching breath. I rather liked the character of Tauriel and the budding attraction to the dwarf she healed. Also Richard Armitage became more important, who was so wasted in Hobbit 1.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Jackson's Return to Form,"It took Peter Jackson two films to finally get back to the Middle-Earth we know and love. Let's just be grateful he did. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug silences all contenders as this season's rollicking, enormous spectacle, one which must be seen in the intended 3-D to appreciate in its fullness.And about that 3-D. Oh, what glorious stuff it is. Better than perhaps any film this year (save Alfonso Cuaron's groundbreaking Gravity), Smaug uses its 3-D to enhance the story rather than simply embellish it. Even if you tend not to plunk down an extra few bucks for the surcharge, you'll be glad you shelled out for this one. More about the technical specs later, though. Let's talk story.For those who have seen the first entry into the Hobbit trilogy, An Unexpected Journey, you know the story: a rather reclusive hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (played with wonderful quirks by Martin Freeman) is practically forced into a dangerous mission by his friend, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan). The mission involves traveling with a group of a dozen dwarfs, led by the hot-tempered man who would be king, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), to reclaim their homeland under the faraway Lonely Mountain, a kingdom ruled now by the destructive dragon Smaug. Bilbo's task is to sneak into the dragon's layer to retrieve a precious stone, the wielder of which holds the right to reign under the mountain.Running concurrently with the journey to the mountain is a subplot involving a disembodied evil force which has taken refuge in a very scary CGI ghost town. It seems this force is a Necromancer, threatening to come to life and conjure a dark army for himself.An Unexpected Journey ended with the Lonely Mountain in sight for our heroes, and the second leg of their journey proves to be the more exciting adventure thus far. The first film was a disappointment for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the faithfulness to the book's tone. The Hobbit is lighter fare than The Lord of the Rings, with happier songs and a bit more comedy. It works well on the page, but the film suffered for it. With Smaug, Jackson returns to the darker, more somber tone of the Rings films. He also proves that he is still a master of pacing: the numerous action sequences are at turns terrifying and comical, but always entertaining and hardly ever superfluous.Being less faithful to the source material may get one into hot water with Tolkien purists, and I imagine that the addition of a newly- invented character will incur the ire of many. Tauriel (Evangeline Lily), a female warrior elf, serves basically as the object of both dwarf Kili's (Aidan Turner) and elf prince Legolas' (Orlando Bloom) affections. Nonetheless, the addition adds another layer to the story and gives Legolas' father, King Thranduil, plenty of opportunities to inform Tauriel she is beneath is son. As Thranduil, Lee Pace provides a performance so campy and outrageous it would make Tim Curry proud, but for some reason, it works.With Smaug, everything works. The acting and direction are still top- notch, but the scripting has finally caught up to them. All the teasing of the first film pays off when we finally get a glimpse of the terrible dragon Smaug in all his glory, and it is truly a thing to behold. Not since Jurassic Park has a reptilian creature been so downright awe- inspiring, and with a voice by Benedict Cumberbatch ( in full ""Khan"" mode), Smaug should rival Gollum as a fan-favorite.There is so much to say about The Desolation of Smaug. The new characters, locations, and plot revelations are handled exceptionally well by Jackson. The score, again by the brilliant Howard Shore, is back to par with the Rings films (try listening to the Lake Town theme and not be impressed). The 161-minute run time flies by, and leaves us on a cliffhanger almost as fulfilling as that of The Two Towers. In short, The Desolation of Smaug is simply one of the best times you will have at the Cineplex all year. It is smart entertainment, and great popcorn fare is hard to come by these days.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
NOT Jackson We had Known !,"Note : Ignore My Rating.To be Honest, this is not Petter Jackson we had known in The Lord of The Rings trilogy.

I'm sure everyone misses that Jackson.That Peter Jackson who made Legolas walk on snow while other members of the fellowship was walking through the snow. Yes, it's true because we get to know that elves are light. Also when Aragon was with the hobbits in the forest you can see behind in the background three giant stone trolls. YES ! that is Peter Jackson, even though some may not realize this but these small things makes the difference between a great director and a normal director.Second thing, if you think that An Unexpected Journey is some how far from the book, what about The Desolation of Smaug.

Watch me use technology with one hand tied behind my back to part people from their money by putting together an interminably long movie! The acting was robotic, probably due to the really poor script. The script was possibly written by a 12 year old, so maybe I shouldn't be so critical.The entire feel was of something cobbled together out of separate pieces, resulting in a creature much like Frankenstein. A film not quite right, it has all the trappings of a much loved classic like LOTR or Star Wars. It falls far short. By the final scene, it stinks like a rotten cantaloupe, ripe for 20 minutes, quick to decay.The action was simply idiotic in some places - going way too far into the fantastic.The entire thing went downhill fast after Gandalf's Wizard Bomb in the fight against the Goblin King.The amazing feats created for battle scenes of LOTR have morphed into super speed Cirque De Soleil - not at all thrilling, just boring.The costumes were excellent.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent and surprising addition to the Hobbit Trilogy,"I am not going to delve into a full review of this movie, but let me tell you it is excellent. I am an avid Tolkein fan, and yes it is true there there are changes abroad to his works in this film, but it is so well done that I do not mind. What people need to do is stop comparing The Hobbit movies to the LOTR movies. The books have a different tone from each other so why shouldn't the movies. Jackson does make strides on the DoS to make the movie match the Epic feel of the LOTR but there is no possible way to match that and I think Jackson knows this. The problem is that many of the fans do not.

I thought I'd hate the Tauriel thing but as far as subplots go it was enjoyable. Legolas looks a lot older which is a little jarring. The orc subplot was handled a lot better than in the first movie too, didn't seem quite as shoehorned.I think Peter Jackson really wants to direct movies like Spartacus or The 10 Commandments, big war movies with thousands of people wearing sandals.

Better than the first chapter,"Coming to cinema two months later in Mainland China, the second chapter of THE HOBBIT TRILOGY is poised to prevail the box office in a rather lethargic period after the red-hot Chinese Spring Fe festival.THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012, 6/10) is a relentless roller-coaster ride with a slew of visual stunts to propel a succinct plot, which doesn't live up to the expectation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS' Middle Earth triumphant standing, also Peter Jackson's innovative shooting technology has received with some resistance and negative feedbacks. The second round, a 3D version is all we have in China, the palette is light-toned, the textual sharpness hasn't been refined from the first one, a tad dim and the same landscape doesn't register the same rapt effect anymore.Nevertheless, the film is an ameliorated update from AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, not simply because of Smaug's imposing grandeur and droll garrulousness (voiced by a malignantly intoning Cumberbatch). The plain narration bifurcates from the early start, when Gandalf (McKellen) detaches from the rest of the expedition on a solitary quest, as it often pans out, the journey without the omnipotent grey wizard galvanizes more excitement and comic relief. The action set pieces are imbued with sufficient antics in the barrel cruise, the comeback of Legolas (Bloom) and a freshly coined female elf Tauriel (Lilly) reinforces audience's modern aesthetic as a welcoming love triangle among the two and a handsome (and slightly taller-than-average) dwarf Kili (Turner) is a clever deployment to gratify a touch of romanticism and conforms with the topical love equity enthusiasm. The pulchritude of slaughtering orcs with dexterous archery can never stultify the viewers.When Bilbo (Freeman) lurches into Smaug's turf to exert his burglar role, it prompts the zenith with the disparate duel between the dwarf pack and the indomitable fire-generator, it is also worth mentioning the dissonant atmosphere between Bilbo and Thorin (Armitage), is the hobbit only an expedient pawn for Thorin's stout-hearted vengeance to reclaim his kingdom, or the boundary of species can be breached through Bilbo's valorous altruism? Let's wait and see what will happen in the final venture.This time, one might be able to distinguish the 13 dwarfs more easily besides Thorin, Balin (Stott), Kili and Fili (O'Gorman), Freeman is consistently indulged in his invisible vantage with the ring, while McKellen's Gandalf has some perilous path to overcome. The film is properly enlightened by several new characters, apart from Tauriel's apropos feminine touch, Bard (Evans) is the key character introduced here, and for certain his import in the finale is well hinted although we haven't seen too much potential in him yet. And it is always a delight to watch Stephen Fry, sketchily appears as the Master of Laketown, quips with his insidious underling Alfrid (Gage).As a middle section of a trilogy, this film actually skirts the conundrum of being left in the epic and enmeshed background without a certain closure to end the film itself, it is both satisfied to see to a not out-and-out victory and intrigued to imagine what will happen when the dragon is released to a more spacious scale, all magnetizes its core audience to return for a third time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The journey continues.,"The Hobbit trilogy was never meant to substitute the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It is more of a nostalgic journey to the Middle Earth meant to relive again with newer and older characters. And I, being a huge fan of Middle Earth, never had any qualms about Peter Jackson making three long movies out of a single book that does not run beyond mere four hundred pages. As long as Peter Jackson does what he does best, nobody in the right mind can deny the privilege of going on another journey. The first Hobbit had issues. Mostly because it was preceded by the stupendous Lord Of The Rings trilogy and slightly because it had its issues! Anyway, cheers for the fans because Desolation of Smaug is definitely an improvement over the first. The movie really feels like an adventure, unlike the first one. From what I have read that Peter Jackson had taken liberties and added new story elements that were not in the book, I would say that he did all right. Peter Jackson once again pulls of a beautiful Middle Earth that is as breathtakingly colorful and lively as it is dark and dangerous. And in this world, he orchestrates some of the biggest set pieces adventure that is filled with wit, humor, resourcefulness and courage. There is so much to learn for Michael Bay from Peter Jackson's Middle Earth movies. The set pieces are not just meant to crumble and explode, but they are meant to serve a purpose as a prop to accentuate the action. Something that Peter Jackson does so deftly. And add to that, Peter Jackson's elegant dance in the chaos, you get some breathtaking and totally enjoyable moments in the movie. There is some sort of cartoonish feel to these action sequences, but they in no way undermine the adventure that The Hobbit: Desolation Of Smaug is. This time the story is better, though it is still paper thin. And there are newer characters. Legolas is there. Sauron too makes an entry. And then there is Tauriel. *sigh* Is there anything more sexy and more beautiful than a lady kicking a**es? No, my dear friend, there isn't. Then there is that 'gregarious' ostentatious evil dragon, Smaug. The character developments are restricted to fewer characters, notably Thorin. The rest of the characters seem to be walking the tight rope of wooden characterizations. Bilbo is brave and stuff, but the character development is too linear. But, all in all, the story is much better, swiftly paced with fewer patches of stagnancy. The Hobbit: Desolation Of Smaug is definitely an improvement over its predecessor as the word adventure find its literal meaning into the story. Go, soak yourselves in the adventure 'barrel style, because it is worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson should change the name of the trilogy,I feel bad that Peter Jackson is using JRR Tolkien's name to Market his movies. If He has some respect for the legend he should change the name of this trilogy. This movie is all about selling tickets. No respect for the original work. Let me point some of the outrageous things: 1.Beorn- a wise and fierce protector pictured as mindless beast 2. She Elf - that is a laughable plot. 3. Love triangle - Silly dramatic sequence. 4. Journey through mirkwood - main attraction of novel left out untold. 5. Elf King was pictured as evil who originally was kind and wise in the novel. These are few of the hundred points that I can write here. For me this movie was a kick in the guts.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I found it great...,"This is the greatest movie I've seen in months. Great story, great graphics and, generally, I got what I paid for(more Middle-Earth and Dragon scenes). There are random film snobs that will tell you that the movie ""sucks"" while the book is ""great"". The truth is that it's the other way round. Peter Jackson accomplished making a really dark and interesting movie from a children's book. The story in the movie is much greater and more epic than in the book. And it's not the first time P.J. does that: remember the amazing fight between Gollum and Frodo ending with the destruction of the ring? You know what happened in the book? Gollum took the ring and amazed by it, it stumbled and FELL!!! I know that many grannies would prefer a movie with them sitting on a couch and reading the book for hours, but changes in the book do happen, much or little, and for a good reason. Accept that the story is better and move on with your life. Also, there are some sons of orks that will tell you that there is not ""character development""... What? Are you serious? We learn SO MUCH for characters that in the book we only know their name. Evil orcs, kind or fallen elves, people with families, corrupted people, dark-side of Thorin and so on, but I tried to omit the names to avoid spoilers... So, go see the movie, it's great, and don't listen to what others tell, trust only yourselves. You'll enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Another Epic Chapter of LOTR,"Haters gonna hate! I am big LOTR fan having red most of the books and still sometimes checking wiki- related pages to refresh the knowledge I have about the Tolkien's fantasy world, I am still amazed by Peter Jackson's interpretation in these books. He clearly demonstrates that he undestands the dynamics of the book and adapts the story to cinema in a better way to enhance audience's experience. I totally advocate Peter Jackson's way of adapting the books to the cinema world. Although Tolkien's world is amazing, movies (even adaptations) are not supposed to follow the books precisely. You should leave some of the content to the director's interpretation and imagination. I loved all the characters and acting in the second movie and it has already become one of my favorite movies of all time. It was great to see Gandalf casting spells, Legolas bouncing around as a great warrior, dwarfs fighting in harmony, and the magnificence of the dragon Smaug. I was thrilled to my bones while watching hoping that it will never finish. I just hope that the third movie will be even more epic and thrilling and I hope it will not be the end for Tolkien adaptations to Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better, Darker & Longer","After finding shelter with a shape-shifter named Beorn, Thorin and company must pass through the much feared Mirkwood Forest without Gandalf. Meanwhile, Bilbo begins to use The Ring to protect himself and help his new found friends.This second installment of The Hobbit starts off much stronger than the first. It's darker, the special effects are better and the story is actually interesting. The bright, cartoon-look is gone, for the most part, and the action sequences are perfectly composed.The first film, An Unexpected Journey, was stretched out 80 minutes too long and it's bright, 48fps high-definition made it obvious these great actors were on a sound-stage, surrounded by green-screen filled in with CGI. What it did was it delivered a great ending, promising a non-stop action thrill-ride of a sequel. However Peter Jackson and company went too far and too long, again. Too much attention is spent focusing in on side plots of possible romance and characters we are never given much reason to care for. The darker visuals help to keep the dramatic moments from becoming as cheesy as a made-for-TV sci-fi/fantasy movie but this time, the acting from the new supporting cast doesn't.The Desolation Of Smaug will be as good as we're going to get out of this Hobbit trilogy. It proves 2 films would have been more than enough for the film adaptation of the book. As for the ending, it's enough to make you want to throw things at the screen and boycott the third film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic film which captures the real essence of Tolkien's world!,"The Desolation of Smaug can be seen as a new high for both Peter Jackson and the Middle Earth Saga. From beginning to end this film entertains and immerses you into Tolkein's and Jackson's world. From the actors to jaw dropping environments that the band travel through this film is very well delivered. Having said this, there are times that the director's artistic design does leave you questioning the decision making, of which chief of these is the over use of CGI.The use of CGI in the film may be my only negative point from the new Hobbit films. Unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, almost every aspect of film has been touched upon by the rendering teams. This is most obvious during the numerous fight scenes where over emphasised movements are replaced by a CGI model. I feel that this will not only cause the films to age quickly but it throws the audience out from their immersed state as they recognise the unnatural movements and graphics of characters.Despite this, Jackson has hit a near perfect note. The second part seems to be more mature and refined that the first in almost every way. For example, the 3D never took away from the overall production like it did at times for the first.For many people, they will be drawn to this from the book. Of which I must defend the director rather than the hardcore Middle Earth enthusiasts. There are 'new' parts to the film which Jackson has added himself that the book does not cover. As we know, legolas' return was a surprise to many, but in no way does it take away from the overall feel. Jackson has done a very good job to build upon the short remarks and comments that Tolkien only mentions in passing and this not only adds to the film but arguably the story of the Hobbit.Overall, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is bounds ahead of its predecessor in terms of design and production. The added story lines only adds to the narrative and the cinematography is consistent with our expectations of a Peter Jackson production. Whilst disappointed with the over indulgence in computer graphics I would still highly recommend this film in either mode, although the 3D does have some truly spectacular moments which should not be missed. I give this a 8.5 - 9 as Jackson has excelled himself with his latest release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
: A Evil Arises in Middle Earth,"When we last left our compatriots, they were on their way to reclaim the Lonely Mountains from an evil fierce dragon – Smaug. Peter Jackson, the man who brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy, gave us another thrill seeking adventure that led us down to the lair of a dragon so fierce that hot molten metal could not contain it.But a greater evil arises – darkness has begun across Middle Earth and the quest for the ONE RING has begun. And the ultimate destroyer has yet to be seen as we hear in that famous quote:""One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.""Big props has to go to the duo villain of the story, Smaug & the Necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch), again you have proved your worth as the villain of the story.

Amazing film,I loved this movie. Being only a 10 year old boy I haven't seen too many films but this has to be my favourite of 2013 and probably of all time. Benedict Cumberbach I love and was absolutely amazing in this film. If you haven't seen anything with Benedict Cumberbach before then watch this and you will love him instantly. Although he is only a voice I still think he did a great job as Smaug. Benedict Cumberbach was my star actor in this movie. Runner up actor (actress) in this movie would have to be Evangeline Lily. My favourite and strongest character in this movie was Bard the Bowman. This character was played by Luke Evans. An excellent actor who has starred in a bunch of good movies. I love this character because he is so strong and determined. Overall: 9.5/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better sequel,"While the first one took it's sweet time getting to the story, this just jumps right into the action. But get ready for characters that aren't even in the book, like Legolas. And the motion capture for turning Benedict Cumberbatch into the dragon Smaug is amazing. Peter Jackson knows the right people to do motion capture, as we all know from watching Andy Serkis as Gollum all these years. But really?! 3 hours?! That's stretching it wouldn't you say? Almost as stretched as butter scraped over too much bread. I didn't see this one in 3D, which is a real shame, because it seems I would have benefited a lot from it. Smaug breathing fire towards the audience would have looked amazing in 3D. Then again, the 3D is HFR, so probably not.

"I've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too","Still very good, but I found 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' to be a step below the preceding 2012 release.The conclusion is what affects it the most, in my opinion. It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected.I also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter.I've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.Love the end credits song (""I See Fire"") by Ed Sheeran, by the way.

Becoming invisible and big flying eagles,"Maybe some of you out there who have read the books can explain this to me.In the first Hobbit movie, there's a scene where the company is cornered at the edge of a cliff, so Gandalf finds this butterfly and it flies away and next thing you know, a bunch of eagles come save the day. Not only that, they fly them even closer to their destination so they don't have to walk their helpless selves over dangerous terrain.All I could think of from thereon is: why not just take the eagle express to Erebor?? If there is some explanation in the book that might explain why the safest (or safer) and quicker option isn't taken, I'd like to hear it.Other thing is when Bilbo is up in the dragon's lair trying to get the white stone, why not just use the awesome invisible ring to walk away with it when he sees it? I mean, it's gotten his ass out of dire situations a whole bunch of times, and when he's now faced with a fire-breathing gigantic dragon, he first wakes the dragon, then uses the ring just to hide away, and then takes it off the rest of the time. Am I missing something or do some things just neglect logic in this story??",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Vamp of a Lifetime,"So the Money asked Peter Jackson if he could stretch The Hobbit out to three movies. And he did.I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies, because I accept the fact that they are not J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings movies, they are Peter Jackson's. So, these movies are Peter Jackson's. He has the right to rewrite whatever he wants. And he and his staff have done their homework, and taken liberally from others of Tolkien's writings, and extrapolated well on things Tolkien hinted at and never really portrayed.This second movie of the three has moments of magic and beauty. There were moments where I gasped and moments where I laughed in delight.There were more moments where I drummed my fingers in frustration and tedium. The tedium was in the frequent (of course) and interminable fight scenes. The tedium was in all the special effects, all the CG. Technologically wonderful, though no more wonderful than many other movies that have come out lately.Only one or two of the magic came from CG.The best moments of the movie came when Peter Jackson lets the whiz-bang out step back from center stage and let his fine actors do what they do- -act.Evangeline Lilly is wonderful as Tauriel. Tauriel is a non-royal sylvan elf who has caught the eye of King Thranduil's royal son Legolas (remember him?). She doesn't have the otherworldly beauty of Liv Tyler's Arwen from the previous series. She looks more this-worldly. But she is no less beautiful. In one extreme closeup, her famous freckles show, and she is stunning!Tauriel is as good a warrior as any male. She is also a strong minded woman who cares deeply. So deeply, in fact, that she is willing to break rules and orders. And Ms. Lilly plays her to perfection. Watch her face when she converses, watch her reactions. Wonderful!Worst of all is the near-total waste of the magically-talented Martin Freeman. Well have some more experienced and famed actors fumed with jealousy that Mr. Freeman can stand, wordless, and express three or four emotions silently with his common-as-mud Everyman's face. As I drove away from the theater, I whimsically said, ""It's a shame Martin Freeman had only four lines."" My daughter said, ""He had more than four lines!"" I said, ""Okay, six. Eight, tops.""He has more lines than that, and, brilliant movie actor that he is, lines actually can get in the way of his acting. But so can a heavy- handed director who loves computer generated effects than he does actors.Ultimately, the public enjoys spectacle and movie magic. But what we really want is good story-telling. Peter Jackson more or less tells one-third of the story of the novel The Hobbit. But he doesn't really do it all that well. Acceptably, but no more than acceptably.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A step in the right direction,"After seeing the first Hobbit I had no real interest in seeing anymore. But after a boring night and an offer of a £1.50 rent I thought I'd give the sequel a go, and to be honest I was pleasantly surprised. It's still a way of the depth and quality that the lord of rings offers but it's definitely a step in the right direction for the hobbit trilogy. There were aspects of the film I didn't quite get, for example the love interest between two of the characters seemed a bit out of place and irrelevant. There were also some more really long scenes of the dwarfs on roller coasters but I guess that was expected after the first film. What I did enjoy was the sub-plot of Gandalf and do Gilda. This was an area of the story I felt should've been given more screen time as it's a story that's not really covered by any of Tolkiens work so its left open for some embellishment and creativity. I felt it provided more depth and brought about a slightly darker feel from we had previously seen in the hobbit. All in all I did enjoy the film, but I am still disappointed that Peter Jackson and co went down the route of children's fantasy for the hobbit trilogy, leaving the more mature feel behind in lord of the rings; as I feel if the entirety of the two films were filmed to the standard of the Gollum or Mag scenes, we would've all been blown away. The characters are there, the story is there, the middle earth lore is there, but the execution isn't quite. Less CGI, more character development, less over the top far fetched deaths of orcs, more feasibility and maturity and this film would've been great. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What does one dragon need with all that gold?,"To paraphrase Matt Atchity, Editor in Chief of Rotten Tomatoes, this is the second part of the cynical cash grab adaptation of ""The Hobbit"", from director Peter Jackson, which continues where ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" left off, with Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs walking around. But having actual action and adventure in your action/adventure movie, goes a long way. Right off the bat, this installment is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor on the sole basis that this action/adventure doesn't take nearly two hours to get going.More improvements: There are tons more intimidating and grotesque looking villains that keep this story moving forward (the giant spiders stand as one of the scariest things I've seen on the big screen, all year) even though the plot consists of a highly repetitive formula, wherein they guys walk around, run into a group of hostile enemies (who all seem to be anit-dwarfist) get captured, have to hear a slathering of anti-dwarf propaganda, believe all is lost, miraculously escape, walk around some more, run into different hostile enemies, get recaptured and start the process all over again. But it was the actual battle sequences which really made me lean forward in my seat. From the extremely well choreographed river sequence, laced with superb comedic timing and the best camera-work since The Two Towers, to the 40 minute battle with a fire breathing dragon named Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) a dragon more impressive looking than anything in that new ""Godzilla"" trailer, it's good that Jackson finally realized the likelihood of people actually enjoying this series, is predicated on its entertainment value. Back to basics.One of my biggest complaints about my ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" movie going experience, was the 48 frames per second aspect. This was an argument against the film that many critics outright and irresponsibly disregarded; as if how the film looked has nothing to do with ones movie going experience. Anyway, according to a recent article in The Guardian, Peter Jackson admits to ""softening the high definition of this newest installment"" so as to make it more cinematic. And though ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is not quite 24fps, it is obviously a much better visual experience all around, thus enabling our eyes to simply focus on the masterful direction that Jackson brings to the table, instead of being distracted by a filming technique that repeatedly takes the viewer out of the cinematic world.Final Thought: The content is still really stretched out, the film is still a bit too long (maybe 30 minutes or so) and there is some exposition that I didn't quite understand, but didn't seem relevant to this installment. BUT, with a film where (going in) I knew it would be nearly three hours long, wouldn't have a ""real"" ending since there is still one more film to come and was the sequel to a film that nearly made my list of the ten worst movies of 2012, the fact that ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" was mostly a non-stop thrill ride and had more of a comedic edge than any of the last four Jackson hobbit driven productions, really doesn't leave me much to complain about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Sure, the book is OK, but I can do better, said Jackson","...he rewrote the story, and he failed miserably.All the substance and the beauty of the book, cut out, and replaced with mindless, fast moving action scenes, - which we could see in any silly Hollywood action movie. How sad.New characters, dialogs and plot twists are introduced constantly. Existing characters (those from the actual book) are bastardized and dumb down to the level, where there're hardly recognizable, and impossible to relate to.I couldn't wait for the movie to end, and left cinema disappointed, almost in disbelieve that what I saw, was actually The Hobbit.

Smaug the dragon guards the hall that is full of gold and jewels, the dwarfs and Bilbo venture to the lonely mountain which is the dwarf's home, which Smaug took by force many years ago. In the final scene of the movie, the dwarfs let Smaug escape, he flies over to Lake Town which is the city that helped them reach the mountain. He states ""My teeth are swords. My claws are spears. My wings are a HURRICANE! I am fire, I am death."" And you see Smaug head for Lake Town prepared to burn it. Bilbo dramatically closes the movie with ""What have we done.""

Spoiler,"SPOILER ALERT! It stinks.

Apparently following his lead, the worshipful geeks in the special effects shop have set the bar as low as it will go so as not to outshine the awful script.

"A beautifully rendered, immersive fantasy that still falls short of being a truly great movie.","I felt the same way about ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013) as I did about its predecessor — it's a beautifully rendered, immersive fantasy that still falls short of being a truly great movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.The special effects are downright beautiful. We've got a fantastic dragon to behold. The acting is roundly terrific too. I can only imagine it must be harder for a professional actor to portray a hobbit, dwarf, elf, or wizard, with their stylized language and fantastical quirks. Yet every member of the cast was either good or great. The obvious standouts are Sir Ian McKlellan as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Ken Stott as Balin was also quite good.Yet the monsters and action were sometimes so cartoonish that they really challenged an adult viewer's willing suspension of disbelief. The battle sequence involving the barrels, for example, seemed like something out of a Warner Brothers cartoon.I also noticed a couple of other things. This is my fifth of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies that I've watched, and I am beginning to understand the viewer contention that these film's story structures consist of a lot of ""walking and fighting.""The most interesting story element, for me, was Bilbo's use of The Ring as his secret weapon — all the while concealing its magic from his comrades and first gaining the psychic attention of Sauron. We also see hints that he may develop his own slavish devotion to The Ring, spookily suggested when he brutally attacks the giant spider assailants who might jeopardize his possession of it. The Ring's subplot (and the way it sets up ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) engaged me more than anything else. Throughout all the films, it's a fantastic story device, and well suited for a fantasy context. The Ring could be a metaphor for greed, love of power, possessive love, or even drug addiction. It adds so much depth to the Lord of the Rings universe, and goes far beyond a story of little good guys fighting big bad guys. To me, The Ring and Bilbo were far more entertaining than traveling dwarfs greeting or fighting characters throughout Middle Earth.There may have been pacing problems; this felt slow. I got the sense that too much time was spent establishing Lake-town and its (fairly boring) residents, although it was great seeing the immeasurably talented Stephen Fry's surprise turn as its ""Master."" Too much dialogue is devoted to things like arguing with elves, negotiating boat rides, and penetrating a magic door. (And I'm still not sure how the ""last light of  day"" translates into an Autumn moon.)This was a good movie, even for someone who isn't a fan of the source material. Given its length and its slower pacing, however, I may not feel the need to see the third film right away.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
HK Auteur Review - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"To start off, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan. I haven't read any of Tolkien's works and only have seen the Peter Jackson's film trilogy once. A friend invited me to a free screening of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug two days before its premiere, so I quickly caught up with the previous installment and read up on the film's production online to prepare for its sequel. So this is going to be a review of the first film too. Let's crack onMy biggest problem with An Unexpected Journey is it launched its story retrospectively from Lord of the Rings, starting with an older Bilbo Baggins telling the story to Frodo Baggins just before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring. The Hobbit is not a prequel, it was written first before Lord of the Rings. It's the true ""part one"" and yet it's being framed as if it was a prequel to a great trilogy. This effectively echoes throughout the two Hobbit films as I am constantly being reminded about what's to come. It's distracting and by association makes The Hobbit seem less important.Whether it's Peter Jackson's completist approach to expand the story or a corporate decision from the financiers to cash in on the success of the LOTR trilogy, The Hobbit is too long. Often the story takes big steps backwards before being able to move forwards. It took forty minutes in the first film to start the journey and for someone who is not coming in sheer excited fandom, the slow pace is a lot of work on the audience's part.This is the typical pattern of one story movement in The Hobbit series thus far: 1) An imminent crisis or problem faces our heroes 2) Backstory is given in context to our heroes to the crisis. 3) The group tries to persevere and just as they fail or are about to give up, Bilbo does something that solves the problem 4) The group rejoice about the pure spirit of Hobbits and how impressive it is, cue flute music 5) A new problem comes along. Repeat.Throughout both films, I had an internal monologue that kept screaming, ""Let's go! Hurry up!"", as if I was watching someone play a video game at snail's pace. Die-hard LOTR fans will say that I am wrong about this but it's why those DVD extended editions exist. Even though we'll never know, Guillermo Del Toro's original idea of directing the The Hobbit as two films sounds better. But this is just something I'll have to accept. That's the extent of my issues because when The Desolation of Smaug is good, it is very good.Martin Freeman is a great Bilbo Baggins. The role requires exactly what Freeman plays best: acting quizzical from being one mental step ahead of everybody but always feels socially awkward about pointing out the obvious. Freeman's reactions are entertaining and overall I find Bilbo a much more engaging protagonist than Frodo; he gets things done.Smaug the dragon is frightening. Benedict Cumberbatch injects an immense sense of threat and power into Smaug's voice, combined with its gigantic size, creates a memorable movie villain for the ages. It was bone-chilling watching the dragon slither around in the dark, with the imminent feeling he can squash Bilbo at any moment. Hands down, the Smaug scene is the best scene in all five films so far.The beautiful Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel is a welcome addition to the series. Despite of being Jackson's creation, she is a well-rounded strong female character that adds a love story. Orlando Bloom returning as Legolas is neither her or there for me. He isn't an interesting character and seems to exist for his fighting abilities. Both elf characters are unnecessary filler material, but make entertaining filler no less. The dwarfs are more fleshed out in this installment, which is an improvement because there was nothing to distinct them apart from each other in the first film.nother minor quibble I had was the decision of using CGI in the action scenes. The orcs are computer-generated and the action sequences look digitally layered and video game-like. They're well designed and are well-paced action scenes. But the LOTR trilogy previously established a real world look with its use of New Zealand landscapes and creature make-up, and I wonder why Peter Jackson decided to go with more CGI as it doesn't match with the previous films.Peter Jackson's deep love for the material is felt throughout both films and this perhaps is the film's most winning quality. After all, Jackson's completist approach isn't self-indulgent or obnoxious, but out of a genuine love, awe and wonder for Middle Earth and its mythology. It's infectious and is probably the primary reason I was able to sit through the long running time.Overall, I enjoyed The Desolation of Smaug more than An Unexpected Journey. There is less setup to be done, hence the story moves along much faster. And for that reason alone, I think I will enjoy There and Back Again even more when things begin to wrap up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Movie,"Tonight I watched the movie ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"", along with my kids and it was fun and adventure. The movie started with the pretext in mind of the first sequel of the movie ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" and the story unfolds rather slowly. The action scenes were pretty long and undue details were added making the movie length to 161 minutes. Apart from all this the archery skills of Mr. Orlando Bloom was worth watch he was shown too good with the use of the bow as well as his counterpart Ms. Evangeline Lilly. The scene of the Smaug the Dragon was quite long and unnecessary details and talk was boring then adventurous. The mounds of gold shown was too mouth watering but it was good. The fighting with Orc's was good but again lengthy. The running around of dwarf's was enjoyed by the kids and it was funny and laughable. This was a good time pass and it consumed almost many hours of the weekend night. This kind of movies is worth watching for both adults and kids and this movie really played its part. All the cast played their part in the befitting manner and overall it was a fantastic effort. The back ground music and the scenery was stunning and as it was filmed in New Zealand; it means the country is worth watching due to its natural scenery. I gave this movie 9 out of 10 as it was an excellent effort by all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I Doubt Five Armies Can Top This Film,"Yes, I read the Hobbit. Yes, I read the Lord of the Rings. No, I don't like how Legolas was shoehorned into this movie. Anyway...What I mean in the title is that this film is probably the most memorable out of all the Hobbit movies thus far. We have Azhog the White Orc being badass as usual, Ian McKellan turns in a great performance like he always does, and they even sneak Steven Fry into a bit role that has his fingerprints all over the writing. But by far the most memorable moment is the Triumph of the Whirling Barrel Dervish. Those of you who see the film know what I'm talking about.Never have I seen something so cartoonishly over-the-top in a Tolkein film before. It made everyone in the audience laugh at how utterly ridiculous it was, and it really helped set this movie above from its predecessor as well as the original Lord of the Rings films. Yes, those films were great, but I don't find them especially memorable the way I do this movie.I feel the elements introduced into the film that weren't in the book work to the film's advantage. The love interest between Tauriel and the dwarf whose name I can't remember helped set him apart from the rest of the dwarfs, though, again, I REALLY wish they'd left Legolas out of the film. All this does is set up either a tragic death or all of us rolling our eyes because Legolas or the dwarf is going to get stiffed. No one likes seeing their ship sunk, Peter Jackson.So, yeah, love this film to death, because this is where I really feel that the fantasy adventure starts to simultaneously take itself more seriously but also less seriously. It remembers that fantasy doesn't need to be based in reality and occasionally throws in a bit of bombastic silliness to make sure we remember that too. It's not perfect, but there was never a moment I didn't enjoy. I instead look to Five Armies to fulfill that obligation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Turn-around with 'Smaug',"Much to my dismay, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' did not fair too well; though, I found it to be a great introductory film, even if it was a tad slow. Now with 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug', things are looking up for Peter Jackson and company once again. They have crafted yet another masterpiece with this second installment of 'The Hobbit.' Some would say that the introduction to a new character that doesn't appear in the books (I'll let you see for yourself) would be an unnecessary addition to the story. But in spite of all the changes the filmmakers have made, they actually serve the story well and don't seem to be as intrusive as one might think. The highlights of this film are the breathtaking production design, and the flawless special effects. The character development continues with each cast member in more depth, along with the new characters not seen in the first film. 'Smaug' is highly entertaining, supremely crafted, and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. So much so, that it leaves the viewer hungry for more!Oscar Nomination Possibilities:Best Production Design Best Film Editing Best Sound Mixing Best Sound Effects Editing Best Visual Effects Best Makeup Best Cinematography",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Don't listen to the other reviews,"The Movie is extremely well made by movie standards. I will admit that the only thing holding the movie back from LOTR level is character development. Also, there are too many unneeded characters in this trilogy. I actually hope that someone gets killed off just so I can remember the other elves names better. Smash looks incredible and is voiced excellently. Not a lot of Gandolf or the orcs in this movie, because this chapter is based more on the task at hand rather than Orc attacks. Be prepared for an action packed movie with a good story and incredible CGI. I wasn't a hugefan of the ending, but I can understand that the writers did that so the next movie starts of interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not as good as ""Unexpected Journey""","It's impossible to deny that Jackson's team have produced another fast-paced, action-filled adventure movie that is visually astonishing because of its CGI effects. The scene in the treasure room with the dragon was particularly remarkable. The elf king was an interesting character. I was pleasantly surprised to see Fry in the movie, and I enjoyed his portrayal as the Lord of Lakeland.However, I didn't particularly enjoy this 2nd Hobbit movie. I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the first one.The orcs were suitably vicious-looking, but it soon became clear that this movie was like a video game where the main point was to kill as many orcs as possible in two minutes. They certainly seem easy to kill.It was just three hours of chasing and noble speeches really. Most of Jackson's movies are like that, although ""Unexpected Journey"" transcended it.Let me disclose that, although I am a science fiction fan, I am not into fantasy fiction and LotR. When I was younger, I tried several times to get into LotR, but without success. (I did read ""The Hobbit"" in high school because it was mandatory.) I find the LotR universe tedious and overly complicated. I did not really enjoy Jackon's LotR trilogy, although I sat through all three movies. I'd like to see a movie about the real medieval world for a change, rather than one filled with imaginary creatures. I'm tired of dwarfs and orcs.However, unlike many of the reviewers here apparently, I very much enjoyed the first slower-paced more character-driven Hobbit movie. That was a movie that came close to reproducing the slower feel of the Original book. I was hoping this one would be as good as that...but it wasn't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
