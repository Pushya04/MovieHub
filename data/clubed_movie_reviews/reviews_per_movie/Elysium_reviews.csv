Possible Humankind Sci-Fi Thriller,"This sort of thing is already happening on earth, and has been for a long time, the wealthy elite fencing themselves off from the poorer in society, and hoarding all the wealth for themselves. So this is a very real possibility.The film is excellent, with great performances from Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley in particular, Jodie Foster is good if somewhat unused, as is William Fichtner, heavily using CGI though, but it looks very realistic CGI.Well directed and paced, and action scenes done well, overall a very good Sci-Fi movie.The current 6.6 average rating seems a bit low to me, it is worth an 8 out of 10 at least.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Competent film with unexploited potential, but satisfying nonetheless","I tend to be curious every time a talented filmmaker gets to direct a film set in a pessimistic future/post-apocalyptic era : visually, it's the perfect setting for desolated landscapes and amazing images of urban chaos ; story-wise, it's the perfect occasion to insert social commentary and establish more or less subtle metaphors about our current way of life, our current values, and extend in a fictitious way many assumptions that we have regarding the fate of mankind and our very own planet.In my opinion, it has to be one of science-fiction's most important sub-genres, since it leaves so much room to contemporary concerns (the environment, pollution, wars, immigration, etc.). Films like ""Children of Men"", ""Looper"", and ""The Road"" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : ""Children of Men"" was an ode to life, ""Looper"" felt a lot like a modern-day western, ""The Road"" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, ""Elysium"", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with ""District 9"", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.""Elysium"" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.The first third of ""Elysium"" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in ""District 9"". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.Unfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in ""District 9"", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in ""Elysium"". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.Then the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.Overall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while ""Elysium"" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of ""Elysium"", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It is flawed and by no means anywhere near on the same level as D9 but its solid entertainment and a smarter than average sci/fi film.,"Matt Damon stars in the Sci-fi/political thriller Elysium, Neill Blomkamp's follow up to District 9, along with Jodie Foster as Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and Sharlto Copley as the main villain Kruger. Is Elysium on par with Oscar nominated District 9? Absolutely NOT! Not even close but it is still a solid sci/fi entertainment. It is a more conventional film than its predecessor, which I was not expecting from Blomkamp.The film starts of very cliché and gave me some eye roll moments but it quickly picks itself up from reaching into mediocrity. They way it does this is by evoking political messages through out the film in relevance with today's society. Questioning our handling with immigration, military power, our health care. Which I found to be important in this film. Obviously me and Blomkamp share each others political stance. For anyone else it might seem like its trying to oversell its message.I felt most of the cast were very under used. Jodie Foster's character really didn't have much to work with. She was just there to move the plot forward. Matt Damon served his purpose as the lead but by no means of the imagination is this one of his best performances. They were all over shadowed by Sharlto Copley. My God, is he great as Kruger! Right away we are introduced into this provocative-sociopath with no regard for human life. The story really needed this kind of menacing character. He is by far the film's best positive. Another negative aspect of this film would be its pacing. When we are given emotional scenes they don't stay long enough to settle and doesn't give that emotional impact you were hoping for.Like District 9 it delivers on the the beautiful imagery. Using the very best Weta Workshop has to offer. From its big guns to the human-like robots, to the space station of Elysium. The action set pieces were just as exciting as its predecessor. The film really manages to capture all its budget on screen. My biggest issue comes from the excessive use of shaky cam. It was used when the characters were simply walking to the action sequences. I felt ninety percent of this film was shaky cam. Which got me a little dizzy since I ,unfortunately, got to sit in the very front of the theater. That might have something to do with it as well.Neill Blomkamp has established once again that he can compete with the best Directors of the genre films. Elysium shows more flaws than his first film but they are overwhelmed by its positive aspects, to me at least. It was not a disappointment and it was a solid popcorn entertainment and a smarter than average sci/fi film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most accurate depiction of the future of humanity.,"* No middle class just poor v rich.* Enslavement but not quite. Society is run by a combination of warlords and CEOs.

Like... WHAT IF you could wear a goggle over your eyes that shows the same busted up world except everything is green and beautiful, and everyone has deepfake smiles.)* Most interesting is the poor v rich spend all their time plotting and fending each other off.

Creates some kind of American revolution feeling.I feel that there should be a series with this universe that explores the down vs up, because they struck prophetic gold on the whole thing.

In the shadow of Blomkamp's District 9,"ELYSIUM is a bitter-sweet social commentary that uses brutal allegories to reiterate the alarming rate at which socio-economic and geo-political ties are disintegrating all over the planet. As a follow up to the thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining DISTRICT 9 (2009), South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp's latest offering is yet another visionary parable to mull over. And while the first half is a frightening impression of the future of humanity, the second half feels rushed and diluted. Even so, the film has a lot to offer in terms of visual effects and explosive action.Although Blomkamp's narrative begins in a dystopian future set in 2154, the story has a modern day setting that uses current events in cleverly hidden metaphors. Consider the following facts: The French Revolution that led to the execution of the monarchy; Derogatory sentiments deriding Android phones as ""ghetto"" products; Fatalities of illegal immigrants on route to greener pastures; The prospect of space tourism that only the super-rich can afford. Now imagine in the not too distant future, the extremely wealthy live on a pristine space station where state-of-the-art health care prevents people from premature death. The remaining ninety-nine percent of the population are left to suffer on the diseased, polluted and over populated planet we call Earth. Thus begins Blomkamp's setup where the premise is a thematic and often desperate struggle for equality. Amongst Earth's 'ghetto' population, blue-collar worker Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) has always dreamt of shortening the ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Now diseased and dying, the only means of rejuvenating his health lies aboard the titular space station. But preventing Max from leaving Earth is Elysium's iron-fisted Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her rogue agent - the terrifying and almost psychotic Kruger (Sharlto Copley).Where Blomkamp excels is in presenting a bleak scenario that is not only plausible but also discomforting. Considering the real world disparity between man-made utopias and an unfed infant in so called 'third world countries', it becomes all the more unsettling that this story is not entirely make believe. This is precisely what gives ELYSIUM a powerful yet thought provoking backdrop. All else, from gritty action sequences to the CGI built paradise in space benefits from the current going rate in Hollywood. On the other hand, character development leaves much to be desired. Two-time Academy Award winning Foster is either miscast or given very little to work with, but definitely my biggest disappointment in this film. There is simply no punch in what appears to be her first antagonistic role. Foster shares this downside with William Fichtner, another underrated actor whose talents are wasted in what should have been a key role. Thankfully, Damon and Copley make up for any noticeable lapse in the acting department. Together, their characters portray the fickle polarity of the human nature while also providing the film's testosterone fuelled action, including scenes of intense shootouts and sudden blood splatter.In a year that coughed up quite a few sci-fi films, with some even treading into apocalyptic territory, ELYSIUM stands on firm ground as a film that tackles social issues head-on. And while this film is far from perfect, there are ample reasons why this film is still worth a trip to the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining Science-Fiction with some flaws,"ElysiumElysium is at one point disappointing and at the other it is fine. It's a Dystopia which does not look like it could be too far away from the present. The longer you think about it, Elyisum already happens everywhere, and Neill Blomkamp is a South African native, so it becomes clear, that the message is about poverty and money in the future. The difficulty making such a future logic and scientifically well, is obvious, and it is not completely convincing. There lies the main problem of a sci-fi movie. You make either a starwarsy fairy tale or you have to make it very, very believable like the director's much acclaimed ""District 9"".Plotwise it reminded me of ""Wall-E"" (which was better), ""Oblivion"", ""Escape from NY"" and some anime type plots . The story was very predictable from the beginning and for my taste, it could have been made completely PG 18 in terms of violence, to make it darker and more grim. Now, it looks a bit indecisive. The actors were fine, especially the less known, like Copley, Luna and Moura. Jodie Foster is great here, reminded me a bit of Tilda Swintons performance in ""Michael Clayton"". Matt Damon is a good actor, but he's a bit overused lately. In comparison to ""Pacific Rim"" it's clear, why the audience is more happy with Del Toros skyscraper-style movie: it's pure entertainment, reality is far away and the violence is very mild - you hate it or you love it.To sum it up, I was well entertained by this. I liked the strong hints of real present problems. I disliked the predictable way the story unfolds, the overall mixture of action and violence and some illogic details. I definitely want to see more movies by Blomkamp and so it gets my 7.0.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very nice dystopia, above average","Good surprise that this Elysium, after the promising District 9. Neill Blomkamp confirms his know-how in the framework of a US blockbuster. Here is still at work an interesting subject, with contemporary resonances. The film is also beautiful, whether it is the shots of the earth with this devastated mega-city where poverty and assembly line work reigns, or the shots of Elysium, the space station for the rich who live in a sanitized world, filled with greenery, where there is no more disease, and who exploit the poor earthlings for their profit.The subject is not original and has been treated many times, but here the production benefits from the latest digital techniques: on this level the film is a success. And the direction of the actors is also very good: Matt Damon is very good. Sharlto Copley is still impressive in a crazy role.Good surprise then that this dystopia is far above the average of the basic science-fiction super production (I include superhero movies as science-fiction).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Set in a dystopian future, Max De Costa fights to survive and get to Elysium.","'Elysium' starring Matt Damon is the perfect summer popcorn movie. It has everything you would want in a movie; a great cast that serves their purpose and visceral special effects that might even land the team an Oscar. Everything including all the fight scenes were executed flawlessly. Coming out of this movie I had close to no complaints. The writing was a bit dodgy in some areas, but the great acting and effects quickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp, who dazzled audiences with district nine 4 years prior, does a fantastic job once again with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie goers everywhere. Overall 'Elysium' is worth every penny to watch in theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow,"Before watching Elysium, I read every review about it. And it seems to me that there are a lot of people that hated it. Most have said that the message in the film is what kept it 'likable'. Well, after I watched it, I thought to myself, ""Why?"". Trust me, don't believe any negative reviews about this film. Yes, it's flawed, but the film itself is really good.Matt Damon was great in this film and he was a very likable hero. But Sharlto Copley, oh boy, he was one heck of a villain. He was so good, every scene he was in was disturbing, in a very, very creepy way. He owned almost every scene he was in and was the stronghold of this film. Jodie Foster as the other antagonist, err, she did her part I guess. Every one did a good job and they really enabled the film to lighten up in most areas.So, this film was really good, and I was extremely pleased by it. The film did a nice job for making the audience feel attached to the characters, and I applaud to that. The action sequences were nice, and it didn't over power the film, something Elysium got right and what others sort of didn't. (Man Of Steel's epic final battle, was just TOO LONG!) Also on the scenes where it tones down and becomes emotional, was very well done, and it gives this movie heart. It's fast, epic, emotional and incredible.Now, although the film is great, I only have one small gripe about Elysium. Now, the film is around about 109 minutes. I know, that when a film feels really good and it begins to near it's end, you don't want it to do that just yet. That's how I felt when I saw District 9, and I felt the same with Elysium. The film didn't feel rushed which was nice, but an extra half an hour would've been great.Is it a Sci-Fi movie? Yes! Is it an action movie? It gets to it. Is it an epic Sci-Fi action movie? Yes. It is epic! It's definitely a must watch this year. I'm being generous to this film, because of the film's message consisting of poverty, wealth and equality. Watch this film with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Elysium is visually gorgeous but its story and characters left me cold and disappointed,"After director Neill Blomkamp's fantastic debut film District 9 I was understandably eager to see his new sci-fi film Elysium. Unfortunately his second feature doesn't quite match up with the greatness that was District 9.Visually the film is quite stunning and it has some great cinematography when it comes to the larger shots. The CGI effects are excellent and blend in well with the environment. The Earth of the film looks very gritty, believable and lived-in and the space station Elysium has this very sterile and futuristic look to it. You could really buy it that Earth could look like this with many decades of neglect and poverty. Everything's in disrepair and in decline. The rich on the other hand have every resource available to them in their own little paradise in space. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations.Matt Damon is decent as the film's protagonist Max who is an ex-con now working on assembling the droids which keep order on the now overpopulated Earth. His role and the writing of his character isn't anything too special or memorable but he does what he can with it. He's just a no nonsense guy who is thrown into a difficult situation. He was also quite sarcastic and funny when he was dealing with the droids in the earlier part of the film but we didn't see this side of him at all after that. Alice Braga plays Max's childhood friend Frey with whom Max meets up again when he's an adult. I didn't feel much of an emotional connection or chemistry between them though and that hampered the film a bit. Their back story is told almost completely in sentimental flashback sequences which I didn't care for. The antagonists in this film were very one-dimensional and over the top. Jodie Foster plays Elysium's defense minister Delacourt and Sharlto Copley (who was also in District 9) plays an undercover agent named Kruger who is positioned on Earth. They're both very cliché and uninteresting. The writing of all the characters wasn't very good at all in this film and I didn't get emotionally invested in any of them.The story isn't that great either and this then also takes away from the film's many action sequences because we don't have that big a stake in them. The film starts quite strongly as it juxtaposes the situation on Earth and on Elysium to highlight the problems of social and economic inequality. Then suddenly when the action starts, these issues fade far in to the background in favor of more and more action. From the trailers and the hype I really got this impression that the film would deal with these issues in a thoughtful manner. Regrettably this is not the case with this film. A big problem with the film is also that none of the characters seems to learn anything new or change their beliefs or anything like that. A huge part of the success of District 9 was in seeing how the main character evolved after spending some time with the aliens. In Elysium the good guys are the good guys and bad guys are the bad guys. There's no complexity, nuance or subtlety in any of them. We also don't get to meet any other citizens of Elysium beside the higher up leaders like defense minister Delacourt and president Patel. It would've been interesting to see the common people of Elysium and how they react to the situation, what their beliefs are and what drives them. The writing is also a little too pointed out and heavy-handed. Some of it just made me think ""Wow, really?"". For example, at one point the CEO of the droid production company literally tells some mid-level manager not to breathe at his direction. Things also seem to happen way too conveniently to push the plot along. Then again you could say this about many films but you really start to pay attention to these things when you're not completely engrossed in the film. This film surely would've benefited from a more subtle approach. The ending was also way too simplistic for my taste.The action in this film is quite intense and it looks very impressive at times. The exoskeletons were fun and looked convincing. Then comes the shaky cam. Oh boy. It's really quite annoying and very often it's hard to see what's going on. They should've really taken a page from the Bourne movies on how to shoot action scenes. Luckily the shaky cam isn't there all the time but the action could've definitely been improved with a clearer shooting style.All in all, the film has decent action with absolutely gorgeous visuals and it moves along at a good pace. Sadly the writing, the plot and the characters aren't that interesting and it's hard to get emotionally invested in this film. It's watchable and probably quite entertaining if you're in the proper mood for it. For me, the film ultimately left me a bit cold and disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I Love it Every Time I Watch It,"I have found Elysium to be a very underrated movie over the past few years and I genuinely wish that wasn't the case. It's gritty and heartfelt. While I do wish the pacing was changed from a quick story that feels like there isn't much to tell when there definitely is, to a longer movie that takes its time to introduce everyone, I still find it a great movie. And in a way, it's fine where it is. I've watched it multiple times and still enjoy it. The action is amazing, and there's so many cool things to marvel at. The relationships between the characters and the portrayal of those characters are on point. The visuals are great. And the ending is beautiful. I wish there were more installments to this movie but I love it. Hopefully it gets the recognition it deserves as time moves on.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Liked the CGI and sets, but didn't like the story","What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again, in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created (visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.I just wish that, when someone comes up with future plans for making a legitimate SF film (sans comic book scenarios), they contract a real science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of SF writers out there that can, I believe, turn out much better scripts than currently making their way to the big screen.Bottom line: the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when Bladerunner was produced. As an avid, and long time fan of true science fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the story, it could have been a lot, lot better.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The haves and have-nots of the distant future...,"Planet Earth in the year 2154 is a sorry sight, at least in Los Angeles: everyone is sick and struggling, while robotic guards regularly harass the residents. The wealthy and powerful look down on Earth from the space station Elysium, which is rich with swimming pools and green lawns, and where diseases are cured within seconds. Ex-convict and working-stiff Matt Damon, exposed to radiation on the job (and with only five days left to live), strikes a deal with a low-rent space travel honcho to steal brain matter from one of Elysium's elite in exchange for unauthorized passage to the privileged world. Unfortunately, they choose the wrong citizen, a spineless corporate suit in-cahoots with Elysium's secretary to the president, who is planning a political coup. Plot-heavy science-fiction adventure is, rather surprisingly, easy to follow and moves at a quick clip. Damon gives a solid performance (when he isn't being asked to scream or hobble around in agony), and the costly production looks terrific. Still, the picture does begin to flag after the first half, with character motivations becoming unclear, and everyone acting hysterically or irrationally. I'm also not sure of the purpose of Damon's fate, which seems to go against the central plot function the film is operating on. As the cold-hearted secretary, who thinks nothing of shooting impoverished citizens out of the sky, a miscast Jodie Foster struggles with an underwritten role; I haven't a clue as to who this villainess is, and I'm guessing Foster didn't, either (she's also encumbered by, what I suspect to be, post-production dubbing on her dialogue, which is heavy with a faux-decadent cadence that doesn't work at all). Producer-director-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp's gigantic effort is rather enjoyable overall, although the hopeful ending may strike some as overreaching, even in this context. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Matt Damon will do whatever it takes to get to Elysium,"Of all the genre's out there, science fiction seems to be the one rarely getting it right these days. When Neill Blomkamp burst onto the screen with his gritty racial commentary film District 9 it changed the genre for the better. Now he is back with his latest look at the future with Elysium and is bringing Matt Damon along for the ride. The trailers looked to deliver a similar vision of his previous film, but does it pack the same punch both in the story as well as visually?Elysium follows a man desperate to get to Elysium, a space station where the very wealthy live in a pristine world, while the rest of the human race remain on an overpopulated ruined Earth. With nothing left to lose, he takes on a mission against Elysium's secretary Delacourt and the entire system to save himself as well as the millions of others on Earth. Once again Blomkamp has created a film that not only entertains but has numerous levels of social commentary without ever getting overly preachy. This time out there seems to be the health care system, over population, and pollution that all make up this world these characters inhabit. Matt Damon continues to deliver with him really stepping it up even more than usual here. What is great about his character is that he feels more like a normal guy with flaws and a reluctant hero forced into this situation as opposed to wanting to be there. You feel his desperation and in turn can imagine the rest of the planet and what they are going through. District 9 star Sharlto Copley plays a completely different type of character and is a complete badass. He steals every scene he is in and is near unrecognizable in this role. Every time he steps on screen you know something great is going to happen. The always great William Fichtner has a brief but not surprisingly good presence here. Jodi Foster is the only that just doesn't seem to work all that well. Her performance felt forced at times and she seemed to float in and out of the strange accent she is trying to use. The visuals are gritty, dirty, and beautiful all at once and are the main catalyst to make this film come to life. There is plenty of action here and at first seems to be playing it a bit safe, but quickly proves otherwise as the film moves forward.This is one of the best science fiction films to come along in some time and has everything you could possibly want. Most will just watch this movie and see the action spectacle and cool visuals, but this film is so much more. Pay attention to the story and what it is trying to tell you and this film will have a greater effect on you. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, but overall still gets the message across all while delivering a bad ass action science fiction film that should not be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Neil Blomkamp is great,I thought this movie was really good movie if you're a fan of Sci-Fi. Obviously if Matt Damon's' in it it has to be great right? If the movie had about 25 more mins to do a few things different this could've easily been a 9 star movie which is what I consider District 9. I really like how Neil Blomkamp films his movies. Like Steven Soderburgh you can tell his movies by the way the movie is filmed. They have certain styles that you can clearly tell are far different from everyone else kinda like Guy Ritchie movies. Elysian is a very good movie and is well worth taking the time to watch it. Neil Blomkamp is great.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Interesting and entertaining, but the story falls apart","I am a Bourne trilogy fan, and enjoy watching Matt Damon, but this movie had stale conversations didn't really bring the act to this. The action was decent though, the stand offs were very entertaining and overall it was a good movie. Except for one major part, the story comes out as him trying to save himself, then turns to saving the entire planet, and then him saving his girlfriends daughter. Even there is the problem the characters were not developed, the viewer seems random flashbacks of his life one I think was around 3 times. Never though do they explain the story of him and his girlfriend and where does she get the baby from.Away from children, and back to reality another drawback of the movie is it's politics system. Seems as though Mexico took over USA in 130 years because everyone speaks Spanish, and all the French people took all the rich people and flew out in space.Lastly, are the effects, some were cheap (first crash landing) and some were awesome (elysium itself and the gruesome splatter effects). There were neat ideas put into the movie of how it is going to be in 130 years. The scene with the parole officer was amusing. Also, I gotta admit the shield that the bad guy was using was wicked, and the whole reconstruction/healing was neat or at least as long as your brain works (go see the movie you know what I am talking about)This is my first review, thought I will try to write and maybe was a bit harsh with my rating, but I think the idea has potential, but should have been worked on a little more. Oh, my girlfriend thought that the awfully accented bad guy was Chuck Norris.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lacking in Motivation,"Elysium is the follow up, much anticipated by many, to the critically acclaimed District 9 from South African-Canadian director and writer Neill Blomkamp.In the middle of the 21st Century, with the world now grossly over-populated and law and order seemingly at breaking point, the super wealthy have decamped to a satellite space station highly visible from earth, a utopian society free of poverty, illness and other such mundane woes.Meanwhile, the vast majority of earth's population lives in squalid, cramped slums seemingly based on the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Needless to say, the rich are all too keen to protect their enclave and any unauthorised vessels arriving from earth are duly dispatched by being blasted away.Jodie Foster stars as Elysium's ambitious and sociopathic Defence Secretary, as ruthless at advancing her own interests as she is at ensuring the purity of the over-sized Ferris wheel whose security is in her charge; Matt Damon is the working class drone desperately trying to access the other world for the treatment to cure his radiation sickness from which he will die in 5 days.There was clearly an interesting concept waiting to burst out here, an opportunity to explore themes of wealth, inequality, social status, health care and immigration, but sadly it failed on almost every level to build interest or have anything relevant to say.First, we saw so little of the societal structure or way of life on Elysium itself. Apart from Jodie Foster and a few other high ranking officials, the film showed us nothing of how this satellite was run. It looked as if everyone lived in a McMansion style-home – the type you find next to golf courses in Florida or on the Sunshine Coast. It all looked terribly sterile, reminiscent of the contrived town Jim Carrey inhabited in The Truman Show. We were not privy as to who cut the lawns, did the plumbing or washed the dishes. Superficially, the lives of these pampered people seemed hollow and totally unfulfilled – where were the galleries, the museums, the theatres or even a casino for those that might like that sort of thing? Frankly, the impoverished life on earth which was shown with enforced work in a fascistic environment seemed far more fulfilling.Further, Matt Damon's motives for getting on Elysium were totally selfish. All he wanted was to save his own skin. Granted, there was then concocted an unconvincing love interest and a wish to save his childhood sweetheart's little girl but this too was just parochial. Where was the burning anger borne from social injustice, the wish to better the lot of all humankind, the working class warrior on a mission? And when the film's final denouement came it was head in a sick-bag time.The script and dialogue were banal, as was Jodie Foster's delivery. Matt Damon worked harder to bring some interest to his character but he was up against it – but at least he tried.The CGI was good – but that's pretty much a given in any well-funded Hollywood film these days. Close up camera work was appalling, non-stop wobble vision which made action sequences confusing. This camera style is so unnecessary and it really is beyond comprehension as to why film-makers persist in its use; in small doses it can be effective but when near constant it produces a feeling of nausea.It is so disappointing to be relentlessly negative about a film but when they are as lacking as this one, the positives can be hard to find.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Ferris Wheel Paradise in Space,"Elysium has to be one of the most populist oriented science fiction films I've ever seen. Doesn't mean it isn't good, in fact has a message of equality that should resonate for today's audience.Elysium is a giant wheel in space with artificial atmosphere where folks live on the inner ring in really luxurious style. They've even got all the latest advances in modern science with a machine that can cure just about anything. For that if nothing else the people living there want to keep it to themselves.Meanwhile back on Earth the planet has just become one big polluted mass where everyone just scratches out a living the best they can. It's patrolled by robot police who keep the great mass in line. Everyone yearns to go to Elysium and live the good life. But there are no Horatio Alger stories any more. The haves, the 2% that live on Elysium want to keep it for themselves and are ruthless in keeping the other 98% in line.What's brought things to the sorry state they're in is unbridled capitalism. That's the message of Elysium.The one man who's going to change it is Matt Damon who gets an accidental overdose of radiation poisoning on his industrial job. Now he wants to get to Elysium and steal some of that rationed healthcare. In the end though he serves far more than himself.That part of the film reminded me so much of the famous noir film DOA where Edmond O'Brien is given a slow acting poison. As for the ending that's from another classic science fiction film The Omega Man with Charlton Heston. See if you don't recognize the plot elements.One of the causes near and dear to Matt Damon's heart is our environment. Both in this film and in his most recent previous film Promised Land, Damon used the power of his celebrity to voice these concerns without sacrificing an iota of entertainment.His adversary for most of the film is Jodie Foster who plays the head of Homeland Security on Elysium. She's got an agenda of her own as she protects the Homeland Security for the haves on Elysium.Elysium also makes some strong political statements about the USA as a kind of earthly Elysium which at one time was built on the strength of immigrants which now some want to keep out at any price.I did enjoy this film very much, it's one of the best so far I've seen this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium a trip you might want to re-think,"Elysium was easily my most hyped up movie for the summer. Neil Blomkamp came into the scene a few years ago with the amazing film district 9, so Elysium has been long anticipated. So the question is does it live up to all the hype and can it reach the level that district 9 did? Unfortunately the answer is no. Unlike District 9 the story here is a very simple one, with no real sense of political/controversial undertones, and that is a shame because Elysium's plot is perfect for this. Instead we get a very generic story with no real surprises and unfortunately Blomkamp decided to play it safe here. Now Elysium is not an awful movie by any means, in fact it's good but it the problem here is that it's weighted down by it's simplicity. The camera-work and soundtrack also hurt Elysium in a sense that the sound and music are almost non existent, and the camera work looks like it was filmed to be in 3d but then they opted out making it seem almost like a video game. Matt Damon brings in a decent performance but it is Sharlto Copley here who steals the show with his role as the villain. It's going to be a big year for sci-fi films but i would highly recommend watching the unrated sci-fi film oblivion over this. Elysium ends up playing it safe and becoming generic with no real surprises. There is a grand setting here but they never take advantage of that fact. Hopefully Blomkamp can get back on track with his next film, but i do expect great things to come from him in the near future. While not awful, Elysium proves to be somewhat of a disappointment.

"Not bad, but probably not worth a trip to the movies.","Elysium is your standard tale of the struggle between the upper class and the poor...with robots and space ships in the year 2154. (The fact there's even THAT MUCH of Los Angeles left in 2154 is amazing on its own.) The rich have moved from a dying earth to the massive space station Elysium, and everyone not rich is forbidden to go. Also, Elysium has video-game-like healing stations that cure everything. EVERYTHING. And since you can barely get an Advil back on earth, the people stuck there are not too happy about it. Matt Damon plays your standard guy- raised-in-an-orphanage-wishing-he-wasn't-so-poor, while Jodie Foster plays the I-don't-give-a-flying-f*ck, shoot-first-ask-later head of security for Elysium.Pros: - The first thing that will grab you is the scenery. Earth looks beaten down, but it looks fantastic in its devastation. Elysium looks like a dream world. The inner-core of Elysium looks like something straight out of Aperture Laboratories. (Portal, anyone?) - Jodie Foster plays a MEAN villain. And that's good. - Sharlto Copley, the star of District 9, has got some serious acting flexibility. He plays a grizzled mercenary that is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of his D9 character, but you'd never recognize him until the end credits. - The SHOOTING action scenes are very cool.Cons: - I specified earlier that the shooting action scenes are good, because the FIGHTING action scenes are terrible. When anyone goes hand-to-hand, the camera shakes WAY TOO MUCH. I know that this is becoming a style for many movies, but...I hate it. You literally cannot make out what is happening. All I can think about is that there's a camera guy running behind the scene, who can't hold the camera properly. It's enough to give you a headache. STOP DOING THIS, MOVIES. - Matt Damon is...eh...dry. He just doesn't do much for the character. Seems like he phoned it in. - I hate to say it about a Neill Blomkamp-written movie, but the script just isn't that strong. I would have wanted more time for Jodie Foster to flex some acting muscle, and less time for Matt Damon to fumble through awkward confrontations. I never really got attached to any of the characters.Be warned - there is some graphic violence.Elysium is not a bad sci-fi action flick, but it could have been much better. It's going to fall well short of some of the other sci-fi flicks we've seen this summer. (Star Trek, Pacific Rim) Elysium scores a 3 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(If you enjoyed this review...well then, you have good taste. And you're probably very good looking.

"Worth to watch, Brilliant Graphics","Well, as a die hard Matt Damon fans, I'm just so gonna watch this movie and I did. Yeap and I will always said his acting just won't fail me and let me down.Lets talk about the movie shall we ? Firstly BRILLIANT GRAPHICS, thanks to modern technology, CG looks real enough, hardly notice that it had been polished by after effects. Visually Enjoyed watching the movie. Actually I see shadow of District 9 throughout the show, is it maybe coz of Sharlto Copley ? Well, you judge that yourself.Talking about casting, I would say all the Actor/Actress were put to the right place, the acting was real, professional, I am so into the movie and I am so enjoyed of the performances of they.Everything is best and sets, at least for me. Just a little bit disappointed of the story line, it's just so predictable and simple, I was hoping to get a little bit more from this Movie. But overall still a nice show to watch.So I am voting a 7 out of 10 rating.You definitely going to watch this, whether you're a die hard fans of Matt Damon or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A fun action film with some work needed to be done,"Elysium is not perfect by any stretch. It's brought down by a mediocre plot, any character outside of Matt Damon and shartlo Copley is dull, and as much as Jodie foster tries her hardest the villain is really bad. But what holds it up is the interesting sci-fi concepts Neil always has, beautiful visuals, great action scenes, shartlo Copley is a fun villain, and Matt Damon giving a outstanding performance on top of being a really likable hero. Not great but a fun popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't believe the review trolls,"Elysium is a gripping scifi movie. There are some plot holes but what scifi movie doesn't have those? Damon as Max and Sharto Copley as Kruger are excellent. The plot isn't deep but the action never slows down. Is this America in 30 years, where the environment is trashed and the rich control health care? Those seem to be today's headlines every day. Yes it's fiction but a more possible fiction than many other scifi movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gripping Sci-Fi Movie,"Directing: I must say that Neill did an amazing job not only directing but also writing and delivered a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Starting from the first act, building up to a steady second act and finish off with a great closure.Production: Of course, Neill was also part of the production team, as if he had nothing else more important to do like writing or directing. Bill along with the rest of the production team, all worked with Neill on previous projects including District 9 and Chappi. Problem is that when it comes to this combination of outer space, rockets, robots, health crisis etc... extensive details are key and small mistakes can sometimes cause irregularities and plot holes. This movie has so many goofs and plot holes it's quite comic.Script: Neill wrote a very impressive script, there is nothing much else I can say about the script except a few barely noticeable irregularities but other than that, the script was solid! Great work Neill.Acting: Mat, Jodie, Fichtner all great actors, delivering a solid performance throughout the movie. A special praise goes to Copley for an exceptional performance as Kruger.Cinema and sound: Lorn's opening Ghosst was out of this world crazy, and an impressive composition by Ryan Amon with a soundtrack to be remembered. The cinematography was on point, no shaky blurred scenes that make no sense, a solid job done with visuals and editing. I do have a few question marks on a few shots, like how is Elysium so clearly visible from earth?Conclusion: Goofs aside, I enjoyed watching Elysium from start to finish, it was thrilling and entertaining.I give Elysium a rating of 8.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Evil White People hold Hispanics in submission.,"In the year 2154 two classes of people exist: the very wealthy WHITE PEOPLE who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the HISPANICS (except for Matt Damon), who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. Secretary Rhodes, an evil WHITE lady, will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the luxurious lifestyle of the WHITE people of Elysium. That doesn't stop the HISPANIC people of Earth from trying to get in, by any means they can. When unlucky Max (The only non-evil WHITE person on earth) is backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that if successful will not only save his life, but could bring equality to these propagandized worlds.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining sci-fi thriller, with non-polarized good and evil","I liked Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and I was sure I would not be disappointed with Elysium as well - as for thrillers, I prefer movies when evil is cognizant (even if aliens or mutant warriors, not abstract such as animals, natural phenomena or even zombies. Well, the script contains some unreal scenes for the sake of excitement and action, but they are not long and do not become annoying, fights/chases and human contacts are balanced, and many actual serious topics are approached (e.g. immigration limits, overpopulation and poverty, health care and wealth). Actors like Matt Damon, Judie Foster or William Fichtner are always high-level (Damon has become a really versatile actor, his role in Behind the Candelabra is totally different). However, the movie has no even good-bad contradiction, as Sharito Copley is not equal in value with Damon. The ending is only partially expected, and the general mood differs from most Hollywood movies.All in all, if you like action sci-fi thrillers without numb actors and pointless violence, then you will enjoy Elysium.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
El-Stupid-ium,"WOW! This movie is just awful. They call it Science Fiction but there is no science in it...only really bad fiction.Have you ever noticed in these kind of futuristic society stories they never really explain how society got to the current state it is in at the start of the movie? There is a reason why. There is no possible way that such a stupid societal construct could ever come to be! So ...like a Paul Krugman economic theory...the answer is that the construct exists because the premise starts out saying ""Let's assume that all logic and common sense goes out the door.""(!)Evidently in the future only future Los Angeles and Elysium exist. Supposedly the world is ravaged by population and disease but there are no Asians or EEU or South American or African members...or even Washington, DC, involved with Elysium! EVERY POLITICALLY SYSTEM GLOBALL JUST SOMEHOW UP AND VANISHED! DOH! So...Elysium is built and lived on evidently by only Hollywood types who rule the planet! The internet as we know it has also completely vanished. So has e-mail and cell phone technology...but you can still get a good deal on GMC vehicles that look like leftover Road Warrior vehicles!Matt Damon (say it Team America-like) works in a factory where he...I guess...builds robots (?). That's a little unclear. But...he is stupidly badgered into some sort of elevator style ""heat-treatment"" booth by his superior. Since their is no OSHA anymore his character gets trapped in the room where they...get this!...dose the robots WITH HUMAN KILLING RADIATION! Now...there's like no big signs up anywhere in this factory that say WARNING: RADIATION AT WORK! It is never explained why robots need radiation treatment but that is what they do. AND...get this!...when the treatment is done the radiation ""magically"" disappears! People just walk in and out of the room! Like...WTF!??!!!??? How does radiation magically dissipate or get moved out of a room? IT DOESN'T! Unless all science goes out the window!Poor Matt. Now he has 4 days to live because of Radiation poisoning and he is very ill and can barely walk or stay awake or keep from puking...for about 5 minutes! The rest of the movie he is hooked up to a biometric-ally controlled exoskeleton and Matt never shows any effects of radiation poisoning and he fights his way all over LA and Elysium! So...in a complete Johnny Mnemonic rip off (they should sue)...Matt Damon has the magic data in his skull and people want his head. How this all comes about is so incredibly ridiculously stupid and unbelievable I wanted to throw things at the screen.Matt then shows up with a grenade with the pin pulled out and his hand holding the grenade from exploding and he demands a ride to Elysium or he will blow his head off. So...not strapped in...and with no refueling of any sort at all...the ship just flies off on a 12 minute flight to Elysium! So...they are breaking through Earth's atmosphere with the super rocket powered ship...he is not strapped in and is holding a grenade...AND THERE IS NO BLEEPING G FORCE CAUSING ANY ISSUES!The final ""evil guy\good guy"" fight is just awful. The ""evil guy"" basically runs around saying ""I could kill you but I will continue to spout stupid statements to drag this out until you...and this will be SUCH A SURPRISE...manage to overcome and defeat me because I kept just spouting off at the mouth rather than just killing you!""This is after Matt goes to the armory and rescues the girly and Leukemia ridden daughter(tug my bleeding heartstrings). Now...dig this...3 bad guys are taking over Elysium...there is a big armory with plenty of weapons...AND NO ONE IS COMING TO GRAB THE WEAPONS AND TO STOP THE 3 MAN COUP OF ELYSIUM!

Entertaining Easy Watch but feels like we've seen it before,"Its an enjoyable film, plenty happening, easy to follow, good case, thought provoking material but it doesn't feel original. The market seems saturated with 'earths a mess and people live in space' type films i.e. Oblivion, Total Recall etc. Saying that this is the best one of these and does give you a more realistic sense of what could happen in the future has a layer of gritty reality to it that seems to give is more credibility. There are random elements to it, why is a South African commando's (or whatever they were) stationed in Los Angeles, just felt like that Blomkamp wants something to do with South Africa in there even if its irrelevant or compromises the plausibility of the film.

"Effects and spectacle in search of a decent plot, a decent pace and a decent conclusion","As someone who really enjoyed District 9 with its mix of social commentary and sci-fi, I was quite looking forward to this film but due to the so-so reviews from critics, decided to give it a while and watch it once the dust had settled. I did so recently and have to say that the critics that laid into this film were mostly right to do so because it is a surprisingly weak film across the board. The plot is about the haves (in space) and have-nots (on earth); it is a familiar scenario and of course the have-nots want what they don't have while the haves don't want anyone else to have what they have.Speaking of haves, just to say what the film does have – it has a very big budget, a very big star and plenty of impressive special effects; so if these are the sole qualities that you are looking for then you'll find much to like here as it ticks these boxes. Unfortunately what the film doesn't have is a great deal of substance to back this up. OK there is stuff in here about immigration and artificial borders drawn in a map but it is really poorly handled with nothing smart to say but just big obvious gestures which really bring nothing (and I say this as a liberal myself). With the subtext mostly just a flapping rag hanging off the film, this should still mean that we get a solid sci-fi action movie but unfortunately this also falls flat. The film has terrible pacing, plot twists and turns that really make no sense at all and generally it doesn't engage.The sci-fi action is technically impressive (despite feeling like we saw it before in District 9) but with nothing to really engage the viewer it just starts to feel like noise and spectacle for the sake of it – which it kinda is. Damon seems earnest throughout and is OK but he is not as light-footed with this material and it shows. Indeed the whole film shares his rather plodding feel. Foster is wasted, Copley's is a good presence but seems out of step with the rest of the film, Braga is stunning as ever but doesn't have too much else to work with and so it goes on.It has a lot of things at its resources in terms of star names, special effects and money to spend on both, but unfortunately the plot is leaden, the pacing off, events unconvincing and unengaging and the subtext is really akin to something scribbled on paper with crayons and a smiling sun in the background. It is expensive enough not to be awful, but it certainly isn't much good.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The movie is OK for a sci-fi/action,"Elysium had some refreshing ideas about how the future could look like and I am positively surprised about the background story of the life on earth in contradiction to the life on Elysium. It is a parallel to today's life and makes you think about how the life could be if it develops further in that direction. The visuals and the sci-fi elements are good. Some technological inventions are ingenious like the chips that are attached to a human brain where the data could be up/downloaded via a USB cable :D It has some great action elements, which are sometimes easily predictable. Also I wasn't very stunned by the acting performances. The development of the love story is somewhat boring and lacks emotion, it is unfinished and undeveloped. All in all it is worth watching for everybody who likes sci-fi movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Neill Blomkamp recreates look of 'District 9' without the same success,"It's the year 2154. Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con living in a dystopic police-state earth and crumbling Los Angeles. He's trying to live the straight life working in a factory. The rich and powerful are now living in the space station Elysium. Everybody wants a ticket to the utopian world where advanced med bay can cure almost anything. During an industrial accident, Max is flooded with a lethal dose of radiation. He has 5 days to live and is desperate to go up to Elysium. Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is threatened by the president and is now orchestrating a coup. Max reunites with his old criminal boss Spider to try to steal some brain data. Except the data they stole is something more valuable than some bank accounts.The look and feel of this is reminiscent of Neill Blomkamp's other and better sci-fi 'District 9'. The story is weighted down by a few questionable setups. There are a lot of recycled sci-fi ideas in this movie and one unexpected one from 'Johnny Mnemonic'. The movie has its moments. If you could overlook some of the simplistic setups, there is a fun little action movie. However the backstory is a little too simplistic. It's fine for a small campy movie like 'Johnny Mnemonic', but this movie wants to be taken seriously. And I just can't take its message too seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Funky. Memorable. Jarring.,"Guess what. I hate Crypto-era Matt Damon. He sucks.But guess what. He's really good in this movie. And this becomes before the crypto era. So I let this one slide.This film is particularly jarring. It's violent, shocking, mentally exhausting but seriously salient.This movie isn't some predictive dystopian social commentary gem. It's a couple levels below that. It makes up for mixed messaging with SERIOUSLY stand out visuals. It's a delightful visual nugget with an all around intense perspective.The runtime is perfect and it packs all the essentials and more in the visuals department. For myself, this film separated itself very quietly.

Excellent movie - excellent statement,"I feel compelled to counterbalance some of the poorer reviews: concerning bad storytelling, not much to connect to, no chemistry between the main characters, not enough development of social criticism, no one changing to the better ... The movie provides a plain and clear statement. It doesn't want to be a simple hero-gets-heroine, down-in-our-hearts-we-actually-are-all-good-people-flick. One of the first thoughts that struck me was: this is exactly how we 1st-world-people treat refugees, foreigners, 3rd- world-countries... It is not a movie about chemistry between certain people, it is about chemistry between systems. Using the tool of a brilliant, entertaining, well-done action thriller with outstanding actors, Blomkamp draws a picture highlighting some of the grievances of our present world. Connecting to the movie's message is synonymous to connecting to these problems, to what we can see in our own neighborhood, country, political system right here and now. Do we ourselves change our attitude to the better? Or are we just, turning off the TV with a little shiver, glad to be on the better side, forgetting within a minute all about the poverty and sadness we have just watched? The movie doesn't need more chemistry, development or social criticism - it needs people to open their eyes, minds and hearts to see the plain facts. The only mistake Blomkamp maybe made was underestimating our ability to follow what is so clearly seen by him: he himself having lived in a 3rd-world and later in a 1st-world country, knows the difference from his own experience, the cause and effect of problems are obvious to him. We, who are lacking this first hand experience, must make an effort to see. Maybe it is easier for myself because my husband is South African and helped to open my eyes to the gap between rich and poor as well as our ignorance beforehand.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Great Sci-Fi by Neill Blomkamp with a Different Fight of Classes,"In 2154, the population is divided in two social classes: the wealthy people live in Elysium, a space station with all the resources; the poor people lives in the exhausted Earth.In Los Angeles, the former car thief Max da Costa (Matt Damon) is on parole and works on an unhealthy factory Armadyne managed by the CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner). He dreams on saving money to travel to Elysium. Meanwhile the Secretary of Defense of Elysium, Delacourt (Jodie Foster), plots a coup-of-stat against President Patel (Faran Tahir), with the support of Carlyle. He programs a software that can override Elysium's data system and make any change, including the president's name to Delacourt. Carlyle uploads the software to his brain to increase its protection.Max is exposed to a lethal amount of radiation in Armadyne and has only five more days of life. He seeks out the criminal Spider (Wagner Moura) expecting to travel to Elysium, where he can use a medical chamber called Med-bay that is capable to heal any disease and save his life. Spider tells that if Max steals profitable information, such as bank accounts, from the brain of Carlyle that is on Earth, he would get his ticket to Elysium. Max accepts the proposal without knowing the powerful knowledge in Carlyle's brain. When Delacourt learns that the information she needs to become president was stolen from Carlyle brain, she sends the notorious agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to hunt down Max and recover the software at any cost.""Elysium"" is another great sci-fi by Neill Blomkamp, the director and writer of ""District 9"", with a different fight of classes. The poor people live in Los Angeles, now a big slum, and the rich people lives in Elysium, the Elysian Fields from the Greek Mythology and meaning a place or condition of ideal happiness. Matt Damon is excellent as usual, and Jodie Foster is a perfect villain with a different look, blonde with short hair. The Brazilian Alice Braga is very well-known and this is the international debut of the also Brazilian Wagner Moura.There are many plot holes, like for example why not shutdown the airspace from Earth permanently unless when Elysium needs to send a shuttle to Earth of vice-versa? Earth is limited to Los Angeles? Why does Elysium need a man to launch missiles to knock-down the spacecrafts with illegal immigrants? Why not keep Med-Bays in the hospitals on Earth is they are so simple and cheap? But the movie entertains and does not give time to think in these holes. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Elysium""",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining Sci-Fi That's Certainly Underrated,"Elysium (2013)*** 1/2 (out of 4)The setting is 2154 and Earth is pretty much a dumping ground for the sick and the poor while Elysium, a space station built by the rich, contains the perfect lifestyle. When he finds himself dying and needing to get to the planet, Max (Matt Damon) decides to take it on himself to try and combine the two worlds. I guess I'm going to be in the minority because I found director Neil Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 to be good but quite overrated whereas I found ELYSIUM to be incredibly entertaining, rather smart and full of terrific action so in many ways I think it's rather underrated by the majority of the people out there. Yes, I will admit that the story isn't the strongest in the world and yes I will admit that the ending doesn't quite pack the punch everyone was hoping for but there's still no question that this is a highly entertaining gem. I think the strongest thing is obviously the special effects, which are quite flawless for the majority of the film. I really thought the director did a brilliant job at building up this futuristic world by giving it a terrific look but he also made you believe the setting, the conditions of the people in it and he managed to do this on the rich space craft as well. Another major plus are the action scenes, which are beautifully filmed with the director putting the 2.35:1 cinematography to perfect use. Yet another strong point are the performances with Damon leading the way as the hero. I thought the actor was extremely believable in the part and while this role isn't going to land him an Oscar, seeing such a strong actor in the role does make it much better. Jodie Foster is good in the role of the villain but I will admit her accent was strange to say the least. Sharito Copley, Diego Luna, Wagner Moura and William Fichtner are all very good in their supporting roles. The film certainly contains some political elements, which are thankfully never too preachy but at the same time it leads up to an ending that really doesn't work. ELYSIUM seems to be getting attacked by some because ""it's not as good as DISTRICT 9"" but this here is somewhat unfair. When viewed on its own I think the film perfectly lives up to the director's strong vision making it a must see.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worth Seeing but Less Than It Could Be,"I saw Elysium in IMAX, so my review is only for that format.In a future where Earth is like the slums of Mexico City, the richest few have escaped to live on a satellite world. Our protagonist, played by Matt Damon is just another nobody in the overpopulated Los Angeles of 2154. The story is about his character trying to get to Elysium against seemingly impossible odds.Elysium is cut from the same cloth as District 9 (also directed by Neill Blomkomp). Both of them owe their gritty, industrial tone to Blade Runner.The idyllic world of Elysium is visually wonderful. I wish more of the action was set on that world. Perhaps viewers in 1939 felt the same way about the world of Oz, feeling that the bare glimpses of the Emerald City did not satisfy.The primary antagonist to Damon's character is Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. Like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, she is ""civilization's"" line of defense against the enemies beyond the walls. She plays her part with an iconic stoniness that some might find annoying. I thought her acting was fine.One thing that I found distracting to the point of annoyance was the overuse of hand-held cameras. I want to be thinking about the action, not the cameras.The story itself is filled with action. That may be enough. But I wish I had cared more about the quest of our hero. Maybe I didn't because it was overshadowed by the political and social implications of the story. Not that it was preachy, but distracting. Imagine The Wrath of Khan if Captain Kirk were just one of a population of millions, not an individual who is a genius warrior with an unbending will.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Max has fulfilled his destiny, but is it ""Elysium""'s destiny to be a better movie than District 9?","Okay, first of all I am so excited about this movie, especially it is directed by Neill Blomkamp, the creator of the awesome ""District 9"", and I thought this gonna be ""awesome"", too.Set in 2154, where Earth is drew over-populated, messy and such things. All the problems that you can imagine is now a reality in this planet. The only reason to go to space is for the Earth life as we used to know. Unfortunately, as the greed of human never stops, they keep the facility, this Elysium, only for the rich-folks.Max De Costa, an ex-criminal who decided to work on Armadyne, a robot servants factory, got an accident on workplace, leaving a radiation that will kill him in five days if he doesn't go to Elysium, where the medical pod and such things could be happened.So I will start with the plus. There are so many sci-fi(future imagination especially) that failed. Let's just say Pandorum, G.I. Joe(I don't know if this sets in future, but well), they are barely give us the real deal of future. But in Elysium, it's too ignorant to not believe what Earth would be. Over-populated, advanced tech(even I am not so sure with that medical-pod), even the genius AI. Hell, they are seem so real in a distant future.Another aspect is Sharlto Copley. Yes, you maybe recognize his face from ""District 9"" as Wikus Van De Merwe. You see, the accent he uses in two different films are flawless. And the characters between a mutated human become a #1 mercenary, he just cannot fail. I love his act and impression, really.Beside that, there was nothing special, more than my expectation from D9. The plot is flat, there is no co-op relationship that really matters(Between Wikus and Christopher Johnson, it is so intense), and easily forgettable. One more thing, the action. I have watched the trailer for this movie, and it seems promising a great fight between exoskeleton-guy with a robot, a genius AI robot. But as far as I can see, I only saw a man that ripping of a robot's head. That's all. No more robots. Ever. The camera is unconformably followed. I mean, why could they just put it on a certain spots, and let the editing do the work? I was really surprised when the Director of Photography is exactly the same as D9. D9 is better at fight scene.The verdict is, this movie may be forgettable, but the act from Sharlto Copley leave my disappointment that this movie would/should have been better than District 9. A great dystopia future and actors, but really missed the chance because the freaking camera shoot and standard plot. But still, I am looking forward to D9 sequel. Hope it will get more awesomeness from the franchise.P.S.: Sorry if this review is too comparative with District 9. Since I like District 9, the director and writer is same and I expect something more, so. . .",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium 6/10,"Elysium, a film that I was not at all excited for, but still saw it. Blomkamp is back after the success of one of the best sci-fi films in along time, D9.So, visually the film is incredible and that's what I think is the films strongest aspect. The vast landscapes of this poverty filled Earth is beautiful, yet so dirty. You can actually believe this is Earth because with a lot of neglect over time, Earth may or may not turn out that way. And then there's Elysium, that I find to be an extremely cheesy Utopian world. I was chuckling every time there were shots of that world and the people in it. Everything too perfect. Yes, I know that's the point, but I just think the way it's executed is really cheesy. The visual effects are perfect and blended extremely well. The CGI looks as real as you can possibly get with CGI. There wasn't a moment when I was questioning whether it's CGI or not. I honestly thought it was all real. The robots are so fascinating because of their colors. The robots are bright colors like red, yellow, orange, which is a contrast to what Earth is. The set and production designers are top of their game with Elysium. My biggest problem with the direction of this film is the shaky-cam. I'm usually a fan of the shaky-cam because it can add a grittiness to the film and most of the times it does in the film, except for the action scenes. Almost every action scene has so much shakiness you get disoriented to what actually going and which character is where. I would have loved smoother and more clarity to the action scene because I want to see what's going and what fight technique each character has. And having a ton of cuts during the fight scene doesn't help either. It's like one shaky tight shot, cut to another and another, then to a medium, then to a wide and back to a million more close ups. Thus being said, that didn't stop me from getting into most of the fight scenes. My favorite fight scene is probably the first one once Max is attached to the exoskeleton machine because you get introduced to the weapons and the strength this machine brings to Max. My least favorite is the final fight scene between Max and Kruger because the way it's shot makes me so disoriented and seems really rushed to get over with. Also, I love the gore. Get ready for some imploding and exploding humans.The script is by far the weakest aspect of the film and it really turns me off big time. The film starts out pretty good with comparing the situations on Earth and on Elysium to show the social and economic inequality. But we kind of lose all that once the action starts. These issues just back into a corner and stay hidden, so it just turns into the ""good guys"" vs the ""bad guys."" And that's it. Of course you know the character's motives and what not, but I still just found that way over powered by one dimensional characters. There's hardly any character development for except for Max and Frey, which told through flashback, which I fairly enjoyed, but nothing new to storytelling. Finding out about Max's and Frey's relationship/friendship in the past still doesn't get me emotionally attached to the two character. Their relationship and motives seem way too mechanical. No other character has any character development. I think it's really comical that basically everyone on Elysium are rich white people, which are portrayed as evil bigots and then Earth is only filled with people of different race and Matt Damon is apparently the last white person on Earth. The film also takes cheap shots at health-care. Elysium just rudely slaps you in the face with a political agenda about inequality of wealth, health-care, and race. The whole film is also carried by really cheesy dialogue that is quite laughable at times.I'm just going to start out by saying that I think Jodie Foster is comically dreadful. I remember when she is first on screen and delivers her lines, my girlfriend and I look at each other with confused looks. Foster is way too over dramatic with the way she delivers her lines and facial expressions. She literally pauses after every other word. And what kind of accent or should I ask accents is she speaking with? Her movements are stiff and robotic like. Foster is a bad actress by any means, but holy sh*t, she's unwatchable in this. Matt Damon is decent in the film. He does what he's hired to do and shows some emotion, which is nice, but nothing special. I don't have anything to say about Alice Braga besides, bland. Now, Sharlto Copley has by far the best performance out of everyone, but I still don't like him in the film. Copley disappears into his one dimensional character. His performance is very much a caricature, but that voice, that voice! My best, yet poorly way to describe his voice in the film is like a high pitched Australian Grouch from Sesame Street. I was annoyed from beginning to end. I almost forgot, Diego Luna is my favorite part of the whole film and he only has like 15 minutes of screen time. I think he has the best performance and most likable character. He connection emotionally with me without any character development, weird. Maybe I'm in love with the actor.I saw Elysium with three other people and we all left the theater joking about how bad it is. At least we got $10 worth of laughs out Elysium, right?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved this film and I'll be following Blomkamp from now on,"Can't tell you how great it is to see someone capable of filling Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's shoes! Blomkamp has made the best movie yet this year. I was intrigued by District 9. It made me think, but this self-assured and skillfully crafted effort is taking his game to a much higher level.It's been a long time since I was in awe of both the script and the direction. To see they both came from one guy, Neill Blomkamp, is wonderful if a little unnerving. Do we really have to rely on foreigners for biting social commentary?This film is much more clever than most reviewers are letting on. One reviewer said it's a bit melodramatic, but, frankly, I don't see a subtle treatment getting to first base with most Americans. This puts a lot of troubling issues in sharp relief in an artful, very watchable format whereas most of the arguments about immigration, healthcare and the rich versus the poor are in dense, boring prose.I was warned that Jodie Foster's performance was marred by odd accents, but I barely noticed. I thought she depicted a kind of sharp edged conservative that should be readily recognizable. Sharlto Copley is great as a vicious soldier and Matt Damon is the likable center of the film, as called for. The supporting actors including Braga, Luna and Fichtner, to name a few, all add much to the whole enterprise.This is definitely a go see and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, including pre-teens and up.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Hollywood, stop with the shaky cam already!","Enjoyable film. Many moments where you just have to check your brain to make sure that you forgive the plot holes. Damon is great. Kruger is positively unintelligible. Do not understand how some equate this with good acting. I found him very irritating, but not in a good actor way.The contrast between earth and Elysium is stark but for God's sake, why do directors and cinematographers seem to think that shaky cam = the gritty reality of the main character's angst-y situation? LET THE ACTORS ACT IT! While I held it together this time, the film would be best served with a Dramamine for every moment they're on earth or in a fight scene. I would definitely have ranked it higher if they could have located a freaking tripod on set.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Copley should have been the leading character,"Once again Sharlto Copley steals another movie. He brings the kind of energy, intensity and focus that is totally captivating when he is on the screen. He absolutely should have been the main character in this. he would have been far more watchable than Matt Damon, who, quite honestly, is out of his depth with films like this.Jodie Foster is good as the villainess but should have had more screen time. Alice Braga is...on screen. I think that's all that can be said.Production design is excellent and the hardware is beautifully designed.The same cannot be said of the script which is underdeveloped. It feels like a first draft.Pacing is poor, some parts drag, but there are some impressive action sequences. Shaky camera work reduces their effectiveness at times but still some moments of excitement.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Funny and bloody,"You might be surprised at first, why this movie was rated R, but after watching it, you won't be. I don't want to reduce it to that though. On the other hand, I have to talk about the different accents. While it is fairly easy to understand the Spanish flavored accent, many might have issues with the south African accent from the ""District 9"" star. I myself count amongst them.Still you can't blame the movie trying to really have many religions and nationalities in it. It's also great seeing Jodie Foster in a different sort of role. Matt Damon is good as lead, though not every joke hits home. His action star status earned with Bourne gets a new refreshing Science Fiction update here though. His character tries to stay grey, though you will know where this is heading. Some I'm sure might feel troubled by the violence and moral issues though",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good example of why a heroic main character with a selfless goal is important,"Matt Damon got many more people killed in the process of trying to rescue himself. Kind of hypocritical, no?Simply put, the main character Matt Damon is early on involved in a workplace accident which virtually dooms him. With 5 days to live after a fatal dose of radiation, the plot begins. But with no other stakes than his own life, he seeks out help that might get him to Elysium, a haven for rich people with equipment that can heal you of virtually everything.So, you're supposed to root for this single man to survive while others die in the process of it, while there's billions of people on this overpopulated futuristic Earth and basically everything going on in the background looking way more bleak than Matt Damon's fate.I love the effects and 10 years later it still holds up IMO, I truly appreciate Neill Blomkamp's work, and this truly holds up.But what most of his work often lacks is a more solid plot and/or writing. This movie sadly was carried by the effects alone most of the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Elysium is an exciting, emotionally involving action-thriller.","Elysium is the most original science fiction film of this year. Writer/director Neill Blomkamp delivers a gritty and seemingly realistic vision of the future. In the year 2154 the very wealthy live on a luxurious space station called Elysium, and the poor live on an overpopulated, devastated Earth. I didn't find the setting very appealing but there's enough there for an entertaining action-thriller. Matt Damon doesn't play a typical hero. In fact, at times, I didn't feel compassion for him. This, I'm sure, was Damon's and Blomkamp's intention and by the end Max Da Costa goes through big changes. This approach is commendable but I didn't find it very interesting. Still, the ending is a triumph as Max redeems himself in a big way and manages to change the world. As a child Max gazes longingly at the picturesque space station above while dreaming of one day escaping Earth with his best friend Frey (Alice Braga). This impressive image works wonderfully in the emotionally-charged ending that will definitely make viewers think. In this way Elysium is structured similarly to Blomkamp's debut film District 9 (2009). Elysium isn't as big a triumph as District 9 but it comes very close. This time Blomkamp has a more experienced cast to work with. Jodie Foster provides a good performance as the power-hungry, cunning Jessica Delacourt. Sharlto Copley's C.M. Kruger is a rather frightening creation. Another name worth mentioning is Wagner Moura as Spider. Moura's performance turns the determined Spider into more than just a shady employer. At times he's even more sympathetic than Damon. The film's intense action sequences are aided by excellent CGI. Blomkap's talent for showing inventive weaponry and striking visuals is again present in Elysium. Moreover, just as in District 9, there's a good underlying political message. In this sharp disparity between wealthy and poor one man can make a difference. In conclusion, with Elysium Blomkamp delivers another innovative satisfying science fiction film that's well worth seeing. I definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Middling Sci-Fi with great production value,"What Neill Blomkamp does really well with Elysium is creating the world that the story takes place in. Both Earth and Elysium are stunningly realised with great visual effects and production design. There was clearly a lot of care and attention put into this and it immerses you into the world extremely well.However, the story for me is one that's just fine. It could have explored its ideas and concepts in a lot more detail but overall its paced well enough to keep it mostly engaging.The characters are also rather bland, except for Sharlto Copley who is hilariously over the top as the villain Kruger and appears to be having a lot of fun in the role. Matt Damon's Max didn't interest me unfortunately and the line delivery of other characters range from fine to poor on most occasions.In the end there is a lot of potential here, but I feel Blomkamp did a much better job with his first film District 9.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved everything about this except the STORY,"Elysium has amazing aesthetic, excellent cinematography, realistic effects, a fun villain, and very amateur writing (that stupid healing pod).Elysium does cyberpunk really well. The dirt, gritty, futuristic feel of this movie is done super well. It felt a lot like cyberpunk 2077, and I mean that as a compliment. The concept of having advanced tech and extreme squalor is mixed pretty well. I do think the city of LA should've looked more like the megacity from Dredd but that's just me being picky. Overall this is pulls off dystopian cyberpunk just right.Some of the shots in this movie are masterfully done. There are a couple tracking shots that gave me shivers from how much I liked them. Additionally the slow-mo shots were done just right where they weren't overused. There are some more generic scenes early on but when the cinematography is needed it shows up.The special effects are super good too. The robots use really good motion capture and are very nice to look at. The vehicle designs are a good mix of brutalist, sleek, or militaristic which adds to the wider feel of the world. The ring of Elysium is cool looking as well (not sure of the physics that allow it to have an open top but I suspended disbelief for that little detail). The view of Elysium from earth is really well done too.Kruger is a really fun villain to watch. His South African slang and his two cronies work with him expertly, you can feel the history between these guys and their shared psychopathy. These guys are truly bad guys and pretty much irredeemable, which I usually find kind of annoying, but they are so enjoyable to watch I think it makes up for it.The only thing I don't like about this movie is how awful the writing is. The characters are not very nuanced at all. The bad guys are bad simply for the sake of being bad. The good guys have really cliché motives and story beats are pretty predictable. It's just overall a very underwhelming story experience, and to make it worse it uses one of the worst writing tropes. Let me rant about the stupid healing technology.For some reason the people on Elysium have access to healing technology that can heal you from pretty much anything instantly. That sort of thing is very dangerous to put when there are almost no rules to it. In Elysium the only rule to the healing pod is you need to be a citizen and your brain needs to be intact. They provide no reason why this technology doesn't exist on earth, especially because it's the primary reason that people want to go to Elysium. Overall this seemingly small detail kinda destroys the concept that any of the people on Elysium are actual characters and not just NPCs. The healing pod is a McGuffin but it's a bad McGuffin.I understand that this whole story is an allegory to immigration in our current society but this film is written like a young adult fiction novel. The story is dumb, it's not thought out, and because of that the universe as a whole doesn't work, which sucks because everything else in this movie does work really well.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not District 9, but still not bad","Most of the great works of science fiction take place on a spaceship, another planet, or in the case of the new Neil Blomkamp film, a dystopian future where instead of a wall separating two countries, it's the space between a diseased-ridden Earth and the distant but visible Mercedes-Benz logo looking space station, ""Elysium"".On Elysium the haves, have it all, beautiful houses, beautiful children, and even little MRI machines that cure whatever ails you, be it broken arm or life-threatening disease. The have-nots back on Earth live a hard life not to dissimilar from the one that Blomkamp portrayed in his previous film, the fantastic ""District 9"". Instead of the oppressed aliens in Johannesburg, this time it's a whole planet. On this Earth, in the ruins of L.A. in the year 2154 lives Max (Matt Damon) an ex-con with the heart of gold, which we're told in way too many flashbacks that he is special. On Elysium Jodie Foster runs the show as a government official who keeps the floating paradise safe by killing all who try to enter.When all too convenient circumstances bring Damon and Foster in opposition the movie really picks up, with a few stops to introduce Alice Braga's character and fits her and her story like a familiar puzzle piece into the narrative. That is the major drawback on the film aside from the constant reminders of rich is bad and poor is good, is that everything feels all too convenient. Characters who all know each other or who only have one degree of separation between the main cast. Plus if you know sci-fi, or even movie logic, you will see everywhere the movie takes you well before you get there.The performances keep you engaged enough, mostly though through the slightly 'off' character Kruger played fittingly by Sharlto Copley. What really stood out to me was the world building and the incredible, I mean really incredible visuals. From the robot police to the simple 30- plus year effect of a ship flying in space, the visual effects artists really made a beautiful looking film. Writer/Director Blomkamp still needs some work on his storytelling and his fight scenes. Or maybe he shouldn't have got the steady-cam crew from Damon's ""Bourne"" movies to shoot a lot of his action.The classics of sci-fi almost always have some sort of social commentary as told through a fictional prism. Who we are, what we are capable of, what we can do to ourselves as well as one another in a society with rules that are followed blindly. Unfortunately ""Elysium"" is not one of those destined to be a classic, but it reminds you of the potential these types of films still have and gives me hope that Blomkamp can give us another one with his next film.--Robert L.

I Enjoyed It While I Watched It!,"ElysiumOverall I enjoyed this movie while I watched it but with hindsight it was less than satisfactory.In any dystopian/sci-fi movie there must be an inner logic and rational that drives the story. If the basic reasoning fails then the viewer feels cheated and it just becomes style over substance. Elysium was created by the ruling elite to escape over population on the earths surface. As a wealthy enclave, not unlike the Bahamas, it became an aspirational place to live.But then the idea went all wrong, to make everyone a citizen of Elysium was absurd as 20 billion people cannot live on a space station. Not to mention that number of non-contributory people would destroy the very thing they aspired to. The script then side stepped this logical outcome and made the movie about access to healthcare, when healthcare preserves life when the population of the planet needed reducing by 50%.Matt Damon was good as was everyone but we had some repeated action sequences that became far fetched. Lastly the mixture of child minding and soldiering never works as these occupy different worlds and it just never works. James Bond changing a nappy, no, no, no!Overall it a firm 6 outta 10 but with some tweaking this could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining fantasy action!,"'Elysium' is often unfairly compared to 'District 9'. Maybe because its the same director? Maybe because it once again stars Sharlto Copley with an identical accent and dialogue to that in 'District 9'? However, 'Elysium' is a film in its own right and should be viewed - and reviewed - as such.'Elysium' so well illustrates the great divide between rich and poor - regardless of circumstance - and the unsympathetic attitude of those in power. The film certainly sends out a powerful message, but I don't believe it to be propaganda. It simply makes a statement.Matt Damon is good as always - provided the script is good, which it is. Sharlto Copley, who played the hero in 'District 9', stars as the antagonist, Kruger, and does a mighty fine job - and is also in great shape, if I may say. Jodie Foster stars as the ambitious, self-centered Delacourt. As good an actress as she is, I didn't find her believable in this film. Her actions and dialogue were repetitive.The film takes a bit of time in the beginning setting up the main character, Max (Matt Damon) and the dilemma he finds himself in. It is very interesting, though, and provides the drive force behind the character, and made me root for him all the way - and the cause he stood for.As we discover just how corrupt the people in power is, the film slowly but surely builds to a climax. I was highly impressed with the third act, which delivered stunning action sequences, and was fast-paced. Talk about saving the best for last! This final act was really exciting with plenty of firepower and great fight scenes. Sharlto Copley gave it his all during this act, as did Damon.'Elysium' is a thrilling fantasy action adventure. I enjoyed it!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The future's a bloody mess, literally","Neill Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" is far more flawed than his debut ""District 9"", yet it is still skillful summer entertainment and a worthy continuation of the thematic backdrop that Blomkamp has set in the latter - futuristic social inequality. This film however takes the quote ""the rich get richer and the poor get poorer"" to orbital heights, literally, as the eponymous 2001-esque space colony gets filled to the brim with the wealthy while the rest of the poor folks gets damned on a vastly overpopulated Earth. Here in Los Angeles, a criminal named Max (Damon) struggles to board Elysium after a freak accident, while corruption and paranoia seethes through Elysium official Delacourt (Foster).This social commentary on whether society is doomed by their own doing is used as a clothesline for frenetic sequences of violent action, all combined to form one feature-length race against time for the underdog to triumph over all. Thing is, the underdog has to face an even crazier dog, a disgruntled and psychopathic mercenary named Kruger hired by Delacourt to off Max for, um, doing good stuff. Sharlto Copley, the flawed protagonist in Blomkamp's previous effort, plays a despicable and barbaric villain so well here that he's in danger of being typecast as such, as opposed to Matt Damon who can play an action hero in his sleep. Even when Damon suits up in a clunky brain-controlled exo-skeleton following the accident, we root for him because he's a clear underdog that the audience supports.Blomkamp's screenplay is flawed, with certain gaps of physical logic here and there, and the story seems cobbled from previous superior sci- fi classics. But where his screenplay fails, it's his direction and vision that delivers. Blomkamp successfully materializes two different worlds - rich and poor - in technical aspects, and presents them as a black-and-white prophecy. Gritty scenes in the L.A. slums on Earth are compelling to watch when compared starkly to the spectacular-looking utopia-like Elysium. Any space colony that can rebuild exploded faces is a colony worth living on, no? It must've been a challenge for production designer Philip Ivey to come up with concepts for both sides, but he succeeds.Which brings me to the other factor - the action sequences, and Blomkamp delivers thoroughly on that aspect. Frantic action sequences mixed with crowd-pleasing and squeamish moments made me realize - here is a modern- day filmmaker who knows action, and what his audience wants and keeps on that promise. In my opinion they were far more exhilarating and refreshing to watch than any other movie this summer, as they provide no shortage of old school bloody thrills - and I do mean bloody.""Elysium"" may be flawed and familiar story-wise as it should have been half an hour longer with more scenes set in the colony, but it still has a thought-provoking concept and enough action to vastly satisfy both the popcorn crowd and the action crowd. This is a summer blockbuster that delivers.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another superlative slice of sci-fi action,"When South African director Neill Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 came out, it blew me away. Never before had I seen an inventive and intricate storyline mixed with mind-blowingly realistic special effects work and some hard-hitting and heavyweight action scenes. It's still one of my favourite movies of all time, so I was understandably excited by the prospect of this follow-up.And ELYSIUM doesn't disappoint. It's a straightforward action thriller in which both good guys and bad are clearly delineated; it lacks the novelty and scope of Blomkamp's previous movie but it more than makes up for that with its full-blooded action and overriding sense of energy. Once again, the sci-fi special effects are remarkable - this is CGI as it should be employed, as it's completely realistic and never lacking.Matt Damon can handle the action stuff readily enough - anyone who's seen the Bourne trilogy can tell you that - and Blomkamp assembles a stellar supporting cast to back him up. William Fichtner is a delightfully weaselly bad guy and Jodie Foster an effective political foe, but it's Sharlto Copley who really shines as the OTT main villain, Kruger. It's a complete turnaround from his quiet, mild-mannered turn in DISTRICT 9, and both he and the viewer have a ball with it.ELYSIUM builds up a real sense of excitement and palpable tension as the story progresses, and the script never lets you down either; once again, there's plenty of subtext to enjoy. This film could well be thought of as an advert for 'Obamacare'. The action sequences employ shaky-cam to good effect, and it's nice to see that Blomkamp hasn't toned the bloody violence down either. No, it's no DISTRICT 9, but it comes close and is one of the best sci-fi movies of recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Elysium isn't the Paradise of Movies, but it's Solid Entertainment","Is Elysium the masterpiece of thought-provoking sci-fi cinema of 2013? No. Is it the masterpiece of action and spectacle of 2013? No. Is it terrible or a total letdown? No.And given that, it's a much more entertaining 'thinker' sci-fi than Oblivion, which was really trying too hard and overstuffed with convenient clichéd or fortuitous plot devices. In comparison, the only similar type of plot device that made me really groan was the defense mechanisms of the Elysium space station: a rather laughable construct used just to force the allegory of today's illegal immigration problems in the USA.Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley give strong performances as opposing characters. For the most part (except for a couple of brief scenes), continuity is maintained well for the deteriorating state of Damon's character's health. Their first battle has exhilarating staging.Personally, I really enjoyed Jodie Foster's full-tilt aristocrat, but I can see where some will be turned-off by her accent and execution. I think she pulled it off.Outside of the above, and where Elysium falls down a bit, is that no one else is very memorable. There's an underground resistance leader (Diego Luna) who's solid, but a bit of a cardboard character, and William Fichtner puts in a short deliciously loathsome performance as an Elysium elitist. But, Damon's love interest, Alice Braga, is 'just there', and there is a needless subplot involving her injured daughter which really plays more as the standard abhorrent 'child in distress' cliché.While you get a glimpse of the disparity between the Haves and the Have Not's, you really don't get to see that much of the 'star of the show' (Elysium itself), and the story feels a bit empty being focused primarily on the 3 main stars. Fleshing out the plot is sacrificed for action at the end of the day. Which is not to say the movie is bad overall. It's a decent watch, and pretty stunning in an IMAX theater. It just could have been more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Elysium"" is intriguing, but gets bogged down in its own negativity.","Class warfare, health care, immigration. ""Elysium"" (R, 1:49) is an action thriller that explores all these social issues and more.Less than a century and a half in our future, the rich live in the ultimate gated community – a man-made satellite shaped like a bicycle tire, which hangs in the sky within sight, but out of reach, of the poor people of earth. Earth has become a dirty, run-down planet full of dirty, run-down people who are lucky if they have a job. Elysium is a paradise with a swimming pool in the middle of every manicured lawn. Every home is beautiful and they all have a device that looks like a cross between a tanning bed and an MRI, which can heal any citizen of Elysium of any injury or disease.Naturally, the citizens of earth want to be on Elysium and the citizens of Elysium want to keep that from happening. Whenever the citizens of earth attempt their futuristic version of a border crossing. well, they're stopped. Leading that effort is Secretary Delacourt (played by Jodie Foster) - a Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, National Security Adviser and border patrol agent all rolled into one. She's also ruthless and she talks funny. In the future, unusual accents are plentiful, but morals, not so much. Delacourt will do anything to keep Elysium pure and secure, while people like Matt Damon's character, Max, yearn, and sometimes really NEED to ""get up there"".When Max suffers a serious accident at work, he knows that getting to Elysium for medical attention is his only chance for survival. The same need exists with a little girl, the daughter of a childhood friend of Max. Max knows someone who can get him to Elysium, but only if Max does something for his ""friend"" in the process. And that ""something"" could turn out to be a game-changer for everyone in this Orwellian morality play.There's a lot going on in ""Elysium"". Maybe too much. Incorporating so many social issues into the plot makes the film feel cluttered. The condition of earth and its people is portrayed with an nearly overwhelming grittiness and the ""every man for himself"" mentality of almost all the characters is pretty depressing. The story is interesting and the action is exciting to watch, but I would call other aspects of the film. too much of a good thing. ""B""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Rich Whites Ruin Earth Like They Ruin Everything,"If I were to stereotype today's leftist liberal thinking, I couldn't do better than this movie: Wealthy whites (bad; wealthy whites are always bad, except when they vote for Obama) deserted earth (white flight; isn't that what bad rich whites always do?) to live on a space station called Elysium (white suburb or gated community), and the hispanics (except for white hero Matt Damon), get to live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. Secretary Rhodes, an evil white lady (why must the evil ones always be white?), will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve, protect and defend the white people of Elysium. That doesn't stop the hispanic (code for good but exploited) people of Earth from trying to get in, by any means they can. When unlucky Max (the token non-evil white person on earth) takes on the task ( like good white man Tarzan) of saving the good (non-white) people of earth. _________________________ It's a testament to the stupidity of the average moviegoer that so many have bought this simplistic BS.

"Great Graphics, average story but decent execution","Elysium is a science fiction action movie directed by Neill Blomkamp and stars Matt Damon, Sharlto Copley, Jodie Foster and Alice BragaSet up in 2154 the movie shows us a horrifying future with a huge gap between the poor and rich with poor being living on an over populated, depleted, sick and ruined earth and the rich living on an ultra luxury space station.The movie has a unique plot but the execution ruins the play as the movie couldn't capitalize on it's unique storyline and becomes the same predictable 'one man will bring the change' type of movie.Acting is either at par or below par as despite of having a strong and talented stars none of them was able to make any mark. Matt Damon and Jodie Foster is also wasted.Screenplay is good but gets slow in between, the movie also looses grip in between. Screenplay could've been much crisper.

How to Get a Nice Beard Trim,"I love a good sci-fi movie. Even in ones with preposterous scenarios, if the film-makers can find ways to make it credible or can display some cleverness in the presentation, I'll buy in. It's called suspension of disbelief. I had some hope for ""Elysium"", because the idea of a giant, floating space wheel where .01 per cent of the ""other half"" lives really stirred my imagination. Mind you, I had some questions about its atmosphere and the sun's lethal radiation in space, but these vital scientific issues were never touched upon. Other reviewers on this site have effectively lambasted the film for its suspect science, so I'll merely recap by saying: The film-makers seem to think that if they just show it the audience will believe it.I'd like to zero in on those cure-all medical pods in the movie. The door opens, you place the sick person inside, the door closes, the machine diagnoses the problem and - presto! - the person is cured. It works for leukemia, severed limbs and faces that have been torn off (and I swear that the face in question grew back without acne scars or grey hairs in the beard - yes, a finely trimmed beard grew back, too!). This isn't science, or science-fiction. It's magic. It occurred to me that with such magical medical machines all over the place this could have been a movie about immortality. Because you could certainly cure death.I expect more from a big-budget movie in an age bristling with scientific knowledge. Fifty years ago this type of cheese would have seemed pretty nifty, but not under present-day circumstances. It's not even a well-made movie, with its choppy pacing and inability to allow the audience to inhabit any of the physical spaces it shows on screen. Poor Matt barely gets a chance to breathe let alone develop a character; and then there's Jodie Foster, who practically bellows her lines and wears a facial expression that suggests rectal discomfort. Maybe she should try one of those magic pods.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's the future of our current world,"I watched Elysium years ago, and it's one of those types of films that sticks in one's mind. Especially given current world events and the general trajectory of the world economy and demography.I find it amusing to read Americans' reviews of this film, in all their varying faculties of English. Decrying it as improbable and boring socialist propaganda. Meanwhile every European is nodding along whilst watching the film. After all, as capital continues to accrue to the fewer and fewer: first the top 1%, then the top 0.1%, top 0.01%, and so on, this film presents a very real extrapolation of our current world.Space technology becomes mature, yet the energy cost of escaping the planet's gravity well is beyond the reach of 99.99999% of the world's population. The elite minority want to live in a clean paradise, yet don't mind polluting and destroying the planet on which they no longer depend.Elysium presents a possible future of our corporate-led globalization and unregulated capitalism.

Solid Sci-Fi Flick with to much unwarranted hate,"I honestly wasn't a massive fan of District 9 but was intrigued by this movie as it seemed to have an interesting plot and one of my favourite actors Matt Damon in it. While it's definitely flawed Elysium is a solid action flick and well directed by Neill Blomkamp. Matt Damon was great in this movie he was really good in the action scenes and his motivations were very good and clear. Shartlo Copley was fantastic in this movie one of the best movie villains of 2013 he was just insane and extremely entertaining to watch. The CGI was very good especially during the space sequences as it looked very real just like the action in the movie. The future is very well done it just looks like an awful place to live and they really sold that in this movie and really sold the paradise that was Elysium. The problem is they never bother to explain the future how the world got so desolated and the origins of Elysium. While Copley was fantastic in the movie Jodie Foster was not there was just nothing to her character, her accent was strange and out of place and she had no understandable motivations. While is definitely a flawed movie I really like Elysium and Blomkamp was do hard on himself with this movie and I really don't want him to give up now.

This thought-provoking action SF film is a metaphor.,"This futuristic film presents us with a dystopian vision of a future Earth which is overpopulated and polluted. There is however also a utopia, 'Elysium', which orbits Earth and is the home of a rich elite who have had it built and now have a carefree existence living there.Film opens with shots of a young boy who bears a remarkable resemblance to Matt Damon the star of this film. Earth has been in a bad state all of his life and his desire is to go to Elysium. People on earth do go to Elysium though. However they do this illegally. If they pay enough money to the people-smugglers they get taken on craft that fly illegally to the artificial world and sneak in.Trying to stop the illegal immigrants and deal with other security matters, are the security personnel. They are human and robotic, and are based, and act, on both Earth and Elysium.Matt Damon plays the part of a simple worker, luckier than most of his unemployed fellow neighbours living in the slum, an ex-criminal who has now turned his back on crime. However his life and work are both hard and dangerous. Life on Earth is cheap, and unlike on Elysium, by contrast the medical services are poor.Worker Damon suffers an industrial injury that requires treatment and is the plot device that requires him to travel to Elysium. There is a plan to get him there but things don't work out as planned.In some ways this film reminded this reviewer of 'Demolition Man'. In this futuristic film, just like 'DM', the people are politely nasty. They are abrupt, rude and very plain-speaking, but all this is done in a very polite way of speaking. Some of the time anyway.Casting has been done in such a way as to emphasize the points that the story is trying to make. The people of Earth inhabit slums and shanty-towns. They look like poor immigrants and peasants anywhere. By contrast up in Elysium the people look and sound very different. Accents and language also play a part in illustrating this.Earth is crime-ridden and covered in graffiti, whilst Elysium is a peaceful haven. So for Elysium to be protected from the violent gun-wielding people of Earth, Elysium must also use some violence for protection. This requires not just robots, but also human security and military personnel. These military operatives, and their world, and outlook, are portrayed well, and stereotypical casting and accent choices make their attitudes and role unambiguous to the viewer. They also function in this film to pose the question to the viewer of the role of the military in society.Star Matt Damon gives a great performance in his role as a simple worker. However some of the decisions of our simple worker do not impress. His judgements are a little too simple and he makes some bad decisions. Damon is well supported by a good cast. The great Jodie Foster has second billing, however her character is strange and even stranger is how the film-makers have used Miss Foster. A powerful performance came from Sharlto Copley who dominated in every scene he was in. This reviewer was happy too, to see William Fichtner, a well-recognized face, that this reviewer last saw giving a tremendous performance in 'Heat'.With all the robots, this film reminded this reviewer of 'Oblivion' from earlier this year. There was a similar theme of a dirty Earth below and a shiny top-world. However this film is somewhat less unoriginal. Some scenes also reminded this reviewer of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' another film from earlier this year. However unlike that film this seemed less of just a collection of action scenes, though dumb decisions by characters did cause some of that.The film set up the hero to have some serious fights with a seriously bad guy. Just like 'Demolition Man', sadly however, some fight scenes were filmed in such a way that it was difficult to even see what was happening, they were that fast. Special effects concerning the gadgets were all uniformly good. The high-tech gear, the low-tech salvaged gear, the flying machines; all were totally believable throughout the film. One item that jarred was the total absence of background music. Instead we were attacked by very loud music that was far too intrusive. On the other hand, all scenes, sets and locations were good, particularly of the grim cities of Earth.Better than the comparable 'Oblivion', it is on a par with 'Star Trek Into Darkness' and 'World War Z'. Rather like 'WWZ', the narrative of this film gives us comparisons with present day Earth and it's problems, and poses the question at what cost can you build a utopia, when is the cost too high, and how do you balance the rights and duties of the people within the utopia, with the rights and duties to those who are outside of it? 8/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Very good and worth watching movie,"I must say that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, even though many comments on the internet said it is not so worth watching. I'm still wondering what people disliked so much about the movie because I really liked it and wasn't disappointed at all - my expectations were fulfilled and I enjoyed every moment of Elysium.The movie kept me on edge of my seat since its beginning to the end, it made me hold my breath few times while watching it and I can't remember a moment when I was bored - the story was fluent and kept me interested in it for the whole screening. It was shorter than most movies today, 109 minutes may seem to be not enough for a huge movie like this but I'm glad it's not longer - as I said before, the story evolved and had no 'lazy' and uninteresting moments, it didn't concentrate on unimportant details and told only things that were needed.There was so much to look at, so much to experience - visual effects and the environment/surroundings were amazing, camera work very good, soundtrack stunning (I can't stop listening to it since seeing the movie), and actors did a great work too. It's one of the best sci-fi movies I've recently seen and I can recommend to everyone to go and see it.I liked that the main characters weren't perfect examples of bravery or leadership or whatever comes to your mind when you say a 'perfect human being', they were quite natural and believable. Matt Damon's Max was selfish and maybe a bit coward too at the beginning of the movie. Jodie Foster's Delacourt maybe seemed to care only about good and peaceful life on Elysium, but she also thought about her own career and own interests. Max wasn't only a hero and Delacourt wasn't only a villain, they were humans with both good and bad in them.In my opinion, the whole crew made an excellent movie that is definitely worth watching. One point down from total 10 for few cliché moments that seem to sneak into every (even the best) movie nowadays - those clichés for me include this story of little kid Max who promised to take everyone to Elysium or the farewell scene with sad music on the background and typical 'I'm-sorry-goodbye-speech'.To sum up, the movie left me astonished when it ended up and yes, I consider it to be a very good movie ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sponsored by Obamacare and Obama Immigration,"This contains some spoilers.In the future Earth is overpopulated, polluted and dying. To keep the human race alive a new planet (space station) is created. To create it you need the people that are intelligent and you need the people with money to fund it.

So this new planet Elysium looks amazing and their citizens are healthy. Earth can't offer much to their citizens. The people from the poor planet want to get to the rich planet. The rich planet can't support people that can't contribute and know it would be their downfall so they protect their borders. The poor planet fakes citizen I.D. and tries to cross the new planets borders because they want what they have.

Blonkamp should stick to directing this next one,"I couldn't decide whether to give this a 6 or a 7. Either way this film has its strengths and has its weaknesses. It all just eventually cancels out to the point where there really isn't a score to rank it. It isn't a good movie, but at the end it isn't a very bad one either. Neil Blonkamp is probably one of my top ten contemporary directors. Props for him for finding an original, solid story to satisfy moviegoers. However, it can only satisfy. The characters are a little flat, except for Sharlto Copley's (which I will get to later), it gets to the point where some of these are screaming to be noticed before they're thrown to the side. I liked the three leads though, Matt Damon gives a strong performance as always. I was pretty surprised where Jodie Foster went, this is definitely a change of pace for her, and I really don't know what to think. Sharlto Copley was the stand out for this film. He hasn't been in much since his flop The A-Team, but this guy has range. I'm excited to hear that he's doing some more stuff this year. The effects I thought were outstanding. I know that its pretty much expected these days that effects have to be great in films, but in my opinion these are probably one of the best ones this year.

Neill Blomkamp - King of the half-baked popcorn action sci-fi.,"Neill Blomkamp plummeted to the movie-event scene in 2009 with the interesting-concept, blandly-executed District 9. Sure, the first act is quite good with its documentary style of exposition, but then it gets tiring, realises that and awkwardly abandons it for an action movie instead. Nevertheless, on rewatch, Sharlto Copley is the one that holds it together so I'm quite glad he rejoins Blomkamp again for Elysium, this time as the antagonist where I'm still not sure he belongs. In the lead, a more experienced action actor, Matt Damon, who's always reliable in this type of role bringing a sense of humour to an otherwise humourless film and a sincerity to his pain and struggle. However, although Blomkamp wisely decides not to paint himself in a corner and start with a certain style and fizzle out again, opting for an all-out action style, it doesn't feel like a fully fleshed out world and just a high concept.It's a world where characters often make decisions that are obviously designed to put themselves in danger. It's quite frustratingly contrived to get to where it wants to go and its on-the-nose comments on shared healthcare across classes is almost cringeworthy in its sentimental and overly simple execution. While Jodie Foster is getting the biggest bad rap for how misguided the way the Elysium residents were directed, the real criminals are the dreadful over-the-top performances from William Fichtner and Wagner Moura. But still, the special effects are rather exciting, which is an aspect District 9 is also undoubtedly notable for, and it is an entertaining film when you stop trying to think about it too much. Nevertheless, I'm sure Neill Blomkamp will enjoy his crown as the King of half-baked popcorn sci-fi as his ambitions don't seem to stretch much further.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The contrasting uber-polarization between rich and poor was made to be so obvious, particularly with the rich having a machine that instantly fixes any health issue - and somehow the poor run a space program - that it is simply childish and unbelievable. The director obviously had dough for proved talent Matt Damon and plenty of special effects, but it just doesn't add up to anything. The villain is an absolute annoying joke - and I guess villains are to be hated - but maybe not for the reasons I did, which was: ""Why can't I take this guy seriously?"" and ""I hate the sound of this guy's voice"". And unfortunately the villain isn't the only annoying thing about this movie: the entire thing is torture comparable to a steaming pile of poo held under your nose for over an hour. The movie can't end soon enough, and the director and all actors involved should be punished severely for unleashing this abomination unto the world.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worth waiting for,"In 2009, a new talent burst on the cinematic scene in the form of writer and director Neill Bllomkamp, a South African living in Canada, who gave us the startlingly original and political science fiction movie ""District 9"", a bitingly satirical take on apartheid South Africa. It's taken him four years to come up with his follow-up work, another sci-fi project, but it wipes the floor with the other genre offerings of this summer ""After Earth"" and ""Oblivion"".This time the setting is an over-populated and environmentally ravaged Los Angeles in 2154 (the same year as ""Avatar""). In classical mythology, Elysium was the home of the blessed after death; in this film, it is a space station where the ultra-rich escape the crime and ill-health of Earth. The head of security at the station is the icy Delacourt played by Jodie Foster and the person who is trying to break into this Brave New World is ex-con, now radiation worker Max portrayed by Matt Damon with shaven head, exo-skeleton and a brain full of code. Delacourt's special agent and Max's intended nemesis, the ferocious Kruger, sees the return of South African Sharlto Copley from ""District 9"".Comparing BlomKamp's two films, both use the genre of sci-fi to make political points, this time the scourge of inequality and the injustice of immigration control. The difference between the works is the budget: an estimated $30M has become an estimated $115M which means bigger stars and bigger special effects, so ""Elysium"" looks great - especially in IMAX - but the plotting is somewhat simplistic and the conclusion overly sentimental.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, could have been great","This movie is very successful on one level, a flop on another. As a high octane, action based sci-fi thriller, it is great. The visuals and special effects are some of the best I have ever seen, it is well acted, and has tons of heart-stopping action sequences. Its downfall is that it takes itself too seriously, and tries make a social statement. The parallels between the inhabitants of a future destitute LA (mostly Chicano) trying to gain citizenship in the prosperous (mostly white) world of Elysium, are so obvious they are laughable. Its like something you would expect a high school student to come up with if they were given an assignment to write a story outlining the evils of our society. Very superficial and shallow. I wont give spoilers, but I don't really have to - you know how it is going to end after about the first 30 minutes.On the other hand, even though I knew what the eventual outcome would be, I didn't know how we would get there, and the ride along the way is a lot of fun. I was thoroughly entertained for 2 hours, was never once bored, and was often on the edge of my seat. And who says every movie has to have a ""message""? If you are looking for something deep that makes you think about social issues in another way, save your money. If you are looking for two hours of solid escapist fun and entertainment, I highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The sci fi aspect of the movie is good, but its social and political message is ridiculous","The sci fi part of the movie is really successful. Space stations, mechs, human-mech interference. In fact, 3D printer-style health technology is a really nice and new idea. But equality by throwing around the limited resources of a dystopian world. This is a pointless and absurdly naive plot. What will happen next? The limited resources available will be exhausted and will not be enough for anyone. The existing order will be disrupted and the poor will continue to suffer. However, if you don't think too deeply and watch it for the mecha battle, it can be enjoyable. Sharlto Copley is the secret star of the movie with his villain performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Avoid the Imax experience on this one...,"If you enjoy Blomkamp's sci fi visual eye candy from his other movies and short films, then this film will not disappoint. I would not recommend the Imax experience for this one since the shaky cam is overwhelming in that setting (and i usually don't complain about shaky cam). The story is highly political involving themes of healthcare, immigration, and homeland security with a slant favoring liberalism. LA now looks like a third world slum with gang graffiti in every nook and cranny. Also, the Jason Bourne comes out of Matt Damon in the fight scenes which is always fun to watch. Doesn't have the same emotional punch as District 9, but a decent addition to the genre. 7/10 is what I would rate it personally. The visual effects alone are worth the price of admission on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fans of ""District 9"" will find ""Elysium"" similar but with an added emphasis on fast-paced action sequences and gore","In ancient Greek mythology, Elysium refers to a place where mortals related to, or who were favoured by, the gods were allowed to enter in afterlife, where they would never grow old and lived there doing whatever they please. Following this idea of a paradise, the Elysium in the movie is a manmade satellite containing the wealthy upper class, where they are free of illness, and lead generally pleasure-seeking lifestyles on the station. In contrast, the working class is forced to toll on the overpopulated and polluted Earth. The government plays god in this futuristic dystopia, as they decide who is qualified to be on Elysium. Within the government, the Secretary of Defence, Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster), spearheads the harsh treatment of illegal immigrants from Earth to protect Elysium from running out of resources.""Elysium"" is director Neill Blomkamp's second full-length feature film, after ""District 9"", which was a critical and commercial success. There are several similarities between both films, such as the long overhead shots showcasing a birds' eye view of the terrain, the theme of suppression and the character development of the protagonist.That said, those expecting ""Elysium"" to be entirely similar to ""District 9"" would be disappointed. The use of shaky cam, fast cuts and multiple scene changes worked in ""District 9"", capturing the attention of the audience. ""Elysium"" tries to use a similar method to engage the audience, with the shaky cam to portray a first-hand experience, while presenting the fight scenes through rapid cuts from different angles. Furthermore, while ""District 9"" took a long time to build up to the climax, 'Elysium' sped things up with faster and more frequent fight sequences. Despite the fast pace, the audience was left feeling more disorientated than engaged. The large amount of time dedicated to the fight sequences also led to a hurried character development of Max Da Costa (Matt Damon).As expected, the character with the most development is Max. Max Da Costa is a factory worker and an ex-convict who seems to be perpetually under parole. An accidental radiation exposure leaves Max with five days to live, and he becomes hell-bent on getting to Elysium for a cure. This desperation led to Max ignoring Spider (Wagner Moura) and Frey's (Alice Braga) attempts to convince Max to put others in front of him. It was only until upon reaching Elysium when Max had a sudden change of heart, sacrificing himself for the greater good. However, this change comes off as being abrupt and it seemed as if the director was running out of time.Of the other characters in the film, Copley stands out in his role as the main villain – a South African mercenary, criminal and Delacourt's personal hit-man, Agent M. C. Kruger. Kruger is vile, capricious and lecherous, and Copley's portrayal of the role successfully leads the audience to feel repulsed yet fearful of the character.There is an overwhelming amount of violence and gore throughout the movie, and the director seemed to take every opportunity to insert blood and body parts that were blown apart. The blood and gore confronts the audience and gives a first-hand view of how violence tears apart, literally and figuratively, the society and its people.Overall, ""Elysium"" presents a possible, if unoriginal, future dystopia. The large amount of violence and gore, however, forms the bulk of the movie and distracts the audience from the main message – a warning against the continued destruction of our planet.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A science fiction moral parable,"This film which utilizes the most advanced technology for its special effects has as a core a very ancient myth. I am not writing my personal idea I just reproduce the characterization that Dimitris Bouras, the film critic of ""The Kathimerini"" newspaper in the issue of Thursday 22nd of August gave to the central hero: a Messiah leading the downtrodden to heaven/redemption- that is to Elysium. Truly it is one of the times that I agree completely with the film critic. Perhaps I should have read the critique after I had seen the movie.Briefly the plot is that in a future world human society is sharply divided between the poor masses who live in filth and the privileged rich who live in an artificial world, a satellite of Earth called Elysium, from the Greek name of the after-world where the souls of heroes dwelled- the equivalent of the Christian Paradise although the qualification for entry were different. This point is very strongly made from the first instance of the film. It follows a long line of dystopian fiction such as ""The Time Machine"" by Wells, ""The Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley, ""1984"" by George Orwell, the science fiction comic ""The Incal"" by Jean Giraud(Moebius) and Alejandro Jodorowsky and also the theories of many theorists of oligarchical rule in the 20th century such as Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca and Michels-even James Burnham. It is also based on the experience of a great part of human recorded history which witnessed a great cleavage between the ruling class and the popular masses.This perennial theme is set in a not so distant future and with a cast of characters that E.M. Forster would term flat: The central hero, an orphan raised by nuns, a semi-criminal type and factory worker who after a terrible accident follows a path that leads him to martyrdom and the saving of the poor- thus confirming the prophecy of a nun that he would achieve great things despite his humble background- in the same sense that Jesus Christ did- although in his case he expiated the sins of others not of himself; the ruthless defense secretary of Elysium that does anything to safeguard the interests of the rich and advance her personal ambition; the sadistic and vicious undercover agent that is illegally hired by the powerful, is dumped by them and then betrays them in his turn as all self-respecting mercenaries do. And some other characters less or more sympathetic that fill the canvas of this predictable and simplistic movie.But I have to point out that it is not a bad movie. Many people accuse it for being naive but frankly class hatred and political oppression are pretty black and white concepts and most people in history have experienced them in such a manner. Sophisticates and intellectuals may complain here but one must not rationalize too much. When sources are divided very unequally hatred and chaos follow and one does not need the theories of Jurgen Habermas or Noam Chomsky to state the obvious. Yes the movie is as subtle as a tone of bricks falling on your head as a reviewer wrote but it is a movie and not a sociological treatise. And as we know political and religious myths are more powerful motors of history than the writings of learned intellectuals.Briefly speaking if you are conversant with Christian mythology and modern dystopian fiction and you love visual and sound effects go and see this film. If you want sophisticated descriptions of modern social problems and are offended by the idea that the poor are good and the rich evil then don't go.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable action romp/blunt force political allegory,"Elysium is the second feature length effort from Neill Blomkamp whose District 9 was a brilliant debut that covered many of the socio- political issues present in Elysium with a dose more subtlety. It must be said that Elysium is never boring as music cues and startling shots of the space station thingy and an overpopulated Los Angeles do a great job of establishing a back story sans dialogue. However, as effective with pacing as the film can be it has an over-reliance on musical cues during emotional moments and a heady use of metaphors in the dialogue that don't give the audience much credit when it comes to connecting the dots.My gripes with the heavy handedness aside, projects such as this that set out to insert messages about other political issues such as overpopulation within the confines of a studio system is something worth commending. These issues may often fall by the wayside as the focus is often drawn to fetishizing the action into making it look as cool as possible, but the action never fully dilutes the political messages and remain quite cool to watch.I wasn't a huge fan of the gutter mouthed Sharlto Copley as the antagonist who's over the top nature and South African accent shone a light on how bad some of his dialogue was. Added to this I found his dialogue so riddled with swear words that my fragile ears could simply not permit it outside of the context of a dockworker stubbing his toe.Matt Damon's performance was one of my personal favourite's I've seen from him and the film had me pondering issues and stuff during and after the run time which is damn fine value for $12 on a student discount. I'd recommend seeing Elysium, but there's a lingering sense that it could have been executed far better in some easy to fix areas.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pass the Popcorn review,"I saw Matt Damon's newest movie – Elysium. I had great expectations, and I was curious to see this movie since it was directed and written by District 9′s director and writer Neill Blomkamp. Elysium reminds very much of that awesome movie and it has an interesting story and a good cast, so I think it was natural to suppose, and hope, that Elysium would have been District 9′s worthy successor. Unfortunately, this movie was a pretty big disappointment – and even if you decide to ignore the existence of District 9 and don't compare the two, it remains a bad movie. Also, I would have loved to see Ninja of Die Antwoord play the main role, but he turned the director's offer down.Matt Damon plays Max, a young man living on Earth in the year 2154: our planet is polluted, unsafe, filled with criminals and poor people who hope to one day get to Elysium, a man-made space station where all the wealthy people of Earth have moved and where they can live forever thanks to special medical machines. The rich would do anything to stop the poor from getting to Elysium, and the poor just want to get there in order to be cured. After Max is injured at work and has only five days left to live, he joins a group of criminals who attach an exoskeleton to his body and send him on a mission to steal some data from a rich person, and afterwards go to Elysium.First of all, the movie looks great. But let's not emphasise this: it's supposed to look impressive and have great visual effects, it's a sci-fi with a $115 million budget! Also, while there are some good scenes that manage to keep you interested, others look like a video game. Then we have the story. As I said, it's interesting, mainly because you have so much possibilities and you can exploit it in so many ways: you can show the sociological aspect of the situation presented in the movie, you can analyse the characters psychologically, or describe the class wars between the rich and the poor so we can understand how things happened before the rich went to Elysium and we can sympathise with the poor. The director did nothing of this. Instead, he just showed us – this is Earth and it's ugly and it's really sad, this is Elysium and it's nice but the people are evil. It's a pity, since Blomkamp wanted the movie to send a powerful message and to be a metaphor for today's society. Yes, we get the metaphor, but it's faintly delivered and it makes Elysium look like just another silly Hollywood sci-fi trying to be all smart and stuff (Oblivion much?).Regarding the acting, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were good, but their characters were too undeveloped. Especially Foster's role as the movie's antagonist, the Minister of Homeland Security Delacourt, should have gotten more attention, if not more screen time. Blomkamp could have just taken the hint from Foster's last name. Matt Damon, on the other hand, is constantly present, in almost every scene of the movie, so he manages to be a bit more developed. But there's his childhood friend Frey, decently played by Alice Braga, whom we should believe he loves and cares for, even though they haven't seen each other in years, and she has a child with another man (that we never meet). Their zero-chemistry relationship is just taken for granted in the script, and consequently, we can't care. Perhaps the worst characteristic of this movie is that's it's so damn long, it gets so boring and still manages to leave some things unexplained. I guess we can just hope Blomkamp will create something better the next time.Rating: 6/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Original but Worth Watching,"Elysium: ""any place or state of perfect happiness; paradise,"" as defined by Dictionary.com.Based upon this definition, you can somewhat gather what the premise of the movie is. The year is 2154 and Earth is overpopulated, disease ridden and in disrepair. The world's wealthiest live in a fortified space station above earth called Elysium. There they enjoy every luxury including mechanisms that will cure them from almost, if not every, illness or injury. The people of Earth want to be there and the people of Elysium definitely do not want the Earth dwellers coming to their abode.From the start of the movie I was thinking ""Dredd"" or even ""In Time"" with Justin Timberlake as the scenery and the plot reminded me of those two films. Initially, I was wondering where the conflict would come from and what it would be. I mean, even today the wealthy live in beautiful protected areas away from the general public and they typically don't want strangers invading their neighborhoods. Is that so wrong?As the movie played out the conflict became clear. A movie needs one protagonist or more and one antagonist or more. It was clear who were supposed to be the protagonists and who were supposed to be the antagonists, but the writers and/or director had to really cement the fact that the protagonists were on Earth and the antagonists were on Elysium. So, in not so subtle fashion, they made the Elysium citizens depraved and nearly inhuman in their behavior and mannerisms. Essentially you were supposed to loathe Elysium and all it stood for. I think it was a little over the top and a bit unnecessary. Yes, wealthy people are going to make decisions and do things to protect their wealth, but that's not to say that they have no moral fiber whatsoever.Putting that aspect of the movie aside, it did make for a riveting film after all. Eventually I was drawn into the saga and I was whole-heartedly pulling for the hero. There is a lot of symbolism and parallels in this movie to life as we know it now, some of them discrete and others are overtly obvious. The effects and graphics were a big plus. The robot police and guards were extremely human-like in their movements such that you would think they were people in robot costumes. And graphical representation of Earth and Elysium made the disparity between the two locations very pronounced. This movie, while not that original, is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How did they get Matt Damon and Jodie Foster to do this film?,"I think the director, Neill Blomkamp, must have blackmailed them into it. Or maybe he held their dogs hostage? Because, if they read the script, they had to have known that all the special-effects in the world wouldn't save it.I LOVE sci-fi. But I hated this film. In fact, I'm angry that this film was released. Just as we've finally started getting some good sci-fi movies produced, this thing comes along. And presto, sci-fi gets a bad reputation, once again.I'm having trouble deciding which was worse; the plot or the camera work.Just kidding. It's the plot! The plot is one dimensional characters we don't care about, fighting a war we don't care about. In fact, more than once during the movie, I was hoping the bad guys would just kill Damon's character. That would put us BOTH out of our misery.The camera work and editing isn't much better, and hits a low in the fight scenes. Watching the fight scenes is like trying to watch vegetables being chopped in a food processor. Jump cut, jump cut, jump cut. Who's winning? Damon? No, the zucchini.I won't even try to cover all the failings of the ""science"" part of this sci-fi. There's no way to chronicle the errors and inconsistencies, and stay within the 1,000 word limit.But here's a tip for future sci-fi directors: If you use a 1950's style circular space station, please SPIN it!

"Elysium, surprised me, glad I watched it.","Honestly, this wasn't a movie I was planning on watching this summer, and maybe not even on DVD or BLU-Ray. Going in to the movie with my semi-negative feeling about it, I was glad I watch it. If you do go and watch this movie, two things you should at least appreciate, Matt Damon's acting and the visual effects. Without Matt Damon, this movie might have been stuck in the mud, and 15 minutes in, you might lose interest. But, with what he delivers in the movie with his talent and passion, his character Max truly comes to life and you're drawn in to follow his story. Also, the visual graphics in this movie are seamless. Many parts of the movie where you know there are visual effects, you barely notice that there are any. That's when you know they have done a good job in the visual effects department.Overall, the story of Elysium does a great job illustrating a futurist story and molding it to relevant story impacting people today. It should be a story many can relate to an enjoy watching.I'd recommend, if you haven't seen it, and you don't think you'll like, at least go in with an open mind, and watch it.

"More character, less action, please.","This is an enjoyable movie that uses science fiction, as it is often used, to present an allegory of what 21st-century America has become since Ronald Reagan began what has eventually turned into the Tea Party. We have walls to keep out illegal aliens; the 1% living in a paradise they think is separated from the great unwashed; unsafe working conditions that lead to the deaths of workers who produce goods for the 1%;medical care available only for the 1%. The characters include an ineffectual President clearly modeled on a liberal fantasy about an Obama who is powerless to do anything. Jodi Foster is a combination of Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney, ruthlessly combining Homeland Security and the State Department. There is even a weapon-obsessed Tea Party type who is a tool of the powers that be--a tool who gets out of their control. Much more could have and should have been done to develop these characters; Matt Damon's heroic orphan and hero of the people, Max, is the only character developed to any extent. And this is what keeps the movie from being great: character development is sacrificed for the sake of fight scenes.

To sum up, Elysium isn't a mind blowing movie, but its very entertaining, you will get your money's worth on this one if you go to the movies to be entertained, if not, Elysium is still preety decent, but don't expect big twists and turns, its all very predictable.

Goodish movie with a bad plot.,"Health care. Basically this movie is saying that health care should be free for all. Rich people get better health care and that's just not right.

They use exoskeletons and high energy plasma stuff and it's very cool in theory, except they're fighting for health care and that's just... not the coolest thing to make a movie about.The bad guy starts off unhinged and ends up as a raving lunatic, but he's fun for the most part. He's the only thing fun about the movie really.Health care. Ugh.It's implied that all of America (or LA*) winds up overrun by Latinos.

It lacks emotions in some important scenes making you feel like it needs a little bit more drama.It would be a much better film I think if the film had focused on Jodie Foster much more.The film is also pregnant to many good social messages, but it rushes it messages and as a result it fails to deliver them completely.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There were subtitles for some non-English conversations, but others were just too muffled/mumbled/spoken to fast/too much background noise/whatever. It didn't really matter as the plot line was very predictable, but still suspenseful.I had to come to this site to see who played ""Young Max""--was surprised to see he is NOT related to Matt Damon.

The Best Sci-Fi of 2013,"Directed and written by Neil Blomkamp, the guy who is behind one of the greatest sci-fi and alien film of the past decade, District 9 (D9). This was my most anticipated movie of the summer, and surely I'm not disappointed by it.The core of the story is health care and how awful the situation is in 2154. I love the fact Blomkamp puts a message in his films while he entertains you, he doesn't try to create a change or make a direction for a change, but he brings awareness to these social issues and problems and shows how unpleasant and horrifying it can get. This helps to realism of the film's tone, which brings me to the next point I love about his films, the sci-fi aspects; it looks and feels real and believable, he doesn't make cartoonish environment, the science and technology are not too far from the realistic world. It also comes from using less green screens and performing actual stunts, but another plus in his films are the visual effects, it is astonishing, especially in some of the fight scenes, it looks so sharp and awesome. So besides the solid story, the pacing is well done, it doesn't slow down at all, the movie just keeps moving and building up without wasting a second – I totally didn't realize how fast the 100 minutes went by. The soundtrack is also perfect for this film, either if it's an emotional moment or a fight sequence, the score is there to support and add an extra element to it; Blomkamp definitely knows whom to hire to score his films, well done sir. Regarding the performances, Matt Damon surprisingly is his first sci-fi action, he brings a solid performance (I guess Dogma can be counted as sci-fi, but it wasn't as big as this, and he's done a great job here); Jodie Foster, first I need to mention that she has a really sexy, dynamic ass that I had never realized (maybe because of the Imax screens, but she surely looks sexy here), and she does a fine job here, however some might find her accent and dialogue strange and not like it, same with William Fichtner (one of the most underrated actors of the present time), but keep in mind this strange futuristic dialogue is there to show the difference between the poor class and the rich class; the best performance definitely goes to Sharlto Copley, he owns every scenes he appears on the screen, to me he's even better in here than in D9 – I found it very interesting that a lot of people didn't know he's in the movie until yesterday since he was on Reddit or just someone told them after the movie. Although with all these positive sides, I have a few problems with the film, first one is the cam shakes in some of the fight scenes, to me they're very unnecessary, especially the fact movie is R rated for the violence and the language of Copley's character - maybe at some points they considered having it in PG 13, which I'm glad they didn't because it would ruin Copley's character, and then it would destroy the whole film. The other problem is Jodi Foster's character, she's supposed to be a family oriented person, but the audience won't find that in her character at all, I guess showing more of her character would slow down the movie a little bit, and they just avoided that. Also one thing you really need to consider, this is NOT an action packed movie, there are fight and action sequences, but the film is not filled with all of it, so do NOT expect and raise your expectations based on that. I also think there are two signatures to other classic sci-fi's; a bonsai tree next to Jodi Foster, Bladerunner, and the year 2154, Avatar's year.In conclusion, this is the best sci-fi of the year, indeed, it's better than Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, Ironman 3, and even Star Trek Into Darkness, and yet it's not better than D9, but it' still enjoyable and very entertaining, definitely check it out in real IMAX if you can, I give it 8.8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible On Every Level,"Like bad action movies of the past with a big budget but no brain, (Can you say Reloaded? Can you say Revolutions? Can you now say Man of Steel?) This movie pretends to be smart but ultimately there was no thought put into it on any level other then how to make an overall socialist agenda look cool. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacks any real energy. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma. Yes, even the normally charismatic Matt Damon spends the film in pouty face with nothing deep to do. I know the characters are facing horribly depressing events but those monotone performances, interrupted by bursts of anger, are terrible. Since the movie tries to put some sort of emphasis on a theme, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. Just like the Matrix sequels, this movie works as eye candy for a combined 15 minutes of its running time. The rest is crap.To reiterate, what sinks the movie is that it lacks a sense of wonder and never emotionally connects with us. Sure, the CGI isn't bad but that clearly isn't enough in today's digital day and age. YAWN. Elysium is yet another victim of the spend more and think less way to make movies.

Admirable concept but the writing falls short,"I revisited Elysium because I saw it ten years ago in the theater and remembered absolutely zero about the film. Figured it was time to refresh my memory.The concept of Elysium is one that I can appreciate. Dystopian and something that has been explored and talked about many times, but there were some twists with the idea of health and healing. It's a little on the nose that Elysium is intended to be America; the diatribes on immigrants and the way wealth safeguards access to healthcare. (Whether you agree or disagree with the politics doesn't detract from what the message is.)Regardless, it is an admirable concept with characters that I think all the actors do what they can with. Unfortunately, many of them are just so one dimensional there aren't a lot of options for creative portrayal.That ties in with my main issue with this movie: the writing is bad. Plot holes galore, limp dialogue, the aforementioned on-the-nose-ness coupled with poor character building. It fell flat in a lot of ways.On paper I think this movie is a great idea. The execution was definitely lacking.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Classism and Science Fiction - Excellent!,"Neil Blomkamp is a brilliant director made for the modern era - his films Elysium and District 9 unveil a realistic, anti-utopian vision of the future that suggests that modern day problems will most likely have only evolved, not disappeared. Specifically, his films touch on sensitive topics like wealth distribution, health care, prejudice and the degraded environment. Likable and familiar actors Jodi Foster and Matt Damon portray both villain and hero in nontraditional and unique ways. The superb writing and casting in Elysium offers a freshness to the science-fiction genre rarely seen in today's blur of industry films.Set in the year 2154, Blomkamp's vision of the future is brutal and unkind. The world our hero (Max- played by Matt Damon) lives in is dry and dirty, ruthless and over-populated. As Max attempts to re-assimilate back into regular life after prison - viewers get a fascinating glimpse into how the world has excelled (advanced robotics, weaponry and flight) and regressed (public infrastructure and health care) all at the same time. The earth has become over-run with the struggling poor - which has motivated the richest individuals to build a space station isolated and protected from the masses - it's a utopian mecca called Elysium. Elysium is beautiful, clean and houses the most advanced healthcare technology only regular citizens can dream about.It's in this setting that viewers get to meet mercenary Kruger (Sharlto Copley) - begrudgingly hired by Elysium controllers to do their dirty work down on earth. Sharlto Copley steals the show as a psychotic murderer who wields a samurai sword while unleashing brilliant one-liners. It's this sadistic sense of humor combined with an intense drive to kill that ensures Kruger a permanent place on the list of greatest villains of all time. His best line (after forcibly stabbing Max): ""Did I get ya?! Better get that looked at."" Throughout the well-filmed action sequences and flawless CGI - Blomkamp continues to surprise. Elysium has many twists and turns while still maintaining its originality and beauty. This director has a masterful eye for detail and story-arc all exhibited in Elysium. Keep an eye on this filmmaker - his next works are sure to be great too.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good film worth a watch,"I went for an evening out at the cinema had previously seen the trailers for Elysium and this was a film I had been interested in seeing as I have been a huge fan of the Bourne Trilogy and some of Matt Damon's other work.I was very impressed with the film for a number of reasons. Firstly, I would like to start with the theme as a whole. I thought that it was relatively new and original, however I would admit to not watching that many futuristic Sci-Fis before. I thought that the whole theme tied in perfectly with the unpredictability of the story. Personally, I think that the originality was the film's strong point. It was very hard to figure out what was going to happen next as something else normally happened in my case, when I tried guessing. Additionally, I was very impressed with the graphics, I personally have never seen graphics that looks as good as that, I thought that the Elysium itself look almost real. Finally there were many good action scenes in there that were both different and gory at times and they used both the combination of Brains and Brawn.Overall I thought that the film was pretty decent and would recommend watching it, however, it's unlikely to be your choice for Film of the Year.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Bit of a Disappointment,"Elysium, while it was not necessarily bad, was a bit disappointing. The special effects in this film look great, from the violence, to Elysium itself. However, the story is not so great. The plot is decent at best, and the character development is very underdone. The relationships between characters were barley explored, and the characters seemed to have next to no emotion. The felt like, in a sense, machines. In my opinion, the best part of the movie by far was Sharlto Copley's Kruger. At the end of the day, the movie was OK, and if you have nothing else to watch, then give it a go.

"District 9 with a bigger budget, better actors, but without the originality effect","Neil Bloomkamp presents Elysium, or should it be District 9 Part 2? The premise is pretty simple: in the future, the Earth gets overpopulated so the rich travel to a space station called Elysium where they live a luxurious life. In Elysium, director Bloomkamp once again chooses the way of the social message, masking it with a very entertaining and visually impressive action drama. Nothing to blame there. The directing is fine, we have many great actors, a thrilling plot, a true blockbuster. The thing is that in terms of model, this is exactly the same movie as District 9, sharing most of its ideas, only adding a bigger budget and a better cast, losing like that all the originality effect that District 9 was so praised about, even if it was a bit overrated at times. Like that, Elysium is just a competent blockbuster, one of 2013s best but certainly not the masterpiece many were expecting. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Far Left, heavy handed political propaganda","Could this movie be anymore obvious? We get it! America is Elysium and we should let everyone on the planet in and give them free everything, because apparently, America has enough resources for everyone.

It was so over the top with the illogical premise, that they should have offered pain pills beforehand. Logic and common sense cried through this whole thing. Don't waste your time. Just watch CNN to understand how horrible an idea it is for a nation to have laws. Open the flood gates and let everyone in! No laws, you mean, uncaring people!

"Beautiful, Stunning, Yet Missing Something","The cinematography of this movie was amazing, it is visually beautiful. The story within itself is very relevant to the socio-economic situations of society today. There are numerous elements of class warfare, the subjugation of the middle and lower class to substandard living reins strong throughout.The message of the plight of the poor leaves a psychological mark on the viewer as the wealthy within the film never show any care for their lives nor their well being. Aside from one character that mostly stays in the background, which is a shame.I felt the acting was quality aside from Sharlto Copley (Kruger), who left a lot to be desired whenever he was depicted. Instead of depicting the character with a more psychological interpretation he went with the stereotypical violence enthused henchman.While that could also be a result of the writing as overall it did feel that something was missing from each character to make you care about their plight. The aforementioned character that could have shown a more human element of Elysium was an extremely minor character, a gross missed opportunity to improve the plot.Nothing about Matt Damon's character truly captures the situation of Earth and why change is needed. He seems forced into his role out of his own selfish desires rather than out of the common good. Which in essence makes him no better than those on Elyisum.While the over arching theme of the movie is outstanding, the cinematography eye catching, and the action seems well executed there were a number of missed opportunities that caused the movie to go from memorable to a movie that was simply enjoyable at the time.True Score: 6.6",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some good idea and some ancient ones,Must admit it was a good film exploring the possibility that sooner or later capitalists trashed the earth like the morning after a hard-core party. In an era that machines can hook up with your nervous system I can see that the movie thinks in 130 years from today we still use the peripherals like Keyboard and laptops ;))) NOT so .Steve Jobs should have been hired as an adviser to come up with ideas on this. The manager (William Fichtner :John Carlyle ) behind the glass was going through some Assembly code (base machine code) which to an average Joe may seem like a mumbo jumbo geeky things but it is definitely not something at his level would use. Attempt of desperate people trying to get on ships and cross the border and get themselves into a better place is pretty much close to what we already have with Australia and refugees from troublesome nations who want a better life and risk their life trying to pursue that. The kidnapping of Mr (William Fichtner :John Carlyle ) was done well however the man to man combat of the south African dude with (Matt Damon:Max) the hero of the film was lengthy and boring. Interesting enough Mr Patel seemed to be of an Indian descent but I saw a few Chinese and Indian or a few African in year 2013 based on UN's publications they should contain 50 % of the Earth population.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Paradise Lost,"This film is mildly recommended.Elysium, the latest sci-fi thriller, purports yet another fatalistic view of our future. It's an intelligent but unexciting movie that showcases all of the elements of sci-fi genre with an undercurrent of social relevance. The film deals with more complex political issues, a subject very close to its director's mindset. Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has directed this fantasy action film with enough flash and strong imagery to disguise his overt messages about class warfare, injustice, immigration, and prejudice. It's still drips of deeper themes like apartheid, inequality, and discrimination, although the racial implications have been slightly altered to conform more to socio-economic issues.The year is 2054 and it's still them versus us, as the film depicts two different worlds and class structure. There's the luxurious resort space station called Elysium where the rich can cavort in the extravagant lifestyle with which they are accustomed and only the wealthy are the welcome 1%. In sharp contrast, there's Earth, a slum-ridden hellhole for the mere common folk.Up on Elysium, everything is running quite smoothly, with Jessica Delacourt, a high-ranking governmental official, in charge. Played by Jody Foster, Dalacourt is all evil and greed. It's a one-note role, but Foster does put a spin on this stereotype every now and then.Down on Earth, everything is a mess, with Max DeCosta, an ex-con and laborer, trying to survive. Played by Matt Damon, DeCosta is all good and courageous. It's a one note role, but Damon does put a spin on this stereotype every now and then too.Of course, both will clash as Max attempts to land on Elysium to try to make matters right, (I will not go into the details of the complex plotting, the illogical circumstances that bring Max to meet his fate, or spoil any surprises except to say that Damon looks good as the anti-hero, with or without his exoskeleton attached.)Blomkamp keeps all the action and CGI in motion, although his tendency to overuse hand- held camera-work ruins much of the physical fight sequences. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, has a strong visual point of view that elevates the melodramatic moments, of which there are many. The turn of events lack genuine suspense and the final outcome is very predictable, more the fault of the screenplay than the direction.Blomkamp's casting of the supporting characters brings mixed results, although those secondary characters are far more interesting and developed than the two lead roles. Alice Braga, Wagner Moura, and Diego Luna are fine in their roles. However, there is a major misstep in casting with Sharlo Copley as Kruger, a mercenary who tends to kill the English language more eagerly than his intended targets. The actor's overwrought performance with his thick accent and poor diction undercuts most of the menace needed for this pivotal role. As for the leads, Foster, who looks fabulous, seems to be channeling Tilda Swinton with her ice princess imitation and Damon plays Max with a minimum of success.Elysium effectively shows us a grave new world and while Bromkamp's film is a thought- provoking fantasy, the film ultimately made me think about nirvana and other more heavenly travel destinations, like exiting the theater.

Bad is not the right word...,"There are a few things that make this movie a bad movie. Very unconvincing acting by very talented (Damon, Foster) and untalented (Braga) actors for instance.

And what about the plainness and shallowness of the story? One could guess every step of this mess until it was at last finished.But if there was something that really did bother me was the arrogance and hypocrisy of the film makers to present this piece of trash as a social allegory, a moral message, something very wise and profound that could help us all became better human beings and turn this horrid world into a better place.

Sci-Fi Done Right,"Great Sci-fi movie. Elysium displayed a beautiful rendition and variety of CG and effects, as well as great acting by the actors. Some scenes may be disturbing, while these scenes serve a greater purpose. Lots of twists and turns made the movie less boring. Another thing that was done well was the character development. In the movie we see protagonists such as Max (Matt Damon) and antagonists such as Delacourt (Jodie Foster), as well as in- the-between characters like Spider Julio, etc. These ""middle"" characters did not necessarily have the leading roles, yet their personalities make each unique and important towards the development of the story.Again, this movie deserved a 8, but since I am a sci-fi fanboy, I'll give it a 9/10.

Good but not Outstanding.,"""Elysium"" is a visually stunning Science-Fiction parable that - halfway through the movie - loses its socially critical aspirations for the benefit of common action scenes with lots of shooting and fighting and projectiles exploding in slow motion.Neill Blomkamp certainly had a strong vision; he created a dirty, overpopulated, ruined world ridden by poverty and violence, a world we can very well relate to since it too obviously resembles areas and spots we all - once in a while - happen to see on the news when there is again a report on the favelas in Brazil or townships of South Africa or any other slums or war areas for instance, and we feel relieved to have escaped such a hard fate just because we were luckily born in a rich industrial country. And such an idealized industrial country can be interpreted as the eponymous space station ""Elysium"" where the few rich ones are living like Greek gods in heaven looking down at the Earth in disgust for all the miserable people down there to whom they feel so much superior. There we have it: the metaphorical north-south divide!All this would have been enough to make it a very profound and deep SiFi-Classic if Blomkamp had not wanted to combine it with the typical Hollywood summer blockbuster action booster pack including a more or less secondary love story plus an obligatory sadistic sociopath named Kruger thus losing track of his original path and - which is worse - giving away much of its suspense and substance because he very soon gets caught up in predictable Popcorn movie patterns. Very much like its more artistically innovative predecessor ""District 9"", ""Elysium"" seems not thought through down to the last detail, many questions are not answered, too many things are assumed or just not explained, there is no background story either, there are certain issues with logic, and we are not offered a sufficiently satisfying depiction of the futuristic political and economical conditions.So we have to take the world's premise for granted in which the main character Max (Matt Damon), a common worker and former thief, somewhat clumsily (he is not trained after all) struggles to find a way up to ""Elysium"", like so many terrestrials before him, where he wants to use one of the local Med-Pods that miraculously can cure any illness and injury in order to save his own life thus teaming up with a bunch of outlaws who enforce him with a strength-enhancing exoskeleton which for some reason no one else wanted to wear. Unfortunately, he has very powerful enemies, above all the Secretary of Defense D. Rhodes whose zero-tolerance immigration policy threatens to foil his plans. Jodie Foster plays Rhodes with such an eccentric, cold-hearted charm that it's really a pity that Blomkamp's script also lost focus on her amidst all the beamy and bulky action intervals.While ""District 9"" worked better as a classical SiFi-parable in spite of its many logical flaws, Blomkamp's latest contribution to the genre, may be a bit too simplistic and underdeveloped to have a lasting impact on the audience, however, it is nevertheless an impressive eye candy for any real SiFi-fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pathetic SciFi,"As Sci Fi fans we looked forward to the premiere of Elysium.

Unbelievably Awful!,"This movie was the sole reason I created this IMDb account, as I could not believe how terrible it was. While it has the usual CG and action you'd expect from a movie in this genre, it's an absolutely horrible knock-off of District 9. My friend and I decided to leave the movie halfway through because we couldn't stand the complete lack of concern regarding continuity. I get that it's a Sci-Fi movie (one of my fav genres), but nothing connected and the whole thing made absolutely zero sense. For example, at the beginning of the movie and within the same context, some street and building signs in Spanish, while others in English with no apparent correlation.

A disappointing film from a director many had high hopes for,"In 2154 Earth has all been used up, resources are scarce and those people that remain, scratch out a hard-scrabble existence in a apocalyptic type world. All the while they gaze enviously at ""Elysium"", the utopia built in space above their heads.Eylsium is the flip-side of Earth, everything is plentiful, order reigns and the rich get to live out their fantasies. They also have access to medical treatment, able to cure any illness after a quick scan in a tanning bed type device.Back on Earth, ""Max"" (Matt Damon) is a low level assembly line worker, tasked with helping to create robot policemen or peace keepers. Following an industrial accident, his options shrink further and his long standing desire to move to Elysium becomes a necessity. How he achieves this and the help he receives, is the subject of the story line. Ultimately he becomes an enhanced warrior, ""Robocop"" lite without the police badge.As can be imagined, the queue of people wanting to escape to this rotating dream in the sky, is long and varied. Meanwhile Elysium's ambitious Defence secretary ""Delacourt"" (Jodie Foster) main task is to try to ensure that dream is not shattered by untidy, dirty immigrants destroying the idyllic setting. Instead of ""boat people"" think ""shuttle people"". Delacourt is zealous in this task, taking steps outside of her remit, angering the more liberal president President Patel (Faran Tahir).Of course no story like this would be complete without a greedy corporate arms conglomerate. On this occasion run by John Carlyle (William Fitchner) in his Bugatti Veyron badged shuttle craft. Carlyle worries more about contracts and performance targets than employees getting irradiated, after all there are plenty more to replace Max in this much sought after position.Added to the mix is a rather bizarre bounty hunter ""Kruger"" (Sharlto Copley) who completes the ""wet work"" that is occasionally required when the Elysium President is too squeamish to deal with issues. Complete with his default South African accent, Copley cuts a swath and delights in gruesome deaths as he completes Delacourt's bidding.Director Neill Blomkamp, famous for his relatively low budget but innovative and impressive ""District 9"", has a much starrier cast and a bigger budget to play with this time round. His earlier breakout film had obvious parallels with apartheid, this film tackles even larger themes, rich and poor and entitlement to health care.Where District 9 had humour and a clear sense of right and wrong, this story is more confused. Effectively attempting to explore the complex area of immigration via a big budget sc-fi film is a risk and on this occasion, one he has not pulled off.The plot is simple yet manages to be confusing, the motivations of the characters, especially Copleys ""Kruger"" is difficult to understand. His character takes centre stage and turns the action into yet another ""mano et mano"" slugfest, something this story was never about.Damon is as effective as ever but he appears exposed in his exoskeleteon on occasion. With Foster getting little screen time, we are left with a poor mish mash of ideas, which do not come together in a cohesive whole. Unfortunately, blame must lie with Director and writer Blomkamp and represents an opportunity missed. Lets hope he is more on track with his next venture, ""Chappie"".The effects are good without being state of the art but the story continually gets in the way. If the director wished to explore these themes, a much more thoughtful less action packed film would have proved more suitable. The film is also quite gratuitously violent, whereas in District 9 this was played for laughs, here much of the gore appears sadistic and unnecessary.SummaryA disappointing film from a director many had high hopes for, following his excellent calling card ""District 9"".Certainly watchable and on occasion interesting but more for what the film might have been,rather than what is actually on the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Dick Cheney's Ringworld,"Writer/director Blomkamp's breakthrough work was 'District 9' - a simple plot driven by fairly original concepts and techniques - and it was a big success. Predictably the new 'wunderkind' was given a bloated budget for his follow-up project - and it's resulted in a major letdown with a trite story undermined by implausible ideas. The film is set about 150 years in the future, with mankind living on a polluted, over-populated earth, and being exploited by a fascist elite who control the masses by means of a robot police force. The privileged minority reside on Elysium, a vast orbiting space station which resembles a luxurious Beverly Hills gated community. One of the earthbound serfs is the standard action-movie hero: a tough-but-sensitive ex-con called Max. After being exposed to a fatal dose of radiation at his robot-factory workplace, he needs to access the forbidden medical facilities on Elysium - and during his struggles to save himself, Max becomes entangled in a 'coup d'etat' planned by the station's megalomaniac female head of security.Although the film looks good, Blomkamp provides little reason to care about anybody, since the participants act like manic puppets with incomprehensible motivations. He attempts to conceal the yawning gaps in his story by getting the characters to shout at one another, and engage in endless shoot-outs with CGI robots - all of which produces little more than brain-addling tedium.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Exploding Commentary,"By first glance at the very first still, I already believed that Elysium will be the best blockbuster of the year; the story isn't based on anything, the concept looks rich, and the character design of Max looks like a potential of a new cinematic icon. With the name Neill Blomkamp, you will know that this is more than a simple high concept. Just like District 9, the story builds a social allegory. Now this one talks about the economy, illegal immigrations, and healthcare. It would have been intriguing, but the film is shaky in its message and somehow more satisfied on being cool, which ends up being a straightforward action movie that has only little development. The rest of it is still quite gripping and stunning, with a vision that is more breathtaking than any blockbuster out there. Elysium is fine for its big ideas, but the context needs more to work out.The setting is definitely built for satires, though unlike District 9, this one takes them seriously, as in not much humorous. Its cynicism is everywhere, but it depicts both rich and poor in a typical way. Elysium is run by a selfish, corrupt government and its citizens are too naive and pleasured to be concern about what's going on, while Earth is mostly inhabited by good people because they get all the suffering. It's fascinating how they have to realistically contrast between both class; the space torus world is more advanced than the third world, but no matter how they tried to make it look close to reality, the political wars still feel campy and contrived. The plan of the ""heroes"" also seems amazingly absurd. It's Sci-Fi, sure, but again it's an allegory to a real life problem. Their solution for the healthcare crisis is quite otherworldly. I guess this is for the sake to fit for an action movie plot, but that also results to a less impressive delivery of its subtext. In other subject, the film doesn't provide enough detail beneath the corruption of the Elysium government, neither the devastation of Earth which makes an underwhelming commentary.The storytelling is terribly straightforward, though straightforward is not actually a problem. You can develop a character by studying their personalities even without any back stories, but here even a single flashback and brief pathos won't bring much genuine connection to the audience. The actual energy relies more to the technical work and the performances. The characters may be somewhat bland, but the actors thankfully filled something in their marvelously designed roles. Matt Damon gives all of Max's weakness and redemption, which makes him an endearing protagonist. Sharlto Copley's unhinged villainous turn is endlessly enjoyable. Wagner Moura and Diego Luna manage to be likable in their small roles, while Jodie Foster and William Fichtner brought some appropriate antagonism.The film is best when it focuses on the cool stuff. Every image of the film is undeniably breathtaking to look at. The production is awesome with rust and dirt all over it. The special effects are simply magnificent compared to Hollywood's most recent summer blockbusters. The action is of course has the joy of blowing up flesh into pieces, palpable trademark of the director. Neill Blomkamp pours the best of his technical filmmaking skills.Personally, Elysium is a disappointment. The world it created is so brilliant, it would have been a powerful blockbuster that would outweigh all the remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, adaptations, and other unoriginal projects Hollywood provides nowadays. It's still pretty innovative and very entertaining, but the story had something to say and it troubles to that point. I still think Neill Blomkamp is a magnificent storyteller. I just wish he can use more of the human side of his stories. Matt Damon ends up achieving that, but it wasn't enough unfortunately, though it's getting there. Maybe more exploration would help to make it all compelling. If you have no interest in its sociopolitical content, then feast your eyes by one of the most eye popping visuals and exciting set pieces ever presented this year.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A film that achieves as many hits as it does misses,"Back in 2009, the film-viewing world began raving about a curious new sci-fi actioner named District 9. Boasting a satirical commentary on racial segregation and a funny-accented producer-turned-lead star Sharlto Copley, it signalled the arrival of a potentially explosive new director, Neill Blomkamp. Personally, the film embraced genre clichés a little to willingly for my taste, but it was an exciting little film with some interesting things to say. Four years later, Blomkamp is on similar grounds with Elysium, but this time the target is the social elite.In 2154, Earth has been abandoned by the super rich, who have all packed up and headed to a space station named Elysium. There they live a care- free life in their mansions and all talk French, seemingly sipping wine all day by the pool. The biggest benefit is a healthcare machine that can diagnose a patient and heal them almost instantly. Back on Earth, things are tough. Robots police the dusty streets, and ex-con Max da Costa (Matt Damon) is repeatedly beaten down by the man when he's just trying to get to work. When an industrial accident exposes Max to a heavy dose of radiation, he is given 5 days to live. He must get up to Elysium at all costs with the help of his criminal friends Julio (Diego Luna) and Spider (Wagner Moura) in order to heal himself.Like District 9, the social observations are sharp, with obvious parallels to be made with the American health system, where the rich can enjoy top-class treatment from the best doctors, while the poor are forced to choose which of their fingers they want sown back on. Not to say the satire is subtle - this is the cinematic equivalent of posting dog s**t through an enemy's letter-box - Jodie Foster's evil Delacourt hires her psychopathic 'man on the ground' Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to shoot down any illegal immigrants attempting to land on Elysium to get some better healthcare. The rich here have no dimensions - faceless suits who wouldn't p**s on you if you were on fire. But the anger in Elysium makes the film all the more absorbing.Sadly (and, again, like in District 9), this comes at the expense of the story. Max is a faceless 'good' guy, but is given some humanity by the effortlessly likable Matt Damon. His love interest is in his childhood flame Frey (Alice Braga), who has a child riddled with leukaemia, causing Max to question his priorities. It's all too predictable and overly familiar, riddled with distracting plot-holes and silly plot devices. Blomkamp's tech-fetish surfaces again as Max is given an exoskeleton that somehow makes him stronger, making him look a bit like Bane from The Dark Knight Rises (2012).In a performance a world away from his ethically-challenged, bureaucratic weed in District 9, Sharlto Copley damn near steals the entire film. Bulked up and bearded, Kruger is a terrifying (albeit rather one-dimensional) psychopath, apparently capable of any horrific act. I could listen to his voice all day, which is the complete opposite of Jodie Foster, who delivers a strangely tuned-out performance with the strangest accent I've ever heard. She is simply terrible. But that's Elysium, a film that achieves as many hits as it does misses, neglecting the story for some cutting satire, boasting some astonishing CGI but delivering some sub-standard set-pieces, but overall, a pretty good movie.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Blomkamp's futuristic gamble pays off,"AN original science-fiction film these days is a gamble, it's either going to be a hit or a miss. Luckily for Elysium, the man behind one of the hardest hitting sci-fi films for the last few years isn't Michael Bay. It has been about four years since South African-born Neill Blomkamp totally shocked international and local audiences when he released District 9 in 2009. This time he is back in the director's seat and is well equipped with Hollywood A-listers Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. In the year 2154, Earth is over populated and basically turned into a massive slum. The rich leave to a man-made space station known as Elysium where everybody lives in perfect harmony with lovely gardens and suburban homes, and the health care is beyond excellent. Foster plays the Secretary of Defence on Elysium who is challenged by her superiors on her actions trying to protect the well­being of the utopian society. Damon plays Max, a criminal with a rocky past, who now leads a mundane life as a worker in a robot manufacturing plant on Earth. When he is exposed to a deadly quantity of radiation, he has no choice but to try and find a way to Elysium, but it's not that easy for our leading man. He seeks the help of one his acquaintances from the criminal underworld to help him get to Elysium, and it is at this point the film really kicks up a gear. From the onset, it is clear that the film is far more than just an average popcorn sci-fi watch. It is obvious – but I'm going to say it anyway – this film is a social narrative on issues relating to the rich and the poor, class differences and the health system. And these issues are common to all societies, whether you live in Paris or Parys. As far as science fiction goes, the film delivers, with a worthy plot, believable character development, outstanding visuals and a decent amount of action. Blomkamp comes from a visual effects background and it is evident that he didn't hold with the elegant use of CGI, far better than the ""summer"" blockbuster we saw a few months ago. Although the film is primarily driven through dialogue and storytelling, there are a few well executed action sequences with some entertaining gun battles and futuristic weaponry that will put a smile on your face. There are, however, a few downs to Elysium. It suffers from some of the classic Hollywood pitfalls — aspects of the story are just too convenient for our lead character and for the progression of the story. (It won't be too hard for audiences to predict how the film unfolds). Foster's character plays an important role in the film, but it doesn't seem like she put a whole lot of effort into it. Without a shadow of a doubt, the absolute highlight of Elysium is Sharlto Copley. Just when we thought we saw one of the best villains earlier this year in JJ Abrams's version of Khan, Copley gives Benedict Cumberbatch a run for his money playing a menacing South African mercenary hired as a sleeper agent by the higher-ups of Elysium.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
America's future for the world,"The world of the future, which is depicted in almost every movie, in every imaginary utopia, in scientific talks, etc. Everywhere, is perfectly depicted. The future point of technology is successfully handled. A very good ratio has been achieved in terms of visual effects without unnecessary exaggeration. The movie is 140 years in the future. The reason that makes the movie perfect and draws you in as you watch it is that they handle the rate at which technology can develop for about 140 years in a way that is very close to the possibility of realization. There are no strange ridiculous laser weapons, teleportation devices, etc. Like in some movies.If America continues to be the number one country in the world, I think in the future we will be able to pick and choose people based on their money, just like in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You've seen it all before,"I laughed at the box that says ""Spoiler Alert"" you couldn't spoil this it it that bad. Plenty of action but that is only camouflage to disguise the very predictable plots, all used in previous films over the years.. and as for the acting I can't describe how bad it was. There's a line in it where the Elysium Secretary Of State (Jodie Foster) says "" I'm afraid I can't Act"".... I fell off the chair laughing. 106 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.I'd rather be in the dentist's chair for that long. I'll bet it didn't take that long to write. How did Matt Damon agree to do this. I give it 1/10... my previous low score was 6/10... and that was dreadful.

Finally some Science fiction with a good story!,"After the colossal disappointment of Star Trek Into Darkness, it's good to see some people still care about Science Fiction in film. The story, acting and action are all solid. Only issue is shaky cam. I know why it was used but it can really go away from film all together. Still the best story of the summer action movies.For pure entertainment value it was on par with Iron Man 3 and Pacific Rim which had stories that weren't as good but had charm that kept me entertained.Also, for those of you who like your military action with lots of gore then it's a big win. If you are squeamish during films like Saving Private Ryan then you may want to steer clear.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Promising at first, disappointing in the end.","After watching this movie, I was left with a very bitter taste and felt a bit ""conned"". Nobody forced me to view it, to be honest, so I shouldn't have reasons to complain. I went in with low expectations after seeing the trailer, and wasn't expecting something different than a popcorn flick.The first part of the film, though, was a decent enough construction of a story, which kept me involved and interested. Nothing really original, but enjoyable nevertheless. Some shaky footage here and there, where it didn't seem to be required, but kept at the minimum for a while; some beautiful action shots, and a good pace. This part of the movie I rate at around 7 out of 10.After about the half way mark, something changes dramatically regarding the style and everything turns ugly: poorly written scenes, characters' actions become totally irrational, and the whole construction crumbles like a deck of cards. In my opinion, a single character's existence and ridiculous behavior manages to completely destroy a perfectly functioning movie. You'll recognize it when you'll see it. The camera starts to lose control in the action shots, and in conjunction with the roaring sounds, causes dizziness - I really had to close my eyes for a few moments at one point. So the second half I see as a 2 out of 10.The overall performances are good, with one notable exception. Averaging the two grades, the overall feeling is a 4 out of 10. ""Oblivion"" was a better movie, by today's pretty low standards regarding sci-fi movies, and compared to ""After Earth"", the first part of ""Elysium"" was better, but the second was worse.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's not 2001, but it is August. Let's be thankful for a small gift.","Elysium is a Kubrick/Clarke-like 2001 spoked wheel hovering and tormenting the L.A. underclass still suffering in the environmentally-challenged earth of 2054. Writer-director Neill Blompkamp has another gritty, chaotic future like his acclaimed District 9, only this time he hews closer to traditional sci-fi with bald political parallels to 2013 and pervasive fighting to the exclusion of the more cerebral possibilities of the intriguing premise. Put simply, the have's are flying high while the have not's are miserable in an underworld recalling the workers in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.""Cerebral"" is how I would characterize Kubrick's sci-fi; ""visceral"" is what I see in Blomkamp's. Like our dreams of paradise, that place must be better. In Elysium it is manifestly so: The rich have set up a gated community in the sky where all their needs are taken care of, especially medical because they can be cured immediately by their individual health-care machines and virtually live forever—not available on earth. The didactic implications of stern immigration laws on Elysium coupled with a lack of universal health care on earth provides Elysium with enough allegorical ammunition to keep three of these movies going. Alas, violence dominates as it usually does in contemporary sci-fi.Those allegorical implications are almost heavy-handed: Earth is over-populated, minorities are now the majority, and the rich have become so rich they can abandon earth and live isolated from the woes of working people and an over-burdened planet. Enter hero Max (post-apocalyptic Mad Max?), played by the durable and always intelligent Matt Damon, a good-hearted ex-thief on the right path, who needs to get to Elysium to stop his imminent death from radiation. Saddled with a desire to help the ailing daughter of a life-long friend, Frey (Alice Braga), Max has a reason to subvert the ruling class on Elysium and enfranchise him and the rest of the abandoned earth.The premise is 2001-worthy, but the execution is dominated by the old chase motif with accompanying fisticuffs that last forever. Why not, like 2001, have a few fighting apes and then an ominous monolith or two? Suspense and satisfaction don't need to rely on violence. Nor does Jodie Foster as defense secretary Delacourt need to rely on a French accent so flawed as to be distracting from her thespian excellence (remember agent Starling?)While hand-to-hand combat still seems absurd in a world where a scanning machine can cure you of what ails, even death, Blomkamp falls in to the modern CGI obsessions related to combat rather than wit. Still, this is August, and an intelligent actioner with figurative possibilities is a minor gift. I'll take it and dream of an Elysium where Oscar-worthy films appear each month, not just in December.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Neil Blomkamp couldn't replicate that ""District 9"" sense of realism that made the presence of aliens extremely believable. Without that, ""Elysium"" became a generic sci-fi","Written and directed by Blomkamp, with a much fatter budget than that of his successful debut work - the fabulous ""District 9"" - ""Elysium"" uses the best expedient that science fiction has, which is to point a mirror at the society and extrapolate the reflection to point out its flaws. However, if Blomkamp used this artifice perfectly before, here he makes a little mistake, but not enough to irremediably damage his new cinematographic effort.As in ""District 9"", Blomkamp proves his capacity to conceive - theoretically - a world that, while being critical of the reality in which we live every day, points out potential future problems from our actions today. If in Distrito it was the ""shrimps"" that symbolized black South Africans (the director and screenwriter's country of origin) who were suppressed and victims of abuse and prejudice, here he expands his scope and speaks of all those who are considered second-class citizens, dividing in an arbitrary and unreal way (typical of someone who is not in touch with the different worldviews that the richest and poorest have of things) the planet between miserable poor and super rich.Highlighting the narrow view of people that Blomkamp demonstrates here, the plot would even be justified if it did not appeal to clichés in the way of presenting its characters and their world. Max is an ex-con and lives in a huge slum - which is what the city of Los Angeles has become - a huge mass of people and houses that speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and all kinds of dialects in a huge filthy mess. Of course, it is not enough for the subject to be the hero, he needs to be ""the chosen one"", as the film informs us as soon as the credits are presented. Max was raised in an orphanage, told by a nun that he was destined for great things. Next to the boy, the young Freya (Alice Braga) lives in the same orphanage and becomes the ""impossible love"" of our protagonist.If so, many clichés weren't enough, the representation of the inhabitants of this rotten world is the most laughable possible. The impression one gets is that all the characters came out of an unsuccessful spin off of Mad Max. Everyone is ""mean"", ""coarse"", ""bad looking"" and ""bad"". Good people among the poor practically do not show their faces. This simplistic view also follows Blomkamp's view of the wealthy on the Elysium satellite. All dressed in white (and a largely Caucasian population) drink champagne, listen to symphony concerts, and cure skin cancer as easily as eating a grape. Simplistic, it presents a xenophobic and limited population where there is also no space for those who think differently from this pattern. The director offers an overly simplistic vision and does not realize what a great idea he had in favor of deeply stereotyped characters, absolutely unjustified actions and a waste of an excellent premise.By ignoring the middle lane, insurgents on both sides (or even the middle class, where are they hiding?) Blomkamp limits his world to the old - and obvious - hero versus villain cliché without developing anything beyond that, like had set out to do in the first few minutes. Note - when you see the film - how the first half hour of the film (even with the speech ""you are destined to change the world"") works very well and inserts us into that dirty reality and in contrast to the ethereal world of Elysium. Too bad it stops there. The plot itself is absolutely derivative and in the end becomes a game of cat and mouse between the ""slum ninja"" version of Damon against the bearded brute of Sharlto Copley (which in this simplistic world is what you do best and have fun doing of its frightening villain). All the hype about Jodie Foster's character is exaggerated. Her character, presented as a strong, cruel and determined woman, reveals herself to be shallow and easily replaceable and without any great motivation for her actions (just pure personal ambition).Visually, the film is almost flawless. The mechanical design of robots matches both their functions and the absurdity of their existence. The immense terrestrial ""slum"" dialogues with the ""communities"" so common to the great urban centers of our world. It is impossible not to notice that the Earth is photographed in warmer and more pleasant tones than the monochromatic Elysium. The care that was left in the visual part was lacking to retouch the script. Even with dozens of very interesting concepts, there was a lack of subtlety and shades of gray and Manichaeism was left over in the construction of the script. Little is known about Elysium itself and its inhabitants - apart from their fondness for the French language - or the motives for depriving the underprivileged of medical treatment are explained. Such elements could expand the discussions proposed by the film that were only on the surface. Blomkamp was far from failing in this, his second venture, but neither did he show the same subversive talent displayed in his debut work.In the cast, Matt Damon is an actor who confidently embodies the roles of ordinary men and represents well the class of ""blue collars"", the manual workers who support the system for those in power (and it is still appropriate that the protagonist works building the same robots that exercise ""authority"" over him). Damon makes Max's desperation not to die palpable, giving reason for his journey, and it is interesting to note that a man who just wants to live his life is pursued by socialist, capitalist and anarchist activists to be used as a tool for change. The same cannot be said for Alice Braga's character arc, Frey. An old friend of Max, she reappears out of nowhere in the boy's life with a daughter suffering from leukemia who also needs medical help from Elysium. As much as the actress does not compromise, her role does not work, serving only to add an unnecessary melodramatic component to the narrative. There is even a useless flashback of Max and Frey as children, with him promising his friend to take her to live in Elysium someday.Who really steal the film are Wagner Moura and Sharlto Copley. Moura, in her first role in a Hollywood production, composes a character full of nuances in an interpretation with the right tone of exaggeration to conquer the public without alienating it. Your Spider, even profiting from someone else's dream of going from hell to paradise, still has a certain dignity within him and, when he sees a chance to change the world, he embraces it (even if the script does not explain his motivations very well for his actions more selfless). Copley, on the other hand, conquers by his almost absolute detachment from any kind of morality that his Kruger presents, with the actor having a great time playing this true sociopathic monster, which makes him absolutely irresistible every time he enters the scene. The same cannot be said for Jodie Foster, who lets the coldness of her Delacourt be confused with apathy - something unforgivable in a woman capable of blowing up forty unarmed civilians without batting an eyelid. Praise is also given for the participation of the charismatic Diego Luna, who uses his little screen time very well as Max's former partner in the criminal world.The introductory part of ""Elysium"" is the best part of the film, with a camera in hand, in a realistic tone to describe the precarious life of Earth's inhabitants, with the slums of futuristic Los Angeles as a backdrop. In these sequences, we follow a section of Max and Frey's childhood, passionate friends who would later take different paths in life. Then, the film picks up the story years later when the protagonists meet again. Essentially, the film's social critique focuses on a possible future, a consequence of the growing overpopulation and inequality that exists today. The focus of the story is the city of Los Angeles, where Latinos are left on Earth and do not reach the necessary status to live in the satellite city. However, the weakness of the plot jumps out of the screen due to the ease of invading the habitat of the powerful and the naivety of predicting a machine that cures all diseases in a matter of seconds. Thus, these fantasies collide with the semi-realistic tone of the beginning of the film, which can distance the spectator who was engaged at the beginning of the journey. It's a shame that Neil Blomkamp couldn't replicate that ""District 9"" sense of realism that made the presence of aliens extremely believable. Without that, ""Elysium"" became a sci-fi adventure like many others out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
To have and (make sure) to have not or my review of Elysium ****,"Elysium is awell, is a great movie. I hesitated there only because I was going to say ""is a great science fiction movie"" and while this is most definitely a science fiction movie, I think Neill Blomkamp had too many balls in the air for me to champion this movie as classic science fiction. From the heavy emphasis on action mixed in with all the commentary on poverty, pollution, and health care etc he had chainsaws, bowling balls and bowling pins in the air for this juggling act But don't get me wrong this is about as good as it gets with film making and story telling. Personally I thought the heavy emphasis on the action made it loose some of the overall effectiveness on all the other social commentary it had going for it. To me, by definition, great social commentary is something that all great science fiction has. And while I think Neil had great aspirations for doing just that, he also had an eye on the box-office potential of super-hero level box-office potential.What's interesting is I saw this with a conservative friend who also likes science fiction but in hindsight it's something I should have asked them about because liking science fiction HAS to be at odds with much of their regular day to day thinking .Most of the best science fiction rally against corporations out of control, or rally the against the repression of freedom of thought and expression, fighting the corruption of power and money, human rights over misguided self righteous morals etc all those things his political party usually stands for. And while they were typically busy with counting the number of ""F-bombs"" rather than counting the number of crimes against humanity, all the action I think helped mask the extremes of the 'haves' against the 'have nots' and it's ""class warfare"" message. This way it did not seem to offend their senses the way the director's previous attempt at the allegories of apartheid and all 'the good things it had to offer', that were so well played out in his District 9. And speaking of that movie... considering the relatively tiny budget he worked with on that one, it was very interesting to see him balance the ""brain and brawn"" with the slick and fantastic look of this film with it's much bigger budget.But aside of all the ""action versus message"" in this film what I really liked was some of the turns this film took. Every time this movie started to head in a predictable direction Neil would throw in a curve ball, literally crashing things to the ground like when they were delivering the prisoners to the orbiting space station Elysium. Now there may have been a few stretches of believably in the plot where Matt Damon's character Max just happens to get a lethal dose of radiation that sends him on his suicidal mission, at the exact same time Jodie Foster's character Delacourt, the security leader of the one-precenters on Elysium is planning a coup, but these complaints are minor when dealing the humanity Matt Damon's character builds up as Max trying to save all those on Earth in particular his childhood friend Frey(Alice Braga) and her sick daughter that needing to get to the instant healing only available on Elysium.Now, Richard Roeper called Jodie Foster's acting something like the worst performance in the history of film, or something like that, while Peter Travers said she was ""killing it, as a Dick Cheney in heels."" I was probably somewhere in the middle. And while I would be hard pressed to particularly defend the locked jawed grit she was grinding out, the Cheney comment is laughably accurate. In particular, I liked the fact she was not 'chewing the scenery' as is often the case with great actors in villainous roles.So the idea of how rich people really don't care if poor people have access to medical care is scarily reflective of today's world just look yet another vote by old rich white dudes against health care for the poor is in today's headlines and taking the idea of unregulated corporations polluting the world to climate changing levels wrapped up around several cool gun battles, and fight scenes between a exoskeleton enhanced Matt Damon and psycho villain Kruger(Sharlto Copley) can seem a bit flippant, or incongruous, still...I walked away from this film extremely entertained and yes even intellectually challenged, so having said everything I just said, it really is a great 'science fiction movie' ""f-bomb"" ? ""Was there? 'spose so and how many tattoos did they have?""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Slightly let down,"Although I had been waiting to watch this movie ever since a friend showed me the trailer, after we had watched District 9, I felt that it was not exactly what I had hoped it to be. There are some plot holes, and the whole ""leaving Earth and arriving in space within a matter of minutes"" was -to my eyes- tackled a bit naively. All this is not disturbing in watching the film, the effects are great throughout, but the characters are somewhat poorly developed. Seemingly bad guys turning into likable characters within seconds of an unconvincing dialogue. Jodie Foster gives a good performance, albeit not her best, Matt Damon is who he is, the bad guys are very bad, and the good are too good.

Matt Damon, disappointingly made little connection to his character, becoming a glorified Robocop instead of a redemptive and memorable vigilante (like Jodie Foster in The Brave One; 2007). Writer/director Neill Blomkamp hit a home-run with his first endeavor into the Sci-Fi realm and made quite a smart move when casting not-so well-known Sharlto Copley as the lead in District 9. However, placing Copley as the renounced, uncivilized foe to Damon in Elysium, made him seem comical; like watching Road Runner string the Coyote along through a series of useless gags.http://themovie-geist.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I will try again....,"Considering the superb acting talents of Matt Damon & the lovely Jodie Foster, you would not believe how bad this movie is. The character development is not developed, the direction is shaky & the script reads like a school kids school play. The special effects however are very well done, but there was nothing much in this movie that I warmed too. It's far left political messaging is also annoying. If you wish to make a movie with a social agenda then please do a documentary on it, rather than dressing it up as science fiction. Otherwise you will just ruin what could have been the basis of a good movie.Well in my honest opinion the only thing this movie has to offer are the special effects which are well well done & easy on the eye. They are imaginative & creative but there it ends. I still love Jodie Foster, but I believe this role was not challenging enough for her. & Even Matt Damon is certianly not at his best here, as he is a little wooden & quite distracted.

Flawed but entertaining new film from District 9's Neil Blomkamp.,"As a huge fan of writer/ director Neil Blomkamp's District 9, I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Now after a 4 year wait, his sophomore flick Elysium has arrived. I liked Elysium. I was certainly entertained but, it does have some problems that keep it from reaching the standard set by District 9 such as, a bit of an overloaded story and some surprising overacting by a few principles. Elysium tells the story of the future Earth of 2154. The planet is overpopulated and ravaged and the rich and powerful have moved off planet to the enormous space station of Elysium where they have every convenience and luxury, while the rest are left to labor and wallow in the mess. Enter ex-con Max, (Matt Damon) a man trying to work hard and stay out of trouble and prison, while dreaming of reconnecting with childhood sweetheart, Frey (Alice Braga). An accident at work leaves Max fatally poisoned with radiation and with 5 days left to live, Max needs to get to the only place where he can be cured, Elysium which is off limits to the poor inhabitants of Earth. Max turns to crime-lord and hacker, Spider (Wagner Moura). Spider will get Max on Elysium if he helps steal the information about all it's access codes stored in the brain of one, John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who, unknown to Max and Spider, is working with Elysium Secretary Of Defense, Delacourt (a surprisingly miscast Jodie Foster) to overthrow Elysium's president (Faran Tahir). Still with me? Needless to say Max now has information that Delacourt will kill to get and is being hunted by her henchman, Kruger (Sharlto Copley) all the while trying to find his way to Elysium to heal himself. Throw in strength enhancing exo-skeletons, Frey's sick daughter and we have a Sci-Fi action soup with a lot of ingredients. Elysium does have a bit of an overcomplicated story and while it is not hard to follow, it just has a lot of elements to it as, once again, Blomkamp tackles the theme of 'the haves and the have-nots, as he did in District 9. We get the contrast of the over populated slum Earth has become to the spotless and perfect living conditions the wealthy enjoy in Elysium which, floats above in Earth's orbit as a constant reminder of how little we all are to them and how they are so above us. The message is not subtle but, Blomkamp skillfully keeps it from overwhelming things with so much else going on. There is a lot of fast paced action and with a complex story as we have, the director keeps things moving very quickly. The excess of plot doesn't slow things down though one feels it might have served the film if things were streamlined a little bit and there weren't quite so many players in the game. And as for the players, Damon and Braga are strong though Braga's Frey really doesn't get that much screen time till the last act so we don't identify with her as much even though we do get treated to flashbacks of she and Max as kids in an orphanage. Damon proves once again he can be an action star yet with some nice depth, giving Max some layers that enhances his character much like his surgically attached exo-skeleton enhances his strength and agility. Sadly it's veteran actress Foster who seems to be miscast here. She never quite strays into camp but, plays Delacourt like one half stereotypical bureaucratic douche and the other half Roger Moore era Bond villain complete with unidentifiable accent. It sticks out awkwardly in what is a serious Sci-Fi flick as does District 9 star Sharlto Copley, who is completely over the top as Kruger. Which is disappointing consider how good he was in D9. A calmer demeanor would have made him more threatening. Neither characterization seems to fit in with the more grounded performances of the leads and more serious tone of the film. Joining them is Wagner Moura who is just weak and tries to compensate by over doing it as Spider. An actor with a bit stronger presence who doesn't need to try as hard would have worked better. But, there is still plenty to like about this film. It's story may be complicated but, there is a lot of action to move it along and some delightfully gruesome moments splattered here and there as this future's weapons do make a mess. The last act especially is quite thrilling and has a nice emotional impact to go with all the explosions, gunfire and mechanically enhanced hand to hand combat. The SPFX are flawless, the design is breathtaking and the film could easily take place in District 9′s world. The score by Ryan Amon suits the film well, though reminded me of Dark Knight Rises a bit, but, that's not necessarily a bad thing. So, all in all I liked Elysium and recommend it especially if you enjoyed District 9. It's a bit meatier then most summer fair so, those who are tired of moody superheroes might like being given a bit more to chew on. Just be prepared that there is a complex story to digest along with the action and that a few of the veteran cast members just don't seem right for their roles. Entertaining despite it's flaws and another strong role from the versatile Damon.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Looks great, liked Damon, too many stereotypes, wrong focus","I liked District 9, it had a quirkiness that's lacking in this film. Elysium's visuals are stunning, and well thought out, but the concept is rife with South African sensitivities. The elite are shallow or downright evil, the military types are brutish, and the only people with any spark of goodness are the downtrodden.The movie starts with the premise that earth is massively over-populated, shows it, then veers immediately into a simplistic poor versus rich theme. At no time is any thought given to the basic issue of overpopulation or what it did to the planet and what could be done about it, it's just somehow the wealthy and powerful's fault.And I don't know how it works in South Africa, but there's a rich history of philanthropy in the U.S. At any rate, the director needs to pull his head out of wherever it's stuck and balance the equation. At least if he wants interesting movies.Matt Damon was very good, as were most of the actors given a chance to be. There was little to no development of the Elysium-side characters so it was hard to care one way or the other about them. In the end that made it difficult to care one way or the other about the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the More Enjoyable Movies of 2013,"Elysium stars Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley. It comes from the creator of District 9, Neil Blomkamp. Because of this many people have been comparing this movie to District 9, which I understand but don't agree with.Personally, I loved this movie. I felt that Damon was very good and Copley was excellent as Kruger. He was the highlight of the film for me. He has some pretty memorable quotes. The action is filmed really well, with some mind-blowing visuals. The world itself is engrossing and developed.Now the movie does has problems. I felt that Jodie Foster could have been played just as well by many other people. Also, I feel that some characters were just there to propel the story along. But I really liked the story. It reminded me of District 9 a little, which is never a bad thing.Overall, I loved this movie. There was never a dull moment, the story was intense, there were great visuals, and some really cool characters. It's not as good as District 9, but that doesn't make it horrible as some people are saying. If you like sci-fi, you will enjoy this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A worthy follow up to District 9, cant say much more though","Elysium is a worth follow up to Neil Blomkamp's District 9. Its got thrilling action, awesome visuals and a couple of really good performances. However it doesn't quite reach the level of greatness that District 9 achieved. Is that a bad thing? That depends, they are 2 separate movies, but with Neil Blomkamp's premier movie being so amazing you really cant help but walk into this movie with very high expectations. If there's one thing that I didn't find overly compelling about this movie is that the story just didn't impress me. The concept is excellent and a very scary view of what our future could very well look like if the gap between the middle class and upper class continues to grow but the story that was wrapped around the concept for some reason didn't fascinate me. The film has a great message and is very entertaining but the overall feeling I had when I walked out was ""That was a movie."" This film defiantly deserves to be watched as its very entertaining and fans of Matt Damon are sure to enjoy this film. District 9's Shartlo Copley does an excellent job as the films villain. I'd say in my opinion you could be fine waiting to just rent this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Suffers from bad direction and surprisingly poor performance by Jodie Foster.,"I should have avoided seeing this film opening weekend; a lesson I normally adhere to. Very disappointing.The story is pretty good and could/should have made for a very good sci-fi/action flick.The biggest drawback by far is the frenetic, confusing, shaky shooting and editing. This is something we've been seeing more of in the last several years for reasons unknown. The closest thing I've ever heard to a compliment on this style has been - ""It doesn't really bother me."" What I do hear often and personally agree with is ""It sucks. I can't tell what the hell's going on!"", with a close second being ""It's making me feel sick to my stomach."" No one has ever watched a ""traditionally"" filmed scene and said ""Wow, that was terrible, I could actually see everything that was happening and know exactly what was going on."" This new trend is just lazy and sloppy.The other notable distraction was Jodie Foster who is normally very solid and put in what I think is the worst performance of her career. It's not that the dialogue was bad, but her presentation was hideous. Trying to put on an air of aristocracy, her pronunciation was painful to watch and completely unbelievable.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lightweight Maybe. Great Fun Certainly.,"While this doesn't have the power and impact of District 9, there's no denying that Blomkamp is a sci fi master.With Elysium, he has created a dystopian future that Philip K Dick would be proud of.The set design and CGI work brilliantly together to create a beautifully realised world that is all at once recognisable and at the same time clearly of the future.This is a romp of a movie with great action sequences, believable characters and an in your face social subtext that although not fully explored, offers enough bite to create an emotional bond with the characters.Yes it was all a bit obvious and yes you've seen it loads of times before but it was so well done that I was having too much fun to care.Like District 9, this is a nice piece of body shock that while grim, never becomes pornographic.Matt Damon does a fine job. In fact, the acting on the whole was good. Sharlto is brilliant as ever with his absurd and hilarious marine. Only Foster feels like a fish out of water. She would have done better to have reprised her role from the Inside Man.All in all this was a very enjoyable summer blockbuster with a good story, decent characters and great CGI.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could've been better.,"The movie as a whole I would give it a 6/10. I saw it in Imax and it wasn't worth it. The message portrayed by the movie is good, however there are a few plot holes in it. Certain areas of the movie were dumb and didn't make sense (I don't want to list which parts to prevent any spoilers). The Trailer was also misleading as it made me believe that Matt Damon's Character had more action in him but in the movie it fluctuates. In the end it's the main message of the movie that stands out. Would I recommend watching it? well, if there was an option to watch it when tickets are 1/2 off then sure, just don't waste extra money on Imax for this.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Meh...at best.,"Matt Damn did fine with his acting as always and there were some pretty neat futuristic concepts with weapons and some of the ideas for action, however overall this was a pretty ridiculous and unimpressive movie. The dialogue and acting was nonsensical and not convincing at all, and there were so many quick camera shots even outside of the action scenes. Jodi Foster talked like she was a robot and Idk if that was on purpose or not. The plot was somewhat cliche too and could've been a lot more intriguing if it went in different and more creative directions. Not horrible yet nothing I'll watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Turns out even re-heated and big-studio-ized, Blomkamp's material is worth your time","In a world with a class divide so wide it's fatal to those on the lower end, with professional health care out of their reach, and people will go far to save their loved ones, including illegal immigration in spite of it being extremely risky... well, this movie was made(I had to go there). And those issues are addressed, albeit the heavy-handed-ness and naivety of their handling grows exponentially from the first to the last I mentioned. The rich live on Elysium(where we spend little time, making us ""miss it"", cherish what we do get, similar to The Hulk in The Avengers - with that said, at the end of the day, it does wind up feeling over-hyped, and the third act is when the low-level generic and predictable aspects double in concentration), named after the Ancient Greek version of paradise, where only the gods could go - presumably titled after Prometheus scored some points with the pretentious. It has magic healing beds. And... actually, that might be it. We learn nearly nothing about it, or the people of it. Except that it is as nice as Earth used to be, before it became one big third-world slum.Max(Damon, rendering sympathetic a not very fleshed out classic hero) is one of the 99% living there, with stop-and-frisks, police robot brutality(getting sarcastic with one of these AI will get you beaten up and/or offered meds) and awful jobs that you're lucky to even have. He dreams of ascending to the titular space station, and once he contracts cancer and has five days to live, he decides that it's time. Desperate, he agrees to have an exo-skeleton attached to him(yeah, it ain't a suit... we see the nasty, gut-wrenching surgery procedure; nearly every instance of violence in this is short and painful, making us feel every broken bone), and tries to go there. He will have to contend with the Secretary of Defense Delacourt(Foster as a hammy ice-queen, seeming determined to prove she can do horrible acting - she is one of the only two performances that are unintentionally funny, and the other one, Moura's Hollywood hacker Spider, is much less bothersome) and her asset, the creepy, insane hobo-beard of Kruger(Copley, giving us a truly despicably villain).Neill had to prove that District 9 wasn't just a fluke, and in spite of the heavily reused elements and structure(their freshness now grown stale), the more conventional approach here and the earlier mentioned preachy, idealistic take on these very current issues(thus serving more to add emotion than information to a complicated, nuanced issue; and yes, I am a bleeding heart Lib), he shows that he is near the top of the short list of sci-fi(the tech looks advanced and yet slapped together - utilitarian) directors to keep an eye on today. I do hope he gets help on the writing, as the dialog can be unwieldy, the plot bloated and this simultaneously goes to great lengths to craft impossible-to-overcome problems, and contrive ridiculously convenient fix-all solutions to them. The world is detailed and feels like we're already there, with the prevalent realism heightening the intensity of the appropriate-in-amount-and-length action scenes - think '88 John McClane. Use of slow-mo and hand-held camera, while infrequent, are the only real negative of these exciting sequences. Build-up to them is solid, at times swift and subtle, with sudden bursts of thrills, seldom anticipated and thus all the more effective.There is a lot of strong language and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of supplementing their Summer blockbuster with a side of social commentary - provided they can live with it being more focused on flavor than nutrition. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Elysium, maybe not what we expected from Neill","Can a psycho bad guy with a katana subvert an utopian futuristic semi ""planet""'s government? Probably not.Blomkamp's politic vision is even more explored and in-depth than District 9 (human's discrimination against another race ---> human's in-race discrimination with class struggle), the directing is good and cgi is VERY good (I wonder how a 2013's cgi is so much better than the 90% of today's movies); the main problem is the characters' flatness during all the movie, with Jodie Foster (the main ""villain"") being so boring and Matt Damon making so bad choices during all the movie's second half (how they can save a simple plot like that? They can't).PS - too much useless slow-mo, seems like hot garbage from Bay or Snyder (of course, with the due differences, Blomkamp can do his job).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium review,"This film represents a natural evolution of the rough, intense, deeply sociopolitical textures that Neill Bloomkamp previously worked with in District 9. Many comparisons can be made between D9 and Elysium; they're both particularly ugly films that face certain ugly truths through the thin veil of sci-fi, and they're both set in some of the trashiest slums ever filmed. At the same time, Elysium borrows a lot from the anime Battle Angel; both are stories in which the rich and poor are separated between the Earth and some high-flying city, and the characters fight their way to the top with some help from cybernetics. There are also individual scenes that reminded me of other things: one scene reminded me of Total Recall, the main henchman was like an evil version of Metal Gear's Solid Snake, I couldn't help but to think of the Ghost in the Shell saga and the works of William Gibson with all the high-tech surveillance ops and brain-hacking.Despite being somewhat unoriginal, Elysium is every bit as awesome and awe-inspiring as I expected. The action hits hard and rough, with frequent fights and shoot-outs, all made even more explosive and incredible with a plethora of futuristic gear. The film can get pretty gruesome, for there are a few exploding bodies and painful-looking injuries, but it's still nowhere near as gnarly as District 9. Some incredible slow-motion shots and gorgeous special effects make the excitement stand out even more. In between the action scenes, the film maintains even pacing with strong conflicts and quality visuals.As noted above, the story covers pretty standard sci-fi ground. It does employ some interesting concepts though: the actual Elysium space station is a magnificent utopic space habitat (a Stanford Torus design), the likes of which is often envisioned by futurists and sci-fi authors, but has never actually been produced on the big screen for some odd reason. The world of Elysium is visually fantastic and really cool.The actual plot is solidly-built, with its foundations firmly set in conflict and action. It takes some really interesting twists and turns; the climax is a little predictable, but everything leading up to it is a real roller-coaster ride. Characters aren't particularly deep; the villains are especially one-dimensional. However, the film does its best to humanize the heroes and the poor people they fight for, to best emphasize its key themes. The themes are not all that subtle, and the political stance is not something I personally agree with, but I appreciate the effort and nobility of the film, as it underscores such hot topics as immigration, healthcare, and class warfare.This film uses pretty rough and gritty photography and editing. The camera does shake around a bit during some scenes, but it didn't agitate me nearly as much as I thought it would: I could see the action perfectly well, and I thought a lot of the camera angles and compositions were cool. Acting is alright: Matt Damon is a pretty generic action hero here, Sharlto Copley (hey, the dude from District 9) is flipping crazy, and Alice Braga offers the most touching performance of the lot. Surprisingly, Jodie Foster is the weakest link, thanks to her butchery of the French accent. Writing is not bad. This picture has really cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty good too.I felt this was a perfectly satisfying and awesome sci-fi adventure, despite a few quibbles. District 9 remains a fresher, more original, and more deeper experience; I think it's because it offered something nobody had really seen before. Elysium, on the other hand, offers something we've all seen before, so it hasn't struck as hard with audiences. Personally, I think I prefer Elysium over D9, for having a more complex plot, more incredible action, and more far-out ideas. Both would make a great double-feature, and I do hope director Neill Bloomkamp continues to pump out similarly raw and uncompromising pictures. If you're a big sci-fi fan like me, Elysium is definitely worth seeing; I'd recommend it as a rental to casual viewers.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Movie with a mission-statement,"ELYSIUM's slimline plot springs few surprises. I liked the contrast between the space-station's cure-all tanning pods and Earth's still overstretched hospitals. It's clear that the $100,000,000 budget mostly went on CGI. The effects are great if not exactly fresh. The cast do the best they can with under-scripted characters. Matt Damon recycles Jason Bourne to good effect. Jodie Foster phones in her role as a Elysium's answer to Donald Romfeld. Sharlto Copley does a Johnny Depp panto turn as Jodie's arch henchman Kruger.Pretending that a South African township is the San Diego of tomorrow doesn't entirely come off, and Elysium itself is somewhat insubstantial: I was reminded of the threatened enclave in TV's THE WALKING DEAD. But - hey - maybe this is where our great-grandchildren are headed. Like Blomkamp's 2009 sci-fi thriller DISTRICT 9, ELYSIUM is a movie with a heavy-handed mission statement: share your toys, boys and girls!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Striving for relevance,"Neill Blomkamp's sophomore feature serves more as a statement of intent, than a calling card for future reference. Within the confines of parochial script owing too much to Hollywood epic conclusiveness and too little to the restraint shown with the phenomenal debut of ""District 9"", Blomkampp struggles to imbue a sense of relevance to a heavily socially-aware storyline.In the year 2154 with resources strained and class warfare restrained by corporational dictatorship, the rich of the world have shipped themselves off-planet to an idyllic resort called Elysium. Detached from earthly woes and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, seemingly extrapolating Wolverine's rapid healing gene, the wealthy live in a cocoon of self-glee, whilst still gaining dividends from Earth profits. With the accumulation of fortunes brought to an extreme, the rest of humanity is brought to a state of sustainable poverty in a fascist state policed by mechanised droids and system institutions running like clock-work through the use of robot figureheads. In a run-down Los Angeles ex-criminal Max (Matt Damon) tries to straighten out his life. Unfortunately for him a work accident leaves him radiated with but five days of life, needing powerful drugs to keep him functional. Left with few options Max attempts to break through to Elysium to use the almost magical medical capabilities available there. However en route he comes across valuable secrets, which make him the most wanted man in the Solar System....On several levels ""Elysium"" is a riveting piece of sci-fi with what - in my opinion - is the best CGI effects ever to be registered on film. Unlike most generic computerised special effects Blomkampp brings some much needed refreshing fingerprint to his animated CGI with trademark Halo-inspired drones, robot, exo-skeletons all moving with such specific swagger, that Blomkampp has cemented his unique style and usurps the right to say that despite the onslaught of special effects this is a rare example of a movie, where the CGI actually functions for the story, not the other way around. Blomkampp's specificity is further underlined by the mixing of the decrepit atrophy of humanity (in the form of squalid slums) seamlessly intersecting with technology of the future, creating a captivatingly hideous world, which lingers in memory far longer than any other modern CGI-bursting picture. Aided with some memorable performances by the wickedly devious Jodie Foster (as Elysium's secretary of defence Delacourt) and the efficient madness of Sharlto Copley as the ruthless South African mercenary-spy Kruger, ""Elysium"" has multitudes of ingredients for the creation of a sci-fi classic, even to outdo ""District 9"".This time however the script turns out to be the biggest let-down for writer-director Blomkampp, who fuses the world around a story, which lacks in creativity, instead making that up with blasts and a needless attempt to 'change the world'. With cumbersome, if morally sound, social messages heavy-handedly bringing attention to the plight of the poor, the increasingly widening wealth gap, the overreach of corporate power as well as to health systems geared towards money, the movie topples into familiar traps, overly relying on Hollywood sci-fi standards to push the message through (unlike for example ""Children of Men""). Nonetheless ""Elysium"" is visually powerful, even stunning, providing belief that a new profound voice for high-octane cinema has emerged. Now all he requires is some aid in delivering a story suitable for his virtuosic use of CGI magic.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good visuals, bad writing","Elysium had promise, it showed that right in the beginning. It could have been a grand movie, but the writing was way below par for what it was trying to achieve. It tried addressing different very serious topics, but failed. It wanted to portray the suffering of common man, but didn't. Too much was just passed by to keep the story arc within the movie runtime I believe.Neill Blomkamp is a good director, with District 9 being a perfect example as well. And he did a great job with writing that movie as well, but not this one. I fail to understand why that is. It could be he was pressed for time, it could be that he just didn't care that much about the script this time, I don't know. Matt gives a solid performance as usual and as expected by him. I think Jodie Foster was not well used at all. With her brilliant acting talent, I believe even herself she might feel let down by this one. The buck stops with the director on this one as well. He should know how to use the resources he has, and there is no better and powerful resource than Jodie.Also that Sharlto Copley accent, boy that had me wanting to give a 4. So cringe-worthy at times that it seems he is making fun of the viewer by deliberately talking that way. I understand that he is speaking Engligh in the Afrikaans accent, but boy was that way confusing and mixed up with so many other accents that it took away from the role instead of adding to it. I've always regarded him as a good actor but this performance really misses the mark.Anyways, this should not keep you away from watching a visual masterclass. It is a good action flick, nothing more nothing less. You should give it a try and maybe you will like it more going into it with average expectations. I did not like it too much, personally I went into it expecting so much from it that my own expectations for it let me down.I was thinking halfway through the movie that maybe it deserves a 7, but not quite. So a 6.5 from me, maybe, or maybe a solid 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Dull Sermon about Obamacare and Open Borders in the Guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic,"""Elysium"" is a dull sermon about Obamacare and open borders in the guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic. The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy- handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that ""Elysium"" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's die-hard fans.It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes.Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film.There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away.I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message ""Elysium"" sends: ""It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have.""This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities.If the Earthlings of ""Elysium"" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and ""meet the new boss; same as the old boss."" The real revolution starts when we look within and outside ourselves with love.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Neil Blomkamp does it again, after District 9 he delivers us Elysium.","We went to see this movie last night, I have to admit one thing when leaving the theater, that Blomkamp surely knows how to make an entertaining movie, that sticks in your head and that makes you discuss and debate social and moral issues. And that is what makes a movie strong for me, the mere fact that when the movie is over, the discussion is still on.Yes I can agree with comments that this movie isn't up to par with D-9, but it is also a different kind of movie, it is a new story. The only similarity I could find, is that Blomkamp has a love for depicting a black/white society, just as he did in D-9. He takes on the moral high ground when it comes to poor vs rich, adequate health care for the rich and the more improvised inadequate system for all others. That is quite clear from the get go, but I don't mind that, cuz if you want the bring something into the public eye you need to go to the extremes, and that is what he is doing in this movie, there's no gray area. You either belong to the elite, or you don't and you will do anything to be part off it.And it is exactly this premise that is the building foundation of this movie. The characterization is building on a slow pace in the beginning, and yes it could have been done slightly different to give it a more easy pace for watching, but in the end you do realize why Neil has chosen this approach. In the whole of things, the build up of characters, the slow pacing in the plot, the flashback back and forth all nicely come together and give this movie quite a high credibility and an understanding in why Damon's character does what he does and the decisions he makes in the end. We witness how Max (Matt Damon) transitions from being an irresponsible joker and gangster into the anti-hero he becomes at the end. I hear people complaining about the fact that Damon wasn't Bourne enough (for the fighting scenes) but that would be completely laughable as Max isn't a military man, he comes from the streets, he is a survivalist, someone who will only fight to survive. If Blomkamp would have given him unmatched fighting skills that only well trained military would have, it just would have destroyed the whole character. No this guy, lives and thrives on emotions and on his wits on solving a problem, and that is just exactly how he fights, which is a very good thing and it works perfectly.Scharlto Copley on the other hand, makes a perfect villain, my god is this guy good. He was great in the A-team, sublime in D-9 and does he nail the bad guy in Elysium, this guy one to watch for the future. As Agent Kruger he sets down a very great villain, a psychopathic killer on a leach by a corrupt government Secretary (A very good and convincing Jodie Foster). But Kruger (Copley) undergoes a transition just as Max, only it is in the opposite way, he sees a chance to get rid off the government leach and gain the ultimate power through Max, and it is that where the whole movie is building up to. These 2 guys, both with a destiny to fulfill, only it's inevitable that they wouldn't duel as they cross paths right before they reach their goal.Without giving to much away from the plot, the ending and final sequence and scene is quite fitting and it ties the whole story together, and leaves you (the audience) with some serious moral issues to think over and to discuss with your friends.I know I have enjoyed this movie very much, and I am looking forward to see more work of Neil Blomkamp and Sharlto Copley. And in final a big cheer for the magnificent work from the WETA workshop for the special effects and the decors, they're truly breathtaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Began intelligently, ended stupidly","Good story premise of an artificial planet, Elysium, where only the rich and otherwise privileged live in the mid-21th Century after earth has been ravaged by class warfare. The riff raff still suffer on Apocalyptic earth and live like criminals/animals. Effectively depicted was the ravaged look of a potentially human-destroyed earth(actually real life living conditions in today's District Federal in Mexico City...Ugggh). Matt Damon's character wants in the worst way to get up to Elysium to save his life. Of course, lots of obstacles to that come up. Duh.The film broke down IMO when Damon's character got to Elysium and the explosions, bangs, gun play and other adventure film idiocy took over for the mostly intelligent beginning and the story resolved into a standard sci-fi adventure flick with way too many suspensions of logic and disbelief required to get through it. For one major flaw, where was the premium Elysium defense system when Damon's ship arrived to invade it? You would think the filthy rich would have a super-duper foolproof setup to foil any mongrel humans from getting in and soiling that fine nest. But, no. Thus, they got in.

Worlds Apart...,"Director Neill Blomkamp's ELYSIUM is another of his futuristic nightmares, using the titular, super-sized space station to represent the ultimate, upper class world. It's a floating paradise, populated by the ultra-elites, who hover above the ruined Earth below, where the teeming poor struggle to survive.The symbolism / metaphors are obvious, but never preachy or heavy-handed.Enter Max (Matt Damon), a man with a criminal record, just trying to maintain his job and his sanity. When Max finds himself forced to commit a crime, he has no idea how huge the crime actually is. Soon, he's on the radar of a corrupt government official (Jodie Foster), and her team of homicidal mercenaries.Mr. Blomkamp is so adept at bringing these dystopian visions to life, that it's astonishing. This is helped immensely by his superior CGI and realistic characters. Mr. Damon's Max comes across as an authentic ""loser""-turned antihero. He's out for himself, until circumstances arise that challenge his selfishness. Ms. Foster gets to really play up the wickedness, making us hate her right away!Special mention must go to Sharlto Copley, and his utterly reprehensible Kruger.

Elysium: A gated community with one hell of a HOA,"Elysium was by no means what I had hoped for but was an enjoyable theater experience nonetheless for any SciFi nerd. The CG was superb and the set and design teams did an amazing job. Overall the acting was effective, primarily from Jodie Foster(Delacourt) and Sharlto Copley(Kruger), complimented by the rest of the cast who were fairly believable in their roles.Where Elysium falls short is primarily in the story. There were so many plot holes that it actually began to hinder me from completely enjoying the film. Truth be told its a SciFi and plot holes are expected but in abundance can become overwhelming. *********SPOILERS BELOW**********************SPOILERS**********My biggest grudge with the film was why the inhabitants of Elysium horded the machines that were capable of curing any physical ailment. You would think a machine of such capabilities would be hard to come by or cost some unforeseen toll for using it. Unfortunately, they appear in the film as a standard household appliance. Not only that, the machines work in mere seconds!! The film even contradicted itself having Med shuttles with over 30 machines in them. If every house already has one of these machines, it works instantly, there is no war on Elysium, and the main concern in keeping Elysium secure is keeping the inhabitants of earth out, why in gods name were these shuttles even created? Better yet, why weren't they already on earth healing people? Even the machines themselves contradicted the purpose of Elysium. Elysium was created because of overpopulation on earth, which inevitably leads to pollution. If you've created a machine that essentially is the fountain of youth, are you not setting yourself up for overpopulation on Elysium?The idea of Elysium wasn't established to the audience. To me Elysium was nothing more than a gated community for the rich and famous. There were no signs of its actual independence or separation from earth aside from its obvious distance. In fact, it was Elysium that still needed earth. Only by standing on the shoulders of the many could these people reach such positions of power. The inhabitants of earth simply had to go on strike at the factories of these powerful people or boycott their products until their ethical and humane demands of being healed were met. Not only that, if history has taught anyone anything people are willing to go to war for less. Boston Tea Party much?Another small but annoying plot hole was when Elysium was reset. In resetting itself the film clearly showed the entire place shutting down i.e. losing power, lights, etc. Remember we are living in space on a man made creation with artificial gravity and atmosphere and we've suddenly lost power? Lets just think about this a few seconds...******END SPOILERS******Don't let my critical nature prevent anyone from seeing this film in theaters. It really wasn't that bad of a movie. It wasn't as good as Pacific Rim, but the films more positive areas made it reasonably close.What the film should have done was made living on Elysium itself the very cure to ailments. You have a beautiful man made world with an atmosphere and every other element controlled by humans. The world was essentially pure and could be maintained so, allowing such things as long life and health to be possible. Even faster regeneration from physical trauma could be feasible if explained by mixing certain elements into the atmosphere. To contrast the beautiful world, the entire population of Elysium would have to be ugly. By ugly I mean share similar personality traits like Delacourt and Kruger who abuse the people of earth for their personal gain. X leads to Y and Matt Damon goes to Elysium for whatever reason, but ends up destroying it. The way Elysium is destroyed happens in a way that it is totally disintegrated so it doesn't leave massive debris to be sucked into earths gravitational pull. Instead all that is left from Elysium is a glitter like haze which comes into our atmosphere. The SciFi twist would be the ashes of Elysium inadvertently begin to heal the people of earth.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Worth the watch, especially for South Africans","So I went to see the latest epic sci-fi film Elysium, the new movie by the South African born director Neill Blomkamp who brought us District 9. Remember the movie that made the word ""Prawns"" a swear word, yeah that one. As before the viewers from South Africa are privy to many of the insider jokes.For those who don't know, District 9 was great, few movies in the Science fiction genre can really claim to be truly original, it could. It was dark, while still being humorous, satire mainly focusing on the treatment of an insect-like aliens confined to, in essence, concentration camps in South Africa.Elysium actually shares many of the main themes of class, xenophobia, greed and totalitarianism, but this time round it's far more mainstream in it's conception. It is played out in a dystopian future, to say the world is a polluted mess is an understatement of colossal proportions, so naturally the rich have left it. The privileged have moved on to a space station called, you guessed it, Elysium. Naturally this station is nothing short of an utopia of living ease, many stunning gardens, people dressed in Armani for lunch and speak eloquent french while doing so. This all happens while those less fortunate below suffer a barbaric life of squalor. Matt Damon plays Max the protagonist a blue-collar ex- criminal trying to walk the straight and narrow in the world below, fighting in vain against the totalitarian system. Some comical times in how he talks to his mechanical superiors though. Then he gets a ""Full dose"" of radiation in an accident at his menial day job and thus has the required incentive to find a way to get up top for treatment. Oh, by the way, those on the station above have a medical table device straight out of the Stargate series (which Blomkamp was a 3D Animator for) that will heal you from anything, and I do mean anything well you'll see.Now the cinematography and effects are phenomenal but the plot, well its not in the same league as what we came to expect. It's formulaic in its predictability but the formula is tried and tested and it's done so because it works, but still, disappointing. That being said I came out of the cinema entertained so can't really complain.What I have to mention is that the performance that stole the movie for me (and the source of most of mine and fellow viewers laughs) was not that of Matt Damon nor of Jodie Foster, the nemesis, but that of Sharlto Copley (he was brilliant in District 9 as well) who plays the mercenary aptly named Kruger who is charged by Jodie's character to hunt down Max. I say aptly named because like Copley himself, Kruger is a South African 'Boet' through and through with an accent that is truly pushed to its limits. Seriously, he sings the whole of Jan Pierewiet, I swear! and the best is when he entices Max with this pearler ""Ja, Lekker and other Kak"". Even his helicopter has the South African flag on it which apparently is still the same in 2154.So in conclusion, it's not winning any screenplay awards but it's worth the watch especially if you are from South Africa, then you won't be able to help yourself laugh at the awesome Saffa vernacular.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting futuristic action film,"Elysium is another film which depicts what earth will be like in the future and how our society and civilisation will survive. In this story the classes are even more divided and the rich and powerful all reside on the perfect habitat that is the space station Elysium, while the rest of the human race are struggling on overpopulated earth. The story follows Max, who Matt Damon does a great job of portraying, as circumstances lead him to go on a mission to disrupt the way of life and the inequality between the two.This film has some great action which is bound to keep all viewers entertained and the whole futuristic aspect makes it more interesting. There were quite a few memorable characters in this film one of which was an unpredictable and manic Elysium agent played by Sharlto Copley. Also the relationship between Max and his childhood friend was quite moving and added more meaning to the story.There were some gory moments in the film which I noticed shocked some of the audience but these were few and far between. Overall I think this was an enjoyable and gripping film which is something quite original and definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best disappointment of the Summer,"Considering how many things it does right, ""Elysium"" is still a major disappointment. From the same director of the wildly original ""District 9"", Elysium similarly uses a futuristic syfy story to talk about issues that run rampant in the world today. The film follows the story of Max (played by Matt Damon), a down and out guy living in the year 2154, who aspires to eventually travel to Elysium, a luxurious artificial habitat made for the one percent of the overpopulated Earth to live on. Jodie Foster plays the role of a political figure on Elysium who seeks an opportunity to plot a coup, and Sharlto Copley gives a great performance as a mentally disturbed and extremely violent crony of Foster who is sent to kill Damon. The supporting cast though is not as charismatic. Every other character in the film is basically a Latino gangster who contributes to the struggling resistance group on Earth.There is also another side to ""Elysium"", and that is being a summer blockbuster. While not tackling political issues, Elysium is a full on summer action flick; evil robots and all. The fighting sequences though sometimes approach a Quentin Tarantino level of bloody, and by the end of the movie I really just wanted the story to move along without any more stale fist fights.Anyone hoping for a full fledged successor to ""District 9"" will be disappointed by ""Elysium"". Yet Neill Blomkamp has created a film that has enough appeal to attract the more educated Movie-goer and hormonal teenage boys to become a box office success. It may not be perfect, but ""Elysium"" is one of the better movies of 2013.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie is horrid,"1 means awful. I wouldn't use awful for this movie. I would say it should have never been conceived. This movie should have been aborted. Nothing about this movie is original. It borrows from most half-decent sci-fi flicks and makes it worse. I mean was this supposed to be a parody? What was the director trying to accomplish? Seriously, Jet Li's ""The One"" is a much better movie than this. I cannot believe that this steaming pile of trash has passed for a movie. Well, maybe I can since Sony has shoved this steaming pile of rotting cabbage in my face every other commercial. People probably only saw this movie because it was shoved in their face and felt a need to see it. This movie is for the intellectually challenged.

A surprisingly well-considered morality tale about the haves and the have nots,"This movie is ultimately about the other half. The holy grail they are looking for is an instant medical cure which serves as a good metaphor for a lot of other things. At any rate, we can all appreciate what happens when one's health goes bad.It is a pleasure to see Diego Luna on the screen again. He is a charming actor, who unfortunately has a bit part in this reel, but at least his part is well-played. Copley plays his part to the hilt and Jodie Foster is no slouch either. Her French is quite convincing.I have observed some of the complaints about plot errors but they are poorly founded. It is highly likely that medical technology would remain restricted - it's about profits, people. If you look at how fast the people on Earth were pirating tech, you can see why the meds didn't make landfall. It's the same reason why Intel doesn't have a fab in China - the tech would be long gone in a matter of months.In any case, this movie pushes all the buttons. It's well-written and well-acted and reminds us of a few human truths. We don't see what happens after the curtains close and that is a wise decision by the producers, as it will not be pretty. It's very kind of them to close on a happy note,",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium: scifi socialism wrapped in contemporary issues,"Elysium: scifi socialism wrapped in contemporary issues Matt Damon reached for the stars in his new scifi flick Elysium. Instead he fell to Earth, with a loud thud, as the story line was revealed. Set in the year 2154, with a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles as its backdrop, Damon must fight his way through two worlds for his own survival and the rest of humanity. Wealthy elites live on a gigantic space platform named Elysium, while the rest of Earth's population lives in the ruins below. Twenty-second century Los Angeles is populated with millions of Hispanic individuals who have reclaimed a city once under their auspices. Very little work is available except for a few giant corporate structures managed by the Elysium hierarchy. Damon's female interest has a child who is in her last days of life. With our hero facing his own demise from an industrial accident, the clock is ticking for both to get to Elysium where cures are available. Numerous obstacles are placed in the path of the protagonist Damon before he can achieve passage for himself and others to the elites floating abode. Jodi Foster is engaging as the Defense Secretary in Elysium. Contemporary social themes overburden this film's futuristic settings begging the question, did the White House edit this film. A war between the rich and poor is continually emphasized. Climate change is creatively worked into some of the scenes. Yet, the most provocative theme is sophisticated medical services are only ordained for the rich, sound familiar. Director Neill Blomkamp, denies in numerous interviews, that Elysium was intended to showcase America's current problems. Any other interpretation would be antithetical to the evidence before the audience. Damon's performance is flat, as though he was forced to perform in a venue out of his league. Half-hearted direction makes the interplay between the actors lame and uninteresting. As an avid fan of scifi, I would wait until this one comes to cable. It has very little future.

One of the Most Important Films of Its Time,"With this film, I have had a revelation about how much I am truly learning to love and appreciate the science-fiction genre of film AND books. Even though this was an original screenplay, I was actually extremely motivated to go ahead and pick up Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" (which became the very celebrated film, ""Bladerunner""). In doing so, I think I have already found a new author I will probably enjoy for the rest of my lifetime. To you, Neill Blomkamp, I send my regards.Outside of the Earth, there is a spacestation built, called Elysium, where all of the wealthy of Earth relocate themselves to be away from the pollution and scum of the poor folk on the planet. Our protagonist, Max, runs into a mishap and must find a way to Elysium so that he can be healed in one of their miracle beds. These miracle beds allow the wealthy to live on and on, only to be killed by other humans, yet they are able to be immune to anything nature throws their way, to an extent.When it comes to the acting in ""Elysium"", I must applaud every single actor. They have all given a fantastic performance, especially Matt Damon as Max. Not only is he layered, but I believe that many people who see ""Elysium"" will easily relate to him. He is a hard worker, much like the rest of the society in which we live. For a character not too focused upon, I must say that Matt Damon's old friend's daughter is well-casted with an excellent little girl. My heart cracked a little at the thought of her having cancer and dying slowly. Our two main villains, played by Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley are just extraordinary. They both suited their roles so very well, and I truly cannot see another person playing either. These were one-of-a-kind performances. The film is just perfectly casted, in all accounts.The writing of this film is another one of Neill Blomkamp's exceeding accomplishments at writing political commentary in cinema. Not only is this a groundbreaking film, it is the type of film I would hold up to the likes of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""District 9"" (Blomkamp's past film). Neill simply manufactures brilliance within his storytelling, and his directing compliments what he writes for the screen. He knows exactly what to do with his ideas, how to execute them properly, and then he just goes along his merry way and crafts it into a subtle masterpiece. Excellent, EXCELLENT job, Blomkamp. You get less acknowledgments with the film academies than you deserve. This film also has some of the most jaw-dropping moments I've ever seen put to the silver screen.With ""Elysium"" being a science-fiction action film, many people are probably wondering how the special effects were. I'll be frank: these designs for anything from ships to futuristic areas, to nonexistent laser weapons, to the stars in space is phenomenal. There are't many films with such great special effects, but it doesn't really shock me, being that this is a Blomkamp film.The score, the familiar bass of ""Inception"", is definitely suitable. I wish this type of soundtrack would be used on more films nowadays. There is something truly intense about the note played in one solo cloud of thunder.""Elysium"" is brilliant. There are no words in my vocabulary to describe how excellent the film really is. If you enjoy the genre, it is definitely a must-see for you. If you want a straightforward action film, it is for you. There is so much to enjoy about the film.With all of that said, I'd be shocked if you hadn't already guessed what my fanboy self was going to rate the film with.IMDb says that Blomkamp's next film, ""Chappie"" will not be released until 2015, so we've got a while to wait. But it will be well worth it, I'm sure. Check this out, readers.Merry Christmas, and God bless!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great ring to it,"Synopsis: An ex-con working in a droid factory is accidentally exposed to radiation and is given only 5 days to live. His only hope is to make it to Elysium (space station for elites). However, things gets complicated when some extremely confidential data is downloaded in his brain.Most of the attempts to infiltrate Elysium are shown in need of Health pod -- a device that can cure anything. Reserved only for the citizens of Elysium, health pods are not available to the residents of Earth. And this forms the basis of the movie.The director has tried to weave in moral fibers within an out and out action movie and is largely successful in it. I also liked that he kept pace of the movie fast. While blending in elements of emotion, he made sure that it doesn't drag. Soundtrack is also nice and matches the overall mood of the story.Matt Damon gives a good performance as an ex-con who is driven by his selfish motives. He doesn't care for the data stored in his brain and what good it could do to the Earth. All he wants is to save his own life by any means necessary. Another thing that I liked was that the director refrained from making protagonist a superhero. The exo-skeleton that was fixed on to him gave him subtle advantages. If this was any other movie, the exo-skeleton would probably have allowed him to become Hulk.Jodie Foster as the iron lady leaves an impression. Though there is hardly any character development, it is shown that all her actions (particularly Immigration handling) are a result of her strong conviction and responsibility to save Elysium from the dystopic Earth.Sharlto Copley as the sociopath Kruger deserves a special mention. His character gives this movie what it exactly needed. A strong and maniacal antagonist.Though set in a dystopian future, this movie raises superb questions. Should special medical care be allowed only to the rich? Don't the life of poor mean anything? Can the Class divide be abolished in some way? It's great to see a movie with a real message behind it. Hope other directors take a hint and make movies with similar themes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hippo as the Hero,"Greetings again from the darkness. Social commentary does not automatically make a movie ""smart"". In fact, commentary done poorly could be labeled the exact opposite. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp's critically acclaimed sci-fi feature District 9 was creative in its approach to social issues. Unfortunately, his follow-up is a sloppy, big budget mess with too many writing shortcuts and what may be the worst performances of Jodie Foster's career.Earth in the year 2154 is an over-populated, polluted disaster that looks like what we saw in Wall-E, only with people. Earth is so bad, it has been evacuated by the ultra-rich ... an obvious statement on the ""one percenters"". The poor and downtrodden earthlings spend their lives dreaming of getting to Elysium, the space station paradise that houses the elite and is only a 19 minute shuttle ride away. On Elysium, the houses are stunning and the lawns perfectly manicured. Oh, and technology has re-imagined tanning booths into a medical marvel that can cure anything from zits to cancer. This advancement is the main reason earthlings risk everything to reach Elysium. See those poor folks have only shoddy hospitals ... an obvious statement on universal healthcare.After an industrial accident, Max (Matt Damon)is desperate to reach Elysium so he can save his own life. As expected, his selfishness evolves into focused heroism after he runs into his childhood crush Frey (Alice Braga) and her leukemia-stricken daughter. Getting yourself to Elysium is not so easy thanks to the protective nature of Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster). She is working with greedy businessman William Fichtner and earth-based mercenary Sharlto Copley to plot her political coup on Elysium ... just in case you forgot that the rich are really bad people.There is a data theft plot that, if re-directed, could open up the Elysium advantages to the entire population ... an obvious statement on open immigration. In between all of the political statements Blomkamp does throw in plenty of explosions, gun fights, aggressive robots and enough CGI effects to keep any sci-fi fan entertained. There is even a battle of exoskeleton suits between Copley and Damon. Where Arnold once said ""Get your a** to Mars"", I can't in good faith say the same thing about Elysium.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great .. could have been superb,"Neill Blomkamp (District 9) is a good writer director with a near-mastery of set design and CGI. If he could learn to take his lead-foot off the ""social allegory"" pedal he could be superb. But that is not likely to happen anytime soon, because Bloomkamp is clearly attracted to the Moral Pulpit like a moth to the flame. Not that this is a bad thing. At a time when Hollywood does not know whether it is coming or going (literally -- if you haven't been paying attention, Tinseltown product is now being released in Russia before it ever gets to Cleveland) it is refreshing indeed to encounter a film as finely crafted as Elysium. So well crafted indeed that Bloomkamp has unintentionally made it remarkably easy for his audience to ignore most (if not all) of the preaching and simply enjoy one of the most fluid sci-fi actioners since Alien. That's how good this guy is. As much as he would love to get each viewer alone for 6 hours and explain precisely what is wrong with our world - DUH -- he simply cannot resist the temptation to be an entertainer first, and a cleric second. Highly recommended. And for those with lingering doubts, a newly ""buffed"" Matt Damon has become the new Kurt Russell and a genuine Action Figure. IRONY ALERT: Damon could not be cajoled into doing the last Bourne but his role here is little more than Bourne Redux. Ditto for Jodie Foster, who turned up her nose at the last Hannibal, but here gives a performance that is little more than a placeholder for action to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek on Steroids,"This is a decent movie. The story is an old one, dating back to Metropolis and in the not- to-distant past on Star Trek. A group of ""haves"" have removed themselves from the ""have-nots"" to a castle in the air. It is a self sustaining place where the lucky are able to live picket fence existences with little conflict. Unfortunately for them, there are people down on earth who are quite aware of their presence and would like a piece of the action. Matt Damon is a malcontent with a whole host of problems who finds himself the chosen one, through a series of events, not all of his own choosing. The movie is striking in that the world created visually defies the imagination. Unfortunately, there are so many holes in the plot, so much suspension of disbelief, that things just go too easily. Jody Foster is quite good as a sort of iron maiden who devotes her life to the status quo at any cost. Unfortunately, the infrastructure proves to be pretty fragile, considering how much effort and expense has been put into it. It is remindful of Mr. Spock disabling an entire planet by shooting at a single computer console. Backups and fail-safe systems seem to be lacking. Still it's a fun ride and keeps the audience in suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another sci-fi that fails to capitalise on an interesting premise,"Elysium rested upon quite a thought provoking premise, and one that is becoming more and more relevant for our times. One of my major gripes however was how familiar the whole film felt. There was a definite feel of District 9 to the futuristic earth, and the tone and atmosphere was nothing revolutionary. Blomkamp creates masterful and beautiful visuals in his direction, but the similarities to District 9 were a little too jarring for me.The plot was largely predictable and didn't always move along at a steady pace. There seemed to be some indecision as to whether this wanted to be an action movie or a dystopian film with an underlying moral message. Ultimately it found itself stuck somewhere between the two. When it did come to the action I found it slightly derivative although not unenjoyable.Matt Damon was fine... nothing special and nowhere near his best. Jodie Foster's performance was rather odd as I'm not sure what she was doing with her accent. Copley's villain was a tad tedious and I was bored with him almost as soon as he was introduced.There is nothing dramatically with Elysium, however I did expect better from a team up of Blomkamp and Damon.Unfortunately what could have been quite a clever sci-fi ended up being rather generic.

A good entertaining movie,"This was a nice surprise as I didn't even know this movie existed before watching it on TV. The main characters and the futuristic science fiction made me watch it.I think they could have better addressed the issues of an over-populated and diseased Earth (that can indeed resemble our future planet). From a macro story of the Earth's population, the movie focus too quickly on the micro story of two or three main characters.The golden Paradise of Elysium is poorly shown, it almost felt like there wasn't any money left to show it properly as we only get glimpses of what is going on in there... This is in my opinion the biggest mistake of the movie.The whole story is a good one, heartwarming even, but sometimes skips logical steps perhaps to prevent the movie from being too long but also making it just one more science fiction story that we enjoy watching but will hardly 'revisit' from time to time.The acting was great, I felt sorry about Matt Damon's anger and troubled life.

The plot had more holes than a colander. The 2 dimensional and unimaginative writers do nothing to develop the characters in fact there is a scene were the president of Elysium himself chases down a terrorist. What? Little or no time is given to the people of Elysium much less Jodie Foster's character who only has a hand full of speaking parts. The only reason I went to see this movie was to see Jodie Foster knock one out of the park, again. She is so talented and has always been very selective about the films she stars in. They either cut out a lot of her parts or paid her a lot of money to act in this poorly thought out film.

The fact that the average score for this movie was a 7 is surely a sign that the human race is doomed. It was fun while it lasted. Goodbye everyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"There Are Many Things I Liked, Except The Film As A Whole. ♦ 62%","So intriguing the first instances of the film I sat there anticipating one hell of a dystopian flick. Jodie Foster entered the scene and I knew how the film would turn out.Starting off the depiction of a beautiful, futuristic planet-kinda place called Elysium, the plot speaks about a kid's dream to go and live there. As Earth is (evidently) running low on basic amenities & high on population & toxins & radiations, this new place is a refuge. The weapons, the instrument, the medical healer and the trans-human theme are so interesting I was gob-smacked at the pure charm of 'em. But, then an idiotic, self-destructive drama coils in which not only pops unanswered questions but also makes the whole setup look foolish.Not speaking about plot holes, Elysium doesn't pay attention to its characters as the second part tries to act smart and dives into a confusing state of blunder. Faux pas in movies, that is what Elysium is.Although, the concepts and the ideas are worth watching over a fine screenplay of 100 minutes. The action scenes are sumptuous. And there was no need to touch the whole shebang with romance, thereby creating unnecessary emotion.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for a one-time watch!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Gap Between Rich and Poor,"In the world of ""Elysium"" set a century hence, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor has reached its ultimate level. The rich are now floating above the earth in a utopia set-up in space. The poor remain to suffer on the squalid wasteland that remains on Earth.Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is a laborer who was stricken with severe radiation illness in a work accident. His only chance to recover is via the healing facilities located up there in Elysium, exclusive for the use of Elysium citizens. Max seeks help from renegade hacker Spider (Wagner Moura) to smuggle him across. Max was provided with an android- like exoskeleton (which gave him superhuman strength) and a cerebral link (to steal vital Elysium information).However, the powers-that-be represented by the fanatical Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) makes sure the impossible immigration laws are strictly enforced and their floating space station remains pure. She has her sociopathic enforcer Kruger (a frequently unintelligible Sharlto Copley) on Earth to make sure no ""undesirables"" ever crosses over the line, and that includes Max.The social message is very clear in this film, criticizing the great financial divide and its diabolical implications, especially with regards to health care. Director Neil Blomkamp previously tackled racial discrimination in his acclaimed previous film ""District 9"" which made it all the way to the Oscar Best Picture shortlist a few years back.Despite the presence of bigger stars, ""Elysium"" is not exactly better than ""District 9"". While intentions of the story are obviously noble, the execution of this story was rather roughshod, as rough as the dizzying shaky camera technique employed (unnecessarily, I thought) in most of this film.The best part of the film was Matt Damon, who managed to remain believable as the flawed hero Max, even if the circumstances of his story became unbelievable. On the other hand, the usually cerebral Ms. Jodie Foster actually comes up with an over-the-top one-dimensional performance here, which did not fit her well.Being a science fiction film, we expect to be regaled with special effects, but here, we were shown nothing we have not seen before. Of all the futuristic equipment shown, it was the powerful healing machine Med-Bay which was the most impressive. It was able to perform a total face reconstruction in minutes complete with nicely trimmed beard!One really head-scratching moment was the ""surgery"" of the sick Max in the hands of rebels to receive sophisticated technical gadgets attached not only to his body (through his t-shirt, mind you) but also his brain. You really need to suspend your disbelief big time how that could have been done, given the crude conditions Max and his ""neurosurgeons"" were in.Overall, I would just rate this film a little above average. The ending scenario though was very good despite the rocky road the film took to get there. The initial premise was very promising, more could have been done with it. For instance, we don't see enough of what life on Elysium was really about. It was not a bad film, but just a bit disappointing given its potential.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Disappointing, to Neill's sky-high standards","Neill Blomkamp has shown his potential at creating cohesive and moving stories - yet Elysium might not be the perfect example.The directing is niche, similar to his other films. Lots of camera shake, odd angles and quick cutting. Though everyone loves some originality in modern cinema and frankly this method normally works out well in assisting with the creation of a grounded feel, there are times when it feels like it is being overused and not too well thought-over.The cinematography is very much what one should expect from Blomkamp, but the beloved Johannesburg sandy sites, bright blue skies and fogs of dust are accompanied by some equally emotionally intriguing shots of the sleek world of Elysium, even more aesthetically pleasing. All this is put together by the meticulous work of the FX houses and WETA's brilliant workshop, who make it impossible to distinguish between the prop and the digital.As for the storytelling, things get a bit messy here. District 9 demonstrated some incredible allegories, and Elysium tries to to the same. The concept exists, but it feels like the ideas are somewhat all over the place and rather disconnected. Perhaps thinking the plot over and over will provide a better understanding of what the story really means, but it is no wonder that even Neil himself declared his disappointment at this area (right before his gem Chappie released, he clearly learned a lesson there).Is Elysium worth watching? The answer is a definite yes. Though it may have its issues, it's still got that action, atmosphere and look which makes Neil's movies so unique and enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium gets a high recommendation from me,"Since my movie theatre-working friend was off today, and this was the only movie I hadn't seen that was still playing that I wanted to see, this was what we chose. We both thought it was better than expected with plenty of great action scenes, a good Sci-Fi story, and many fine emotional moments concerning a lady friend of Matt Damon and her daughter that he ends up helping in a big way. Oh, and Jodie Foster as one of the villains was also quite compelling to watch. Things move along at quite a fast pace but not too much so that you couldn't understand what's going on if you pay close attention to the quite descriptive dialogue. So on that note, I highly recommend Elysium.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Porgy and Bess fly in a space ship for the children,"The Movie: Special effects: Very Good. Acting: Stiff - ""Yea, WE all got paid acting jobs"" Writing: The Earth is over crowed and polluted, but everyone needs advanced medical care and a space station of their own. Oh brother, did Che Guevara reincarnate as Neil Blomkamp. I wonder if Blomkamp will do a movie about the Israeli treatment of the Palestinians? NOT. Better to see the twig in someone else's eye then the Giant Sequoia in your own. Matt Damon: Now that he did this picture he can feel good about selling his $20,000,000 home. However, I do not think he and the family will be moving to Compton or Nogales. Jodi Foster: An exquisite butch SS Officer complete with ersatz German/Dutch accent. She did Yale proud.

This is propaganda at its best. Joseph Goebbels would marvel. The producers, not to mention Foster and Damon, don't even try to mask their disdain for those who have to deal with this country's security and its porous borders.

a very funny yet at the same time quite realistic sci-fi crap,"i just couldn't stop smiling all the time while watching this funny sci-fi movie. funny things are so many that i have to use numbers to list one by one, just in case i might skip one or two:1) this screenplay is definitely written by either an illegal immigrant or a naturalized American citizen. and his country of origin is also quite obvious, from south of the border of the land of the broken dream.2) the whole movie is just a saga of the illegal immigrants trying so hard in so many ways to get into united states in order to get a better life, better medical treatment, better welfare or maybe, food stamps to buy free groceries from the supermarkets and at the same time use food stamps to cash in us dollars.3) the storyline is also using the fact that 1% of the richest peoples in all countries on earth can have the privilege going to enjoy the luxurious living on Elysium, while 99% of the poor got to live on hell-like futuristic earth. the pathetic living conditions in this film are widely borrowed the slums and shanty towns in Mexico, Haiti, Philippine, Bangladesh, or Brazil where people just live in the garbage or by the garbage.4) the so-called Elysium, the beautiful sterilized environment, those green lawns, nice mansions, swimming pools....are just scenes from Miami, Florida5) the V-22 Osprey has been improved to be with 4 huge turbine jet engines, super sonic speed and has the ability as space shuttle going up to space anytime without any pre-flight preparation or safety procedure.6) the Elysium got similar border patrol to catch and deport illegal aliens7) the only difference of the realistic medical treatment for the illegal immigrants between the Elysium and the USA is no medical treatment whatsoever on Elysium, even you have successfully entered it, while the USA has laws to treat illegal aliens even they don't have citizenship. but ObamaCare Health Coverage for all the Americans is another story.8) funny thing is that 1% of the rich and powerful living on Elysium still needs a president, a secretary of the state, a secretary of the DOD? human national guards are replaced by droids or robotic human force. the dark force on earth is still like the forces assembled by the Mexican or Columbian drug lords. everybody got tattoos to prove they are lethal. this film smartly avoided the formulaic and childish Chinese Tongs drug kingpins and their kung-fu muscles.the whole movie is nothing but a masquerade describing the poor people south of the border trying every way to sneak into USA, while the governmental authorities north of the border trying every way to block such migrating flood, the only difference is heavily borrowed some sci-fi materials to make it look like a futuristic sci-fi movie. this is a very funny movie about the current cat-and-mouse border blockade and penetration tug war. i just couldn't help smiling while typing this same-crap-different-genre exposure.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The film was fairly well paced, but I felt it could have been longer and certain parts could have been expanded upon, and also I predicted the basic outcome of the film before even watching it.

Not bad but no district 9,"Elysium isn't a bad movie just a disappointing movie. Being the Neil blokamp fan that i am i felt a little disappointing at the fact that after months wait YEARS for a movie to top one of my most highly rated sci fi films of all time (District 9) It didn't come, But i still hold hope chappie will be better As I've said its not bad, its exactly what i expect in some respect from Neil blokamp a futuristic thriller with lots of turns and a deep driving political message underneath, But it lacked character interaction. Jodie foster could of been written out of the plot entirely without anyone noticing, she was there as a name to promote, The film looked beautiful from a CGI perspective but i felt some of the action lacked what i wanted it to, E.g the Exo suits weren't quite what i was expecting i was looking for something with some far better fast pacing I loved the soundtrack and the cinematography was really good in lots of places but it still lacked what i wanted from this film Thats why i only rated it 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A better than first thought sci-fi hit,"(62%) On the contrary to the critics, and I suppose a lot of other people and film fans, I actually thought this was a better movie overall than ""District 9"". It's more cinematic, the plot is better told, and it doesn't try to convince you every waking moment that you're watching a documentary. The social politics are as abundant here as the ones in District 9 (just like a truck on an elephant), but there's still an interesting concept at this movie's heart.

"This is one of the smartest sci-fi movies I've seen in a while,","This is my first review on an R rated movie so far. Yeah! This is on Elysium. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was really cool looking. It showed an interesting premise and some shots of sweet action. I saw the movie a few days ago, hoping that it would be good. Was I right? Read the review. I ain't telling. If you don't know the premise of Elysium, it's about Earth far into the future. It's polluted, it's dirty, it's disease ridden, and all the poor people live there (It might sound mean, but it's true). All of the rich people live in Elysium, a floating fortress in the sky, which is a lot like the halo from Halo or the Citadel from Mass Effect (call it what you will). Up there, there's no disease, there's no death, there's just life and happiness. One of the reasons this is is because of these medbeds. If you lay on it, it will cure any disease or injury you've gotten. That's cool. That's pretty much what the entire plot is, it's cool. And it's really, really good. I like it because not only does it have cool sci-fi plot elements, but it has a message. It basically tells you ""stop doing crappy things because in the future, life will be crappy"". It's good. The acting is top notch. Matt Damon does a great job in his role, you can really see him just invested in his character. I like actors like that. Jodie Foster plays the leader of Elysium and she's really good, but she isn't the main villain, like the trailers make it out to be. The main villain is a guy named Krueger played by Sharlto Copley, who for me stole the show. He was so good! You know when they do a good job when you hate the villain not from being annoying, but from being evil. Good job Sharlto. The action is so cool! It's very intense and very cool to watch. It's a movie where you feel every blow emotionally. That is a definite plus. The gore may be a little over the top, but it's still cool. The scene I'll remember the most was one of the characters getting his face blown off by a grenade. Not like the skin or anything, no. A chunk of face flew out of the front of his skull. And it was awesome. The cinematography is the best I've seen since Moonrise Kingdom, but it's very different. It definitely feels post-apocalyptic in the filming. It's shaky and movey (is that even a word?), but it doesn't distract you or get you nauseous. Overall, this movie is great. It's got an awesome plot, superb acting, sweet action, and stellar cinematography. My only gripe is that it's about twenty to thirty minutes too long, but that isn't a lot. Don't go into this movie thinking it's going to be fun, because it's not. It's well made and very interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nowhere near District 9, but still a pretty good action flick","The story of this one doesn't deliver anywhere near as much as District 9. Maybe I expected more from Blomkamp considering his brilliant debut with District 9. Maybe that's not fair, but that's just the way it is. Regardless, it isn't a bad movie. It's premise is good, the story's decent, and the action is great. Matt Damon does his job as always, Jodie Foster unfortunately isn't used properly, and Sharlto Copley is wonderfully sadistic as Kruger. If you're looking for some action to get your blood pumping look no further, but if you're looking for a great film or something to really leave you thinking you might want to look elsewhere. Here's hoping Blomkamp can come back strong wherever he decides to take us next, and hopefully he takes Copley along with him too.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Well, that wasn't really much of a blast...","I had been told by friends not to watch this movie, but still I decided to sit down to watch it out of sheer boredom. I must admit that I get the meaning of their words now that I have seen the movie.Story-wise, then ""Elysium"" was a shallow and hollow replica of a movie. The story was oozing with predictability and it wasn't really based on a solid foundation. Which ultimately led this movie to become another of those mindless drone movies that are run by CGI special effects and bright lights. But once the dust settles, then there isn't much meat on the bone, so to speak.The story is about Earth in the future, a planet destroyed and in ruins. While those with money and the ability have established a new life of luxury and without care on Elysium, an orbiting space station watching over Earth. Struggling through a harsh life, Max (played by Matt Damon) becomes a victim of circumstance and an accident and have to reach Elysium in order to save himself, keep a promise to his childhood girlfriend and save the Earth in the process.Right, and we all know just exactly how the movie will end based on that storyline. And guess what, it did. Director Neill Blomkamp has managed to add every storyline cliché into this movie and make it so predictable that it is physically painful to bear witness to.You would think that with all that advanced technology, robotics and weaponry that the orbiting Elysium station would have some better defenses aside from a single rogue agent with a orbital rocket launcher on Earth? It was just downright idiotic.And while on the topic of idiotic things, then why did they mount the exoskeleton outside the clothing on Max's body, when they had to drill into his nerves and such. Wouldn't the clothing get in the way?I can't claim to be a fan of Matt Damon's work, and he was by no indication the reason for me sitting down to watch the movie. However, it should be said that he was actually doing a good enough job in this movie, despite having a very, very weak script to work with. It was also nice to see Jodie Foster and William Fichtner in the movie. William Fichtner actually had the most interesting of all characters throughout the entire story. Sharlto Copley was great in ""District 9"", but he wasn't really set to use the full scope of his talents in this movie.""Elysium"" is mindless entertainment. It does provide good enough entertainment, just don't expect to be dazzled or left with something to think about once the movie ends. Adequate acting, good effects, bad storyline, overall a so-so experience.Thus I am rating ""Elysium"" a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars rating.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid Sci-Fi Fare,"Although it is set 141 years from now, Neill Blomkamp's Elysium portrays a vision of Earth that would be more suited to a setting 1000 years ago. The citizens wealthy enough to afford a ticket have emigrated to the suburban environment of 'Elysium', where cancer can be cured in seconds and poverty is nonexistent. Everyone else is left breathing in toxic fumes and living in dire conditions on the planet we call home, wondering what they did to deserve this life. Andrew Niccol's In Time realized a similar world quite well, but unfortunately was highly ignored and proved financially and critically unsuccessful. Elysium, meanwhile, is getting far more attention both because it's director was Oscar-nominated for his last (and first) feature, District 9, and because it's star, Matt Damon, has a noticeably better reputation for making good films than In Time's lead, Justin Timberlake. Damon has been promoting this film by telling the press about it's ""political themes and messages"", which he apparently feels quite passionately about. However, any moral lessons from the film which Blomkamp and Damon are attempting to convey to the audience in relation to poverty and human rights are lost amongst the CGI landscapes and loud, violent battles displayed on screen.Elysium begins with Damon's character, Max, on his way to work (on Earth), but being unfairly attacked by some robotic cops and beaten unconscious. This scene is a good indicator of what the rest of the film will be like- using regular sci-fi fixtures to tell a story which is all too realistic. Released from hospital, Max is immediately forced to enter a highly radiated chamber in order to keep his job, and becomes seriously ill as a result. He learns he has but 5 days left to live, and is hastily released onto the streets by the comically evil CEO of the company he works for, William Fichtner's Carlyle. Carlyle has all the film's funniest lines, such as ""Don't you dare breath on me! Cover your mouth!"" to a reasonably affluent Earth citizen. In fact, the film looks set to be quite funny for the first 15-20 minutes, as Max sits down with a robot parole officer to whom he must repeat words phonetically as we would to an automated phone operator. These traces of humor utterly disappear, however, after Max's accident, which sends the plot into a spiral of painful gore, intense shoot-outs and epic intergalactic explosions.Damon has been on top form recently with his roles in Behind the Candelabra and Promised Land, and he carries much of the film on his newly thickened shoulders. That said, Sharlto Copley really is the standout, playing the single most hateful, terrifying character portrayed in a film of this scale in years. I will forever be going to lengths to avoid having to meet the man in person, as that would result in me scurrying away in fear. Jodie Foster's smaller-than- advertised 'role' (it's more of a cameo) is nothing to write home about, particularly since she hasn't given a good performance since Lambs.If you enjoy watching spaceships land on dusty land (bringing back oh-so-fond memories of The Phantom Menace), you'll love this film. If you get your kicks from watching data rapidly transfer between hard drives (National Treasure-style), Elysium is for you! Using countless science-fiction clichés in an impressively subtle manner, Blomkamp has managed to make a film that is shockingly entertaining, considering it's dark roots, and outdoes such mediocre fare we've seen this year, like Oblivion, in everything from acting to visuals. It may not have the epic scale or sheer fun of Star Trek Into Darkness, but this is a nice break from the pure awfulness of some of the year's other sci-fi films.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining sci-fi with a message,"While it doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by DISTRICT 9, ELYSIUM is a very entertaining sci-fi film with a message. Something that Neill Blomkamp does very well is create a believable world with interesting characters, and he does that here as well. The world in the film feels very realized and believable. Also, the special effects used to enhance it are very effective as well. The story is rather simple. Matt Damon's character, Max, gets a lethal dose of radiation and has to find a way to Elysium to get treatment. In this movie, the poor remain on Earth while the richest in society have migrated to a torus satellite called Elysium. However, some needless complications to the plot bring down the movie a little bit, most notably a coup d'etat subplot that feels shoehorned in to give Jodie Foster's character more to do. The movie also isn't very subtle in its messaging, practically hitting the viewer over the head with its plea for universal healthcare. Still, it's an admirable message, but one that could have been handled more deftly. Another thing that could have been improved was the central relationship between Max and his childhood friend, now a nurse whose daughter is dying from leukemia. Even though this has to be one of the biggest coincidences ever, it still works in the context of the story. Still, despite the over-complication in the plot, Elysium delivers an exciting story, with great action (although edited a little too chaotically) and a timely message.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium: Brazilian actors give a special touch,"Written by: Neill Blomkamp Directed by: Neill Blomkamp Starring: Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley Running time: 109 min. Country: USAElysium (2013, the new film by Neil Blomkamp , known for his success with the movie District 9, shows the extreme separation of social classes that the human being can endure.The film is set in the year 2159, when Earth suffers from being depleted of natural resources, destroyed by technology and overpopulated. It is the planet where only the poor and decaying humans live to serve as labor for the rich who live in Elysium, a space station designed to be the perfect environment where all citizens have the right to use a machine, this exclusive world, healing any kind of disease or infirmity.The action begins when Max (Matt Damon) suffers an accident and is infected by radiation. His boss, a citizen of Elysium, does not care about his situation and he will have only five more days to live. The only way to survive he would go to Elysium to use the cure machine. For this he asks Spider for help, the character played by Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, who was handpicked by the director after seeing his performance in ""Tropa de Elite"" 1 and 2 movies.Spider is working illegally trying to send sick people from Earth to be cured in Elysium. He accepts to send Max to one of their trips if he helps him to reconfigure the system of Elysium,transforming all Earth citizens in official citizens of Elysium, giving everyone equal rights. Clearly the leaders of the space station did not like this plan, starting a hunt for communists that gives a special touch to the film.And talking about special touch, again Alice Braga makes all the difference in an American cast. The Brazilian plays Frey Santiago, a childhood friend of Max's, who he is in love with. Frey has a daughter with leukemia, and fights alongside Max to save them both.Merging science fiction, social criticism, sustainability and romance, Elysium is a great movie for those who like a lot of action and a well tied plot at the same time. Not to mention the special effects and the technological equipment that give the characters futuristic and painful elements, such as the steel exoskeleton that is deployed to the body of the protagonist for him to fight with police robots that would be lethal to any unprepared human.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Elysium is yet to come for Blomkamp,"Watched this Blomkamp's sophomore feature film in theater, to some extent I was underwhelmed by his universally-acclaimed debut DISTRICT 9 (2009, 7/10), it seems that his novelistic intention overrides his implementation, notably his screenplay (this time he is the sole writer for ELYSIUM), the premise is always rosy and aspiring, but in the Sci-Fi territory, if the writer cannot justify the surrealistic world he creates with a certain holistic perspective to cover obtrusive plot-holes which are unavoidable byproducts out of the limitation of one's imagination, very likely bathos will be the consequence.In ELYSIUM, setting in 2154, Blomkamp inherits his visual motifs from DISTRICT 9 (the skeletal robot resembles an agiler Prawn) and enlarges the cosmic extravaganza by erecting a pristine man-made extraterrestrial homeland for upscale class meanwhile the seething dystopian of a scuzzy and overpopulated earth is an upgraded version of the refugee camp for The Prawns in Johannesburg. Howsoever the film's box office prospect (a tepid response from the critics and its North American income is also disheartening, $82,877,000 so far), it is a bold decision for the production company to invest and purvey a wunderkind's second film with a costly budget (reported $115,000,000) for an original Sci-Fi actioner.Accumulating an almost 4-times funds than DISTRICT 9, Blomkamp could summon Hollywood top-tier names to guarantee more tickets-buyers which backfires, however his South African kindred spirit Sharlto Copley continues undertaking a chief role as the brutal outcast ex-agent, whose ambition pans out to be even more vicious than the ostensible villain, the combo of Damon and Foster is a whimsical but diverting one, but due to the ill-fated procession of the story, they don't even share any scenes together, Damon is always a good Samaritan without memorable charisma to single himself out and Foster caricatures herself to a routine militarist with bizarre accent.All the earthbound stratum is comprised of Latinos (save Damon here), Moura, Braga and Luna is certified foil around Damon's amenable hero, contrasts sheer with the high-and-mighty White race in Elysium, robot-like but dons haute couture, speaks French and enjoys a disease-free technology. The omnipotent machine stands out as the sole excuse for earthlings to go to Elysium (actually only for those who are sick or disabled), since the lucky immigrants who stow away from earth to there (19 minutes by aircrafts, a rather facile maneuver) will all be effortlessly captured and repatriated back to the globe, so why they make a fuss over risking their lives in an ill-fated journey? Also the entire re-programming and rebooting scheme is a heedless product of a wholesome mind and cursorily conducted for the sake of being assimilated as any of its same kind. Unfortunately there are many equivocal set pieces like this pervading the entire film which restrains its potential to be a bona fide awe-inspiring eye-opener.But on the other hand, imagination is contingent on the real world where germinates all the possible routes to extend and maximize our capacity of creation, the world in ELYSIUM could be our worst nightmare comes true because it touches on the basis of our undying prejudices on individuality and the callousness and irrationality looming over the inexorable gap between the wealthy and poor, as I mentioned in my review of DISTRICT 9, Blomkamp will always be on my radar as the new blood in the massive assembly line, time is all he needs to hone up his expertise and mostly essentially is to be on the lookout for a distinctive screenplay, he will fabricate his own CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10) one day.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When a film just gets worse the more you think about it.,"Matt Damon's Elysium so touted as one of the great modern sci fi films I had yet to see, that I finally gave in and watched. What an unholy alliance of dog waste this film is. Nothing makes sense, there is no science fiction, the story is just an excuse for some CGI violence and posturing bad guys that give Damon time to ""overthrow"" the system with the press of a button. OOOO I waited 2 hours for that????? And what a system! A single suburban 90210 space station. Don't think too hard about it you'll hurt yourself trying to figure it out. What an utter waste of my time, Given the obviously massive budget I genuinely thought there might be some intellectual pay off as Jodie Foster was sucked into this and even spoke French at the start, but no, it just rewards you for suffering through the endless chase and battle through LA with nothing. Even if you like quasi futuristic game like battles complete with exoskeletons, this one just never leaves the ground. Strictly for first person shooter addicts with no standards whatsoever. I'm so hacked off I need to bathe with some proper mindless fun that never promised to be high art.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A quick note,"I personally just wanted to say this was the best film I've ever watched and whilst I usually just rate film's, I felt I needed to just add this comment as well to prompt you into watching Elysium. You defiantly should. The plot I loved and the ending was quite powerful, how easy it was for everyone on earth to be healed, yet they wouldn't do it. I thought the whole story line was brilliant, I love film's where the world has gone to ruin's, just too see the different way's people create as to why and I think this was one of the best and in someway's; to a certain extent the most realistic for a future, the rich and the poor being separated. I don't really like Matt Damon but I looked past it as he did excellent in this film, although it did go a little bit too action/thriller for my taste in the middle, it still remain's one of my favorite film's and I would recommend a watch, I hope you like it as much as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining for 3/4 of the film,"The characters are well realized, as is the fantasy universe in which they live. The action is fresh and the pace is exciting.But the film loses cohesion, and it becomes obvious the course set to victory would place the protagonist into a role the authors just couldn't figure out how to portray.The mantle of leadership is abandoned, and the potential characterizations of blame and responsibility are lost in an ending that feels like a cop out.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The LONGEST hour and 45 minutes of my life.,"Poor Jody Foster. All those great films, all that hard work in Hollywood, all that great acting and here she is, in a boring, tedious, mindless piece of garbage pumped out by the Hollywood factory in the only way they can make films now. Predictable idiocy, trite script, no brain work required.And Matt Damon. A once promising actor in some pretty damn good work too and now this. He's sunk into a brainless project that must leave him feeling depressed.This film is just like all the other action films. I can't even tell them apart anymore! This could be any of the junky action films released in the last 2 years. This could have been a cerebral, low key, dramatic film. Sooo very disappointing. Only brainless idiots will enjoy this.Really sad.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watchable but not amazing! 6/10,"Review: This film wasn't as bad as I thought that it would be, but it's not a classic. It's quite a average supernatural movie that the has a backdrop of the future, but it's not very rememberable. I found the ending quite abrupt and I was hoping for a little twist, which just doesn't happen. It comes from the makers of District 9, which was a much better movie, but thats not to say that this is totally bad. I found Jodie Fosters voice a bit strange, but she just doesn't seem to age. If it wasn't for the eccentric baddie, who makes the movie, I don't think that the film would have been half as good. Some of the action scenes were quite good and the director did made use of CGI pretty well. In all its a watchable movie but nothing to get excited about.Round-Up: Matt Damon puts in an average performance and he just seems to be pretty moody throughout the movie. This film won't hurt his career, but he won't get remembered for it like the Bourne franchise. Jodie Foster doesn't really star in that many movies, so I'm surprised that she took this role. I think that it was the hugely respected District 9 that made all of the actors rush to work with the director. The baddie, Sharlto Copley, who also starred in District 9 and the the A-Team, was great and surprisingly better than Matt Damon, which was due to his character. It does look a lot like District 9, but you can see that the director is dealing with a much bigger budget.Budget: $115million Worldwide Gross: $286millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there supernatural movies about the future and the divide between the rich and the poor. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting sci-fi B movie,"Elysium is a cyborg movie taking place some 150 years in the future, at a time when the entire earth is a sweatshop planet, while the upper class resides in an ultra lux space station in orbit. Guess what - technology has been used to chain down the 99%, but then an accident that Damon suffers sets off events that threaten to change the course of history.The story is actually *kinda* original, in the same way that District 9 was. There are too many similarities between the 2 movies, and I bet that you'll like this one as much as you liked the other. It's clearly a b-movie despite all the money spent on cast (unlike district 9) and SFX (which were quite good). In fact if the director had not used any famous actors, I dare say it would be so much better.If you haven't seen district 9, then let me sum it all up in bullets:*Pros: a poor excuse of a plot, bad acting (partly due to the script)*Cons: really good setting, nice photography, good SFX*a lot of hand-held camera work*average action sequences*about the political commentary: Elysium is an overtly anti- capitalist/anti-imperialist screamer, not in the classic Hollywood sense of good vs evil - it's not the antithesis between rich evil bastards and poor good people; as the writer highlights from start to finish, the cause of unhappiness is clearly to be found in the system itself. Really huge (full with blinking neon arrows) parallels are drawn with modern day exploitation of the third world by the west, of the worker and nature by the capital, and so on, and so on. The message is so blatantly thrown in the face of the viewer that many people are genuinely put off by it for purely ideological reasons. The same allusions were evident in district 9, but people took that film more like it was about racism, which is more universally accepted as a bad thing.*overall: slightly above average flick",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good Sci-Fi, but too many fight scenes","It's 2154. The Haves live on Elysium, a space station above earth. The Have-Nots live on a ravished, diseased and over-populated Earth below. Max (Matt Damon) who lives on Earth catches a fatal dose of radiation and is told by a robot he has 5-days to live and is given some pills for the pain. There is a plan to have Max go to Elysium for a cure and also to download security information so the people on Earth could go to and enjoy Elysium too. Right now the people on Earth are considered non-citizens and it is illegal for them to go to Elysium. Max's arm is imprinted with a counterfeit stamp to show he is a citizen of Elysium.Webster's says Elysium is "" a place or condition of ideal happiness.""Well, as you would expect, things go wrong and most of the movie shows fight scenes with Max trying to get to Elysium and then many fight scenes when he is on Elysium. Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a hit-man for Secretary Delecourt (Jodi Foster) relishes in shooting down shuttles from Earth that try to go to Elysium. Kruger concentrates on Max, who now has all the Elysium security info implanted in his head and because of that Kruger cannot kill Max because Delecourt needs that info to change the current Elysium government she considers too soft.We don't get to know too much about any of the characters except for Max. We see Delacourt as a real Biaaatch who has no compassion for anyone. Robot builder John Carlyle (William Fichtner) needs long term contracts with Elysium and agrees to help Delacourt change things. And, not exactly a love interest, we see Frey (Alice Braga) a longtime childhood friend of Max and she has a child who has Leukemia and needs to go to Elysium for the cure. Frey and child complicate Max's mission.In the beginning we see amazing beautiful sets of Elysium and later on we see more very good, but darkened sets, and this time as background for all the fight scenes that dominate the movie. There were just too many fight scenes when we needed to take a breath. We would have liked to have seen more of other characters and of Elysium as everything seemed perfect there. We like to see perfect things.Was surprised to see William Fichtner look like a 25-yr old. There is that technology now to make people look younger than they are. I don't have a problem with that but I almost didn't recognize him at first. I think Jodi Foster looked quite young too. Kudos.The acting all around is very good, but sometimes we had a hard time understanding Kruger's dialogues. That is, except when he went on a foul language tirade, then we understood him pretty good.I can see you have a question regarding Matt Damon and the answer is yes, the Jason Bourne character does come out of him but in this movie it takes more time to get the job done.

Futuristic Thriller,"Earth gets over populated, polluted and a becomes a hub of diseases; wealthy people get together and move to the newly formed living space far away from the earth by the name 'Elysium', this place is filled with various futuristic advanced technology, like healing machine that can heal very dreadful health problems like leukemia and even makes physically impaired to walk fit, totally mechanized police forces, shuttles that move in supersonic speed and various other stuffs, more than this it highlights the massive gap between poorer and richer and their war for survival, both are ready to kill each other to protect their existence, neatly portrayed story and fine performance by Matt Damon, to make this plot effective they had used the strong sentimental way of presenting the story, this shows that it's not just the action flick instead it carries some serious contents, but the drawback of this movie is its in-completion of many scenes, especially during the end of antagonists roles and even during some sentimental scenes, overall it's a nice concept good to watch for some futuristic thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A brilliant movie that most people are misinterpreting,"Elysium is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of the last two years & is! Th plot is intelligent, has a meaningful message & brilliant if not amazing special effects. Somehow, despite these three factors, people are ranting & raving, negatively, about Elysium. i mean here's a conversation I've had with a lot of people about this movie & they all sound like this: Person: ""Elysium? That movies f***ing sh*t!"" Me: ""Why is it 'f***ing sh*t' Person: ""'Cause it's unrealistic! Earth will never get that bad! It's unrealistic!"" This is what I've heard a lot of people say about Elysium & it make me wanna fly-kick a pinata llama. EARTH IS ALREADY LIKE THAT! EARTH IS ALREADY THAT F**KED UP! ELYSIUM IS JUST AN ENTERTAINING, SCIENCE-FICTION, FUTURISTIC VERSION OF TODAY'S SOCIETY THAT HIGHLIGHTS A FEW MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH OUR SOCIETY! Take Mexico for example, its a slum, the people are poor, they resort to messed up things like burro shows to entertain themselves & have probably never spent a day in their life clean. Then, right next to Mexico, is Texas with its abundance of rich people, mansions & other rich people things. Think of it like this: Texas is Elysium & Mexico is Earth.Putting the negative things behind, Elysium has some great acting in it. You have Matt Damon who plays the character he's given very well & in a way that really makes you feel for the character. Secondly, Jodie Foster's acting was good, I mean any middle aged actress that was OK with dying her hair white & acting like a bitch could have played her, but that doesn't mean Jodie Foster was bad. Lots of people criticized her accent in this movie but I'm not sure what they were complaining about. She sounded British to me......Finally, Sharlto Copley. Holy sh*t. He played possibly the most malignant & psychotic villain I have ever encounter & played the character perfectly. Seriously, no-one else could've played the character. Every scene Sharlto was in, he sol the spotlight.Overall I give Elysium 9/20 for its brilliant CGI, entertaining story & a message that had me thinking the whole car-trip home for the cinemas plus a few hours. I would've given it a ten but it felt just a bit to short. I wouldn't go s far as to say that Elysium was as good as Neil Blomkamp's previous film District 9, because it's not, but Elysium is definitely up there.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unsolicited Advice for Blomkamp from a Huge Fan,"This as a brutal disappointment after the very high bar set by Neill Blomkamp's darn well near perfect District 9. By and large it, like most movies I guess, boils down to the weakness of the script. District 9 was ingenius when it came to its three dimensional characters and how it worked them, especially the film's main character, into a brilliantly structured narrative. All aspects of this narrative, including depth of character, in Elysium feels thoroughly limited to the first dimension. But it was not all bad. Acting, visual effects, production design: everything except for writing and directing were firing on all cylindars. Returning to Elysium six years later (wow, time flies when you're watching mediocre movies) as well as Chappie (a few less year than that), makes me think about what Blomkamp was been up to since. What's it called? Oats Studios I think? Dude, and this mean to be constructive, as I am a major fan of your genius first feature: your problemo is not building online fanbasses to rallying behind short films concepts. What you need to do is invest in writing very good full length screenplays. Get object feedback on your drafts. Hire the best writer(s) if you're not getting the results on yoru own. Everything else is just a massive waste of time and money.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Avoid this racist, insult to your intelligence, waste of time film!","I wasted an hour and 48 minutes of my life on August 9th watching this god awful film, and if you read and listen to my advice on this review, you won't make the mistake of wasting 1 hour and 48 minutes of your life on this terrible film. To begin with, this film is ridiculously racist, The Matt Damon character is the only sympathetic white person in the entire film! Now I am a white male who enjoys watching movies, and I don't mind if a film is racist against whites as long as the film is good, but this film is unoriginal, badly directed, and terribly written and conceived. There is not one original scene in this film, and the effects look they are from 1985! Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, by far, give the worst performances of their careers! Matt Damon, usually great, has the screen presence of a can of soup in this film, there is no emotional range in his character. Jodie Foster's performance is so bad, that if she had been dead or asleep during the making of this film, she would have been better! What a waste of two great talents! The film manages to take ideas of numerous films before it, while managing to pay tribute to none of them! The people involved with making this film should hang heads in shame, and do the world a favor by not make anymore films!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Best Film of the Summer, and so far the year.","Its a known fact-people do not like politics/social commentaries with their action movies. That's the main reason why so many people were harsh on Green Zone. I freaking loved that movie! God, I've never seen so many people jump on the bandwagon for critics nowadays. I blame the Hollywood reporter; ever since his shitty, snobby review hit the web, many people retweeted it and went in with the mind set that they were going to be disappointed.We live in a world where people are so gullible. And maybe the reason why people are saying this movie is disappointing is because Sony decided to make this movie more of an internet campaign. I don't know, but every single one of the people that score this film with a 6/10 or lower, or a B- or lower say they felt the film beat them over the head with its message.Having seen the movie after hearing both sides, those who love it and those who don't like it, i realize that some people are freaking idiots. This movie is a masterpiece; best I've seen this year so far. Its smart, energetic, original, and thrilling. Its far from generic and repetitive that its pundits claim it to be. So lets get down about the positives:1. Matt Damon. Great casting choice! You can really tell the guy put a lot into his character, and you felt that he was a real person and that made his character more relatable. You really want to root for this guy in his quest to take down Elysium.2. The world of 2154. You can tell that Neil Blomkamp has put so much effort into the world of this dystopian future. Nothing is clean and all pretty like a lot of futuristic movies; no Earth is an over-populated waste land, full of people dying and looking up at a world that orbits there's, wishing for a way out. This is a world you can sink into, and a lot of people felt that it was just a huge social message slapping them in the face- (immigration and health care) But the film really doesn't yeah the symbolism is there but its not in your face. Only hard core conservatives are saying that this movie is a huge political porno.3. Special effects-not one moment in this movie did i think any of the things were CGI. Much like Pacific Rim that came out last month, the special effects are mind blowing. And what's better is the use of practical effects; there is a lot of it in this movie and that boosts the realism of the film even more. The droids, the world of Elysium, all look visually spectacular.4. Kruger. Okay, I saved the best for last. This is with out a doubt the best part of the film and you will hear this from nearly everybody. Shartlo Copely completely steals the show. In a great movie, he is the greatest; he stands out over his counter parts as the menacing, electrifying, creepy, and crazy Kruger. We don't see a WHOLE lot of kruger, but when we do, its awesome. Shartlo puts so much into his performance, giving us the joker vibe. There is a scene towards the end of this film were I was watching Kruger and legitimately felt he was a futuristic heath ledger joker without make up. He will go down as one of the best villains in history.I really didn't have any really issues with the movie except one, but its not like it brings down the entire experience.1. Jodie Foster. The moment I heard she was in this movie and saw her in the trailer, I knew that she was going to play a role that any woman her age could play...and i was not wrong. Even though she is able to get the whole corrupt politician down, her presence doesn't feel as important as Damon's and Copely's. She does a good job, but not great; she's the weakest link in the film for sure but doesn't bring down the movie.In the end, I loved Elysium, and I think there's another reason why people are feeling disappointed-they win expecting District 9. And they should not have done that at all. I went in expecting an entertaining conventional, original sci-fi movie and that's exactly what I got. I didn't go in expecting an original mockumentary/sci-fi thriller. That's like going into a transformers movie expecting a strong, clever story with deep characters and heavy emotion. Change your expectations people. Seriously.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium is a distilled version of D9. That is - even worse.,"While in District 9 Neill Blomkamp did a fine effort of trying to show the results of racial segregation from the point of view of an oppressor becoming an oppressed one (ultimately failing to make it even a bit believable, though) in Elysium he has hit the nail precisely on the head, forgetting to put it against a wall first.The premise is pretty worn - two communities, one a small, rich and prosperous, the other large but poor and suffering. And, obviously, a tale of one man's rise to citizenship of the rich one. What Elysium completely fails to create is a reason to feel for any of the characters. The bad guys are bad because Neill said so, the good guys are good by virtue of being poor and oppressed (we all know that every miserable sod has a heart of gold but is unwilling to sell it). So the good guys fight the bad guys. sacrifice themselves left and right and, obviously, win.Also the movie contains so many absolutely stupid details that it becomes a pain to watch without facepalming. Every stupid action/sci-fi cliché you can think of is probably there.Oh, and as for the message. Earth = Cuba/Mexico. Elysium = USA. Brave immigrants fight through border patrol and decimate U.S. citizens to achieve their small American dream. Kindly empathize with them.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is the Future the Richest Men on Earth Would Have Created and IT SUCKS(not the movie),"If you are living in your own bubble and out of touch with the real world, the social structure in this movie might come off as far fetched and unrealistic. But forget the future in a sci-fi movie, we are literally living in this same world as Elysium right now, minus the technology. Don't believe me? December last year, a tornado hit several states in the US, some workers at a company wanted to go to their homes but threatened with their jobs to stay and as a result, they lost their lives...I loved the social take of the film and that was the only interesting thing about it. But it was good enough to redeem the movie. I hated some of the sci-fi elements, especially those med bays. It was ridiculously simplistic; literally cures anything and everything within a few mere seconds! In order to avoid spoilers, I won't name the things those med bays are capable of, and it doesn't take them any time either, yeah, right... The power suit was designed poorly, both in appearance and in function: It looks cheap and they screw it to your body! Utterly absurd! Why would a power suit have to be screwed to your body? You would scream with pain if you had lifted your finger an inch in that power suit. I haven't even mentioned why the rich went up to live in an artificial moon yet. You see, they went there because the world is overpopulated and polluted. How polluted? It is so polluted that billions of people can still live on it without any problems. It's details like this bothers me. I mean it's the premise of the whole thing, why so lazy? Why not come up with a logical reason for them to live there?You might wonder why I gave this film 7/10 stars after complaining about so many things. It's the story that I really liked and how it is relevant even now. It could have been much better with a little bit more attention to detail and more logical sci-fi elements.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great movie, but not quite there yet","***spoilers below***My high grade for this movie comes from the immense heart it has. Different from a regular sci-fi blockbuster like Oblivion, Blomkamp's works show a strong belief in what is being said, about the social commentary and future scenarios always grounded with real, current issues. Of course, the movie works more like a metaphor than a likely scenario. Just like District 9 (a superior film in every way) deals with economic and ethnic differences and showed an ironic moral play against prejudice, Elysium plays with the notion of economic powers X third world, and it works as a beautiful and powerful situation that is disturbingly familiar (at least for me, a Brazilian, the movie's universe felt very very real). The visuals are amazing as usual, and the movie only disappoints in the third act when it gets too Hollywood-esque (the nemesis fight looked too much Iron Man-y, over-the-top for the movie's intentions), and the big final dramatic twist (Max's sacrifice) didn't do the job since Max didn't have enough psychological set-up and strong characterization for the public to feel a strong enough empathy with him (unlike District 9, which was brilliant at that). So, the final scenes felt cliché and flat. Anyway, Elysium tried to be a new District 9, but it couldn't (few can). Nonetheless, what the movie accomplished still is much better and much deeper than your regular action sci-fi.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

More action than sci-fi,"Neill Blomkamp's previous film, District 9, is one of the best sci-fi movies of the past decade. Unfortunately, his second effort, Elysium, is a sci-fi movie not suited for hardcore sci-fi fans, rather it is targeted more at the typical summer action movie fan.The plot of the film is promising. The wealthy have left the diseased Earth to a space station utopia called Elysium. Max (Matt Damon) is a man with nothing to lose whose goal is to get there by any means necessary. However, the world that is created is filled with unanswered questions. What sort of government is left on Earth, as it seems that the same robots of Elysium keep order on Earth? How does the air stay on Elysium, since there is no sort of solid roof? Even Max's robot suit thing that is heavily featured in the trailers doesn't make much sense. He has the metal parts screwed into is flesh and bones. Any sort of serious blow on the metal parts should make the screws move and break his bones. There are several more questions that can be raised (which I won't at risk of spoilers), and they may seem nitpick-y, however the sci-fi genre is all about creating a believable futuristic world that follows the rules of science.One thing I appreciate about the plot is that it isn't preachy. After seeing the trailer I worried it might talk waaaaaaaay too much about the whole 1% thing. Instead it seems to be more about race. It doesn't talk about it. It's just that most people shown on Earth are Hispanic while essentially everyone on Elysium is white, well except for president Patel. I thought Elysium was for the rich people of Earth. What, Oprah isn't rich enough? OK, so the plot is kind of shaky, but one part of District 9 which isn't lost is the interesting characters. Max is not quite the typical action star. He isn't out to save the world or restore order and justice. He is just out to save himself; he just doesn't want to die. The villains of the film, Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and Kruger (Sharlto Copley, the lead of District 9) are great. Jodie Foster may be a bit more of a cliché super power hungry evil person, but Kruger is fascinating. Unfortunately, I can't get into too much detail at risk of spoilers, but that man is crazy. And Spider (Wagner Moura) should also be mentioned. Blomkamp knows how to make interesting characters.Another reason this feels like a generic action film just in a sci-fi setting, is the emphasis put on Max's love interest Frey (Alice Braga). She seems like an unnecessary character. She is there to provide him with more motivation and a character arc, but that role could've been filled by his friend Julio (Diego Luna) just as easily, without some necessary romance.Looking at the film as an action film it works: great action sequences, cool futuristic weapons and plenty of explosions. Just don't look for a classic sci-fi film like District 9.tl;dr more action than sci-fi, interesting characters, plot notsomuch",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Expectation not quite fulfilled but still entertaining,"I had rather expected more from Neil Blomkamp's follow up to the brilliant District 9. Elysium basically highlights the difference between two lifestyles, the 'haves' on the Elysium platform and the 'have nots' on a future over crowded Earth.Whilst Elysium has some stunning visuals I thought the dialogue was at times weak. Oh! and why do some actor's have to mumble so much, I had trouble catching a lot of what Matt Damon was saying at times, which doesn't help trying to follow a storyline which is quite complicated, as most Sci-Fi's are. I'm not sure Matt is the right choice for heroic roles. He always strikes me as too nice and cerebral and doesn't really have that killer instinct in his personality that say Jeremy Renner or Russell Crowe have on screen. On the other hand, Sharlto Copley gives us a classic villain that I think will be remembered for a long while. In the tradition of great screen villains he gives the outstanding performance in this movie and it's worth paying the admission price to see him. Jodie Foster is my favourite actress and I know she wanted to be in this movie because I read she admired District 9 so much, something I read, long before she was cast. Jodie, I ask, what was that accent? Elysiumese? or was it supposed to be English? I'm not quite sure but it didn't work for me. I do think her dialogue was a bit weak and she didn't have a lot to work with and perhaps she tried to imbue it with this odd accent, but it comes over as strained and at times she sounds like she chewing her words. Having said that, she's never boring, particularly when she's just sitting still as she often is. Even then, she never just sits there.She has a gift for using inflections in her face, hand movements and what she's saying that somehow makes the most mundane line more interesting to watch. There is a scene near the beginning where Jodie speaks softly in fluent French and in her normal voice and I longed to hear her use it but that was not to be. The Elysium platform is fabulous to look at, I read the designer who worked on Bladerunner designed it and it's superb, very impressive. The fight scenes I found a bit too frantic and confused and at times they seemed a bit clumsily executed although there are certainly plenty of them so if you just want lots of action, this film has that by the bucketful. I just felt it was at the expense of good characterisation and dialogue. A side story involving Alice Braga and her little girl who's ill was a bit wasted I thought as she apparently knew Matt Damon from childhood, but the chemistry was missing for me. All in all, watchable but not very involving.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A thinly veiled, two hour propaganda piece promoting immigration reform and Obamacare.","It's a heavy handed political statement about the Haves and the Have Nots, disguised as an action thriller. The characters have less depth than rice paper and the plot and story take a backseat to the message that is hammered home repeatedly- those with privilege attained their status on the backs of the less fortunate and are inherently evil. After all, we're appealing to low information voters here!Anyone who likes their politics intelligent, thoughtful and challenging will quickly tire of this one sided, simplistic, dystopian propaganda vehicle.

Below average on all accounts,"Elysium is such a massively underwhelming movie.The action scenes are just way below the bar that's already been set by action movies of 2013 and 2012. What action there is is ruined by a shaky camera and blatantly poor choreographing. It tries to make up for this by being a ""LOOK AT ALL THIS COOL FUTURE STUFF"" movie with robots, magic healing stations, ""futuristic"" weaponry, and the tired dystopian theme.As a science fiction movie it's just awful. There's a plot hole every 15 minutes, issues that are never addressed, and terrible writing altogether. The science part is never in any way explained — this would be better billed as a science fantasy film. It makes absolutely no effort to be anything other than another cheesy ""sci-fi"" film to throw in the bin along with After Earth It takes after District 9 in that it's trying to be a social commentary but falls flat on its face so hard it's almost amusing.The ""message"" of the film is like any other film being released lately: being socially privileged is wrong. It's yet another film that sets out to make you feel shameful for living in a first world country for no other reason than the fact that it seems to sell really well lately.Honestly, I give it a 4/10 meaning it wasn't quite painful to watch, but it was pretty difficult to enjoy. The humor (at least I HOPE it was intended as humor) kept me from outright leaving the theatre and that's really all it has going for it in my opinion.That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie. It just means it's way below average. If you haven't seen much sci-fi and you don't want to think too hard (and in fact staunchly refuse to pick it apart) then it's a fantastic movie for you otherwise, don't bother.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As long as you're not expecting another District 9 you'll be OK,"""I promise you, one day I'll take you to Elysium.""Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's sophomore sci-fi film after his critically acclaimed debut with District 9. Expectations were high considering that film was a unique experience in that it blended some great sci-fi visuals with a social commentary about the apartheid movement in South Africa. District 9 worked as a modern day parable. Sadly Elysium doesn't live up to those high standards he set in his previous movie, but I still have to admit I had a fun time with this film. I think people would've enjoyed this film a little more if they didn't know it was directed by the same person who brought us the groundbreaking District 9. Elysium is far from being a great film because it is very predictable and generic. There were no twists or surprises here, but I enjoyed the CGI and the performances from some of the cast members (sorry Jodie Foster, I can't include you here). Elysium works as a blockbuster as long as you don't think too much about the plot. Unlike in District 9, the social commentary doesn't work too well here because the characterizations were extremely over the top (Jodie Foster could've toned it down a bit). Blomkamp was trying to criticize the immigration issue and the difference in privileges between the rich and poor. However, I felt that as an action sci-fi film it kept me entertained despite the predictability so I still had a good time with Elysium.The film takes place in 2154 where the planet has suffered from overpopulation and the wealthy have decided to live off in a space station called Elysium. The wealthy have access to a very comfortable life and state of the art equipment such as these medical capsules that heal you in a matter of seconds. Max (Matt Damon) has been dreaming of living in Elysium but his social condition doesn't allow it. He's committed several crimes in the past, but now he's decided to clean up his act and work at a local armor factory. After an incident with some droids, he runs into his childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), who's working as a nurse. Max isn't the only one who dreams of being able to go to Elysium. Several thousands of people have searched for a way to get a ticket (especially the sick who want to get healed in those capsules), but Officer Delacourt Rhodes (Jodie Foster) enforces the anti-immigration laws with a stern hand and will stop at nothing to ensure the safety of the wealthy class. When illegal crafts try to enter Elysium she doesn't hesitate in using force to stop them. One of her best agents is Kruger (Sharlto Copley) who happens to be psychotic as well and loves to use violence. When Max suffers an accident at work he is forced to find a way to Elysium and will stop at nothing to get there.I enjoyed Matt Damon's lead performance here and it was good to see Copley teaming up with Blomkamp again. The face off between these two characters was probably my favorite scene in this film. Elysium isn't the best sci-fi film of the year, but it still is an enjoyable flick if you go into it with low expectations. The action is pretty fast paced and at times the slow motion action scenes look like a video game. Blomkamp is a young and talented writer/director who will probably continue having success in the genre. Again I think the main weakness of the film was its overselling of the social commentary, but the premise and the action scenes lift this film from other formulaic sci-fi action films. I guess that the wealthy habitants of Elysium would've been better off if they simply offered their employees a better health care system. The lovely Alice Braga should also go over her roles a little as to try not to come up with a same ending again because the closure was almost identical to I Am Legend.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Average Overall,"Although, initially, the film bored me, it became more entertaining mid- movie.I think the screenplay was below par, as the plot felt a little rushed to begin with (like a quick back story to get us up to date), purely to set up for the more exciting climax of the film. However, once that was over, the storyline suddenly peaked my interest.The motivation behind Max's actions were clear, and although in the end it becomes a bog standard boy-meets-girl subplot, the whole idea of the story is a redeeming factor. The villains were convincing enough, but I felt the motivation behind Delacourt's actions (other than the standard 'she was evil') were a tad foggy.Overall, the film was not my favourite, but the whole idea of the story was a good one. The acting was good, the fight scenes okay, but the screenplay could have been improved.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another version of District 9,"I watched this movie because of 3 names: Jodie Foster, Matt Damon and Neill Blomkamp. A strong actress, a good action actor and a promising director whose film (District 9) is quite a fresh take of sci-fi genre but somehow feels like a documentary, a bit flat. I was expecting this time, there wil be more emotion, more drama, more upz and downs like a roller coaster. But somehow, this was also feels the same like his previous movie.Even the story is feel like just another version of District 9. Both about 2 separated colony. Then one colony wants to have a better future and invade the other and these movies have similar rhythm and tone. The difference is, the hero in District 9 is a cop protecting the invaded colony, this time our hero is 'the alien' invading the colony trying to save his life. I think the director has an obsession about 2 conflicting colony since he's from South Africa.It's not the best act from Matt Damon and certainly Jodie Foster great talent in here is being wasted.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A solid futuristic action film, thumbs up","This movie was on the TV last night and I went in completely open minded, I didn't know anything about it.I thought it was definitely worth watching and would recommend it as an action film. It got bonus points from me because it was thought-provoking too. It reminded me of The Terminator, where the action is at the forefront of the film but the story itself invites you to reflect on the ominous themes of our own reality and not too distant future.Setting/ locations - loved it. There are 2 main locations - the futuristic slums of LA in the stifling heat on Earth, and Elysium, the off-planet habitat of the elite and rich, which appears in the Earth's sky as some sort of everpresent star-shaped moon. I appreciated how people on Elysium could see planet Earth and people on Earth could see Elysium yet there was an invisible class barrier between the two entities.Plot - one man living in hard times, finds himself on a mission, motivated by love and survival etc. Nothing new but to be honest it didn't matter as the wider themes and setting were the main draws for me.Acting - convincing all round and did the characters justice. Sharlto Copley as the main bad guy was the stand out for me, excellent casting and a great performance!Action - the action scenes were good, again nothing particularly memorable but still engaging.Overall, I enjoyed it and I would like to mention that the pacing was really good. It never dwelt on one character, relationship or plot thread for too long but didn't feel rushed, you get just the right amount of info about what's going on which I think is spot on for an action film. I would loved to have seen more characters and locations from both LA and Elysium which is credit to the film for making such an interesting world.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Banal,"I'll start with the good points as they are very few to start with. The CGI and Matt Damon's performance were okay. Other than that, the movie just made me laugh, not in a good way. The dialogues were so terrible that I knew where the movie was heading in the first five minutes itself. Every dialogue was made up to explain the plot which was already obvious from the visuals. What's up with Jodie Foster? I never knew that she was such a terrible actress. Many of the characters looked so fake and unrealistic. I didn't find a single character that a normal person can relate to. The Direction and writing were unbearably terrible. The writer somehow assumed that all the viewers are dumb. In the scenes where there was a melodrama, it looked so unrealistic that the viewers were feeling almost nothing. The whole time I spent in the cinema, i was so conscious that I was watching a terrible film. I promised myself not to go to this writer's films again.

"Spade review for ""Elysium""","Overall: Elysium is a visually stunning science fiction melodrama set in a very well built and designed world that is ultimately held back by its weak characterization. Neil Blokamp has firmly established himself as the genre's most visually gifted directors and will hopefully continue challenging the vapid nature of modern, big budget sci-fi. 7/10Detailed Review:A) Story/Script: The story is relatively straight forward; characters are archetypes that say the lines demanded by their stereotypes. Yet, the story is effective. The plot is spun out well and is decently paced from set piece to set piece. A stronger, more nuanced script would have really elevated this film, especially with it backed by such strong production values. However, Neil Blokamp really excels at making this an international affair, with different dialects and accents naturally worked into the story. 6/10B) Characters: Each character is an archetype: the ex-con with a heart of gold, the cold Defense Secretary, the psychopathic Mercenary, the childhood friend with a kid in peril. While they do serve their purposes amiably, it is disappointing after the nuanced and multifaceted characters seen in ""District 9"". However, they are played well by their respective actors, with a special mention going to Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley: both play against type very well, inhabiting roles that could have been pure stock characters is played by someone else. 6/10C) Design: This is an absolutely visually stunning movie: the stark contrasts between Elysium and Earth are more than just shifts in color palettes. Both use gorgeous architectural designs that really tell a story of their own. While the idea of the ""used future"" is not original, here it is used with such effectiveness that others will be hard pressed to beat it. The vehicle and weapons design are absolutely brilliant, and they tie into the respective aesthetics excellently, which really emphasizes the history of this world. All together, the visual design of this film really lends credibility to a story that would have been sorely lacking otherwise. 9/10D) Sound/Music: The sound design is as stunning as the visuals they compliment. Engines, saws, gun shots, everything has a punch to them, really pushing the drama on screen further and wringing every last ounce of weight out of these set pieces. The score is a typical, sci fi score, with requisite bombastic portions complimented by slower and quieter sections. It serves its purpose without overstepping its boundaries; a simple but effective score is always better than a loud one that detracts from the film. 9/10E) Purpose/Misc: Elysium is pure sci-fi melodrama, yet it's hard to hold that against it too much; it's ultimately overshadowed by ""District 9"". We have seen Neil Blokamp do effective sci-fi drama while still giving us a challenging story and characters in ""District 9"", so to see this Avatar-esque story supported by such stunning visuals and creative direction is a bit disheartening. Having said that, Neil Blokamp is a director very distinctly in command of the style and nature of the films he creates and does an excellent job building them. When he inevitably matches the style of ""Elysium"" with the brains and heart of ""District 9"", it could potentially be genre defining. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This is Not District 9, but it sure is Fun","Since my first viewing of ""District 9"" from 2009, I have anxiously awaited director Neill Blomkamp's science fiction follow-up. ""Elysium"" was announced at some point last year or so, and I was practically leaping for joy with anticipation. As the release date grew ever closer, more information came pouring out on ""Elysium"" and it soon became evident that this was indeed not a sequel to the very successful ""District 9″. Let me assure you now that if you expect this to be any kind of successor to ""District 9″, you will be disappointed.That being said, ""Elysium"" is not a terrible movie by any means. It stars not only Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, but also the lead role from ""District 9″, Sharlto Copley.In this dystopian tale however, we are dropped into a very gritty post-apocalyptia, as most futuristic visions are and should be. It's a brutal life for those left on earth. Overpopulation and disease has spread rampantly, leaving many living in favelas, or at least we can only assume. We don't see much of earth outside of the village of sorts that Max (Matt Damon) lives in. As our poor as dirt (literally) humans scrap for food and work, there does indeed exist a space station hovering in space called Elysium. This of course is where the wealthy live. A huge plus to inhabiting Elysium is the ability to lay down in an updated version of a tanning bed, and with an ID printed on your wrist, you can instantly become healed of injury, anything from diabetes to having half your head blown off. I think it's a nifty invention, and so do those on earth who pack together on a space shuttle and attempt to crash-land on Elysium to get a chance at a new life.The two societies clash with the wealthy employing absolutely brutal robot police on earth, ready to strike down anyone who does not comply with their orders. Max is a lowly factory worker who runs his mouth a bit much. Within time, his arm is broke, and while I won't spoil too much more here, suffice to say it becomes necessary for him to visit Elysium. This isn't much more information than you are given by the film's trailers of course.Alice Braga plays Max's love interest, and we are told they actually used to be quite close as children through flash backs. Apparently Max used to be catholic or something, and now he's an exceptionally hardened man, dependent on survival, no matter the cost.Damon is quite good here, and seems to pull off a bald head quite well. While we may not be completely in the know on why he acts the way he does, we are convinced that he is determined to finish his goals. Foster plays a very android-like defense coordinator of Elysium, named Delacourt. She has some kind of ridiculous plot to take control of the space station, but her purpose seems to lose its way and reason within time. She's ice-cold, and Jodie Foster is quite good at that.The point where ""Elysium"" loses its metallic luster is when we realize that Blomkamp is practically spoon-feeding us. ""District 9″ was obvious in many ways, but as we pulled for Copley's character, we may not be entirely sure what Max actually stands for. It's very clear that there is a lot of social commentary here about the rate at which our real world economies are being flushed down the toilet. The rich only get more wealthy, and the poor are forced to immeasurably more desperate means of survival. However, as we wonder about the future implications of a U.S. president that many claim is a socialist in disguise, Blomkamp's discussion on the economy begins turning astray. If he's not talking about that, then what is he talking about anyway? Maybe he never really was spoon-feeding us after all.I hate to continue comparing ""Elysium"" to ""District 9″, but where the grittiness and brutality worked in the latter, it seems not to push the thematic as well here. There is a scene involving some surgery, and while it's no brain operation from the ""Saw"" franchise, it feels unnecessary. A woman is slapped hard across the face, and evil mercenaries are exploded into countless pieces. We sit on the edge of our seats, not so much for the adrenaline we are given, but perhaps only for the uncomfortable feeling in the pit of our stomachs, hoping to God that the next death may not be so brutal. That being said, Sharlto Copley plays an absolutely ruthless villain, named Kruger. It's really something to see. His dialogue is pretty weak, but every time he's on-screen, we cringe.I felt as if I have been a bit harsh towards ""Elysium"" but as I have encouraged in previous reviews I have written, please do not take my word for it. I hope only that what I write helps you to discover details in films and entertainment that perhaps you may have missed on your first viewing. I am not a film critic by any means, but ""Elysium"" unfortunately misses the mark in some areas, and those are the areas that I think matter most. I want to care for Max, but the filmmaker's don't truly give us the capacity to do so. This being said, take time to digest the films that you watch, and take the time to discuss them. Ingesting entertainment without discretion will not only brutalize your discernment, but will destroy your ability to willfully comprehend whatever you just watched.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A ridiculous waste of money,"Although Jodie Foster and Matt Damon and the rest of the cast give it their all, the story is absurd, bordering on comical. Some lines (""You make me want to settle down"")are destined for parody--if not obscurity. One wonders if Damon and Foster read the script before signing on--or if they just assumed it would make millions and, hey, who can't use more money. Just like the people on Elysium. As a metaphor against poverty and classism, the script is so tendentious it cannot be taken seriously. Too bad; this could have been a good movie. Instead, it serves as a fine example of what happens when you throw money and more money into film but lack a well written story.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Elysium"" Review","""Elysium"" takes place in the year 2154, when Earth becomes an overpopulated and diseased dump. Meanwhile, the space station Elysium provides a lush land filled with flourishing health and high culture. There is a darker side to Elysium, however, as the corrupt executives control the security robots and prevent illegal immigrants from entering Elysium. The fate of Elysium and the world rests in the hands of one man named Max Da Costa who could also bring equality to both worlds.Directed by Neill Blomkamp (""District 9""), the film stars Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley as the villainous mercenary working for Foster's Elysian executive. The supporting cast also includes Diego Luna as Max's friend, as well as other Mexican actors portraying smugglers who help Max on his journey to save humanity. The art direction shows the large contrast between the futuristic & thriving Elysium and the grittiness of the impoverished Earth. The main themes this movie covers include corrupt committees, health care issues, overpopulation, and trans-humanism, with gritty details and well-hidden symbolism reminiscent of the conditions for real 21st century immigrants.The first half of ""Elysium"" explores the life of Damon's character as he becomes exposed to radiation, giving him just days to live, requiring the use of machine parts and the brain data of another person. He attempts to escape to Elysium with a childhood friend (Alice Braga) and her daughter, who is diagnosed with leukemia. The climactic second half of the film, on the other hand, becomes disappointing as it depends on explosions and high-octane intensity. However, thanks to some excellent performances from the cast and an intriguing premise, it's sufficient enough to pass as a recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Satisfying sci-fi,"I don't get why some other reviewers were disappointed by the story. I found it highly intriguing. A city of heaven floating in space near earth? Sign me up. It looks gorgeous too. Then there is hell on earth for those left behind, seeking a way up there.Good pacing, great effects, a very likeable hero (played well by Matt Damon, although you might not 100% buy the pain he is enduring throughout the journey).Just a satisfying movie overall. Violent, sure, and the fights go on a bit too long for my taste. But the world set up here really grips you. They have perfect automated medical care in the future, but not everyone gets it. Of course this leads to fights. The social dichotomy shown in Elysium is really not that far from what we have today: the haves and the have-nots.Elysium is a movie that just works. 10/10, recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

If u can over look the many plot holes & typical format @ the time this film was made, there's humor in it. Wish Fichner had more screen time. Kruger is a seen stealer too bc actor enjoys his character & plays it to max. Foster is ok, she's done better.The msin thing to remember is to know Matt is like Iron man & of course will prevail.

Matt Damon in space,"District 9 was a brilliant film and so a tough act to follow up. Elysium is visually and stylistically very similar to D9, but with a different story. The plot strongly reminded me of Battle Angel with influences from other scifi pop culture like Terminator, Mass Effect etc. The VFX are incredibly well done and very believable. The cinematography is mainly hand-held which gives you more the feeling that you're there and makes it feel more dynamic. Casting Matt Damon as the lead seems a bit odd, and although he doesn't do a bad job he feels a bit out of place. They also asked Eminem for the lead part but that would definitely have been worse. Jodie Foster plays the heavy but she has a British-like accent and she does seem to overact a little bit. Sharlto Copley on the other hand was well cast as the lunatic merc. So to round up, I found it a very enjoyable film and it was about what I expected but the plot could have been fleshed out a bit better, the characters seems a bit flat and the film lacks heart for lack of a better term. His next film 'Chappie' will be a scifi comedy with a robot in the lead and will be loosely based on his 2003 short Tetra Vaal. Jackman, Weaver, Copley and Dev Patel have already been confirmed as cast so this should be interesting :)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Elysium was a brilliant attempt though not as good as District 9,"The out-of-box title ""Elysium"" is sure going to build mystery surrounding the film's plot. Elysium is a spectacular sci-fi action adventure that defies the visual effects with brilliant story line.In the year 2154, LA lies in the ruin where the population on earth is suffering from post-massacre affect, disease and poverty while the rich resides on a more comfortable life in the Universe called Elysium. Circumstances in Max's life gives him an opportunity to bring equality between two worlds but he has to pay the price for it.From the director of critical and commercial acclaim District 9, Neil Blomkamp comes with yet another visual appealing sci-fi action flick. The plot of the film is splendid but the screenplay could have been strong. I felt not much effort was put to extract brave performances from talents like Jodie Foster and Matt Damon. Having said that, Damon does a fine job as Max. Sharlto Copley plays a negative character for first time and gives a stupendous performance. Art direction is brilliant with astounding cinematography.

What could have been,"Film left me a little flat. Conceptually good, visually great, but pacing seemed a little off @ times and was quite clunky in parts. Back story kinda pointless(except for the young Matt Damon who looked like River Phoenix as a boy, unless that was the point). Last 1/3 or ¼ of the film seems to go off the rails.I guess shaky cam is still OK? Just makes the visual blur of any action sequence frustratingly unwatchable.Went in with high expectations, but the film just didn't have the same impact as District 9. Can't quite put my finger on what was missing/wrong with the film, but it didn't gel with me.Again Sharlto was great, until the last 1/3rd which turns into transformers with humans or something like that.Not a bad film, just not a great one.What could have been.6.25/6.75 – 10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"good action flick, not a significant movie.","I'm a little disappointed by Elysium because I thought Blomkamp had more to say, coming from District 9. I imagined it would have been repetitive but still interesting if he kept exploring the segregation and racism theme in a sci-fi movie. Instead Elysium follows the blockbuster road with a plot already seen in many, many action movies. I won't reveal anything but you'll easily recognize similarities. Kind of a shame given the talent of Blomkamp. Not much to say on the acting, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were flawless as usual and everyone else was fine too, but there wasn't any space for characters development, so no Oscars here.However, when you make peace with the fact that this is just an action movie you're actually in for a treat. The camera work is outstanding, there are a couple of new ideas very well implemented that really gets you excited about the fight scenes even if you're slammed on the sofa eating cookies like I was. The android technology shown and created for this future era is also brilliant and it's where Blomkamp always shines.So I advise to watch it because it's quite entertaining, but don't expect anything else then a couple of hours of Matt Damon fighting in a prosthetic android skeleton.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not bad.,"It's decent for what it is. Nowhere near as good as ""District 9"" but nowhere near as bad as ""Chappie"".First, a personal point: I like simple and contained science fiction.Most of the acting is good. Especially from one actor in particular but I'll get to him in a second.
The special effects still look good.
The violence is satisfying. These are the most memorable parts of the movie.
You want the main characters to succeed.
You don't feel the runtime at all.
There was gross but cool imagery.
Some of the music is pretty cool, too.
By far the best thing about this movie was Sharlto Copley as Kruger. This guy stole the show! Not only did he give the most memorable performance in the movie, but his character actually felt like a theat and was by far the most interesting.
It's got a good amount of rewatch value.
It's really just good, unchallenging entertainment.There was bad and unnecessary dialogue.
As much as I like Jodie Foster as an actress, and her performance wasn't bad, but she didn't really bring anything to the table.
There is some cheese.
The guy who played Spider, whose name I am not even going to bother looking up because I really don't care about him, was terrible and his character was annoying.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Plenty of promise, but fails to fully deliver","A peril of blogging about film is that it can give the inadvertent impression that my opinion of a given film is fixed. My blog about District 9 is a case in point. I enjoyed much about that film the first time around, but I concluded that it didn't have the depth it liked to think it did. I've re- watched it multiple times since (largely because it's a film people like to watch when they visit us in South Africa), and my admiration has grown and deepened. I still find it exciting and fun, but I keep seeing new depth in it too. It turns out that it was I who wasn't thinking deeply enough.So it's with a little apprehension that I finally settled down to watch the director (Neill Blomkamp) follow-up to that film, Elysium. Worryingly, my conclusions are similar if less positive overall; there's much that's good about it, but it's ultimately disappointing. Like the former, this is a science-fiction earthed in the director's South African reality. This time the context is the division between rich and poor; Earth has been left behind by the elite for an idyllic space- station called Elysium, always in view and out of sight by the teeming masses of poor left behind, grinding out lives of subsistence, dead-end jobs and subservience to a system loaded against them. Matt Damon gets caught up in an industrial accident on Earth; seeking healing he's embarked on a dangerous course of action to earn illegal passage to the man-made paradise and certain healing.There's so much about Neill Blomkamp's emerging style. He knows the grammar of science- fiction films well, but his is an authentically original voice and style. He directs actions scenes brilliantly in a post-Bourne world, using hand-held shaking cameras well but in a subtly different way. Every action scene is gripping and involving. As someone who lives in South Africa I like that he uses South African talent and patois alongside better known talent and language. Throwaway South African slang is brilliantly used to draw into the film's world, not alienate. District 9's star is back again, similarly intense but in a key supporting role and a world away from that film's fear-struck vulnerability.Overall, though, it just doesn't work. Key supporting roles (Jodie Foster's being a case in point) are under-written to the point that we're never quite sure what they're for even at key plot moments; the coldness of the privileged elite seems less like the gap between rich and poor and more like lazy writing. Other than good medical care and nice gardens, Elysium itself doesn't seem to have any actual content - which means the gap between rich and poor is never quite established beyond a need for good health care. Which might make sense (and it does) in South Africa, but just doesn't work for the film's central theme. By the time the climactic scenes roll around, you're impressed and entertained, but confused as to quite what's happening and why it all matters so much to so may people.It's a shame, but not a crying one. It's still a decent film, but I'd be really surprised if I grew to feel about this film the way I do about District 9. What we do know for certain, though, is that Neill Blomkamp is a director to watch with excitement.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It should be called ""Mediacare""","One of the worst ""sci-fi"" flicks I have ever seen. Give me Transformers 4 anytime. Not only it's childishly silly in its politics, but the plot has more holes in it than a Swiss cheese (which tastes better). Things happen just because, to please the poor scriptwriter (who's also the movie's director - apparently he couldn't find anyone else to shoot the thing). In a ""fascist"" universe people come and go as they please. There's a whole underground society with the highest technology available. One wonders why they don't use it to cure these poor children. The ships going from Earth to Elysium get shot down or get in, whatever the story needs. A highly trained, clever technician gets hurt in a way a 10 years old child wouldn't. And then we have these heartrending memories of childhood in slo-mo, loads of them, with music, of course. BTW : the score is laughable. And I have never seen Jodie Foster that bad. She's a great actress, but if she can pretend to be that bad, it means genius.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"District 9 on steroids. Max action, minimal social comment, good entertainment.","In 2054 the super rich have abandoned Earth for a space station of opulence, Elysium. Earth is now the domain of the poor, unhealthy dregs of humankind who serve the industrial needs of the Elysium privileged but are never likely to receive invitations to champagne-fuelled soirées. Like an extreme version of the American dream, those on Earth stare up at the sky and dream of a citizenship chip in their arm that will give them entry to a society where life is perfect and illnesses are cured by a few seconds in a 'med pod'.Max (Matt Damon) is a factory worker who is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. The computer calmly informs him he has just days to live so Max agrees to embark on a mission for black marketer Spider (Wagner Moura) accompanied by his friend, Julio (Diego Luna) with a pass to Elysium his payment. Up on the space station, however, Secretary of Homeland Security Delacourt Rhodes (Jodie Foster) has no intention of allowing the mission to succeed and brings in her violent secret police forces, led by Agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley).The immediate comparison to be made with Elysium is with writer/director Neill Blomkamp's feature debut, District 9. Elysium has the same initial 'look' to it with a rotting, corrupt and uninviting futuristic Earth and massive social issues that reflect the troubles of our world today. Blomkamp's work looks largely at inequality and injustice though a sci-fi avenue. His next offering, 2015's Chappie (based on his short film Tetra Vaal and again staring Copley) looks likely to follow the trend, at least in the sci-fi crime aspect. But Elysium is to District 9 what Aliens is Alien. He has moved from thought-provoking human study set against a particular backdrop, to full on action thriller that is more about weaponry and spectacle than surprise.But that's no criticism in itself. I loved Aliens. It's just a different type of film than Ridley Scott's original. Elysium is a good film. It's a fun and engaging film. It's just important to know from the outset there are no surprises, it's formulaic and pure entertainment using social comment as an excuse rather than it's raison d'être.Damon further flexes his muscles as the intelligent action hero, ably assisted by good-looking sidekick, to selflessly take on the two-dimensional evil, arrogant villain. In her role, Foster is a joy to watch. It's rare we are permitted to watch her chomp scenery and get down and dirty with people's lives. Her Rhodes is deliciously conniving. She is the power-hungry bitch you can't help enjoying while looking forward to her destructive end.Likewise, Copley is on overdrive here, dosing up his District 9 persona with a bucket load of steroids and going on the rampage. This isn't another performance of desperation and panic; in Elysium, his Agent Kruger is a gun-totting, black-hatted Wild West sheriff hurled forward in time a couple of hundred years and given access to weaponry bad sheriffs couldn't even dream of.Luna feels underused as Julio and perhaps the predictable thread of Max's childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), and her sick daughter could have been jettisoned in favour of a deeper relationship and screen time for these two characters.Enjoying District 9 is a fine starting point when approaching Elysium, but leave your expectations at the door. You'll see the conclusion almost from the moment the opening credits fade but it's still an enjoyable romp.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Take a shot and watch it,"The movie starts off explaining how the world became overpopulated and how the rich people fled to a place called ""Elysium"" where you can live for hundreds of years and be cured of any disease or handicap you might come across. Which, lets be honest, if that's how things turn out to be, might be pretty awesome.There is also a little back story of Matt Damon's character as a child growing up along side a young girl named ""Frey"". They are the best of friends and it's his promise to one day take them to Elysium.The cinematography might be the best part of the film. The way the world is portrayed as an overpopulated mess is brilliant in my opinion. A very grimy and dark place to live and you get the feeling no one wants to be there. And then you see Elysium and how beautiful it is. I also liked the way it was designed.Anyway, back to the story. Damon's character becomes exposed to a severe amount of radiation that will kill him in 5 days. The only way to survive is to get to Elysium. That's when the action begins and we get action sequences which are a bit gruesome but entertaining nonetheless. However, some of those scenes are shot with a hand-held camera so it becomes shaky which I don't like at all. But, it doesn't take away too much from the movie.Jodie Foster plays the villain who wants all the power of Elysium in her pocket. It doesn't get explained but I'm assuming on Earth, there is no more President or Vice President, etc. But in one scene after Foster's character does something without authority, she gets summoned by the President. So I'm assuming that means all the big authorities live on Elysium. Anyway, she doesn't like the way it's being run and wants to do something about it. It's just, I'm not sure if she was trying for a French/American accent or any accent for that matter, you don't enjoy the movie while she's on screen. But maybe that makes the movie work.Bottom line for me, if you enjoy science fiction movies, you will enjoy this one. It's an interesting take on what could happen should the earth become overpopulated. It's not as good as Bloomkamp's first movie ""Distric 9"" but it had me entertained from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A pleasant surprise,"I chose to watch this film after not really knowing what it was about. I had a glance at the trailer and thought it looked slightly similar to After Earth so i wasn't expecting much more than a typical sci-fi movie.I was pleasantly surprised by how much i actually enjoyed this film. The beginning was a little generic with emphasis on poverty which i can only assume had taken over all earth. In my opinion the film really begins about 20 minutes in with some of the scenes before being near enough pointless.After this however the film comes to life with the introduction of Kruger played by Sharlto Copley. Matt Damon makes a brilliant hero but Sharlto Copley makes an even better villain - stealing the attention from every scene hes in. Even if you don't find the film memorable, you will certainly remember Kruger! The action/fight scenes weren't anything too special but they were good for a Sci-fi.I was happy that there wasn't any crammed in romances and i think the friendship between Max and Frey was lovely as well as the friendship between Max and Julio.Unlike many other films the ending wasn't at all rushed and it rounded up all loose ends and left me feeling glad that i had watched it.I guess if you really wanted to you could pick faults with the science of Elysium like how it was built so quickly or how residents there could even breathe. But in all honesty i think you could pick minor faults in any sci-fi movie.For a film that i new barely anything about i was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and i would definitely recommend it to others!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Elysium has shades of D9 but the canvass is much bigger than anything Blomkamp has attempted. So if larger than life is your thing, Elysium won't disappoint. Special effects though minimal impress in the right places. They aren't in your face or brought out every five minutes.

The thing that ruined it for me was Jody Foster. Her attempt at playing a man, even a tom boy when she was young, just does not cut it. She comes across fake and ineffective. She has in almost all her movies. The one movie I liked was Contact, though she blew it at the end. Her acting is fake and contrived. How she has survived all these years as an actress is beyond me. She put a huge damper on this movie.Then, William Fichtner, is a hit and miss actor. When he hits it he is right on the mark. When he misses it, he is as he is in this movie. Scenes that are good and others that reek.If you can put up with the downer these two put on the movie you'll enjoy it.

"Visually striking, if nothing else, a movie made for cinema","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the year 2054, massive over population and massive poverty have left earth a baron, desolate wasteland. The rich and powerful have hop footed it up to a magical new place called Elysium, a paradise where people can live in peace and luxury, at the expense of the hard labour of those down below, such as Max (Matt Damon), a bulky manual worker who gets infected with something nasty after an accident at work. To get the cure he needs, he has no choice but to take on an assignment for renegade Julio (Deigo Luna), in the shape of apprehending smarmy Elysium corporate manager John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and stealing some information from his brain. Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the ice queen ruler of Elysium, can't have this and sends the ruthless Kruger (Sharlito Copley) to deal with him.Very few directors start off as big names. It's unlikely a major studio, with no track record of their previous box office magic, will grant them a huge budget to start off with, however visionary their ideas may be or however driven they appear to attain perfection. So it's more likely, if they're going to end up making a big name for themselves, that they'll need to get a cult hit on their hands first, a small budget offering that maybe becomes something of a sleeper hit and develops a loyal fan base, even if it's only a small one. And so Neill Blomkamp a few years back, gave us his still memorable District 9, that had the distinction of having impressed none other than Peter Jackson. And if the Lord of the Rings guy loves it, who is anyone else to complain?Despite having a much bigger budget and consequentially far more publicity, Elysium still hasn't lost the touch Blomkamp gave D9, this time with visually awesome, magnificent special effects that retain the dark, dystopian feel he managed with a much smaller budget. It's a film you need to catch at the cinema, preferably an IMAX, I guess, where you can get the full effect of the stunning spectacles on offer. Of course, aside from these, Elysium suffers in other ways. Naturally, as a post apocalyptic science fiction film, there's the opportunity for some social commentary on how things could turn out and the pros and cons of living in such a world, but the screenplay seems far less concerned with what over population could drive the world to, and instead just getting on with a fairly generic, predictable story that just serves as a catalyst for all the destruction and mayhem that ensues.The film aims to blow you away with it's scope and vision, and you have a right to expect great things in that department. You can even expect a decent piece of trashy fun to munch some popcorn to. But you'll have to be in a far less demanding mood in terms of the writing, dialogue and anything else that would have given it more substance. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Do not want...,"I do not believe the Randian principles that this movie was based on- I do not believe that if you remove the very rich that the society that remains would be one of crime and poverty. I believe, if the rich somehow figured out a way to overcome all scientific barriers to building/living on a space station (which I assume would include messaging technology that looks better than Sprint text messages circa 2002), a new caste system would emerge (probably with those lauding authoritarianism on top) and political dissidents looking to dismantle the system (not car thieves) would be par for course within that new society (assuming that the rich are on a space station not the gated community across the train tracks). This would have been a more interesting movie.I did not expect anything from this movie- it usually keeps me from being disappointed. I was not disappointed-- I was induced to anger by shallow characters whose motivation consists of only ""My sick daughter!"" or ""I want power"" or ""I'm envious of that perfect life in the sky- and now my sick butt has motivated me to get there."" If I don't care about the characters at all- how am I supposed to care what happens in the *very long fight scenes*? These shallow characters were highlighted by the atrocious dialogue. Characters shift within their actions for no understandable reason.I'm a liberal and this movie felt like propaganda to ME. It was ham handed about health care, wealth inequality, racial inequality- all legitimate concerns but so poorly illustrated that it became a mockery of itself and those concerns.

Space station paradise for the few,"Matt Damon lives in a society that is like a shanty town and jobs are hard to come by.

We then cut to the space station Elysium where people live in a lush lifestyle where the president seems to adhere to some sort of liberal values yet leaves the citizens of earth a wretched existence as the best health care is reserved for Elysium and Jodie Foster is plotting an overthrow. Again a half baked analysis of society, we have little ides what makes the people of Elysium tick. Why does the president care if Foster is merciless as to how she deals with illegal immigrants on rockets when he is responsible for the state of affairs on earth. In fact why will he not send these medical pods to earth yet funds doctors and nurse and hospitals on earth.Back on earth where its clear this is a police state with a huge underclass and workers are glorified slaves with little health and safety protection, Damon having being exposed to life threatening injuries needs to get to Elysium and join forces with gangsters to get there.The film had good visuals and set pieces but many expected better from the director of District 9.

A lot of other plot bits, no spoilers, more just to keep story moving. Baddie is excellent, Matt Damon good but bit dull and Jodie Foster does the annoying acting she always does where her mouth hardly moves!

District 9 was better,"While watching ELYSIUM I kept thinking I've seen this movie before. The look, the feel all seemed familiar. I then realized that this movie was written and directed by Neil Blomkamp who gave us DISTRICT 9 a few years back.DISTRICT 9 was better.This is a pretty by-the-book sci-fi action thriller. We have the haves vs. the have nots. A reluctant hero, Matt Damon, must rise up from his impoverished life to give birth to a revolution for the common man over the privileged few.There was some interesting ideas here, not the least of which was Damon's ecto-skeleton suit. This could have been a super-hero origin story, instead it degrades into a standard shoot-em-up where the reluctant hero must save the sick daughter of his childhood love or die trying.Stop me if you've seen this movie before.This is the 2nd movie this weekend that I was disappointed in what Sharlto Copley was doing. He needs to find a director that can tap into the potential that was shown in District 9. Diego Luna was over-the- top ""cartoony"" as the lead rebel while Alice Braga was bland as the love interest.

Gives viewers something to think about and digest while enjoying the action.,"'ELYSIUM': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Neil Blomkamp's second feature (and follow-up to his immensely popular and critically acclaimed 2009 sci-fi hit 'DISTRICT 9') is yet another sci-fi action film laced with social and political commentary. Where 'DISTRICT 9' deals with social segregation and racism in South Africa this film deals with class warfare, immigration and the healthcare system in America. The film is set in a future world (2154) where the poor are forced to live on an overpopulated, disease and war stricken Earth while the rich live on a space station (called Elysium) without these problems. Blomkamp has been quoted as saying although it's set in the future it's about right now. Above all it's an awesome action movie. It stars Matt Damon as a an ex-con who's exposed to a deadly level of radiation, at his crappy job, and will stop at nothing to make his way onto Elysium in order to cure himself. It co-stars Jodie Foster and the star of 'DISTRICT 9' Sharlto Copley (who's a scene-stealer).Damon plays Max Da Costa, an ex-con who now lives in a ruined Los Angeles working a dead-end factory job. The factory is ran by CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner), who routinely visits Earth in order to make sure his company becomes profitable again. While returning to Elysium a high ranking government official, named Jessica Delacourt (Foster), asks Carlyle to write her an illegal computer program, that will allow her to override Elysium and make her the President, in return for years of defense contracting business. When Da Costa is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation (that will kill him in five days) doing a deadly job for Carlyle's company (and simply 'thrown away' by him) he wants revenge. He agrees to take a job, from a smuggler named Spider (Wagner Moura), stealing corporate information from Carlyle in exchange for a free ride to Elysium. Due to the fact that Max is deathly ill Spider has a strength enhancing exoskeleton surgically attached to Max's body (to help him do the job better). When Delacourt finds out what Spider and Max are up to she enlists an insane South African mercenary, named Kruger (Copley), to stop them.Damon is once again a great action hero (but nothing too much, in terms of acting, is required of him here). Foster makes a good despicable corporate villain as well but it's Copley that once again steals the show. He and Blomkamp make a great team and going from bumbling nerd hero (in 'DISTRICT 9') to treacherous lethal villain in this is remarkable (He was also a great scene-stealer in 'THE A-TEAM' in-between). Copley makes a classic and very memorable movie villain here and the movie overall is just great sci-fi action. The drama isn't quite as effective as it would like to be but it works. Like all great science fiction the film is a thinking man's movie and full of brilliant social commentary. Everything the movie says about society is exactly true, as well, right now (like Blomkamp says). It's only a matter of time until things turn disastrous or we do something about it. The movie delivers this message in a very effective way. I've heard people complain (as they did with 'DISTRICT 9') that the movie absorbs itself in action by the end and turns from smart to the routine. I agree but I think it's a good thing. This (like 'DISTRICT 9') is primarily an action film; Blomkamp obviously loves action and movie violence and he glorifies it in both films. It's not that he turns his films from thinking man's movies into action films it's that he makes his action films 'thinking man's movies' as well. That's a good thing! He gives viewers something to think about and digest while enjoying the action and the thrill ride. He's an awesome action film director and I love his movies.

I wish Blomkamp would just make District 10,"In 2009 new director Neill Blomkamp started off his feature career with an astounding bang with the Peter Jackson backed District 9. This was one of the freshest and most original science fiction stories to be released in a long time so, naturally, big things were expected when Blomkamp got the opportunity to up his budget and fill his cast with A-listers like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster big things were expected. Unfortunately this was a lot of hype to live up to and Elysium falls just short of being another fantastic original sci-fi film.Set in the year 2154, Elysium tells the story of a dystopian society where the wealth gap has become quite literal, with the rich elites of the world living lives of luxury on their space station Elysium which orbits a ravaged and overpopulated Earth and looks awfully similar to the Halo ring world from the video game franchise, something Blomkamp was at one time attached to for a film adaptation. Obviously he still wants to make that a reality. Anyways, Matt Damon plays Max, a factory worker on Earth who gets the opportunity to go to Elysium where he may be able to equalize the two polarizing societies. But along the way he runs into killer robots, katana wielding assassins, and a slew of crazy sci-fi action-packed obstacles.Elysium has all of the ingredients to be another District 9 sci-fi revolution. It's got an interesting concept, albeit one that has become increasingly common, surrounding social and wealth inequality. This inequality is a little in your face and a little too obvious, but the contrast between Elysium and Earth definitely gets the point across. It's got the budget to carry the epic visuals and make Elysium look truly badass.This is a beautiful film with landscapes that are absolutely stunning. The designs of the two separate worlds are both gorgeous in their own ways. The designs of the characters, costumes, vehicles, and weapons are all reminiscent of the dirty rusty look of District 9. If nothing else Elysium is a major accomplishment on a visual level and I give major props to the filmmakers for building this fascinatingly original world.I really enjoyed most of Elysium. The visual flare of the film never ceases to amaze, and it grows increasingly cooler as more and more elements get introduced to the story. The film's one big fault is that key word, ""story."" Where District 9 was a multi-layered story told in a unique and compelling pseudo-documentary style, Elysium is a traditional straight-forward narrative that doesn't go much deeper than Earth people wanting to be on Elysium and Elysians not wanting Earth people on their world for the obvious reasons. The characters are fun and exciting, but not particularly compelling. The storyline itself is similar as well. It's a lot of fun, but I think this film wants to be taken a lot more seriously than its tone and content merits.Elysium is worth the watch for its beauty and glamour, and the onslaught of explosive sci-fi action. Overall it's a really underwhelming film though, and its melodramatic ending is worth nothing more than an eye roll. I like to think that the studio is to blame for the pitfalls of this movie, and that District 9 wasn't just luck, but I don't know for sure. I guess we'll just have to wait for Blomkamp's next flick, 2015's Chappie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Visually With Little to Inspire,"Elysium always promised to be a 'popcorn' movie and with the direction from Neill Blomkamp it would be expected to deliver a similar punch to previous efforts like District 9. Naturally it's easy to see the similarities and the inclusion of Sharlto Copley is a treat as his character Kruger provides a large part of the entertainment.Like other reviews I also agree that the visual effects are crucial to the entertainment of the film particularly in the slow motion dismemberment shots which are thoroughly enjoyable in a macabre way. The gritty atmosphere is created by Blomkamp by use of the locations a futuristic vision of Los Angeles riddled with disease and poverty on one end of the spectrum and the plush, luxury of the idealistic Elysium on the other.Yes the storyline is predictable and to be fair it has been attempted on multiple occasions before so the task was always going to be a tough one, but the difference is that this film is truly entertaining, it's got all the elements of action you need, a great attention to detail visually and a motive. In no way will this be a classic and will be forgotten a lot sooner than District 9 but it's a solid effort.To conclude Elysium is an entertaining 'popcorn' movie using the limited resources of a tired modern sci-fi idea.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium (2013) by Neill Blomkamp.,"This Sci-Fi drama is about a classic clash of the rich and the poor which takes place in the far future. Earth is overpopulated and ruined to say the least. To live a healthy life you have to be rich enough to get yourself at a space station made for the very wealthy.A film without much chemistry. Too bad because I really like the cast. Matt Damon had absolutely no chemistry with Alice Braga unfortunately. And after seeing Jodie Foster's performance I would almost agree with what some people say about her that she is the most overrated actress, but she still is one of my favorite actresses.The graphics was very good to impressive.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extensionism of invasionism!,"The three worlds of industry,utopia and third world disguise a topical tale of oppression and freedom.Action and adventure abound as Matt Damon and his freedom loving people smuggling sidekicks vie to free themselves of the oppressive oppression of their existence.Some nice near future elements and technology made for what is hopefully a dystopian setting.The tight shots did not allow for great detail about the settings that might flesh the world out a little more.If discussion of issues is the goal perhaps a tiny bit blunt in the scripting.Jodie Foster; cold,efficient and Matt Damon; a very human hero were nice counterpoints to each other.Not too orriball I mostly enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved it!  I will buy the DVD.,"I don't understand the negative reviews of this film. It's easy (and perhaps chic) to tear down art but it is hard to make it. I would love to see the films put out by all of the negative reviewers to see if they can do better than this one.The film was a fantastic thrill ride. It was visually stunning. The props and environments were excellent. The camera work was great. What i mean by that was every frame of this film was well composed. The fight sequences were a bit jarring but I could still follow the action. The vehicle designs were spectacular, I felt that the designers of the vehicles really tried to reflect real physics when developing these assets. The robot storage in the side of the executive spaceship was a great touch. the robots were gritty and believable. The robot animation was top-notch. I even liked the script.Looking through the credits I saw that the famous designer, Syd Mead worked on this one. The shots of the space station really reflected his work. Weta does hire some of the best artists in the world for their projects.I am a great lover of sci-fi and i loved this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Liberal Left Wing Garbage,Typical left wing propaganda against anyone who is wealthy or prosperous. It promotes immigration and socialism. Matt Damon yet again shows his ignorance. If all the people on Earth were placed on Elysium it would be a desolate waste land in a matter of hours. Don't waste your time or money. This will be the last time I watch a Matt Damon movie. Time to stop supporting liberal Hollywood filth. The rest of this post is to fill up ten lines of text so I can post to this website and give my opinion due to the fact I'm sick of reading most others. If your tired of these type of left wing liberal movies please post a review saying so and boycott anything to due with the actors in them and directors who work on them.,1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Shaky-Cam beware,"This is so far the culmination of a disappointing movie summer. The plot is so simple, it could fit into a three-panel comic. Fair deal for an action movie, but since the director stated in interviews he wanted to draw some attention to social and ecological problems this has to be said. It's simplicity maybe even leads to wrong and maybe dangerous deductions for the real world - as I realized when talking to friends after the movies. Apart from that the characters are incredibly flat. The inhabitants of Elysium differ by.. speaking french instead of Spanish as a second tongue besides English? Come on. OK, I forgot they're more healthy. As for the action movie, it pretends to be full of action by overly excessive (yes, that's a tautology) use of shaky cam - and granted, action is plenty, but unfortunately I can't see it because of the shaky cam blurring everything. Last but not least it lacks even in pseudo-realism.That being said - the acting is not that bad. And it's probably better than a Halo movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Kruger prequel anyone?,"I had been looking forward to seeing this when first hearing about it. The plot, the cast, the director; it had the makings of a great film. And it didn't disappoint. Far from perfect, but i enjoyed all of it; i was never bored or found myself fidgeting. I was solely focused on the screen.Matt Damon is as reliable as ever; he just does his job every time; whatever the part, he plays it as well as he can. It is in no way his finest performance, but he still acts very well. The rest of the cast follow his lead, well apart from one; Sharlito Copley. Easily the star of the show; it is now clear that Copley and the films director Neill Blomkamp are a force to be reckoned with. With Blomkamp directing him he seems to excel; as he did in District 9 and with the upcoming ""Chappie"" it will be a hat trick for the duo. His role as Kruger is amongst the best I've seen in the last couple of years. Vicious, relentless,ruthless and even funny at times. It is an outstanding performance and the best part of a great film. I would love to see a prequel focused on the life of Kruger; he is that good.The plot has a solid basis and it accelerates as the film goes on. It projects real life issues, injecting them into a big screen blockbuster and it works well. The special effects are as spectacular as i had expected; and overall it was a highly enjoyable.Up there with the top films this year and i would highly recommend it to anyone.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Was the Cameraman an Epileptic?,"I don't know why Hollywood seems to like this shaky camera crap, but it really damaged this film.

A motivational and eye opening film,"I see so many reviews around here saying this movie is a waste and its just bad. I still insist on watching the film on theater though, what amazes me is how the film delivered its uplifting story we tend to mislead our standards with this film because it is not just an action pack adventure sci-fi theme it have its lesson to tell and not just that it needs to rebuild our thinking of whats with the future ahead.I am deeply amaze that today we can now conceptualize our future which holds a machine that cures every disease. The movie expresses its role to uplift and motivate each one of us that we have a purpose to fulfill and in-order to make it happen we should not forget what inspires us. Many movies contain an eye opening message about our future but this is one of those which is kinda realistic for me, because as our resources reach its scarcity our world will tend to die itself, even sustaining a healthy life.

"Wonderful potential, but I had to walk out.","The story was interesting, though I believe it is a retelling of part of HG Well's ""Time Machine"", with the Morlocks living underground and the Eloi living above. Very easy comparison with people living in the squall of Earth while the elite live above in the space station.I did find the contrasts interesting, with Max (Matt Damon) being very visceral with his language (both in English AND Spanish) while Ms Delacourt (Jodie Foster), playing the refined bureaucrat (fluent in French) was actually the one with the coarser disposition.There was however a scene where the violence and carnage just got to be a bit much. My wife was noticeably disturbed by it, so we chose to leave. I'm confident this film will do very well, it just wasn't my ""cup of tea"".",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's a great film, hands down.","The film is well worth a watch.""Elysium"" was viewed at home on an iTunes recommendation. I did not look into it at all. So even before we got to the 'Afrikaner' accent from the bad guys I felt the story was a rehash of ""District 9"". Especially because it looked the same. Yes, Shalto Copley seeled it, it was a Neill Blomkamp film, but before him all i could see were the similarities in the character ""Max"" from ""Elysium"" and ""Wikus"" from ""District 9"". The story of the unassuming hero who needs to emotionally understand his part in joining the revolution/resistance...So was the story lacking depth? Were the characters heartless? Was it sloppy character development and rudimentary story telling? I personally saw the connection between the two films and was captivated nonetheless. ""Elysium"" seemed to focus on creating the world the story would play out in, as it formed a large crux of what the story would be about, so the difference in setting was more crucial than the unassuming hero. Maybe if the hero had been a woman it may have added a dimension that was less familiar, bringing us to the point. It was not a poor story but a familiar one which left the story revelers to think of something else while soaking up the visual feast. Captivation was not as demanding simply based on a familiar feeling. And it took a second viewing to really grasp the story because I just wasn't listening the first time - I heard the sounds but not the words.So why deem it such a great film if in fact very little attention was paid? Once that familiar story was acknowledged the focus was not on ""Max"" but the connection that Elysium has to Earth, the unflinching grasp one group has to have over another in order to exist.Admittedly great movies have to have pivotal main characters, so how can one just dismiss the main character and still rave about its importance? That's because it's a Sci-Fi. Take a great Sci- Fi story like ""The Man From Earth"". Impeccable in the way it massages the brain but that very massaging could be experienced if I listened to it over the radio. It was not fantastical in its delivery. ""After Earth"" had characters that should have pulled out something amazing in an incredibly lush environment but it couldn't even hold its head above water.Sci-Fi can be the trickiest one to get near perfect, and with time ""Elysium"" might prove to be one that stands a little longer than expected. The heart is there, the message is there, the layers and depth is there but may very well be over shadowed by our societal fad of ""been there done that"".And the true test of greatness when it comes to film is its longevity - that being said, if Neill Blomkamp can maybe throw some ideas around about different characters, build on other unassuming type figures, with a bit more of a grotty past, then we might very well have a Hero in the Sci-Fi department of Movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Irritating, for many reasons","Neil Blomkamp's debut cinema movie, District 9, was great and received much critical acclaim, as well as four Oscar nominations. This, his second movie, is not anywhere near as good.Not just bad, irritating, and for many reasons. What should be a harmless sci fi action -drama is turned into a political diatribe on the haves vs the have-nots and how evil wealthy people are. Also, there is appears to be some sort of pro-illegal alien agenda.Even if you ignore the political agendas, the movie is still pretty bad. Quite formulaic, implausible plot. Fairly predictable in the end.Then we have the casting. Matt Damon is totally miscast as a tattooed criminal. Yes, he is the hero, ultimately, a role he plays well, but the criminal side just didn't work. Similarly, Jodie Foster as he scheming executive also didn't feel right. Worse than that, her accent was incredibly irritating and unnatural, grating like nails on a blackboard.On the plus side, the South African mercenaries were good fun, and had some of the best lines. Always good to hear South African slang (this coming from an ex-South African).Hopefully Neil Blomkamp rediscovers his District 9 mojo in his third movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Somehow... they managed to find a supporting cast to put in even worse performances than either of the big stars. Disgusting.

What every Sci-Fi Action flick needs to be like!,"Elysium is an energetic science fiction action thriller featuring Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley. Neil Blomkamp certainly aims to please, especially fans of District 9, as both the movies share many similar elements.A crock-pot full action and violence, and spiced with a few humorous moments, we follow our hero as he struggles to live within the future L.A. slums that are packed to the brim with the poor and unfortunate. You can almost hear the monotone chant; ""bring out your dead"" over and over again. Meanwhile, up in the confines of space, the rich and fortunate live in utter bliss on the rotating space station, Elysium, free from the disarray of Earth life. The story rages on, heavy with themes of justice and equality for all, as our hero stumbles upon something that could change the course of history, and bring the two worlds back together again, and save those who really need it.Matt Damon's character is believable enough, with Jodie Foster coming in as a ruthless commander and politician of Elysium. Both do a good job, but the real winner here is Sharlto Copley, who emerges as a completely new type of character than that in District 9, one who is eccentric, dangerous, and malicious. Along with a fun array of new weapons, robots, and fun ways to be blown up, Sharlto Copley adds that special touch of uniqueness that elevates the level of fun.It would be unfair to also give praise to the special effects of the film, which looks marvelous on a big screen. The cinematography is well done, adding a few new filming methods, and improving on old techniques to help elevate the feel of the movie.One could question the racial undertones that define the living standards of each way of life, and one could also nit-pick the realism of this future world, and Wolverine-ish superpowers of Matt Damon. However, the movie does share a moral of what a beautiful planet Earth truly is, and gives us a good lesson in gratitude. While it panders to the action and sci-fi junkie, it also allows room for just about anybody to envelope its positive themes and appreciate the courage and strength of the characters. However, it's main purpose, is to entertain, and blow you away. And this movie does just that.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Middle of the Road,"Man., talk about immigration restrictions! In this film the wealthy society have left earth and moved into outer space to a spiraling community called Elysium. Healthcare back on earth is virtually non-existent, while on Elysium (as shown in the trailer) there is a magic healing machine that can fix any kind of ailment that you can think of. I thought during the film that if such a machine did exist, earth would explode with population growth. Maybe that will be the sequel (smile). I was also happy to see that they re-used earthly communities from District 9 (or something very similar). Why not save a buck when you can. Max (Matt Damon) finds himself in a very volatile situation and desperately needs to get to Elysium to rectify the situation. In order to get this done he has to make a ""last ditch"" deal with Spider (Wagner Moura) who is the local deviant. Max also bumps into his childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga) who somehow manages to get herself entangled in this whole mess. There is also an undercover hit man running around earth named Kruger (Sharlto Copley – reappearing from District 9) who works for the corrupt Delacourt (Jodie Foster). I have to pause here and just say that I couldn't understand one thing that Kruger was saying. Anyway, Delacourt is constantly breaking the rules and is tired of taking orders from the space court. She wants to do things her way. That being said, in comes John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who is a greedy business man looking to get as many government contracts as he can. The robot army in the film kind of reminded me of I, Robot (especially at the end of the film). I think that director Neill Blomkamp is definitely comfortable in this genre and I think he should continue to make Sci-fi films, however I think that this film lacked an emotional connection for me. I really never got vested in the main character although Frey's daughter did tug at the heart strings just a bit. On a positive note, I think that parts of the film were visually stunning. It never ceases to amaze me with what they can do with CGI. I found the film to be very predictable, but I am glad that it was not butt-blister long. There are a lot of films opening this weekend and I am not sure that I would put this one at the top of the list. I give this film an amber light.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In a nut shell it was a robin hood story in a sci-fi flick, but that aside the film was very well put together with a good action hero from main man Matt Damon but it was Sharlto Copley's bad guy that stole the whole show.

"Comrades, rise up!","Neill Blomkamp made a massive impression with his $30 Million debut District 9, a smartly written sci-fi film with great special effects that supplied both blockbuster thrills and social commentary. His follow-up film was also going to be a highly anticipated film, but also runs the risk of suffering second album syndrome.By the end of the 21st Century Earth is overpopulated and polluted. The rich and the elite leave Earth to live on Elysium, a huge space station that could be seen from Earth. By 2154 Earth is a poverty stricken, diseased world that has suffers from crime and health problems and an oppressive robotic police force whilst Elysium is a calm paradise where they have healing pods that can cure anything from broken bones to cancer. Many people on Earth try to break into Elysium despite it being pretty much a suicide mission.On Earth is Max De Costa (Matt Damon), a convicted criminal who tries to live a clean life and works as a factory worker, despite being targeted by the police. But after a work accident he gets a lethal dose of radiation and only has five days to live. Max's only hope is going to Elysium, but to do that he needs to steal the thoughts of a billionaire (William Fincher). What Max ends up with something that could change the world and makes him a target for Elysium's Defence Secretary, Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her personal covert agent, Kruger (Sharlto Copley).Some of the critical and audience reaction to Elysium has been mixed and lukewarm with people disappointed with Blomkamp's work. But Elysium is still an entertaining sci-fi film with substance. Blomkamp uses some simple story ideas, such as Max only having a few days to live, so has to go on one last mission and Max having a McGuffin that everyone wants. Blomkamp does this so he can fresh out his world and themes. Earth does look like a hole of despair of urban decay and crime and the planet does seem to not have advance very much.Elysium is very clear and open about its themes and ideas; this is a film that very critical of access to healthcare in America, particularly how the poor had inadequate healthcare compared to the rich and elite who can have anything they want. There are rampant poverty which the elite ignores, looks at gated communities, immigration, particularly of Latin Americans going to the United States and xenophobia of the elite and classism. Elysium's wears its leftist politics on the sleeve as we see the world split into the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as companies aim to maximum their profits regardless of the workers. There are also smaller themes but no less important like the how workers, particularly immigrant workers are expendable. The film is at its most subtle when robots are in bureaucratic positions like Max's speaking to his parole officer, complimented with Damon's sarcastic interaction. Elysium is very much a film about the lower classes taking back what is theirs which should appeal to revolutionary Marxists.Blomkamp is known for coming from a special effects background and like District 9 the CGI and models were excellent. Blomkamp is able to supply action and spectacle with his world building. Blomkamp does go for a little too much shaky-cam at times, yet the hand-held camera work did give Elysium a pseudo-documentary feel and adds a scene of authenticity to the film, making it look more real and add to Blomkamp's photo- realistic style.Like District 9 the action is strong and very well directed. Whilst shaky-cam is used Blomkamp also uses a lot of slow-mo to great effect. We get gun battles, fist and knife fights with men in exo-skeletons and District 9 style weapons leading to exploding bodies. Elysium is how I like my R-rated sci-fi action, very bloody and violence: we even get a man getting a grenade to the face.Some of the art direction was very similar to Looper, with old cars and guns being modified and people on Earth having to do in a rag tag world. There are also some elements of Total Recall, In Time and Escape from New York.Copley was fantastic as Kruger, a raging psychopath with menace and dark humour to his role. It was a shame that he wasn't the main villain as he injected energy into his role. He should be considered to play the next Bond villain. It is a shame that Foster as the main villain was lacklustre, being a politician with xenophobic views who had a cold persona and a strange accent. She should have been written out and Kruger been made as the main villain.Elysium does use a similar storyline and plot points to District 9, both the main characters end up being inflected with something that will kill or change them and both character end up having something that an organisation really want. As mention is very heavy handed with its political commentary and one be that was so transparent was Fincher's character, a billionaire tycoon who puts his workers to the limited and does not care what happens to them. It could have been handled better such as the billionaire trying to squeeze out very bit of profit they can and do things like ignoring safety regulations or concerns.On a final note composer Ryan Amon was clearly influenced by Hans Zimmer as his used a lot of horns, strings and choir music used during the film.Elysium is not as strong as District 9 but it is still a very worthy film that is entertaining and thematic. Even if you do not agree with the politics of Elysium it holds up as an R-rated sci-fi and more should be made.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

MY REVIEW: Elysium is Worth Visiting Once!!,"Elysium. Director of cult District 9, an interesting idea, big actors like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, great looking visuals and sci-fi gadgets, all these raise your expectations to sky high. Elysium fails to meet these high expectations because Jodie Foster is wasted completely and Matt Damon's character despite all his powers does not come across as big hero who saved your world. Technically, Elysium is class apart with very good use of new ideas on future weapons and machinery but when it comes to drama and thrills, movie somewhat lacks the sharpness needed for a serious science fiction. Sharlto Copley as menacing sleeper agent Kruger does well but his character is given a bad turn in last few reels. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Elysium. Despite its many flaws, it makes a good watch any day because of its spectacle of high standards.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You'll hate this if you live in Elysium,"This movie is literally one of the best movies I have ever watched. After Niell's District 9, I wasn't expecting much (really didn't like District 9).

In a society where inequality grows daily, it isn't very difficult for someone like me to connect the dots and see a future state where the elite are even more isolated from the masses they rely on exploiting for their wealth. We see the same trends in every country on Earth. If you haven't got an entitled disposition and have had to work for an honest wage, you'll really enjoy this film.

Another Big-Budget Faliure,"One of the most hyped movies of the summer, I personally was looking forward to this movie being a big fan of District 9, however we see first hand in Elysium how big studios can ruin great ideas.First of all, the world that they try to introduce to you is sloppy and full of plot holes, that I guess they just assume the viewers will ignore. This, combined with cliché after cliché just gets old really fast. ""The orphan who was meant for something more"", ""The man with only 5 days to live"" , ""The mother just trying to help her sick daughter"", for being an original story, very little was original at all.Matt Damon's performance was OK at best. The movie felt like it was trying to EPIC at every turn. Damon really wasn't given too many lines to add much depth to his character --- Think: classic hero.Foster's performance was by far the worst of the movie though. She plays a power hungry defense secretary. We get no back story with her, and her whole plot line seems rushed.As far as positive's go, the cinematography was decent (although not as good as District 9). They did push the boundaries with some interesting camera movements during fight scenes, even that felt like an afterthought though, instead of being a living part of the movie.

Visually Striking but Narratively Shallow,"""Elysium"" presents a fascinating vision of a dystopian future, blending gritty cyberpunk aesthetics with sharp social commentary. Neill Blomkamp delivers stunning visuals and intense action sequences, but the film struggles to balance its ambitious themes with a coherent and engaging narrative.Matt Damon gives a solid performance as the lead, bringing both physical intensity and emotional weight to his role. Sharlto Copley stands out as the unhinged and menacing Kruger, injecting energy into every scene he's in. Jodie Foster, however, feels underutilized, with a character that lacks depth despite her commanding screen presence.Visually, ""Elysium"" excels. The contrast between the overpopulated, decaying Earth and the pristine, utopian space station is striking, and the action is well-executed, with Blomkamp's signature blend of realism and sci-fi spectacle. The film's world-building is compelling, presenting a bleak but believable future driven by inequality and corporate greed.However, where ""Elysium"" falters is in its storytelling. The film introduces thought-provoking themes about class division, healthcare, and privilege but explores them in a shallow and overly simplistic way. The plot is predictable, and its heavy-handed approach to social commentary leaves little room for nuance. Character development also feels rushed, making it hard to connect with some of the key players.Despite its narrative shortcomings, ""Elysium"" remains an entertaining sci-fi action film with impressive visuals and strong performances. It may not fully realize its thought-provoking potential, but it's still worth a watch for fans of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Solid Sci-Fi Effort,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.5/5 starsIs it as good as ""District 9″? No. But it's still a gripping sci-fi effort from director Neill Blomkamp. Anyways, ""District 9″ was a masterpiece that's probably hard to replicate, and it's simply unfair to judge a Director's subsequent works to his best films. Comparison are inevitable and understandable, but a film should ultimately be judged on its own merits, and with that note, ""Elysium is a thoroughly enjoyable futuristic vision, that's only gets derailed at certain remotely sporadic junctures, due to a degree of over indulgence in plot contrivances.The film is still worth the price of an admission ticket, because of its scope, taut narration, and Jodie Foster's deviously sinister act (seriously, the lady can effortlessly just breeze through any role). Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley are as reliable as ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not perfect but interesting,"As a sci fi adventurer, I always love the high-tech, forward looking genre's that have good acting. My fav in this one is Jodie Foster. I thought she did her part quite well. Matt Damon always holds his own. The front end of the movie was lacking, but once it gets underway with Kruger making the chase, it gets better. I agree with another poster that the CGI was done well and that ceratinely helps. I did like the way they utilized a body frame to enable Max to get around. The fight with the bots after they shot down the aircraft was good.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elysium (2013),"Directed by Neill Blomkamp. Starring Matt Damon, Sharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Jodie Foster, Wagner Moura, Diego Luna, William Fichtner, Faran Tahir, Mike Mitchell, Emma Tremblay. (R)A futuristic haves-and-have-nots tale, with the rich living in Elysium, a palatial paradise orbiting Earth, and all the rest suffering on the grungy surface of the decrepit and overpopulated planet. After ex-con assembly worker Damon gets critically debilitated by a workplace accident, he resolves to do whatever it takes to hightail it to Elysium and use one of their ultra-sophisticated med-bays (able to miraculously cure anything--from fatal radiation poisoning to leukemia--in seconds). Director Blomkamp tries his hand at the same sort of sci-fi-with-a-social-agenda as he did with ""District 9"" with wildly mixed results. Art design and special effects are terrific (if familiar), Damon is a firm presence in the lead role, and its intentions are admirable. However, the class divide, labor exploitation, and immigration paranoia metaphors are slathered on with a trowel, and the over-the-top villainy belongs in a low-rent B-picture (Copley is downright cartoonish, while Foster gives a rare poor performance full of unnatural mannerisms).60/100",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Definitely a *must watch* in cinema!!,"The film was brilliant! Im not a huge sic-fi fan, but I loved this movie. Went to watch it on the opening night, screen was packed out which made it even more enjoyable especially the applause at the end! Jodie Fosters acting was excellent as usual, haven't seen her play a negative role before!! Matt Damon was also really good, especially loved the guy from District 9 he was so funny! Graphics and visually stunning special effect were amazing, the robots looked so real. Didn't get bored/check the time at all throughout the film which is always a good sign! This is one of the most entertaining action films of the year so far. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simplistic Allegory,"While a entertaining movie the movie is clearly a allegory for the for U.S. and Mexico. The people left on Earth spoke Spanish (even Matt Damon)and wanted to ""cross the border"" so they could get better health care and a better life in the rich and non-Spanish speaking Elysium world. Jodie Foster plays the politician wanting to keep the illegals out at all costs. Our politicians complain all the time about Mexicans coming to the U.S to get free health care and education for their children and of course want to keep them from that and even send them back to Mexico. Jodie Foster did this movie and played the one dimensional character because she wanted to send this message. The majority of the people that like this movie would not really consider giving free health care to immigrants or suddenly allow illegal immigrants to become citizens so they can have the benefits of U.S. It is an interesting movie in that the director pushes this theme very strongly and gives it to us in the form of an action movie. The movie falls apart at the end by giving us a fairy tale ending where some hospital ships come down to heal the millions or billions of people living on Earth. The allegory again is that the U.S. spends billions on war and billions on border patrols and not for sending hospital ships to countries that could use some free health care and education.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Sci Fi Action Blade Runnin Goodness,"This movie is sick. Mr. Matt Damon has fallen into perfect circumstances to take on a Hail Mary mission with %1 chance of survival. He must become the hero that men rarely can be, to save himself and his lower- class people left to die.Bad ass fight scenes and survival action in a very well done Blade Runner like future. Halo comes to life in these fight scenes. Everything was believable and cool. The type of story was somewhat realistic in that it had believable actions of the characters. The actual sci fi setting is kind of far fetched, just because humans are still half good even though they are half evil. Also, people benefit from a balanced world, more than if it was a cruel dictatorship, for example. So for a slight story aspect that I felt could have been healed through story writing, I cannot give this a perfect score. For example, maybe there could have been more explanation given as to why the classes had become so stratified. Perhaps resource diminishment would lead to the world going into a natural and abrupt depression, causing a necessary evil of about half the population, on average, over no more than 20 years. I'm just thinking out loud.It was too good for words. You need to see this if you like Sci Fi movies or Actions movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Damon gives it a good go, but the movie disappoints in many ways","I had several problems with this movie. The ending went on far too long, leaving a bad after-taste. I also hated how the politics of the current day were injected so blatantly into the movie - I don't go to a supposed science fiction movie to get lectured about political issues (illegals). I want escapism from a sci-fi movie above all.Damon is the only thing good in the entire film. He gives it a good college try, but he can't save this movie from failure. A very awkward story line about a childhood sweetheart runs throughout, and the love interest is cold as a fish, and there is no chemistry between Damon's character and her. None of the other characters make an impression.This movie felt really clunky and unsubtle and just awkward is the best way to put it. Recycled robots from other better sci-fi movies didn't help matters. The space station, Elysium, was kind of cool, but that is about it. 5 Stars only because Damon is always an engaging presence to watch, even in a lousy movie like this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Space movie...,"""Elysium"" is a movie that has to do with a mission that could bring equality to the polarized worlds and exactly between the earth where poor people live and Elysium where rich people live. The person who is responsible to accomplish this mission is Matt Damon and the bad in this story is Jodie Foster who plays as Defense Minister of Elysium.I liked this movie because of the plot and because of the good special effects. The things that I did not like I was disappointed were the interpretations of Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. I believe that both of them did not do the best that they could do.Finally I want to tell you that if you want to see a simple space movie with nice plot then see this movie, but if you want to see it because of the cast then do not see it, you will be let down.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
entertaining though unlikely plea for universal healthcare,"Neil Bloomkamp is clearly a director who believes sci-fi should convey ideas, not just throw around big special effects. He also, though, likes big special effects.With Elysium, the big idea is that rich people have created an idyllic world for themselves in outer space after trashing earth, leaving billions on earth to live in grinding poverty and work in their dangerous factories. There is a brisk trade in the equivalent of border running; Elysium is particularly alluring because it contains machines that will repair any illness. A fatal disease on earth is a quick fix on Elysium.The desire of earthers for health is mixed in with right winger xenophobe Jodie Foster's desire for power. The result is exploding space ships, battles with advanced weaponry, and android fights, all used both to entertain and to further the message.While entertaining, Elysium isn't especially convincing. The movie has a very black and white view of the dynamic between earth and Elysium, dividing the world a little too neatly into purely evil bad guys and noble folk. There is also a moment at the end that, while effective, doesn't really make sense if you think about it.Still, this is a movie with its heart in the right place, and performances are quite good, especially Sharlto Coopley as a disturbingly scary enforcer. I like the message, which in essence I believe in (i.e., the Koch brothers would totally do this if they could), and even if you don't like the message, there's lots of fun running around and explosions.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I can sum this POS movie up in one word! ""Amnesty!""","I for one can't stand it when ""Directors,"" I use the term loosely, feel they need a political platform to make a ""good"" movie.

They randomly break into Spanish and have magical beds that heal anything. Elysium = The United states. The world = Mexico and the Magical beds that heal anything from stage 20 cancer to a face destroyed by a grenade is Obamacare! This political dumbassery has to end! This film could have been a great film but they got to put a little bit of sh*t in the cake mix! I want the 2hrs of my life back and I walked out of the theater giving the screen the finger! The action was good but once again they hit the slow mode button to ""take advantage of the 3D"" mainly because they know the movie can't survive by it's own merit.

"A fine & worthy follow up to ""District 9""","The problem with Neill Blomkamp's last film was that it came from absolutely nowhere for paying people like me & floored us. Obviously. we all asked how was he going follow that act?The answer to that question is ""pretty damn well"". ""Elysium"" gives him bigger stars & a bigger set of toys to work with & probably gives his buddy, Sharlto Copley, a bigger paycheck.This is a constantly entertaining BIG sci-fi film filled great visuals, interesting characters & a very satisfying story with as much political subtlety as a Michael Moore film.So what if Jodie Foster is rather one-dimensional as a villainous ""suit"" (think ""Avatar's"" Quaritch wearing Armani)? She makes that one dimension very entertaining. Matt Damon may not be Bourne-terrific here but he is fine form nevertheless. His ""Max"" has a story we actually care about. The two standout performances here are Wagner Moura as the computer ace, Spider & Copley as the hit-man/machine/sociopath/mercenary, Kruger. Unlike the two idiot scientist who almost ruined ""Pacific Rim"" for me, Moura has fun with the role without ever making fun of the role. There is hardly any humor in this movie, but that doesn't make it a downer. Copley has a voice & a way of speaking that I'm sure seems very strange to anybody living in the western half of the U.S. As he showed in ""District 9"" & the terrific ""Europa Report""(his other ""E"" sci-fi movie this summer) he has a unique screen presence that always holds our attention. I don't know if this makes him a particularly good actor, but he is fun to watch. Kruger is written as a scary guy & Copley makes him one.Blomkamp keeps things moving at a fast pace that never seems rushed. There is only one fight scene that seems a bit like overkill (unlike just about all the fight scenes in ""Man Of Steel"" -which I otherwise loved). There is fairly bloody stuff going on throughout this movie. One scene nearly matches the infamous self-abortion in ""Prometheus"". The gore flashes in front of you quickly & never lingers. Just keep the kids home.This movie is probably not going to go over very well with people who keep their bank accounts on the Cayman Islands, but for the rest of us it is rollicking entertainment",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-fi in the Star Trek tradition,"Elysium is really science nonfiction; a movie about Earth as it exists today, with futuristic settings and fight scenes to make it fun. (This is not my theory; Neill Blomkamp is on record about this. I believe the quotation is something like, ""It's not the future, it's now."") The correspondence is pretty much one-to-one, with that clear global vision that a really fine South African filmmaker can bring to the party.Somebody in the FAQs calls Elysium ""leftwing propaganda"". I didn't actually click on that post, but my guess is this person is an American. (Possibly a Canadian or British spear-bearer.) For the record, all Blomkamp does here is press the haves and have-nots together on one screen; the scenarios are current fact (again, with allowance for sci-fi analogy). The alleged ""politics"" of the film are the kind of politics you get when it's raining outside and someone says, ""It's raining outside.""The performances are fabulous. Matt Damon is basically Will Hunting in a favela, Jodie Foster is icy as Dick Cheney in heels (and we get to hear her native-fluent French!), and Sharlto Copley is skin-crawlingly evil as the hatchet-man; somehow, the same Afrikaner accent that was so cute in District 9 is freakin' satanic here.So see it. It's got all the things you loved about that other Blomkamp film. Apparently, we need more South African movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not that bad,"When I first saw this movie I was stuck with the idea that I was not going to like it. I'm sorry but I don't like Matt Damon and there he was though, in a futuristic science fiction movie! So, yep, I began to watch the movie with low standards and no expectations... But then I was surprised by the simple but somehow efficient story, by the fact that Matt Damon was good in his role and by the amazing way the special effects were implanted in the real environment. I really really enjoyed the special effects which were worked at a perfectionist level. Not in a ""Prometheus way"" but in a realistic way. The special effects we ""don't see"" in a movie are for me the best. This movie is a pretty good example of what special effects should be... The story wasn't really surprising though but sufficient. As I said earlier I was only surprised by the fact that I gently entered into the scenario without finding it boring or totally uninteresting. It could have been better but I thought it could have been worst! Then, it was not that bad and in fact, a good surprise!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Matt Damon plays Matt Damon,"I'm going to cut out the B.S. and get right down to the reasons I hated this film. In no particular order: 1. Matt Damon plays himself like he does in every movie. Only difference this time is he's playing himself as if he's not feeling well.2. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the first 45 minutes.3. The space view of Elysium is the only interesting visual effect in the entire movie.4. The plot and plot twist make absolutely no sense.

Great,"I had been waiting for Blomkamp's new film since District 9, and I was not disappointed. Amazing FX throughout, the shots of the station are truly beautiful, and so is the rest of the photography. But one of the most entertaining things are the designs of machinery, vehicles, and such. (what could you expect, really, if Weta is involved, obviously, it's going to be great...) Sharlto Copley's acting is spot on for his character, bringing to life one of the most brutally likable villains I have seen in a long time. It's definitely a popcorn movie, do not watch expecting some life changing revelation, but if spending a couple of hours truly entertained is what you want, then this is surely a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just terrible,"This is without doubt the worst film I have seen this year. The worst Matt Damon film ever. What a terrible mish mash of ideas, none of which really gel together, more of a 109 min extended trailer of ideas ripped off from other movies. Looks very much like the director was under intense pressure to deliver something really good and just tried too hard. What on earth is going on with Jodie Fosters sound track? Nearly all of it looks post dubbed, she gives one of the truly awful performances I have seen for a long time. You could almost believe that this movie is a spoof, it is that bad.

"For some reason, I enjoy this movie","This film has all the hallmarks of a badly designed film. The plot is thin and the lead actor is not known for having a wide range of emotion in my book, but somehow they pulled it off. Max, after being exposed to a lethal dose of radiation on a planet devoid of resources, fights his way to the only place with the technology to heal him: the floating city of elite members of society, Elysium. The built in time lock of Max's impending death of radiation poisoning does create a sense of tension on top of the main struggles and conflicts. The visuals are very well designed, and the world design is clear: an earth in decay, and a world apart for the elite rich containing eery luxury the world below is forced to go without. Max is not relatable, per se, but he does behave distinctly morally, which ingratiate him with a protagonist focused audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"That difficult, but successful, second album","I'm gonna go off on a tangent for a bit, but trust me, I'm going somewhere with it. One of the most interesting things about music, to me, is the concept of the 'difficult first album'. When an artist or band releases a spectacular first album, all attention turns to what they'll do next. What happens next determines the longevity and the overall appeal of said musicians. Either they're exposed as one-hit wonders, or they prove that they can keep on being the great artists that they are.Elysium is Neil Blomkamp's difficult second album. For those of you living under a rock for the last few years, he was the creator of District 9, one of the best sci-fi/socio-political movies to hit the screen in a helluva long time. Bold, controversial, and highly entertaining, it breathed new life into science fiction.Fast-forward four years, and we have this new creation. Once again, it's a science fiction movie set in the future. Once again, it is a satire on the state of the modern world and (more importantly) the state of African politics. Once again, it's about one man's fight against something he should not be able to fight.Once again, Neil Blomkamp is on to a winner.The story quickly: Max (Matt Damon) lives on an Earth full of poverty and disease, while the privileged few live on another planet called Elysium, which is more or less Utopia. When he gets infected with a fatal virus, Max has no choice but to go on a mission to Elysium. The chances of success are near-impossible, but success could lead to total equality for the entire universe.Now, it has to be said, I don't think this is as good as District 9. There was something raw and unpolished about that movie which enhanced it. What makes Elysium so good, though, is the storyline. Just like its predecessor, it does a very smart job of mirroring the corruption and class divide we see in the world today, wrapping those concepts around a very taut and enjoyable thriller. Expectedly, Blomkamp once looks to the continent of Africa (his home) for inspiration, this time touching on the issues of poverty, disease and class alienation (no pun intended).Having a bigger budget also really helped Blomkamp this time round – he made good use of special effects in District 9, but he goes ten steps further in this film. Robots with crazy weapons, space shuttles, brilliant action scenes involving a lot of guns and quite a bit of fire – it is all very similar to the future of District 9, but amped up. Almost as if the world of those two films are the same.Interestingly enough, what hurts Elysium is probably what should have bettered it; that being the cast. Now, don't get me wrong, the cast is probably the main appeal of the film. Matt Damon in the lead role, Jodie Foster lurking around, it's not bad at all. But Damon never quite fits in the role, and I felt somebody else could have done a better job. Similarly, Jodie Foster's portrayal of the shady Elysium controller felt forced and unnatural. Funnily enough, the best performance comes from Sharlto Copley, who was the lead in District 9. He steals every scene he is in, which made me want him to be the leading man.As far as difficult second albums go, Elysium comes out as a success. It's probably not ideal to keep comparing it to District 9, but there are so many similarities between the two, it's hard not to. Elysium is a very strong, solidly-directed movie that reinforces Neil Blomkamp as one of the must-see directors going around. Worth going out of your way to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beef Wellington Special Effects with a Burnt Road Kill Story,"I thought that it would be impossible to make a sci-fi movie worse than Event Horizon, but was sadly mistaken. The movie works on the most far fetched premise, that somehow in the midst of gross overpopulation and environmental destruction, an immense orbiting habitat was created for the rich and famous, while the rest of the planet's population lived in abject poverty and sought ways to escape to this orbiting Elysium. How all the world's rich and powerful were able to pull off this feat, somehow intimidating billions while getting their incredible habitat created is left to one's imagination. There is hardly an original idea here, as regards the age old tensions between rich and poor, just a politically correct mish-mash to titillate viewers looking for cheap thrills. The writer/director of this farce, Neill Blomkamp, stated after its completion "" I feel like I f----d it up, I feel like ultimately the story is not the right story."" Well, at least he got that right. Oh, and did I forget to mention, the residents of Elysium are overwhelmingly white and the ""illegals"" trying to get in overwhelmingly Hispanic? The astronomical economic rise of China and India are conveniently left out of the equation, as is the preponderance of enormous gaps between economic classes in Latin America.

ELYSIUM was one of the years best sci-fi,"The movie is from the director of 'District 9' which sets in the year 2154 about the people of severely damaged earth and luxurious artificial habitat in the space. I could say this movie was not much distinct from Tom Cruise' recent science fiction. Both the movie deals about ruined earth and wealthier space station colony. More like it is a prequel to 'Oblivion' where robots are taking over from the human race. I enjoyed both, they were the finest science fiction of the year. 'Oblivion' was unique but 'Elysium' gives the same feeling to the movie 'District 9' where protagonist from both the movies get infected and suffers severely.Max (Matt Damon) is an orphan young man who is dreaming to escape the polluted earth and settle down in the luxurious place in the space called Elysium. He works in a factory where security robots are manufactured. One day something goes wrong with him while working, he begins to get sick. In order to get cured he must immediately visit the Elysium where poors from the earth are not allowed. He knows he can't enter legally so he must find an alternate way where he could reach his target.2013 was one of the best year in last the ten years for science fiction movie fans. I thoroughly enjoyed many movies along with my favourite of the year 'Gravity'. 'Elysium' is better than the average, I don't know why it was rated such low. But I could not get a few things like why should one install electronic chips and devices into his body to steal the classified data. I thought the pen drive or external HDD are more than enough.

Its been a long time since we can find a good sci-fi movie worth watching, and unfortunately the wait will go on.

Don't bother,"Matt Damon and Jodie Foster are tremendously talented. Neill Blomkamp matches their talent from the director's chair, and the special effects and action scenes are on par with any good sci-fi action thriller.What makes this film stink to the high heavens is the obvious political and social messages being sent. At least Star Trek was subtle about the political and social agendas being promoted. This film throws off the subtlety gloves and goes bare-knuckled to embrace the entire Occupy movement during which the film was produced.You have the one-percenters living in a dream world of comfort and luxury, with the rest of the louts living in crime, disease and poverty. Up comes an aggrieved protagonist and baby, it's ON!Oh, please.Now, if those were aliens up there on Elysium, enslaving the human race and exploiting them so ruthlessly, you have an interesting storyline for this film.Both Damon and Blomkamp deny that there is a political message in this story. I'm not buying their denials. It's too obvious and too plain for any but the most naive. Hollywood, except on the rarest of occasions, needs to keep its nose out of the political tent. Entertain me.

Another SciFi with poor story,The movie trailer was superb but when I actually watched the movie I got the idea how much time people actually spend in getting good CGI creating the artificial world and not focusing on actual script.The content was so dull and boring that half of the movie was just focusing on the built up of the story. This will actually create negative impression on the viewer. The structure of the story telling was not at all able to keep me engrossed.
