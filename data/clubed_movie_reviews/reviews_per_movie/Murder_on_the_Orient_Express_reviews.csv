"Fans of Poirot steer clear, for there is no Poirot here","This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. Branagh's portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Visually stunning, fairly decent film.","I must admit as an Agatha Christie obsessed fan, my initial thoughts were of pure joy, it's been a while since Agatha Christie was on the big screen, appealing to new fans, and how magnificent that such a stellar cast was assembled. Then I thought, of all the titles, why go for such an obvious choice, which has been done several times.Firstly, the film is undeniably beautiful, the costumes, sets, filming etc, the film will undoubtedly win an Oscar for the visuals. You can see big money was put into the look of the film.My major irritation throughout, was his moustache, just absurdly over the top, when Depp and Pfeiffer should have been dominating scenes, all I could look at was that moustache. That apart Branagh was excellent, I never thought he'd carry it off, but he did.I am intrigued as to whether this is a one off film, or if there'll be the odd appearance on the big screen. Only time will tell.All in all, it was good, I wanted and hoped to absolutely love it, unfortunately I didn't, but no way is it as bad as some say, too much quality for that.7/10 (hoped for a perfect 10!)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Average,"Agatha Christie needs a bit more mystery and depth in a film particularly when the story is so well known. Branaghs's Poirot is more eccentric than brilliant, in fact most of the characters are over played and a bit silly.In the end you don't really warm to anyone or want more, it's very predictable and flat.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Version Is A Train Wreck,"If you have any affection for Sidney Lumet's 1974's stellar version of ""Murder On the Orient Express"", do not bother watching this new version, you will be very disappointed. Even the poster reflects an uninteresting tone, the font used is modern and lacks any sense of style.Kenneth Branagh is a great director and actor that has given us some memorable films, unfortunately ""Murder On the Orient Express"" isn't one of them.At last night's screening of ""Murder On the Orient Express"" I had to use the restroom after about 40 minutes. As I reentered the theater the person entering with me asked me ""Do you think this movie will ever get started?"" I said ""I don't know; I guess we'll have to see."" It caught fire way to late, in about the last 20 minutes.Indeed, the movie had a painfully slow start, with a completely overproduced prologue that seemed quite unnecessary. The introduction of the characters is messy and it becomes rather confusing as to who they are. The cast is full of great actors, but so few are able to ""shine"" in this production.Kenneth Branagh is an interesting Hercule Poirot, he seems to be trying way too hard, and for me somehow he never ""owned it."" The extremely grotesque mustache seemed to get in the wayMichelle Pfeiffer, as Mrs. Hubbard is lackluster and quite flat, until the last 20 minutes where she does get a chance to shine, but by then it's too late, but it's not her fault.Derek Jacobi, one of our greatest actors is so misdirected in this version that he delivers an insipid performance. Penelope Cruz walks through a part that gained Ingrid Bergman an Oscar in the original, again not their fault.Interestingly enough, it is Johnny Depp who gives the best performance. He embodies his character with the right amount of vile corruptness, and sleaziness that brings life to the screen. He also has the most interesting costumes in the movie.Judi Dench is elegant and funny but her companion played by Olivia Coleman, who usually turns in stellar performances is totally uninteresting here, again not her fault.The production is indeed rich and elegant in its production design, and cinematography. The costumes however are fine, but lack a certain panache and glamour we have grown to admire in past Agatha Christie films, such as those designed by Tony Walton, and Anthony Powell. Alexandra Byrne is an extraordinary designer, but somehow it feels like the concept was to be subtle and ""real"". She needed to be bold and adventurous like her work on the ""Elizabeth"" films with Cate Blanchette.The musical score vacillates from very generic, to frantic and never finds the right tone, never providing a sense of mystery and suspense. Only when true vintage songs are incorporated does the atmosphere come alive.Kenneth Branagh is such a gifted filmmaker, it is sad to see this film fall short. He is in almost every frame, perhaps he would have crafted a better film if he was not in it. As the conductor of this train, he did not provide an elegant journey with wit and great character development for one of Agatha Christie's finest stories.",,Anonymous,Mystery
You'll never guess who dunnit,"There's a big problem with Kenneth Branagh's 2017 filming of the Hercule Poirot-based murder mystery. and that's the 1974 Sidney Lumet classic featuring Albert Finney in the starring role. For that film was so memorable – at least, the ""who"" of the ""whodunnit"" (no spoilers here) was so memorable – that any remake is likely to be tarnished by that knowledge. If you go into this film blissfully unaware of the plot, you are a lucky man/woman. For this is a classic Agatha Christie yarn.The irascible, borderline OCD, but undeniably great Belgian detective, Poirot, is dragged around the world by grateful police forces to help solve unsolvable crimes. After solving a case in Jerusalem, Poirot is called back to the UK with his mode of transport being the famous Orient Express. Trapped in the mountains by an avalanche, a murder is committed and with multiple suspects and a plethora of clues it is up to Poirot to solve the case.Branagh enjoys himself enormously as Poirot, sporting the most distractingly magnificent facial hair since Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Gangs of New York"". The moustache must have had its own trailer and make-up team!Above all, the film is glorious to look at, featuring a rich and exotic colour palette that is reminiscent of the early colour films of the 40's. Cinematography was by Haris Zambarloukos (""Mamma Mia"" and who also collaborated with Branagh on ""Thor) with lots of innovative ""ceiling down"" shots and artful point-of-view takes that might be annoying to some but which I consider as deserving of Oscar/BAFTA nominations.The pictures are accompanied by a lush score by Patrick Doyle (who also scored Branagh's ""Thor""). Hats off also to the special effects crew, who made the alpine bridge scenes look decidedly more alpine than where they were actually filmed (on a specially made bridge in the Surrey Hills!).All these technical elements combine to make the film's early stages look and feel truly epic.And the cast what a cast! Dame Judi Dench (""Victoria and Abdul""); Olivia Coleman (""The Lobster""); Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""); Daisy Ridley (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""); Penélope Cruz (""Zoolander 2""); Josh Gad (Olaf!); Derek Jacobi (""I, Claudius""); Willem Dafoe (""The Great Wall"") and Michelle Pfeiffer (""mother!""). A real case again of an ""oh, it's you"" film again at the cinema – when's the last time we saw that?It's also great to see young Lucy Boynton, so magnificent in last year's excellent ""Sing Street"", getting an A-list role as the twitchy and disturbed countess.With all these ingredients in the pot, it should be great, right? Unfortunately, in my view, no, not quite. The film's opening momentum is really not maintained by the screenplay by Michael Green (""Blade Runner 2049""; ""Logan""). At heart, it's a fairly static and ""stagey"" piece at best, set as it is on the rather claustrophobic train (just three carriages on the Orient Express really?). But the tale is made even more static by the train's derailment in the snow. Branagh and Green try to sex up the action where they can, but there are lengthy passages of fairly repetitive dialogue. One encounter in particular between Branagh and Depp seems to last interminably: you wonder if the problem was that the director wasn't always looking on to yell ""Cut""!All this leads to the ""revelation"" of the murderer as being a bit of an anticlimactic ""thank heavens for that"" rather than the gasping denouement it should have been. (Perhaps this would be different if you didn't know the twist).However, these reservations aside, it's an enjoyable night out at the flicks, although a bit of a disappointment from the level of expectation I had for it. I can't be too grumpy about it, given it's a return to good old-fashioned yarn-spinning at the cinema, with great visuals and an epic cast. And that has to be good news.For sure, Branagh does make for an amusing and engaging Poirot, even if his dialogue did need some 'tuning in' to. There was a suggestion at the end of the film that we might be seeing his return in ""Death on the Nile"" – the most lush and decorous of Peter Ustinov's outings – which I would certainly welcome. He will have to find another 10 A- list stars though to decorate the boat, which will be a challenge for casting!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Little Engine That Couldn't,"I have to agree with several others who have commented on this film. It lacks any sort of spark. Each actor plays to the camera and there is little interaction among them. Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh's Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too different from the book,"At first when I saw the trailer, I was so excited and thought ""Finally, a remake of Agatha Christie's masterpiece!"". But after I watched the movie that night, I can't hide I was so disappointed.The movie is so different from the book! And many of the scenes are exaggerated, and some important parts from the books are not included in the movie. Some characters lost or exchanged names. No ""dr. Constantine"", Greta Ohlsson changed into Pilar Estravados, Antonio replaced by some Italian name I can't remember. Some of the characters' personality are also too much for me. Count Andreyi is a... count. It's impossible he is so temperamental in the movie (while in the book Count Andreyi are more respected and well-behaved).Disappointing, for a Christie's adaptation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
beautiful but lacking,"After solving a case at the Wailing Wall, famed detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) takes a boat to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express with various characters. While crossing the Alps, the train is stuck in the snow and a murder occurs. Poirot must find the culprit and its connection to a famous child kidnap-murder case.Branagh uses his skills to create beautiful stages on which his actors can perform. The only problem is that the characters are little more than facades. They are surfaces without interiors. While it's impressively beautiful, there isn't any blood pumping through this story. It begins with Branagh and his crazy mustache. It's an artifice in place of real character work. It also draws attention away from any real work. There is an artificiality with the whole world although it is a beautiful art world. I do wonder if this is the best way to update the adaptation of this classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Difficult to Review,"Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies, and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressive sets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive case features Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.I, on the other hand, was massively disappointed, especially by Branagh as a sort of English upper-class colonel with a stick-on cavalry moustache and by the needless addition of an introductory scene at the Wailing Wall. But I am prejudiced. I read the 1934 novel decades ago and again more recently. I liked the 1974 star-studded version with Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and Michael York—despite the fact that Albert Finney was a very poor version of Christie's Hercule Poirot.In my opinion, the 2010 television version of the story starred David Suchet as the definitive Poirot, and the ending was far and away the best of all the versions with which I am familiar. So I think Christie fans may want to skip this edition of the classic.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nice Change Of Pace And A Solid Throwback,"When was the last time Hollywood gave us a true old school style ""whodunit"" type of film? (Don't strain your brain here. You can take it as rhetorical.) These types of stories, where a detective is presented with a crime scene and figures it all out with just their intellect and powers of observation have always been a big part of my life. Trying to figure out the culprit before its eventual reveal was always challenging to me, and putting these stories on the big screen have kind of faded into the background. So, what do you do when you want to bring them back? Call Kenneth Branagh.In his latest film, he brings to life one of the most famous detective novels in Agatha Christie's ""Murder on the Orient Express"". He plays the famous (and infamous, depending on who you are) Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who is taking a bit of a vacation on his way to his next case on the famous Orient Express. Unfortunately, fate has its own plans for him as a murder most foul (I have always wanted to use that phrase in a review) happens during a snowstorm that derails the train. No one is seen by Poirot as innocent as he questions the passengers, follows the clues, and races against time to solve the case before the local authorities arrive and could accuse the wrong person of the murder.OK, so let me run down the cast for you: Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr., Tom Bateman, Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Coleman, Willem Defoe, and Dame Judi Dench. And yes, they are ALL in this thing, as well as Branagh, who also directed. Given all of that paired with the fact that this runs less than two hours, and I was intrigued on multiple levels. And trust me here: this film does not disappoint. Sure, there are some liberties taken from the source material, but none of them are so far out of the norm that will drive the fans of any previous iterations of this story. Branagh is truly enjoyable as the character who is a genius but has his own issues that actually enhance his powers of observation, and his direction is top-notch here. This is gorgeously shot, including a few shots where there is a nod to the old ways of effects, giving a tighter and more nostalgic feel to the modern telling of this tale.The performances here are exactly what I expected from a cast of this caliber. With a story that has been around as long as ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has been (the book was written in 1934), there is a bit of a minefield when it comes to bringing it to life that could easily fall down the slope into parody or cariacature, but diverse screenwriter Michael Green, whose resume covers everything from ""Green Lantern"" to ""Everwood"" and even ""Logan,"" is able to write dialogue that lets the actors really get into the skins of these characters to treat them with the proper respect and dignity. Yes, there ARE a few liberties taken with the characters themselves, but there was nothing done that gave me even a little bit of growling. Each character has its own arc and motivations that work into the larger picture in a way that is engaging with no wasted space at all.There will be people that will find this film to be a bit outlandish, but I feel that those people are those that have not taken the time to really study the genre. Not every film has to dumb itself down to cater to the lowest common denominator, and I really enjoy it when a film tells me to engage my suspension of disbelief and simply entertain me. For great escapism and a reminder of a simpler time, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" achieves this goal for an audience that can truly appreciate its greatness.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Murder on the Orient Express,"Poirot joins the Orient Express which is full of important people / celebrities and one of them is murdered. When the train gets derailed by a avalanche Poirot agrees to investigate while they are being rescued.A huge number of viewers will either have read or have seen one of the many versions of this famous Christie thriller, particularly the seventies version starring Albert Finney, so the trick was for Branagh to do something a bit different without straying from the story. He does this quite well - after a short, separate story to start to demonstrate his genius and mood he arrives on the train. Everything is more spectacular and looks more beautiful than the seventies version and Branagh provides a more extrovert, fitter Poirot who even gets a bit of action. Branagh has pulled together an amazing cast and as an ensemble piece there are few chances for particular actors to really shine which is as it should be, but Pfeiffer and Depp have some strong scenes. Good fun - Death on the Nile to follow in 2022.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An unnecessary murder,"'Murder on the Orient Express' is perhaps Agatha Christie's best-loved story, a perfectly-conceived locked-room mystery, with a typically preposterous resolution. Kenneth Branagh, who also directs, is the latest in a long line of actors to take on the role of detective Hercule Poirot, and never has Poirot been more magnificently moustached. Poirot is, of course, more a collection of personal mannerisms than a truly rounded character, but Branagh does a reasonable job of bringing him to at least half-a-life (although I still prefer the more forceful interpretation of Ustinov). However, the film lacks a certain tension: a potential murderer is believed to be one of 12 people trapped on a snowbound train, but a consonant sense of claustrophobic menace is lacking. One problem with a locked-room mystery, of course, is precisely that the plot, following the murder, has literally nowhere to go. The result is a moderately diverting film but one that adds little to the previous interpretations of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Some people seem to hate remakes even if they're good,"I really enjoyed this movie even though I adore the original. I went in with mixed feelings and the fear that this would be a typical horrible Hollywood remake, well it wasn't. Especially with a star cast like this it would have been easy to just let the writing and directing slide by so my fear was not that irrational. Branagh absolutely shone in his role as Poirot just like the rest of the cast did in their roles. Sure they added to the background stories of the characters but why shouldn't they? And are people seriously complaining that they added a black doctor? Seriously people. I was afraid they would americanize it but they didn't. This movie is not worse than the original. It is not without the Christie Charme. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I enjoyed it immensely and will absolutely watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A nice surprise,"I was a bit skeptical about this movie, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

His Poirot convinced me and the old glories like Judy Dench, Willelm Defoe and Johnny Depp do their job and do it well, but in my opinion the most interesting notes come from the young people: I personally loved Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, but the real surprise was Sergei Polunin: I mean, for those who saw him performing as dancer, it's not a real surprise, but it's really hard to believe it was his first time in a movie! He has given to his character this melancholy, turbulent and passionate aura, halfway between a Shakespearean prince and James Dean. His expressions, his little gestures, the way he looked at his wife, he made me feel like a teenager who cannot wait to buy his poster and stick it over her bed! And let me say, that guy definitely knows how to ""handle"" a woman as well as he can deliver a kick! As usual, more the critics hate a film, more it worth to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How Agatha Christie was brutally ruined,"This movie is actually a piece of art. It takes a really true artist to ruin Agatha Christie at her best and a Dench-lead cast and come up with a boring Branagh soliloquy. What he has made out of Poirot, it's just unbelievable. I don't remember him being described as a walrus in any of the books where he also has converstations with all involved so that readers/audience can participate somehow. In this movie it's just Branagh, he knows it all, he sees it all and he understands it all. Out of thin air. Such wonderful actors were gathered for this monstrosity and it felt as is they were there only a set for Branagh. And oh yes, when talking about scenery - which ignorant fool came up with alps between Vinkovci and Brod??????? The thing is, there is nothing going on in this film, no suspension building up, no substance. It is just a pale vessel for Kenneth Branagh to try shining. 
Watch 1974 Lumet version. And from what i hear, it's going to be a sequel, Death on the Nile. Watch 1978 John Guillermin version. Branagh should.

It's pretty entertaining during its second act but the odd opening and contrived finale let it down.,"The second act stuff on the train is actually rather well done for the most part, with the dialogue-driven detective legwork of 'Murder On The Orient Express (2017)' being fairly interesting, if a little convenient. Unfortunately, the surrounding material is relatively contrived and oddly clichéd, with Poirot occasionally coming across more like Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes - complete with almost clairvoyant levels of 'deduction', especially in his few extremely out-of-place action sequences - than a portly and particular Belgian. The ending is especially disappointing, though this is perhaps a fault with the source story more than the flick itself. It leaves things seeming rather empty after its ham-fisted attempt at both haphazardly starting and completing an arc for its perfectionist protagonist. Still, it doesn't quite sour the film's finer moments - which shine through the muddy mess that this finale transforms the narrative into - and doesn't quite ruin what is mostly an intriguing and entertaining journey. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable watch,"I'll start by saying I've never read the book, or seen the original film and that seems to be a key similarity to those who enjoyed the movie. I went in to it knowing nothing about it, and it did keep me wondering throughout. So it's an easy 6 stars for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great mystery and a really fun film!,"Murder on the Orient Express is a really fun experience. It has everything you want from a crime mystery - a tremendous collection of characters, great location, thrills, humour, and a roaring third act.What impressed me most about this film was the staging of it. The set was sublime and felt so rich and detailed. The costumes, hair, make up etc were perfect (with the exception of Poirot's moustache... a bit too much maybe?!), and the score complimented the film to a tee. On top of all this there was some top notch cinematography. Nothing to fault from this perspective.Now the cast. It was a who's who of big established stars and up and coming names in Hollywood, and I loved them all. Despite the sometimes dodgy accents (I'm looking at you Judy), I just can't resist a talented ensemble cast like this. It took me a little while to get on board with Branagh's portrayal of Poirot, but after about 20 minutes I was all aboard! Great cast, each playing their character to perfection.Now comes the criticism, and this isn't really a reflection on the film, but more on the source material. What I often find with Agatha Christie stories is that I'm always impatient to get to the end. You know there is going to be a satisfying reveal, and also that they are pretty hard to guess as the rug is usually pulled from under you and there are numerous red herrings. As such, the middle act sometimes felt like we were going through the motions, and the pacing of the film can sometimes feel a tad slow.I'm being picky though, because I was blindsided by the final reveal and thought that they played it out to perfection, with maximum impact. An incredible scene!If you like Agatha Christie, mysteries, thrillers, crime etc, then you'll have a great time with Murder on the Orient Express.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Doesn't completely derail, but doesn't have enough steam","'Murder on the Orient Express' as a book is, speaking as a big Agatha Christie fan, one of her best with a compelling and twisty story, many characters that are also nicely developed and one of her most ingenious endings (along with 'And Then There Were None', 'Death on the Nile', 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and 'Witness for the Prosecution').Of the four filmed adaptations of 'Murder on the Orient Express' the only outstanding one is the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, which is one of the best cinematic Agatha Christie adaptations to me. The others are the David Suchet version, which is often considered one of the worst of the series but from personal opinion while very flawed it's better than given credit for, and the 2001 Alfred Molina version which is a mess. This latest version has a good deal going for it but feels like an adaptation too far. Actually saw it a couple of days ago, but was not sure what my thoughts on it were.Let's start with 'Murder on the Orient Express's' good things. It is a very beautiful film visually, very elegantly shot, lots of stunning scenery, sumptuous costumes that are evocative of the period and a train that has the grandeur and claustrophobic confinement that is necessary. The make-up is also wonderfully elaborate. The story does have some intriguing moments and it is a very clever one in the first place. Poirot is an interesting as he should be. Kenneth Branagh does a very nice job with the visual style, the script is thought-provoking and Poirot's crime-solving is delightful. The relative faithfulness to the source material is commendable too.He also stars as Poirot and generally is surprisingly good, he is very commanding, suitably steely and captures his crime-solving skills beautifully. He could however have brought out more of Poirot's lighter and more eccentric side, like the obsessiveness, there isn't enough of that here. The cast is star studded and generally the acting is very good. Standouts include Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, a surprisingly well-cast and suitably conflicted Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, Derek Jacobi and Willem Dafoe also make much of not very much.Conversely, there are other elements that don't work. The mystery itself is intriguing as a story but doesn't have enough tension or energy. With so many characters and so much focus on Poirot, the exploration of the supporting characters is limited, meaning many of the characters are really sketchy in development. Branagh excels in the visual side of the direction but it comes at the expense at providing enough depth to the mystery.The film has a slow and awkwardly staged beginning and the ingenious denouement feels under-cooked and contrived for an ending so justifiably famous and brilliant. Just to make it clear, the problem is not the denouement itself, it's the execution of it that's the problem. While the cast are on very good form mostly, an exception is Johnny Depp. Really didn't get the sense that Rachett was a nasty piece of work, like in the book and especially Toby Jones' interpretation in the Suchet adaptation when talking of the previous versions, and that the performance was too much of a pale caricature of Depp's lesser roles. Have really liked a lot of what Patrick Doyle has done, but this is not one of his better music scores. It's not awful, but it is blandly uninspired and its slightly syrupy feel doesn't fit. Oh, and Branagh's moustache is like a character of its own and am really not sure as to whether that is a compliment or not.In summary, some good things that stops it from completely derailing but the lack of steam makes it a bland endeavour, this wonderful story and Christie deserve better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kenneth Branagh Delivers a Skillful and Slick Update That Still Has Enough Emotional Punch,"As much as the Murder on the Orient Express book is appreciated as a classic, I came into this movie without knowing the story. I want to start by talking about Hercule Poirot as a character. This movie really portrays Poirot in a Sherlock Holmes ""esque"" light. There's a point where Hercule takes someone out with a cane that felt like he was channelling Robert Downey Jr. in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I don't mean this as a criticism though, the fact that Hercule is witty and funny along with being brilliant is much needed levity for this movie. Some people have complained that the movie is too comedic but without those opportunities to laugh, the beginning of this movie would be unbearably slow. Those moments are like the spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. So, I liked Poirot and you needed a charismatic character at the centre because the other characters don't get developed much until the murder goes down. This movie looks like an ensemble, but it leans more heavily on Branagh as the main character than you would think.The plot of Murder on the Orient Express is iconic, but the way movie portrays it, there's almost little to none. We get the initial setup of everyone boarding the train and other than some preliminary chitchat between Poirot and the other travellers and a tense exchange between Ratchett (Johnny Depp's character) and Poirot, very little happens. Only after the murder happens and the interrogations begin do we get to know everyone and does the plot kick into gear. Just like any great detective thriller, we don't know what's going on and we must unravel the mystery just as Poirot does. When we get to see more about the victim's past and what how appalling his/her actions were does the emotion kick and the stakes are raised considerably.I want to go through the cast name by name and give them all credit but there's just too many names. Branagh is a little over-the-top as Poirot but I would argue that the movie needed that. Its a very theatrical performance (considering his background, it makes sense) but without him chewing the scenery, the movie would have dragged. Michelle Pfeiffer sold out in her role as Caroline, it was nice to see her again. Daisy Ridley shines as Mary Debenham, I hope she keeps picking up more work. Leslie Odom Jr. had a lot screen presence as Dr. Arbuthnot. I appreciated the fact that Johnny Depp pulled back a little as Ratchett but he still borders overacting. If there was anyone I didn't like; Judi Dench was so stiff she was annoying but that was also how the character was written. I normally like Josh Gad but with the screen time divided between so many actors and actresses, he was kneecapped by a lack of room to show his stuff.When you can't bank on the character development or the plot, you need top notch window dressing to help move things along. Luckily the Orient Express is up to the task. The visual effects, the costuming and the exotic atmosphere transport you to another world. I've seen it done more impressively but they really do a stellar job since the movie had a relatively modest budget ($55 million). We get to go to Istanbul, Jerusalem and travel in snowy vistas. We also get to see past events through an old-timey projector and the characters watch it like a movie. Branagh is wise to linger on this stuff and it adds to the escapism that the story can provide. When you go to a period piece movie, you want to be wowed and dropped off in this new world and I think Murder on the Orient Express accomplished that.I came out of this movie wanting to go read the book, so I don't want to be too critical. But the biggest downfall of this movie is that much like the train the characters are travelling on, the movie takes a while to start picking up steam. The opening with Poirot is fun but after that first 15 minutes, the movie slows to a crawl. It relies on Branagh and the beautiful vistas to carry it and while I remained interested, I think a lot of people will be mentally checking out. But the movie does get going and I think if you're willing to be patient, you'll get what you want in the reveal.Talking about that reveal though, I thought it was fantastic. I want to credit Agatha Christie for originally conceiving it but I also want to credit Branagh and the writers for doing a solid job of yanking the rug out from under you. Its an excellent wrap-up and I was emotionally impacted by it. It was unpredictable, fresh and through the efforts of the excellent cast and the shocking nature of the crimes, it raised the rating I was going to give the movie by at least a half a point.I was excited to see this movie and although it wasn't amazing, I wasn't disappointed by it either. This is an adult movie though; the trailer makes it look there's going to be more action and there isn't. If there weren't funny jokes sprinkled in, the movie would be too dry and other than the fans of the book, the rest of the audience would be bored to tears. I went in a group of 3, 2 of us liked it and the 3rd said it was boring and disappointing. If you like mysteries or period piece movies, this will be up your alley. I left wanting to read this book and they hint at a possible sequel that I would also be interested in seeing. If you're a relatively patient moviegoer that appreciates lavish set dressing, good acting and a unique twist, I'd recommend checking this out.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Entertaining and intriguing right to the end!,"I saw this without any foreknowledge of the story despite its history. As a Brannagh admirer I also expected a lot. As such it was a great performance by a great cast. Those who didnâ(TM)t like it perplex me. This is not a modern crime story with action or violence or explosions to distract us. Like Sherlock Homes, Poirot is detective who use his mind and observation skills rather than physical action and violence to solve his case. The filming is perfect, the pace slow and steady, the denouement handled with precision. If you go into this expecting a James Bond type movie ( which I really like precisely because it they are full of action and spectacle but not too much intellectual input !), you will be disappointed. But if you expect to have your mind intrigued and you like to solve crime, then you will not be disappointed. I suspect it will be more enjoyable if you have no idea as to the true plot line, so if you have read the story in the past, it would help if you do not re-read it and you have forgotten some of the details.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Better Than I Thought It Would Be,"I was pleasantly surprised by Kenneth Branagh's performance. When he first appeared on screen, I thought that he would quickly become tedious and annoying. However, as time went on, I found myself really getting into his character. Branagh plays him with such ridiculous eccentricity that he actually became rather charming and relatable. Now, it's not an Oscar worthy performance by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think it does say something about his ability as an actor to take these idiosyncrasies that normally would have annoyed me and in turn make them charming, as well as fulfilling his other duties as the director. The film is also very well shot. I was surprised by how much I was getting into the cinematography. Branagh works with long-time collaborator Haris Zambarloukos in order to make perfect use of the cramped quarters of the train. Whether its panning shots outside of the train looking in, or overhead shots looking down on the actors, Zambarloukos makes very distinct and interesting choices that allow for Murder on the Orient Express to come to life in a rather unique way, one that I wasn't expecting from the looks of the trailers.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Modern Day Clue,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017) is a crime drama directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot, the best detective in the world, as he attempts to solve a murder he was unknowingly thrust into on the Orient Express. Detective Poirot is a last-minute addition to the train as he has been summoned to another case when Edward Ratchett, played by Johnny Depp, is murdered. The film is set in the 1930s and the script is superb for the era coupled with wonderful acting from an all-star cast. Though this film didn't invoke any feelings for me, I was highly entertained and thoroughly intrigued. The film reminded me of the board game Clue, which I loved as a child.The surprise ending offered by the director, Kenneth Branagh, was well concealed through the film. He effectively keeps the viewer on the verge of figuring it out only to pull the rug out from under you. The production value of this film is immaculate. It is difficult to spot anything in this film that doesn't belong in the 1930s and everything looks authentic. However, with a budget of an estimated 55M, it would be hard pressed to not appear as real as possible. With a gross of over 100M, the film was well able to make its investment back, but it comes as a surprise it hasn't made more. This is a great film that can offer a certain level of nostalgia for lovers of the game Clue.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty good remake of an Agatha Christie classic,"This is an updated version of the 1970s film version of the Agatha Christie novel. Most people recognize the name Agatha Christie, famous novelist. Christie wrote mystery novels, very good at that. Her body of work consists of things like murder on the orient express, and then there were none (also made into a film), the ABC murders.... plus more. I saw the 1970s film when I was probably too young to see it, but remember it being intriguing and having a very unexpected ending. I will say that for this remake, both of those things still hold true. There are intriguing parts of this movie, and it has an unexpected ending that I really liked and I thought was cleverly done. OK so let's talk about the plot and how it was executed. The plot isn't all too original at first glance. There are a number of passengers on a train, none that having any relation to one another, among them is one of the most famous detectives in existence... and one night the train suddenly stops. They check one of the passengers rooms and discover he's been murdered, stabbed. Immediately, this detective goes to work at trying to discover just who might've had an alibi, but what he discovers really thickens the plot. I won't say what he discovers, just that it makes the film much more interesting and really makes your ears perk up. The acting was well done mostly. I loved Michelle Pfeiffer in her role, Penelope Cruz was good in hers, Johnny Depp fit his well, Judi Dench was impressive as always, and Kenneth Branagh was just perfect for the starring role as Hercule Poirot. The dialogue was good for the most part, there were a few parts where things got a bit dull, and my attention did wander a couple times. That is really the only reason the rating isn't higher than it is. All in all though, it is a pretty good film that will entertain most people who are fans of this kind of movie. 7/10 for Murder on the Orient Express.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
My favourite version.,"After my disappointment with David Suchet's version, I went to see this with a little trepidation. However, I was bowled away with this. The cinematography is breathtaking, Johnny Depp's excellently portrayed Ratchett is truly a horrible man, and the rest of the cast are just as superb. I particularly liked Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman as Princess Dragomiroff and her maid Hildegard Schmidt. For me, the key elements of the plot were all true to the novel and while a lot of changes had been made I felt they'd enhanced the film. I actually got quite emotional at the point where the full story is revealed and we discover what really happened. And while David Suchet's 'tache might be closer to Ms Christie's description, anyone who's ever seen Belgian entrants to moustache competitions will realise Kenneth Branagh's 'tache is very Belgian. This is now my favourite version of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as bad as they say,"Let me just say this is the first version of Murder on the Orient Express I ever saw. I haven't read the book either, but was really curious to see this movie. I saw it in cinema a couple of hours ago and when I came online here, I had to write a review of my own because I only saw negative ones and wondered why. I loved it. It's a movie I'd go and see multiple times. Yes, it can be a bit slow some times, but I think it matches the theme. (Of course, the Imagine Dragons music in the trailer and the hideous modern, blue fonts were a mistake I find odd. True style breaker.) The costumes and set is just lovely, I was blown away by the creative aspects of the camera. There's one shot that's 'hanging on the ceiling' and you look down at two heads. I thought that was brilliant, in that setting at that specific time in the story. Furthermore I thought all performances were good and it wasn't a Branagh one-man show, it was the full cast that got me. I believed their characters and didn't expect the ending of this film.

A Thoughtless Remake,"Sidney Lumet directed this Agatha Christie classic back in 1974. Albert Finney played Poirot and he was delicious and got an Oscar nomination for it. The rest of the cast was a cohesive group of heavyweights from Ingrid Bergman to Vanessa Redgrave, from Sean Connery to John Gielgud it also had a period reconstruction in scrumptious detail, wit, elegance and an infectious score. None of it is present in this new incarnation. None of it. No, the new version reeks of thoughtlessness and CGI.

Better than expected! Quite a stunner.,"I haven't seen the 1974 version so this movie easily stands out in all aspects to me, whether it was the camera view or the cast ensemble. While reviewing, people often forget the issue with the original story i.e. it's set entirely in the train. Considering the limited space that they had, Branagh does an amazing job with the direction. This isn't just a remake but in fact an entirely different adaptation. Not that it runs away from the main story but it has a sort of different take on it. Apart from that, Branagh easily manages to portray Poirot with all his eccentricity. (The accent was the pull factor for me). Josh Gad does an amazing job with Hector McQueen. Judi Dench shines as Princess Dragomiroff along with Pfeiffer as Mrs. Hubbard.

A dashing Poirot,"There was a very good star studded version of Murder in the Orient Express made in 1974 by Sidney Lumet starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot.I thought the later David Suchet television movie was disappointing.Kenneth Branagh stars and directs this new version wearing a massive moustache which surprisingly was not too distracting, even if it did make him look like a walrus.This is a stylish and muscular film with a star studded cast. Johnny Depp is the villain who becomes the victim on the train ride. Judi Dench, Michelle Pfieffer, Derek Jacobi, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz are just some of the suspects.It is an enjoyable film even if you are familiar with the ending.

Whodunit!,"I definitely enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. It was a fun murder mystery. The greatest thing about this movie was, hands down, the whodunit feel. Murder on the Orient Express was very reminiscent of the Scooby Doo or Nancy Drew mysteries from my childhood. The detective, is Hercule Poirot, a borderline OCD character that strives to find an even balance in everything in life. Because of his unique outlook, he has throughout his life become a great detective with the ability to see things that are out of place. While trying to go on a real vacation, he takes the train Orient Express where there is eventually, of course, a murder. The movie follows the detective as he strives to ascertain the murderer by finding clues, questioning the other passengers for motives, and cross referencing alibis. I thought the characters were well played by their actors, the flow of the movie was never stale, and the detectives mustache were on point. Throughout the movie I was switching between which passenger was my top suspect for the case, and the ending did not disappoint me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A fundamentally passive experience, unlike a whodunit should be","Of course, there is the matter of the source material, which couldn't have been changed significantly. However, I am here to argue that this movie was a failure for meeting none of the expectations it created.First, as a murder mystery, it should have allowed for enough evidence for a viewer to solve the case. Instead, every time Poirot made a leap, he was using information we didn't have, that he was aware of apriori of the events in the film.Second, there is the issue of the great cast. You expect something like this to not be much in the way of story, but that it would shine on the strength of the actors:Kenneth Branagh, Johhny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz and so many others. Instead, we get a bit of each, a bit theatrical, a bit over the top in some cases, even a few moments that really felt fake (although in hindsight, if the actor is playing someone who is lying, maybe they did well?), but nothing shiny. No depth of character, no emotional buildup, nothing. The absolutely best scene comes from Willem Dafoe, at the end, completely ruined by the blunt interpretation of Pfeiffer a few moments later. Branagh's obviously fake mustache had more screen time than any of the stars in that great cast.And third, there was the story. A violent act that causes much pain is explained mostly through Poirot's description and fractured images that are supposed to make the viewer understand. Yet there is no transition from there to the present. We don't care about the event, the characters and we are completely unaware of how everything fits and how people got to this point. As a result, other than Poirot's intense stare and the nice stage sets, there is no story. I had more fun watching the introduction of the detective than in all of his solving of the train case.Bottom line: For what it attempted, it failed at every step. For what it promised, it failed to deliver. With pain in my heart I can say that this was substandard.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Suffers from too much ego,"Branagh has the clout and vision to make great movies, but his ego often gets in the way. I found that to be especially true with his version of MOTOE. Fabulous cinematography, stellar casting, but there were numerous unnecessary changes/additions that seemed more about serving his ego than the plot. Like the bit where he's walking on top of the train car in street shoes. First, not true to the character; second completely unnecessary to the story. Then there were the character changes from the original story, names changed or characters blended together. What purpose did it serve to make these changes? There were also unnecessary action scenes in what is really a psychological mystery.I will say again that the casting is otherwise stellar. Lovely to see Jacobi and Dench who really showed why they are industry royalty,and I heard a rumor that they considered Jolie for the role that went to Pfeiffer and I think they dodged a bullet there if it's true.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Agatha Christi's ""Murder on orient express "" Novel (10/10)......Kenneth Branagh's Movie 9/10",We always do the same mistake when a movie is made following a best selling novel is that we compare the novel and the movie. But we must keep in mind that novel is always superior than movies in many aspect.So my earnest request to the audience please don't compare it with the novel. When you compare you will loose the momentum of the movie. Because it is an excellent movie...A pure crime thriller of pre modern era. It has suspense as well as buried past mystery of all the passenger's life. This made the detective process more complicated.The movie has many aspects to cheer about. It has a good portrait of some 18 th century look with all those etiquettes and manners. The movie is fully loaded with the part part story of different suspects that made it difficult for the audience to guess the final answer.As you know most central roles were done by excellent actors and actresses there is no complaint about the acting. All the acting was very much splendid. Only it can be said that they have done it a little heavy. The dialogues are sometimes a bit too much for the audiences to capture.Over all the movie is a little slow..Like the thriller movies of early 1960's or 70's . But it has many good things to offer. A group of excellent actors together with a fine plot and diffuse suspense has made it a good enjoyable movie. But as i said it is a bit slow and dialogue dependent movie some viewers may experience it as a boring time. i have to say you had better show some patience and you will find the gold. This is A movie that can shake you when you will watch it even for the second time..Imagine what will happen when you go for the first time??????,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Certainly not brilliant but still rather enjoyable!,"I must admit, after his first directorial debuts with the appalling THOR movies, I was a little hesitant about Kenneth Branagh's latest outing as director (and star) with Murder on the Orient Express, and though there was a fair amount of material to enjoy, I'm sad to say that I WAS fairly spot-on.Don't get me wrong, there IS enjoyable stuff here but there were also various problems that left me rather disappointed.Let's first focus on the good things.First of all, one thing Branagh REALLY does well in this movie with his directing, is he delivers a brilliant and authentic slice of nostalgia.We begin in 1930s Jerusalem and Branagh captures the spirit and style of that period spot-on. The fashion, the clothes, the cars, the expensive clubs and bars. We see beautiful shots of Istanbul too with the glorious steamboats and the incredible Cathedrals.We're really transported back in time, but the other way Branagh delivers that nostalgia is with the absolutely breathtaking natural scenery that revolves around the Orient Express's journey. The cinematography in this film is BRILLIANT, courtesy of Haris Zambarloukos and really flies us into the snowy mountains or across the sun- kissed plains. The journey of the train is REALLY beautifully shown all the way through the film.Another good thing that Branagh captures is the attitudes and politics of the period. He's changed the British Colonel Arbuthnot into an African Dr. Arbuthnot, but this change from the original text is actually really interesting and adds another level to the story. A lot of the characters suffer from period racism, and that is authentically portrayed VERY well.Another thing is the set design, the interior of the train. It's beautiful, classic and very stylish.Also, another obvious thing to mention about Branagh's directing is that he does pull together a formidable cast. Almost every member is on top form. The whole line-up from Pfeiffer to Dafoe is great.Pfeiffer delivers a very emotional and strong performance as Mrs. Hubbard. Daisy Ridley plays a posh heroine and she plays that authentically too. Leslie Odom Jr. isn't bad as Dr. Arbuthnot but his muddled accent IS a distraction. Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman are two other interesting and authentic performances as the Russian Princess and German maid. Penelope Cruz delivers a interesting and surprising performance is Pilar Estravados. The great Willem Dafoe delivers enjoyable authenticity and some charm as the Nazi Professor. Derek Jacobi and Manuel Garcia- Rulfo deliver two very enjoyable performances. Jacobi harnessing his inner Alfred Pennyworth and Rulfo ringing with charisma...I am however, rather divide on Johnny Depp's sinister businessman Ratchett. He DOES play a thug well but there are STILL ghosts of Captain Jack and he can be a little laughable at times.Now we've gone through the GOOD members of the cast, onto the bad. Four performances stand out as REALLY poor. Josh Gad, Lucy Boynton, Sergei Polunin and Tom Bateman as the assistant, Count, Countess and train manager. They ALL deliver poor and rather weak performances with Gad, Polunin and Bateman all trying vainly to portray real emotion and Boynton basically playing a female Jack Sparrow.I've saved Branagh's performance for last. I was incredibly divided on his performance as Hercules Poirot which is a combo of Sherlock Holmes and Howard Hughes from THE AVIATOR . He DID deliver emotion and authenticity but there were times when his raving about the ""crime"" and the ""truth"" did feel a bit over-dramatic. His accent wasn't bad but I (personally) think that David Suchet did the best accent. Also, as many have mentioned, his mustache is simply not Poirot, it's more of a John Ruth from the Hateful Eight in my opinion!Now, the script. It, like the film has both good AND bad points. The dialogue is usually smart, sharp and interesting. It displays Poirot's genius and the personalities of the passengers very well. It really showcases the nostalgia of the times VERY well and slightly hinges on the 1974 film of the same name, but it also really grafts the tragedy and horror of the fictional ""Armstrong Case"" very well too.However, this version does have slight changes in plot to the original novel by Christie. There are various twists and turns that are interesting but, VERY messy. Things could do to be tightened up a lot in this film. Also, it just isn't exciting and it didn't really grab me at all. There is almost no dramatic atmosphere or tension.However, all the good performances, great cinematography and interesting dialogue DID deliver a fairly enjoyable picture.But, as I have listed, it does have problems!Not bad but definitely a B-PICTURE!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unfortunately Mediocre.,"When I first saw the cast line-up for this film, I thought it was going to be a masterpiece. Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp etc. The list goes on. But, it goes to show that a brilliant cast cannot make-up for mediocre.I'm being careful to avoid spoilers here! The film starts with a relatively entertaining light-hearted action sequence which brings Poirot to the forefront of the story-line. But, it quickly goes downhill from here. We are then introduced to the rest of the cast and we quickly learn they all have their own stories.After this though, the film becomes incredibly dull and slow. This remake is completely unnecessary and tediousI have only given it 5 stars because I have significant respect for Agatha Christie's Poirot and it is only the base story-line which rescues it. Boring acting and predictable plot-twists.Most definitely mediocre.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie - if you haven't seen the predecessors,"On the whole I think it is a nice, well-done movie, I really enjoyed the unusual camera perspectives, the acting too, but in some scenes it was a bit over-dramatic. I have seen only one preceding adaptation of this Poirot story, and it was the one in which David Suchet forms Hercule Poirot on screen and I have to say that I liked that film much better, than this new one. It's my personal opinion, maybe just because I've already seen another perspective I cannot be objective in judging the new one. I give still 7 points out of 10 for it, because it is till enjoyable and I can recommend to watch it - at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A solid whodunit thriller, but a mixed bag. Despite a few missed opportunities, Branagh leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances","It's strange to think that over the last 10 years or so we've had two popular incarnations of world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes, but no real big incarnation of Christie's wonderful Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Although the David Suchet series only ended in 2013, these episodes never reached the heights of popularity like we saw with Benedict Cumberbatch's or Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock. So it's about damn time something was done about it – so thank you Kenneth Branagh! Adapted from one of Christie's most famous novels, this version of Murder on the Orient Express brings with it a very impressive cast for Branagh's Poirot to interrogate his way through and find the murderer. We've seen Branagh take on Shakespeare and even Marvel so how does he fare with a bit of Christie? Well, fortunately the excellent and varied cast keep the film consistently engaging, captivating us as only these fine actors can do; but a lack of consistent style and slightly messy reveals overshadow what could have been quite an exceptional whodunit.As far as the actual story itself goes, it really is exceptional; it's difficult to fault Christie and her intricate plots and director Branagh and writer Michael Green really do put across the story well. Yet the way the story's told doesn't quite seem to do the book justice. We've seen from BBC's Sherlock that when filmed well investigations can be delightfully exciting and lavishly filmed in a really stylish manner, flashbacks and effects utilised in a way to make each revelation and finding of a clue thrilling. Here however, clues are often underwhelming and almost forgettable, their importance not necessarily highlighted leaving it a little cluttered and making us feel slightly lost at times. All this culminates in a slightly underwhelming finale where we're still trying to play catch up with Poirot and navigate the maze of clues and motivations.Still, despite this, detecting and investigating the murder with Poirot can still at times be fun, feeling like we're part of the action. This is best done right at the beginning during a sort of mini-case, similar to small action scenes at the beginning of James Bond films; this scene in particular is done very well. A lot of this is down to the quips and jokes that come from Poirot, really making his character and adding a personality to the film. Sadly this doesn't last for the entirety, actually starting to stop around the time of the murder. This is a shame since the film loses an element of its personality when the laughs stop. Still, when they're there, they really do help for us to fall in love with Poirot.Most of that though is down to Kenneth Branagh, whose performance is excellent. If you think David Suchet is the only one who could play Poirot, this film will convince you otherwise. With an understandable and mercilessly non-annoying French/ Belgian accent, Branagh's incarnation is absolutely likable and played to perfection; you can't have too much of him and that wondrous moustache. The only issue though is perhaps there's too much Poirot; if you weren't already aware of the rest of the cast, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were all unknowns instead of A-list actors. This is definitely a Branagh film, with everyone else in supporting roles but then again, when he's as great as he is, it's really hard to care.This doesn't mean to say that the rest of the cast are just throwaway celebrity cameos. On the contrary, where the middle section is less detecting and more a series of interrogations, it could easily edge on being dull and monotonous. However this is saved by sharp dialogue and, more than this, the excellent cast. It's a shame they don't interact together more; we usually see them with Poirot as opposed to each other. Still the cast is eclectic and all-starred – quite simply an absolute joy to behold. They make every scene polished and fun to watch, each delivering stand-out performances with unique characters with different sides, never letting us know who we should trust.Then again, that's what you expect from a whodunit – a tense atmosphere where you can't trust anyone. Sadly there's rarely a particularly tense scene, something that feels particularly lacking. Considering they're trapped in a train because of an avalanche, snow surrounding and isolating them, the barren outside a deathly cold mountain, you'd have thought this would be an excellent way of heightening the claustrophobia and sinister atmosphere. Instead, although the scenery is beautifully filmed, it looks more like a Christmas card than a deadly setting for a murder investigation.On the whole a solid whodunit thriller, but a bit of a mixed bag. While the style, atmosphere and slow unveiling of the mystery isn't as strong or fun as it could be, Kenneth Branagh and his inimitable Poirot moustache leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances. With a sequel set up in the end scene, I think you can rest assured that before too long Poirot will be on the case again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Remember, this is an old girl","A lot of my friends found this film a bit simplistic and underwhelming.
I quite enjoyed it.The story is coming on for 90 years old now and if you were to shred it down to its atoms there really isn't a lot going on.But a lot of the stories of that time were about exotic locations that only the rich or adventurous could embark on. 
I thought the film captured this well.There are lots of cinematic shots of sunsets and snowy mountain passes that the train chugs its way along.
The camera often glides along the carriages capturing the occupants through foggy windows or inbetween luggage racks.The acting and characters I thought were all at least adequate for the yarn - considering they needed to be quite sterotypical.To enjoy this you have to put quite a lot of effort in yourself.

Most of them actually get little to do (although Michelle Pfeiffer is nearly ten years older than Lauren Bacall was in the earlier version, but still a fox). Branagh doesn't disappear into the part of Poirot the way Albert Finney did, despite a moustache that always seems to be trying to upstage him.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Worthy Remake, Full of Style and Visual Beauty","I am a big fan of the 1974 version with Albert Finney as Poirot and directed by Sydney Lumet. I read that Sir Kenneth Branagh wanted to do a fresh version with a different take so he deliberately did not view the 1974 film. His Poirot is a bit sweeter and more sentimental than the one written for, and acted by, Finney. However, I find him very convincing! There are touches of humor, especially in the first half of the film. The second half is more serious as Poirot realizes he must solve the crime and has limited time to do so.The cast was excellent, and the scenery whether real or CGI was beautiful. The opulence and grandeur of this kind of train travel in the 1930s came across vividly. If anything, these characters are a bit more touching, a bit less campy and ""over the top"" than the characters in Lumet's film. That's not a bad thing, it is just a different approach. Even at the end, Poirot displays a little unintentional humor because with his perfectionism, he cannot help himself.It is a very enjoyable film, and Branagh is a fine actor, always. He makes the film work. That and the sight of alps at sunset!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A stellar cast and setting can't hide an empty and superficial story,"Branagh shines as Poirot in a beautiful surrounding in which he has to solve a murder case on a train, while showing that his talents are a bliss and a burden at the same time. Within minutes he gets to showcase his detective skills in an amusing way. Not much later, the movie turns out to be loaded with a stellar cast. After some forced introductions the movie starts to feel rushed. There is no build up, no development, just a quick introduction to a group of so called interesting people and it's done.The movie is beautiful, but a great cast can't hide the fact that the movie is rushed, superficial and hollow and doesn't do honor to the fine details that made the original story richer.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The pacing is problematic, too; some moments feel sluggish while crucial plot points are rushed, undermining the story's natural suspense.Attempts to bring a modern twist with social themes and ethical complexities feel more like an afterthought than a genuine integration.

Hercule Poirot on duty...,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a Mystery and Crime movie which is based upon the novel of Agatha Christie. In this movie, we watch Hercule Poirot trying to get some free time after all the cases that he has solved but eventually he is recruited to solve one more. While he is traveling with Orient Express, the train accidentally gets stopped because of a small avalanche. This is the start of his investigation because Hercule Poirot knew from the start that a murder was planned and he wants to find out who is that person on this train who was able of committing such a crime.I liked this movie because it had a very good plot and the storyline was simply breathtaking. The interpretation of Kenneth Branagh who played as Hercule Poirot was very good and I also liked the interpretations of Daisy Ridley who played as Miss Mary Debenham, Leslie Odom Jr. who played as Dr. Arbuthnot and Judi Dench who played as Princess Dragomiroff. I have to admit that the direction which was made by Kenneth Branagh was very interesting and gave the audience a different perspective of seeing some scenes in the movie and of course made them change their view of understanding who committed this crime.Finally, I believe that ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a great movie to watch because it has a very interesting plot with many plot twists that will keep you alert and you won't get bored at all.

"Not too good, I do prefer the original.","This film, from renowned actor\director Kenneth Branagh, is sorta let down for many reasons. First, it makes far too many unnecessary changes. The ending, in my opinion, was done so much better in Lumet's original, it's much more subtle. While the ending here has pretty much the same meaning, it's a little overdone and melodramatic. The directing as well I feel is a bit on the showy side, lots of weird angles that don't seem to serve any sort of a creative purpose, other than to show off how clever the cameramen can frame scenery.Speaking of the scenery, that's where I will lead into my positives. This film is gorgeous, the winter months, the sense of isolation, even the way the trial is filmed in these are damn good, as are some of the cities and locations we visit at the beginning. The acting as well is across the board impressive. We have to likes Of Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Jonny Depp, Penelope Cruz, and even Josh Gadd, an actor most known for his more comedic roles, is even good here. The weakest length is, unfortunately, our leading man, his accent was kind of overdone to me, he has his moments, and I would not call him bad, but that was a distraction.All in all, this film really did not need to be made. The only reason I can think off is maybe Branagh wanted to make a closer adaptation of the book by Agatha Christie, which is a sound reason to do a film like this, however, I've heard it's not that at all, (I kind of have to trust other readers here, as I have not read it myself, for the time being). That's kind of the biggest problem with it. It has its good qualities and is perfectly watchable, but it fails to have any sort of a reason to exist.

This remake though is at best a Sunday afternoon film on a rainy day - certainly there is not enough to it for it to be able to justify its place in the cinema or as a big blockbuster film. Of course the cast and quality of the production would tell you otherwise, and it is impressive for what it puts on the screen, but it is what it does (or doesn't) do with it that is the problem.The film has a playfulness to it, but mostly it seeks to have weight to the performances and scenario. It lays it on a bit thick in this regard, resulting in the film feeling a bit dull because it carries itself heavy, but doesn't justify it or make it work. Individual parts are fine, and the film does have plenty to look at, but as a whole it is surprisingly leaden, lacking real suspense, zip, and vigor.

Johnny Depp seemed to relish his role, clearly familiar with the nature of character he was embodying and Michelle Pfieffer was as good as always. Daisy Ridley can apparently act, which based on Star Wars was news to me.The story was changed a little, with some characters barely appearing and somehow the editing managed to create less tension than there should have been, whilst simultaneously making the plot drag a little in places but overall this was an enjoyable watch and I hope to see more of Mr Brannagh's take on Poirot in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's a relic of a bygone era, the mark of a gentleman imprinted on by an autistic childhood Poirot, along with the wired-in sensibilities of right, wrong, and a sense of patterns in human behavior.People seem to want to pick one Poirot and crown him king: Suchet, or Ustinov, or Branagh.

Unnecessary Racialism,"A good original detective story from a renowned crime thriller author that I'd unnecessarily turned into a modern racial lecture.It appears that character names are deliberately changed or recast simply to make the story more centered around race rather than the more twist-and-turn, conflicting morals story it initially was.The actors do relatively well with the poor writing/dialogue they are given, and the CGI is not particularly effective.Watch the original. Kenneth Branagh is a less annoying portrayal of Poirot, but the modern film is the epitome of what Hollywood has become. Obvious, in-your-face and overly ideological.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Another case for a different Poirot,"In 1934 the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot sets out from Istanbul heading to London on the Orient Express.

Unnecessary remake.,"I am loathe to put the boot in to any film but the barrage of publicity for this, plastered all over the BBC news and chat shows - Graham Norton and Andrew Marr interviewing the phalanx of ""stars"" in a suitable subservient way - has pushed this reviewer over the edge. It is a film that didn't need a remake since the original was perfectly acted and nuanced. Perhaps that is half the problem - I know the ""solution"" and therefore the denouement is no surprise- but there is something more deeply flawed with this movie. Firstly - that moustache. Ridiculous and in the end it becomes something that you stare at and wonder just why something so outrageously stupid would NOT get in the way of what words the actor is actually saying. You stop listening and just try and see where it is stuck on. Branagh stomps around the various scenes like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia (even down to walking along the top of the snow-covered carriage as if he was king of the castle) and then addresses the suspects in a scene that is reminiscent of The Last Supper painting. Everywhere he goes everyone knows him. Absolutely everyone. The opening scenes in Jerusalem are unnecessary and only serve to raise Branagh/Poirot into God like status where the population of the city are happy to take his word and trample a suspect policeman to death. No jury, no trial, lynch mob rules. All of which seems to bother the guardian of justice not one jot.Cut to the train - at last. We hear that the train is full and that Poirot will have to share a cabin for at least one night. As we discover that there are just 12 passengers on the whole train I wondered what happened to all the other empty berths on the other carriages. Let's just pass over that one. We are now introduced to the various characters. I don't know how much these stars got paid for this movie but boy, apart from Michelle Pfeiffer, they don't have too many words to say. The main action is sitting around looking suspiciously at each other. Depp is mostly unintelligible evidenced by his recent performance on the Graham Norton show where he found it difficult to string two words together. It is only Branagh who has the dialogue - and he works it as hard as he can into some kind of Shakespearean dialogue. Judi Dench plays the part Wendy Hiller took in the 1974 film. I know Dench is supposed to be the public's ""favourite"" but Hiller's sneering haughtiness will remain one of the highlights of the earlier film long after this one is forgotten.In the novel and the 1974 film the train gets stuck in a drift. Here it is struck by an avalanche and teeters on a wooden viaduct. Ain't CGI wonderful? The engine is derailed but never fear he comes a gang of ten workers who will dig away the snow and pull a 100 ton engine back on to the tracks - with their bare hands. Marvellous.And the music score? Possibly the most disappointing part of the whole film when one considers the classic Richard Rodney Bennett score for the 1974 film. Patrick Doyle's offering is just insipid and uninspired. The closing credits roll with some vapid pop song burbling away in the background.Well, if you've never seen the 1974 film and you don't know the ending you may enjoy this but perhaps you should locate that earlier film and wait for this to end up on the £3 shelf at Tesco. It would appear, to judge by the final quip by Poirot in the film that Branagh is planning to redo Death on the Nile. God help us.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I enjoy remakes,"I enjoy remakes, perhaps that is why this movie was on my list to see ASAP. Hollywood has grabbed up the rights to many Agatha Christie books with varied success; Death on the Nile, The Mirror Cracked and the1974 production of Murder on the Orient Express, all beautifully done with a cast of Hollywood glamour stars of the era. I have them all in my library of classics. When the BBC produced the Hercule Poirot series I got addicted. The productions are movie length, made for television and David Suchet as Poirot is masterful. Suchet's version of Poirot in Orient Express should be considered definitive. The script is true to the book and deals with the story conflicts in a powerful way. Now for this most recent attempt... The cast is great but I need to agree with comments of other reviewers. It felt like a vanity piece and I can only say ""Why?"" David Suchet has already claimed that prize.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A missed opportunity,"Murder on the Orient Express is fine entertainment, but it's also a missed opportunity. The cast is impressive, the director is skilled, and the source material is classic. Still, Orient Express lacks memorable pop and gets stale. First, while the broad story is intriguing and clever, the script details are repetitive and dry. Hercule's introduction is fun, but the supporting cast is rushed. Then, the mystery fizzles because Hercule's interrogations lack zeal. Plus, Hercule's conclusion isn't fully established, so the twist feels slightly unearned. Furthermore, the supporting cast is underutilized. Skilled actors like Colman and Dafoe have little to work with.Technically, Murder on the Orient Express is good, but not great. Overhead shots and lengthy takes are engaging, but that variety is sparse. The production design is elaborate, but undercut by abundant CGI. Those effects enhance the location, but retro techniques would've supported the era. Next, the soundtrack is fitting, but slightly basic. Dynamic music could have invigorated the film. The sound design amplifies the atmosphere, but isn't surreal. Finally, the pacing and tone are monotonous. Although proficient, both fronts lack energy, keeping Orient Express from unquestionable success. Ultimately, the film is passable, but it fails to stand out.Writing: 7/10

Cunning Detective Tale!,"When a murder occurs on the train on which he's travelling, celebrated detective Hercule Poirot is recruited to solve the case. Murder on the Orient Express is a very cunning yet intriguing type of film that has you constantly second guessing yourself as to who could be this very killer? I decided to watch this with some friends after the sequel 'Death on the Nile' was released to.streaming and I have to say being a Playstation gamer this story is very similar to The Raven, alot of inspiration from the weekend Agatha Christie.I really enjoyed this movie, I thought it was well thought out and everybody played their parts so well but for me the actors who stood out most to me was Willem Dafoe (Hardman), Johnny Depp (Edward Ratchett) and of course the amazing Kenneth Branagh (Hercule Poirot) I thought they all did a very entertaining job at this one for sure!Highly recommend, I enjoyed it very much so.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a technically excellent film, which tells a celebrated and very curious story, but which loses important points in charisma and hospitality","Written in 1934, Murder on the Orient Express is, along with There's None (1939), Agatha Christie's best-known novel, Queen of Crime. The book was based on a real case, which took place in the United States, of the abduction of Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., 1 year and 8 months old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, kidnapped from his crib, in his home, in 1st of March 1932. In the work, the event initiates a series of other family tragedies, which makes the case morally dense for Hercule Poirot and for the reader, a characteristic maintained as the essence of all adaptations of the book so far.With a strong premise based on the author's most famous book, the film had everything to be an incredible detective plot, but the bland script makes the film seem like a generic adventure that goes on for two (long) hours without arousing any emotion in the film. Public. The first problem is in the construction of Poirot and the other passengers who are on the train - most of the time, the detective just looks like an eccentric (and full of mannerisms) caricature based on the character created by the author, while the other passengers on the train are there as mere supporting actors that serve as a bridge for the researcher's deductions, without much dramatic development and without a construction of depth that would be essential for the outcome. A solution to this would have been to invest more in the interaction scenes between the investigator and his suspects. Still, many actors struggle with what little they have on hand and deliver formidable performances. At this point, I need to highlight the brilliant performance of Michelle Pfeiffer and Josh Gad, respectively in the roles of the Widow and the Wizard.Past the main problem - which are the characters -, the film travels on turbulent tracks. There are very positive highlights and there are also a number of imperfections in the execution that end up turning the plot into a dull and bland story, unlike Christie's book. To get rid of the bad side right away, we can highlight the pace of the plot. The film begins in a very exciting and engaging way, as we are introduced to the Investigator even before he boards the Orient Express. However, once he begins his journey and the crime happens, the plot abruptly derails, almost in a metaphor for an event that happens simultaneously in the film.Hercule Poirot's investigation is one of the most uninteresting sequences in the film, because it doesn't have enough interesting aspects to keep the audience in their seats. Also, when some truths about the characters are presented on screen, the whole mystery - for those who haven't read the book - is somewhat obvious and it's kind of unbelievable to see a detective as brilliant as Poirot without understanding what's going on. Interestingly, the plot also has a setting that borders on the theatrical. This can be very well evidenced by the dialogues, which are exhaustively expository, and yet they do not play a very good role in trying to involve and explain to the audience what is happening. In fact, it's much easier to get lost amid so many explanations than to find yourself.If in Agatha Christie's novels the detective fascinates readers with his logical ability to examine clues and connect the dots, here he seems to materialize his conclusions in an almost magical way, so much so that the big reveal of the plot comes to seem forced, as if it had been created by the writers because they needed to end the story somehow. This goes beyond a mere disappointment of someone who has read the original work - it is a problem of script construction that leaves aside one of the basic elements of every detective story, which is to subtly give the viewer the necessary pieces to unravel the mystery that It was presented. Perhaps someone who has never read the novel will be able to get the best out of solving the case, but when you know the path Poirot took, what is presented on screen looks canned.As the investigation unfolds, new details emerge and reveal, of course, that there is a bigger story behind what happened on that train. But the film gets it right by not throwing too much or too little information: everything is calculated so that the audience feels inside the story and fills in the gaps until the end. And all this is shown with a beautiful visual of external scenes, a neat production design and camera angles very well planned by Branagh. Sometimes with an uncut shot, sometimes with a camera that shows the characters from above, the director plays with the possibilities and places the spectator in unlikely places. At times, you feel like you shouldn't be there spying on events, while enjoying the unexpected perspective.The script also tries to promote an interesting discussion about morality and the foundations of Western justice, but ends up just brushing the surface and makes the debate sound almost like a speech of ""the moral of the story is this one! "", trying to open its bias towards the viewer in an (excessively) expository way. The ability to throw all the information in the face of the audience also appears in Poirot himself, who occasionally speaks to himself to show something that may not have been understood by someone - which could be done more subtly, with a look or an expression. From Poirot's closed view of ""right"" and ""wrong"", the film develops its questioning of reality. When he understands the heart of the mystery at hand, the detective's convictions are challenged and, suddenly, we begin to think about ours too. Can anything justify murder? Does one bad act compensate for another? What would you do if you were in the same position? In very well-placed sentences, Branagh clarifies how a murder does not end only in that act. It's something much bigger, which affects the lives of many people, including the killer. The world's most famous detective begins to look at life differently, as do the passengers on the express.The film tackles heavy elements such as racism, xenophobia, alcoholism and religious fanaticism and has as its central theme the ethics of justice, which forms Poirot's character arc, giving the classic and unusual solution of the whodunit a thematic and emotionally resonant context (to those who already know her, no spoilers please). Since much of the book simply consists of Poirot interviewing the suspects in the train's dining car, the film tries to vary locations and introduce more tense sequences. They don't really become action scenes, but they help bring cinematic dynamism and a greater sense of danger to the narrative. In times where the classic detective novel no longer has the strength of before, it is pleasant to see a film that lends itself so much affection to this erased genre. The final scene shows the desire to produce a sequel (already confirmed, by the way) and I hope it actually goes ahead. The last few years have seen a renaissance of Sherlock Holmes in the pop culture mainstream, so perhaps there could be room for Hercule Poirot and Agatha Christie's other works.The big weak link in this adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express is precisely where one should be most careful: the climax and the revelation of the person responsible for the investigated crime. Both the cliché of the scene that refers directly to the Last Supper and the soundtrack, which even made no difference in the feature, but now becomes annoying and almost erases the hearing of the spoken lines, are poorly constructed and rushed, which leaves a bitter aftertaste. For those who are having fun at such a well-executed pace so far. Not that the overall balance experience becomes unpleasant, but it ends up taking some of its shine away.One aspect of the film is exquisite: its direction. Branagh knows how to frame his scenes and move the camera, showing everything that should be shown and creating a cold atmosphere that contributes to the narrative mood. Photography manages to exalt the beauties of Eastern Europe and convey the dimension of the scenarios. The decoupage is exquisite during the first 90 minutes of the film. In a camera walk along the corridor of the express rooms, seen from the outside, we get a sense of the environment in which the cast is inserted. It's an almost claustrophobic space, where you practically have to push each other to get through. Which will greatly help the viewer himself to solve the mystery. Speaking of which, the cabin where Ratchett is found dead is seen from above. The body stretched out on the bed, while we watch only the heads of Poirot and the head of the train, Bouc (Tom Bateman, great) moving objects and clues left at the crime scene, is another example of the excellence of the director's thinking. While advancing the plot, he presents the public with the details of the crime.Another aspect that stands out are the solutions found by Branagh to present the characters, which flow in an absolutely natural way. Among Poirot's quick conversations with the other passengers, you can already get an idea that everyone is hiding something that goes beyond the crime committed. After all, the theme of the story, far beyond the mystery involved, is Agatha Christie's analysis of the human being and how he is able to lie or release half-truths not to get involved - or not to involve him. Each of the names in scenes has good reasons for doing so, although some are more prominent than others.""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a technically excellent film, which tells a celebrated and very curious story, but which loses important points in charisma and hospitality. The challenge of adaptation is always every director's Achilles heel and Branagh's obsession with symmetrically mirroring the book he is inspired by on the screen, almost without filters and emulating the character himself, makes him indisputably divisible. Extremely sweet for connoisseurs and almost tasteless for laymen.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Watch with a clear mind,"Seems like people are always just hating on remakes - nothing about how it was remade, the acting, the plot, how it was portrayed, filmed etc.I was always a fan of Agatha Christie and the version of Hercule Poirot played by David Suchet. Because he was such an Iconic character the image/ voice and character of him will always be the ingrained memory my brain goes to, so it was a little internal battle going on whilst watching this movie to appreciate what was being presented in-front of me instead of what I had come to know.Other than that it was an enjoyable movie. In this version I enjoyed how the characters were portrayed, how the story was carried out, executed and the conclusion it came to.If you are a Poirot fan its worth a watch, but watch it like your fictional hero would, with a clear and analytical mind, living in the moment, not stuck in bias memories of a hero from times gone by.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not bad,"Back when I was in Vietnam, I used to read a lot of Detective Conan manga. In an usual case, Conan just walked around the scenes, listened to the people talked, then had an eureka moment. Every single case in Conan always had complexed killing method that a normal human being wouldn't be able to fathom.This movie reminded me of that. It fitted in as an episode of Case Closed pretty well. Also, the cinematography was well done and showed the aesthetic of the train as well as the people. During couple scenes where Poirot interviewed people on the train, the usage of the splitting mirrors was clever and reflected the characters being questioned.I enjoyed the thrill of this movie until the last 15 minutes. What happened after the culprit was revealed felt incredible uncalled for. It dragged on the movie for an extra 15 minutes for no reason.Overall, I still liked it. If you like detective movies this is not a bad one. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A very enjoyable but forgettable time.,"This film is expertly directed by star Kenneth Branagh who also plays the lead detective with a great quirky but cool style. With excellent shooting by a cinematographer who's name I don't know, so great job Jeff the Cinematographer. The rest of the cast can be great like Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Leslie Odom Jr., and surprisingly Josh Gad who showed he wasn't just the guy from Pixels or Frozen. The rest of the cast however Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, etc. were just mediocre. Overall it was well made and really entertaining but some of the performances were lackluster and the film had some pacing issues.

(Reading Dickens: LOL),"(This is less a traditional review than some scattered thoughts):First thought/complaint: How in god's name are they out there in what is supposed to be cold and sub-zero enough to give everyone ""exposure"" for so long in just regular jackets and coats? Come on, Kenny my man, do better than that.Second thought: while the best Agatha Christie movie of this decade still is and will likely remain The Hateful Eight, this is engaging, dramatic and full of robust performances (Johnny Depp hasn't been this good/sleazy in a decade, even as he has a relatively small role, luckily it's not the size but the keyness of it). It actually helped that I hadn't seen another version of this story - yes, shame on me for not seeing the Lumet one, I'll get on it soon - and the ending was sadder than I expected, which is good. Branaugh keeps his audience on his toes and there isn't a false note in the performances.Third thought: This is not directorially up to par with Henry V and Hamlet, but I'm glad to see Branaugh still has it in in him to make a film full of vitality and visual ideas that are a little wild and a little of the usual (black and white flashbacks, really?) But where it counts, the movie is fully involving and the story shines however you cut it - in that way I'd rank this alongside something like the recent Great Gatsby adaptation: as long as you really get the goods right, and don't go TOO crazy stylistically, what works will shine through (also I mean, Pfeiffer, Dafoe, Cruz, even Josh goddamn Gad are stand-outs, and Ridley's fine too though now she just like has to do a movie where she and Kiera Knightley are sisters, right, like that has to happen now contractually).Oh, and the CGi... eh.... But my positives outweigh the negatives here. Mostly. It's a wonderful whodunit story that kept me on my toes and had a procedural tone that kept me wholly invested. Not to mention, naturally, that giant mustache that is like a mustache that grew a mustache - or, more to the point, the Human Stachipede.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't overanalyze, just enjoy!!","Okay, so I'm tired of hearing/reading peoples' overly critical reviews for this film. If you cannot see a film without breaking it apart and scrutinising every part like it's some kind of science project, of course you will find flaws with any movie.

That aside, I really like this version too. I have watched it 3 times so far and there's no denying is a highly enjoyable film to watch, it's visually stunning and it's filmed in an interesting way with unusual angles and perspectives. The music fits the film and the actors/actresses are all super talented (as we all know).

"Well acted and visually sound, Murder on the Orient Express is a nice mystery that should make Agatha Christie fans satisfied","I think it's been a while since we've seen a classic murder mystery film. What's interesting is that there's thousands of books, but not too many of them get adaptations let alone into film. Why? Their not easy to write and they manage to keep a lot of detail to plot and character in order to twist and turn the final answer of ""who did it"". I can only conclude that mystery seems to have a better life on television as in that medium, those elements can not only stretch further then a films runtime, but can probably better play around the viewers ideas on what's going on.Given all of that, today's movie is a remake of Murder on the Orient Express, based off of the acclaimed novel by Agatha Christie. While I know she has written a large amount of books, her mysteries has been adapted countless times. What made Murder on the Orient Express (and what a lot of mysteries had incorporated) good was how tight and claustrophobic the situation was. It also had the luck of having Hercule Poirit, a detective with crazy attention to detail, to solve the mystery. While he hasn't had the same attention as Sherlock Holmes, he's made his stance has his journeys have filled over thirty novels. Let's see if Murder on the Orient Express can improve from the previous adaptions.In 1934, Hercule Poirot (played by Kenneth Branagh) is about to embark on a much needed break after solving a recent mystery in Jerusalem. He is still under his oath that within most cases, there is only right or wrong. In needing to return to London, he's given a spot on the Orient Express, which seems to be fully booked. He's approached by an American businessman Samuel Ratchett (played by Johnny Depp) to work for him, but Poirot declines. The next morning, Ratchett is found to have been stabbed to death.An avalanche has also derailed the steam engine, stranding the rest of the passengers. Poirot decides to take the case to curb his boredom. It's on this train he interviews all the suspects; wet nurse Pilar (played by Penélope Cruz), scientist Gerhard (played by William Defoe), the princess Dragomiroff (played by Judi Dench) accountant Hector (played by Josh Gad), Doctor Arbuthnot (played by Leslie Odom Jr.), traveler Caroline (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), and Mary (played by Daisy Ridley).I better stop there as most mysteries are best when you know as little as possible. Kenneth Branagh is also in the director's chair for Murder on the Orient Express, and for what I expected, I was surprised. I haven't seen the original, nor have I read the book, but I can say I was intrigued, even if the story is a tad overstuffed. It's common for a lot of mysteries to have a lot of characters, but given what exactly is being solved, it may have benefited to cut two or three of the background characters in order to tighten everything.Though even with the over abundance of characters, all the main actors shine, especially Kenneth Branagh, whose very likable and a fun guy to follow. His accent and tone has the right balance of over-the-top and subtle makes him seem like someone who could be that eccentric and smart. If I had to pick my other favorites, I'd say that they were Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who do a lot with the material their characters are given. That's not to put a damper on everyone else. This is compelling enough that it goes a long with the long dialogue.Now for those expecting a lot of action will want to look elsewhere. Murder on the Orient Express is very dialogue heavy, as a lot of mysteries are. Where it can make up to curb boredom is the cinematography and editing. The movie is beautiful looking and contain the element of a grand scope feeling that most Kenneth Branagh movies have. Many of the flashbacks are shown which has a neat ""old Hollywood"" look to them that gives this movie a bigger sense on nostalgia.I'll give this seven Orient Express trains out of ten. I can't fully embrace this as great piece of art, but I'm glad I saw Murder on the Orient Express. The imagery looks nice enough that I'd recommend that you view it on the big screen. If your not looking for something that is a definite slow burn, this isn't for you. Take the train and see if this kills for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Blasphemous Offensive Steaming Pile of Dung,"We actually know what Agatha Christie would have thought of Kenneth Branaugh's bastardization of ""Murder on the Orient Express."" She predicted, in ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead,"" that some idiot would dramatize her books by adding sex and violence that was not in her original work and hypermasculinizing Poirot, while dumbing down her expert character development in a way that insults the audience's intelligence. She knew it had to happen. And it has.So much about this movie was so bad, it was laughable. Branaugh's heavy handed direction--""Look at me everybody! I'm so clever! I'm going to put Poirot on top of the train! underneath the train! on the side of the train! And film the train from every possible angle like a fight scene from the Batman TV series!"" was the worst kind of in your face grandstanding directing. The shots from above--and I mean directly ABOVE--the action were simply ridiculous.Branaugh even MADE SURE we ALL KNEW his Poirot was HETEROSEXUAL by repeated non sequitur contrived references to a young, thin, pretty, white female love interest in a photo who had about as many lines (none) as the ""prostitute"" added to a scene with the creeped up Monsieur Bouc character, whose only line was to gush over meeting Poirot, when she wasn't simpering like a child. I honestly have never been so repulsed by a handsome male character in my life as Bouc's predatory lecher.What the heck was Branaugh thinking? The only thing worse than dumbing down and sexing up the story with psychopathic violence and creepy lechers was the hitting- you-over-the-head-with-oh-so-unsubtle white savior references to the terrible evils of RACISM!!! Please, someone save us from Hollywood white male liberals bending over backwards to be politically correct about race and thinking they are sooooo progressive while maintaining the worst female madonna/whore lampshade character tropes and adding stabbings, guns, fist fights and shootings not in the original story.""Yes, I took a masterpiece and made it into a self serving piece of crap--but that's OK, because there's a black doctor who gets to make some great speeches about how his white male friend helped him get into med school.""So...let's review. Branaugh ADDED to Christie's original story 1) Poirot's righteous finger pointing at the horrors of racism (adding an empowered black MALE character) and 2) Poirot chuckling with his buddy (wink wink) about buying and selling women for sex. In 1934. In Istanbul. Creating a disempowered female character known as ""the prostitute"" who does not even get a name and whose entire narrative purpose is to stroke Branaugh/Poirot's ego and 3) adding a female love interest whose only narrative purpose is to proof Branaugh/Poirot's ""manhood"" who is literally an inanimate photograph and 4) male characters punching walls, fist fighting, stabbing and shooting people and 5) giving Poirot himself characteristics completely antithetical to Christie's beloved detective. As if we needed any more proof of Hollywood's hypocrisy in the treatment of women and sex in our films and normalizing toxic gender stereotypes in both male and female characters.And the script! It read like some high school freshman TRYING to sound erudite. ""Overt overture?"" Uh...I was waiting for them to serve a ""cheesy cheeseburger"" in the dining car. Many of the lines would have been more appropriate in a Steven Seagal movie--""Why won't you DIE!"" What!??!?!Only a fool would take one of the masterpieces of British literature by the great Agatha Christie and make it into a pandering show of ego and arrogance, while insulting the audience's intelligence and perverting Christie's moral dilemma on the definition of justice into a tale of vigilantism and revenge by a bunch of thugs little better than the man they murdered. I am HORRIFIED to think a whole new generation will think THIS detritus has anything to do with Agatha Christie's novel. If I could, I would give this film negative stars.Do yourself a favor. Watch David Suchet's virtuoso performance in the 2010 Murder on the Orient Express. That production did Christie justice and then some. Or better yet, read the book. Remember reading? Then you'll know that Branaugh should be tarred and feathered for what he did to her epic magnum opus.No, Ken, you didn't have to mutate Christie's story to pander to today's audiences. She is literally the best selling author of all time. Christie needs no help. She appealed to people's humanity and intelligence, creating one of the most popular characters in the history of literature, not to mention a pantheon of assertive female characters and humane male characters, breaking stereotypes 80 years ago that, unfortunately, still survive today. All you did was play to the lowest common denominator, appealing to our baser instincts while maintaining arguably the most brilliant whodunnit plot of all time. So, new audiences think this ""cheesy cheeseburger"" is great, not realizing that they could have had filet mignon.And the tragedy is--she even predicted you would do it. Strip her legacy of it's intelligence and humanity, add male and female stereotypes and neanderthal violence all the while using her brilliant plot to make money.And you STILL did it.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Shameful portrayal of classic.....,"So disappointed in KB for butchering this wonderful novel. Adding characters, taking some out, changing story lines and most of all fundamentally changing Poirot into a heroic agile and well fit person. Nothing works in this plot. Too many holes. The only thing going for it is the wardrobe department that's done a good job. The VFX look horrible because they shot in 65 mm making the visual effects very fake.
I can go on and on about the problems with this production. I hear KB is redoing Death on the Nile. I just hope he can stop himself and keep the dignity of the classic work. But I don't hole my breath",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""No no no no""",Completely misinterpreted. Seems like neither screeplayer nor director have read Agatha Christie's novels. They do not have any idea of Poirot's character. The movie seems like the insult of Agatha Chistie's intelligence.I am disappointed.,,Anonymous,Mystery
Mediocre At Best..,"An attractively huge cast, mostly underutilised. A fleeting performance from Johnny Depp sadly, who is very watchable in more demanding roles. Poirot's French accent is difficult to understand and lots of his dialogue is missed. Prolonged overhead camera work at times on the train, although understandable is very unsatisfying as you can't feel the atmosphere in the room by seeing peoples facial expressions or mouths moving.

"Well, it's not the same old crap","Was this remake necessary? Define ""necessary"". I saw the Albert Finney/Sydney Lumet version when it was released in 1974. I was only 11 years old when it first came out so I don't remember much of how it affected me. But in the many years since then I have become a fan of Agatha Christie and have seen it again and again, as well as other adaptations. I've always thought that Finney's interpretation of Poirot was a bit over the top. Still it was never as bad as Peter Ustinov's. Fortunately I never saw Alfred Molina's version. And then came David Suchet, who, in my opinion, nails the role perfectly. Any remake is naturally going to be compared, favorably or unfavorably, to its predecessors. In my opinion Branagh's attempt fell below Suchet but above all others. Far above. Any time the director is the star you run the risk of over indulgences and this film suffers some of that. Few actors, if any, can resist the temptation to place the value of their own egos above that of the picture as a whole. Which is not to say that Branagh is a bad actor or a bad director. Nothing could be further from the truth. I just didn't feel like he performed either job brilliantly in this picture. It might be that I'm making the mistake of over comparison to the Suchet version. And taken on its own merits alone this picture is decent, if not great. The acting is superb. The photography is beautiful. I couldn't help being overwhelmed by the abundance of CGI but whattayagonnado? It's everywhere these days. The opening scene and the reveal scene at the end differ greatly from the source material. It doesn't hurt the story at all, it's just different. And I can't think of any reason to have done them this way except just to be different. But all in all it was an enjoyable film, exactly what I was hoping for, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old crap that Hollywood has been churning out over the past few years.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you watch it on its own terms, you may just enjoy yourself.","I'm amazed to say I LOVED IT! I truly did. It was gorgeous to look at (money was SPENT!). Going in knowing whodunnit is especially fun when there are people in the audience who audibly don't! I had a great time!Now, I'm sure people want to know how it compares to the 1974 Lumet film with Albert Finney. And the answer is... IT DOESN'T AND IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT YOU EVEN ASK!Honestly! That was a FILM! This – and it makes no attempt to hide the fact – is a MOVIE!!! It's a delicious, giant, Agatha Christie themed cake. It's the kind of movie that requires you to eat while you're watching it. So, if you see it and don't like it because ""boo hoo it doesn't compare to the original,"" it's you're own fault you didn't enjoy it.There are a goodly number of reasons not to enjoy this version on its own merits. But first, the good stuff!Kenneth Branagh, director. He keeps things moving at a good clip. It survives the true test of a period piece: I wanted to buy or wear everything in it. It's not easy to make a mystery where everyone over 40 knows the ending! He approaches it with style and aplomb!Kenneth Branagh, actor. His Poirot is surprisingly understated; shockingly so when you consider the heinous moustache (it's the kind of moustache that requires the spelling with the most letters). The anacondapillar on his face aside, there's wit, charm, subtlety and grace in his performance. It's not iconic Finney or Ustinov but it'll more than do. In fact, I found him quite moving.Josh Gad. I am not a fan. I don't find him funny or appealing at all. Except in this because he's fabulous! The character's pathetic slovenliness is actually endearing and the period look really works for him. It's terrific work.Leslie Odom Jr. I did not see him in Hamilton so this was my first experience. He's beyond appealing.The very best thing about this film: Michelle F-ing Pfeiffer! Between this and mother! I'm loving how much fun she's having. She OWNS this movie!Now the other stuff.A lot of heavy hitters have very little to do. Dame Judi, Derek Jacobi and Olivia Coleman are only here to give the cake some class. And they do! But...Some of the other characters are given extremely short shrift. The Count and Countess (played by Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset in the original) are played respectively by a non-actor and a relative unknown (Lucy Boynton, who was delightful in Sing Street but is no Jacqueline Bisset) and are barely in it. I'm still not sure how the one Latin guy was involved.While the movie deserves props for at least trying to make a period murder mystery with at least a few actors of color, it would have been nice if they all actually had stuff to do. But when even Dame Judi is just collecting a paycheck...The screenplay and some of the acting is a bit cartoony. Daisy Ridley is serviceable. Willem Dafoe is trapped in a character with no way out but DAMN if he doesn't commit to his Choices! Johnny Depp seems like he's in a different movie altogether.There are unnecessary action sequences and the screenplay's other attempts to get you to where you're inevitably going to end up feel forced: like someone at the studio said ""I think you need a car chase only without cars and on a stalled train."" When people actually start confessing, I was like ""don't DO that!""The reenactment of the murder is a bit too stylish for me and takes away some of the horror of what's happening, though it does capture some of the rage.All that said, I really did enjoy myself! If you can watch this movie version without being mired in comparisons to the previous great film (and if you properly adjust your expectations), you might have fun too.No guarantees.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't believe the negative reviews, this is an original take on a well known mystery","I have to say I couldn't disagree more with a lot of the reviews on here slating this film, to the point that I'm writing review which I seldom do. The comparisons with the 1974 Albert Finney version are by and large baffling. Yes, it had an excellent cast, but Albert Finney as Poirot was not one of them and was thoroughly annoying and far too shouty throughout. Brannagh in contrast offers us the Belgian detective in a much more measured way with a smooth combination of deduction, wit and measured anger when required. The cast of this version are largely excellent too and do not let the film down, and Johnny Depp exudes understated menace. Visually the movie is stunning and the way it is filmed is varied and original giving you the impression at times that you are eavesdropping and observing private conversations. Most watchers may well know the story but the suspense is still there nonetheless despite what other naysayers may contest. This was a cinematic delight, and all the more a pleasant surprise because I do know the story. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
can't blame the butler,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't love a good whodunit? Don't we all find a bit of guilty pleasure in being the mastermind who solves a fictitious murder case? Has anyone ever been better at crafting an intricate murder mystery than Agatha Christie? Why all the questions? Well, that's nothing compared to what ""probably the world's greatest detective"", Hercule Poirot, must answer amidst the foul play aboard the sleek, luxurious, and snowbound Orient Express.This latest film version has Michael Green (BLADE RUNNER 2049, LOGAN) with the adapted screenplay and Kenneth Branagh directing and starring as the fabulously mustachioed Poirot (with his own take on the iconic super-sleuth). Like the near-perfect 1974 version, this latest adaptation succeeds in capturing the theatricality, while avoiding any stodgy staginess. Director Branagh shot on film and it pays off in both the stunning snow-covered mountains and landscapes, as well as the tight, precisely-blocked interior shots around the exceptional set designs.Fans of the novel will notice some shifting of character names, professions and backgrounds, although the vast majority of the story remains intact  including the early murder that occurs not long after the film ingeniously introduces us to each of the characters. The cast is strong and deep, and in addition to Mr. Branagh, features: Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Dame Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Lucy Boynton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Olivia Coleman, Sergei Polunin, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. All are suspects – well, except the victim.If you haven't read the novel or seen a previous version, know that the fun is in ride. Follow along as Poirot dispenses zingers throughout, while maintaining a most precise commitment to balance in all things. He is an exacting and fastidious man, and as entertaining as he is skilled in crime solving. Note that the photograph he keeps of his one true love Katherine, is actually a photo of young Emma Thompson (Branagh's real life wife). Enjoy keeping track of the clues and hints, while also tracking the widely diverse personalities, excuses and alibis. Most of the many characters only have a couple of key scenes, and it's quite fun to see what these talented performers make of their moments. Daisy Ridley, Lucy Boynton and Derek Jacobi make the most of their time, while Penelope Cruz overplays hers. Other than Branagh, the star who shines the brightest is Michelle Pfeiffer (fresh off a killer performance in MOTHER!). She continues to remind us just how talented she is, and no, your ears aren't playing tricks  that's Ms. Pfeiffer singing ""Never Forget"" (lyrics by Branagh) as the closing credits roll.Ms. Christie's outstanding novel was first published in 1934, and is somewhat based on the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and her own train- riding adventure. It's a wonderful and perplexing read  one that will have you changing your mind multiple times on who you believe to be guilty of murder. There have been numerous movie versions over the years, and none have matched the excellence of director Sidney Lumet's 1974 film with an incredible all-star cast alongside Albert Finney's Poirot. Though this most recent movie doesn't reach the timelessness of that one, no movie can capture the detail and maze- like structure of the novel. It's still quite fun – and a true joy- to see the pages come to life (irony intended) on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kenneth Branagh's massive ego trip,"Awful movie where Kenneth Branagh self indulges himself at every turn. He clearly believes he is a great actor, but is in fact awful and unbelievable as Poirot.

Far more than the other renditions, this movie places you in the action very successfully on the Orient Express in a snow storm with an engaging group of people ranging from the always formidable Judi Dench to a sleazy Johnny Depp to a captivating Michelle Pfeiffer to an annoying Willem Dafoe, and much more.

Alternatively, the fact that the film succeeds in encompassing a broad spectrum of unique personas is accomplished ( and to some degree compensates for the somewhat lacklustre performances.The pacing was executed with the competency that rarely did I wish for MotOE to abandon it's investigative section and instead deliver it's concluding chapter.The picture also hosts s sequence of enthralling vistas throughout.Overall, MotOE is a somewhat accomplished film that ultimately I recommend you view.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A train wreck ruining a 1974 Classic,"If you have never seen the 1974 original..you may want to see this, may that is. If you HAVE seen the 1974 original, which I refer to as a CLASSIC, stay as far away as you can from any theater showing this waste of time. The original version, directed by the awesome Sidney Lumet and starring the brilliant Albert Finney (an Oscar nominee) as Poirot, was a masterful piece with great writing, directing and a cast that couldn't be beat!! And this new version, Directed by ego-magic Branagh, and starring a so-so cast, with some stellar actors, all being decimated by this production is downright tragic. From the opening piece, set in Istanbul which has nothing to do with anything, with regard to the plot, till it's exceptionally tedious laughable end, taking place in a tunnel in a snow covered mountain, you just won't believe your eyes.The 74 original showed the opening part of the mystery story, which foretold all, but here that investment comes way in the middle of the things, where it has no place, and after so much disinterest has already occurred. Branagh hams it up, takes all the scenes, gives no space for anyone else to breathe, let along give any type of performance, then appears to be almost clairvoyant, as he seems to figure everything out through thin air. Basically because he never has any legitimate conversation with any of the major characters to determine what happened and why. Oh yes, he's the mystic seer. Maybe stolen from a 1960 Twilight Zone episode. No, more he is ego-centric and arrogant Branagh who can't stand being out of the limelight. You're in the limelight now, Kenny....you screwed up a major production and were all laughing at you, not with you. Arrogance reignsThe use of totally unnecessary CGI is annoying and silly, the action scenes are dull, tedious, pointless, adding nothing to the plot. The plot, for what it is is convoluted. Never really explained. In the original we were given clues, had ideas, questions, we could follow along. Not here. It's as if they made this thinking EVERYONE knows all the answers, and so they skip numerous (and I mean numerous) plot points..but again, the mystic seer, with the most stupid looking and idiotic mustache in history, knows all. Watching this flick, you'll wish Poirot got knifed, instead of Mr Ratchett.Plot devices that all fail, where do I start, the opening wasted scene, Poirot measuring the size of his hard boiled eggs.(oh, please) A avalanche comes down and stops the train, but oh yes, only derailed the front engine, not the rest of the train, which it certainly would have done. People firing guns at each other, but why? Racial issues being brought up about skin colors and nationalities. And this is entertainment? What were these people thinking?To my knowledge Branagh is a Shakespeare lover, let me quote this..""How much did revile this film,let me count the ways"". I could go on, but I shall not.The 1974 version ran 127 minutes, this one runs 114 minutes and feel terminally longer. I squirmed and squirmed waiting for it to end. The music score, non-existent. Star turns, none to be found, excitement in the plot, 0. That about sums it up.I simply say this, with $$$ as tight as they are, we should only be subjected ourselves to worthy films, especially when they are overblown remarks. The 1974 original is avail on DVD and in the UK and foreign markets even in a nice blu-ray version. My suggestion, spend your money on that and do not support this type of overblown ego-driven dribble.Bye, bye Branagh, you made no friends with this tripe. You do not work much and it's understandable to see why. I read a UK review earlier that bashed this flick out of the World...good for them, they know junk when they see it. And now, so do I.For me, I'll stick with the original anyway. As a matter of fact, I'll go and watch it now and wash this toilet water taste from my mouth, and this film from my memory",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a train wreck you might've feared but it does run out of steam midway through,"One of the passengers on board the exquisite Orient Express is murdered, and only the legendary detective skills of Hercule Poirot can bring justice. Every face should be familiar as the phenomenal cast are put against Poirot's line of questioning.The biggest draw to this film is undoubtedly the cast. Each member gets their chance to shine from relative newcomers like Daisy Ridley to seasoned professionals in the shape of Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi. Meanwhile, the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Willem Defoe, Josh Gad and of course Kenneth Branagh mean you're never wanting for talent on the screen - the sumptuous 1930s costumes and set decorations also mean there's always something interesting to look at.As characters are introduced across the opening 30 minutes, it's interesting viewing until one of their fellow travellers is brutally stabbed in a frenzied attack. It'll be lazy to simply say it runs out of steam or comes off the tracks once the titular murder is committed, but there's no other way to describe the middle portion of the film.One by one, Poirot interrogates the passengers and begins to piece together what happened on the night of the slaying, but it feels more like the actors are being paraded to do their bit to camera and then promptly leave, rarely to be seen again. That said, it's fun for the audience to play along since nothing is confirmed or denied until the final act when the suspects are confronted by the detective. Without wanting to spoil the end (as I'm sure there are people, like me, who don't know the outcome in the book), the pay-off is ultimately worth the wait and even a little clever.This Agatha Christie adaptation is sure to be the first of a series which will see her moustached detective (hell, is he moustached!) solving cases all over the world. Indeed, the closing scene shows that they're planning for the famed Belgian sluice to go to Egypt next. If what follows is anything like this initial helping, it will be a nice alternative to the samey Marvel mush.Best Quote: ""Some men have a good look. All they have to do is keep their mouth shut and they can take home any prize they want. Still the mouth opens.""",,Anonymous,Mystery

Murder on the Orient express: Moustache magnificence,"Murder on the Orient Express is considered to be one of the greatest murder mystery stories out there. Agatha Christie's masterpiece has been adapted multiple times and it would only make sense that the king of making movies from classic works of literature Kenneth Branagh would take a roll at the material; this would be the only adaptation scene the 2001 Bollywood adaption and 43 years since the critically acclaimed adaptation in 1972 with Albert Finny. Who else should the reigns be given to then to Kenneth Branagh for such a great book?Murder on the Orient Express (2017) follows the famous inspector Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh with a ravishingly wonderful moustache) finishing up a case in Istanbul before taking a well deserved break on the one of a kind train the Orient Express, however while on the train shady business man Edward Ratchett gets brutally murdered and it is up to Poirot to solve what might be one of his greatest cases in his life. Because of spoilers I will not say more.When you take on a role that has been perfected according to some it can be a daunting task, it can be even an impossible on according to others but Kenneth Branagh takes the character and makes it his own. In this case Hercule Poirot is an obsessive compulsive who is able to detect what is wrong in the world and ""make it right..."" He is also more proactive in this version with him defending himself at certain points him the film. A change that has had some of the hardcore Christie fans cry in anger is the introduction of a past love interest for Poirot, I think it fits the film and the character Kenneth Branagh is portraying as, it also fits into the themes of order vs. chaos and grief. I also believe that Branagh disappears into the role of Poirot, his accent is more believable then any of the previous versions of the character and I just do not seen an actor playing a role I see Hercule Poirot.The other members of the cast are well chosen for their roles, Johnny Depp is scummy enough to be Ratchett in regards to his performance and Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant as the irrupting Ms Hubbard while insuring she never gets too annoying and remains sympathetic to the audience. There is also a rather interesting bit of casting with Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr) that adds the commentary of race relations in the 1930s, while it does get dangerously close to peachiness at times it works all the same, I would say the film is decently written if some of the dialogue is a bit blunt.The film very well shot and looks exceedingly beautiful, lots of soft blues and whites paint very breathtaking views of the mountains, the CGI does look a touch cartoonish especially on the wide outdoor shots of the city and the train, this makes it very jarring when the very next shot has the practical effects in full view. I wonder if a few more days refining the CGI would have made it less jarring.Some might consider this movie to be a pointless remake; I think that would depend on what you consider to be pointless in regards to remakes. I do think Murder on the Orient Express is not a pointless remake because it tackles different angles and makes itself unique enough to stand out unlike the Nightmare on Elm Street remake or the Carrie remake. I really enjoyed this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great cast, great trailer, great film","I was completely unfamiliar with the story of 'Murder on the Orient Express' going in. I had of course heard of it, however I had never read it, nor seen any of the previous film adaptions of it. I am very partial to a murder-mystery however, and so I was very excited for it. Adding to that excitement were a tremendous cast (including my main man Johnny Depp himself) and a trailer that blew me away. Now all the film had to do was live up to the hype I had created for it. Did it manage to? You bet it did.The thing that took me off-guard was that Johnny Depp was not only not the star of the film, he was actually playing one of the least interesting characters in the whole film. What also took me by surprise was how much I enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of the character of 'Hercule Poirot'. He was captivating to watch. He left me undoubtedly wanting more. I would happily welcome a follow-up film (which may or may not have been hinted at in the film).There's a lot of fun to be had in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. While it is a dialogue heavy film, it is exquisite dialogue. The amount of memorable quotes in this movie are far too plentiful to count. The twist at the end (which I'm assuming is the same as the source material?) was probably my least favourite part of the film, however it did make sense and I get it. Otherwise though this is a very hard film to find flaws in. Definitely a film not to missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sumptuously Produced. Technically Polished. Narratively Dull & Uninteresting.,"Furbished with polished attire, neat cinematography, star-studded ensemble & a moustache that overshadows everything, the second feature film adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel is a sumptuously produced mystery thriller that's narrated in a dull, uninspiring & uninteresting fashion.The story of Murder on the Orient Express follows the investigation that's set into motion when a passenger is found brutally murdered on the train. Handling the case is celebrated detective Hercule Poirot who deduces that the killer is still on board and tries to solve the mystery before the train reaches his destination.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the movie follows the book closely yet is unable to create moments of genuine interest & nail-biting tension. Characters are poorly written & thinly sketched. The only thing that stands out about Hercule Poirot is his moustache. And further bogging down the plot are its clichéd elements & lack of suspense.But the film is refined in technical aspects, at least to an extent. Its period setting is finely illustrated. Camerawork is crisp, the images retain their sharpness at all times, and also benefit from its apt use of colour palette & lighting. Editing is a misfire, for the story isn't tightly knitted and twists lack the element of surprise. And the background score is serviceable at best.Coming to the performances, Murder on the Orient Express packs an impressive ensemble in Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe & Johnny Depp, and they all chip in with forgettable inputs. Still, it's not entirely their fault, for they had paper-thin material to work with and while Branagh gets the most screen time, he fails to make the most of it.On an overall scale, Murder on the Orient Express is interesting in bits n pieces but for the most part, there is nothing about it that leaves a lasting impression. Script is the main culprit while Branagh's direction is missing the required creativity, and the sum of it results in an adaptation that's faithful yet mediocre & unstimulating. Casual moviegoers probably won't mind its shortcomings but it could've been so much more had it gotten everything right.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Thoroughly enjoyable but a very flawed film,"Let's start with the elephant in the room. If you were going to set up a remake of a Hercule Poirot film, you would not in a month of Sundays cast Kenneth Branagh as Poirot. Not just because he is nothing like David Suchet but because he is nothing like the character that Christie describes. In this film, Branagh simply dresses up in a moustache and thinks that makes him into Poirot. Unless he thinks he is setting up a brand new version of Poirot, but he doesn't even do that. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Branagh as an actor but his weakness is that he always plays himself somehow. I expect he was too busy trying to direct. Why on earth try to play the leading role and direct when there are perfectly good directors and far better actors for this part? Truth be said, this has all the hallmarks of a vanity project for Branagh. One suspects that Branagh cannot understand why everybody does not think he is the world's greatest actor and by directing admire him even more. Actually the film is rather well directed but more of this later.Now, the rest of the cast play their parts well and are clearly well directed. We see them clearly and we hear them clearly as they speak their lines to perfection. The film relies on it's plot and from this point of view it works really well. That said, the previous versions were also very good but certainly not better.The fight scenes were absolutely ridiculous and if any one thing pushed this film towards being a turkey, they did. Read the book Branagh and learn!!!!!Now of course this film was not meant to be ""realistic"" in any sense, and clearly the producers and director wanted to product a visually stunning tour-de-force. And stunning it is but in a very unrealistic way - it all looks a bit like a realistic cartoon. The special effects are brilliantly done but they are very very obvious. The bridge, the train in the snow and the station look totally artificial although as I say, very cleverly done. I have only to assume that this ""Hugo"" look is intentional.Now, I always comment on the cinematography. The 70mm film origination looks stunning especially in the effects-driven swooping shots of the train in the mountains. The camera motion on the train, especially considering the narrow corridors is top class and Haris ZambarlouKos must take credit for doing a great job here. I'm assuming the over use of shots looking down from the ceiling and the tracking shot early on of people walking through the train from the exterior were Branagh driven - they were unnecessary and irritating but some of us found them fun.Near the end of this film Poirot - well Branagh of course as he is nothing like Poirot, alludes to Death On The Nile. Let's hope that if they have a go at that one, they get a decent Poirot!BUT actually I thoroughly enjoyed this very deeply flawed film! Unlike a couple in the row in front.

Kenneth Branagh Brings Back The Mystery To The Orient Express,"Well, I have to say that I haven't watched the original movie, nor read the book, so I cannot tell if this is a good adaptation or which of the the two is better. Branagh is well know for adapting English literature classics into movies and I think he is really great at that.The movie tells us the story of Hercules Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who has to find out who is the murder that has killed a person inside the Orient Express. The story keeps you interested, its full of tension, suspense and even drama, and it surprises you at the end in a way I couldn't see coming (I won't spoil it).The cast is what you could call a Dream Team of the Actuation. You have Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, etc. All of them are great in their roles. They all have a little part in the story, but they all have little moments to shine (well, apart from Branagh that takes the main role).As a director, Branagh gives us some really interesting shots that are really beautiful to look at, even they were created in a studio. He creates longs shots where he likes to show is big ensemble cast by long panoramic of the train windows or inside the train. He is a usual collaborator with composer Patrick Doyle, who here creates a really beautiful score for the moments where it's needed, but also creates some really tense tracks that help build the tension a lot.I would recommend you this mainly because it does not happen that much that we have a cast as wonderful as this all together in the same screen and also because it's a really interesting and entertaining movie, a little bit different of all of the modern action blockbusters were are getting again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Death on the rail 6.5/10,"There's some outstanding points in this film namely1) Kenneth Branagh - his portrayal of the world's greatest Belgian detective is the best I've seen by far2) Cinematography- exceptional alpine backdrops . Hand-held camera-work was exceptional3) Casting - superb all star castBut then there's the points that weren't so goodSome of script / delivery of lines was unintelligibleSome of the CGI was brilliant but some was quite poor and at one point the train looked like a child's toy! Also it felt a bit like the Polar express at times and that's over twelve years old !Overall the film just could have been so much better it had all the ingredients , setting , cast , story but it failed to deliver a top notch performance. Shame really as I really looked forward to this and grudgingly paid the extra £4 for a reclining chair !It sets itself up for DEATH ON THE NILE - I just hope that's a better rendition .Pad.A 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Story Well Told,"This is one of those ""they don't make movies like this anymore"" films that I'm glad did get made. It's a simple story that is easy to follow and it is a story first and foremost. It's not one of those films where the protagonist attempts to dazzle you with his intellectual brilliance, or where he challenges you to a duel of wits. No. It is a process of discovery and the detective, throughout the story, keeps his cards open, letting you know as much as he does. I loved Kenneth Branagh's style of acting. When I found out Johnny Depp was in the film, I automatically assumed he had the leading role, but he didn't. I haven't seen Kenneth Branagh in any other film prior to this and I'm very pleasantly surprised. He managed to completely win me over. The character of Hercule Poirot is all about charm and elegance, and this actor managed to pull it off. In fact, he was the most believable of all the fictional characters on the train.I loved the atmosphere. Loved the choice of angles - to shoot lengthy scenes from the outside of the train, or to go full overhead like in a computer game. Everything about the movie I loved. Even though I've seen and heard the same story retold a dozen times I never get tired of it. This movie did it justice.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Politically Corrected Agatha Christie,"I watched the first 15 minutes of this film and realized that Branagh wanted to update Agatha Christie's nuanced and deep analysis of ethnics and ethical systems with a 'woke' version. I turned it off in disgust.After seeing that the film had achieved an IMDB score of 6.5 and made money, I thought I'd give it another look. I love Branagh as actor. Maybe I was wrong?I watched another 15 minutes somewhere in the middle. Branagh had cast a black actor in one of the roles. In the dialogue Poirot makes a point about the actor's race! What? Was Branagh's condescension and virtue signalling embarrassing for the actor? I cringed.A nuanced story was turned into a caricature of woke morality. Terrible. Branagh had the chutzpah to believe he could fix the story and make it right.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A missed opportunity,"After solving yet another mystery, the famous detective, Hercule Poirot, travels with the Orient Express to a distant location for his next case. What he's about to encounter is a deep mystery which involves a murder with many connections and apparently, a culprit which is hard to find. Together with a friend who happens to be the owner of the train, he must investigate, interrogate all passengers and find the killer before the train reaches the next station, while being derailed due to harsh, winter conditions.It's a remake of an adaptation of a famous book with the same name by Agatha Christie which presents a very strange case of a murder which will prove to be much complex and hard to solve than ever expected. What it originally seems to be another episode of Poirot slowly turns to something more deep, every character seeming to be a possible killer with a motive of his own. It keeps the mystery until the end, generating suspense along the way until the unexpected finale (at least if this is the first adaptation you see).Overall it's a good watch, especially if you're fond of this genre, but you may find a couple of issues or dislikes like I did, which somehow managed to spoil the overall experience. The worst of all was Poirot's character, with his over-prolonged or double mustache, which simply wasn't on par with the strong, perfect man which the famous detective accustomed us. He often seemed rushed and unconvincing, although the insisted on his perfectionist side, which is rather disappointing when considering his fame. Another bad aspect would be the fact that not all other characters seem to be as well described as they could or should, even seeming out of the picture at times, with too few scenes that would make them important in the conclusion. It left a sense of superficiality which is hard to miss in such films and as a result, the final product seemed to lack in this aspects.It's a good movie with Poirot but unfortunately nothing spectacular, contrary to its impressing cast. It could have been a lot better if it had a much credible and imposing main character and more attention paid to the characters and even the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Murder on the 'Mediocre' Express,"Movie Review: Murder on the Orient Express (2017)Director: Kenneth Branagh Studio: 20th Century Fox Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery Release: 2017 Run Time: 1 Hour 54 Minutes IMDb Rating: 6.8/10 Metacritic Score: 53/100 Rotten Tomatoe %: 58First Impressions –This film is the fourth adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, following the 1974 film, a 2001 made for TV movie and a 2010 episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot. I had a budget of $55 Million and features and all star cast.The Plot –The movie opens with the establishment of our detective who must solve the case of an artifact thief in Jerusalem. Soon after he is granted passage to his next destination on the famous Orient Express. However, during a troubling weather event, the train is stopped and a murder takes place. It is up to the detective to find out who is responsibly for the murder, and everyone is a suspect. The main problem with this movie is the problem that most movies that are adapted from novels or other literature have; it is severely missing details. Details that without we cannot become invested in various elements of the mystery and the entire film for that matter. The movie is well focused once the murder is discovered but without some important information that we as viewers are denied, it becomes difficult to understand at parts and throughout I couldn't help but question why I should care about certain things.Characters and Acting –While directing, Kenneth Branagh also stars as the main character; Hercule Poirot, a Belgian man who describes himself as ""Possibly the greatest detective in the world"". Branagh does a fine job playing the character and giving him a great identity but unfortunately that's where the interesting and stand out characters stop I'm afraid. It's almost a shame and a waste that this movie is jam packed full of talented and A-List actors but none of them shine whatsoever in their roles. They lack to convey anything interesting in the slightest, they have very little screen time between them and spend most of the movie staring outside of a train window. It's impossible to talk about the actors roles without spoilers but the A-List includes: Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Willem Dafoenot one of these actors give a necessarily bad performance but are incredibly under utilized to say the least. A big problem at the beginning of the movie and few times throughout was some of the line delivery was a tiny bit corny and silly, that being said the lines they were delivering didn't fit the context of a movie or a scene and it just felt as if they were reading some lines straight from the novel with little to no direction or context. It was incredibly distracting but only happened a few times with one or two B list actors.Film Techniques –This movie has some creative camera work and interesting shots that utilize the setting of a train well but can at times be distracting. For example, when one shot involves weaving through the windows outside a train whilst two characters are talking it comes difficult to focus on what is going o when you only see them for mini-seconds at a time while the rest of what you see fro that scene is just the metal of a train. The music is fine and the small amount of action is gripping enough; the movie uses a surprising amount of CG for it's set pieces and back grounds, it ranges from not half bad to clearly fake.Tones and Themes –The tone of the film is consistent and it shifts well from the serious mystery to a few light moments of humour here and there. The theme of the movie is justice, but it gets more complicated than that when some things unfold.Conclusion –This movie did it's job in keeping me intrigued throughout with it's mystery and entertained me enough to feel like satisfied with the performance of the main character but with it's lack luster usage of it's great cast and lack of overall detail, it didn't deliver on a memorable or intense enough murder mystery.Would I Recommend?

Decent Updating of the Agatha Christie Masterpeace is Not Quite as Mysterious as the 1974 Version,"It's difficult to improve upon the original ""Murder on the Orient Express"" film of 1974. Some aspects are slightly improved while others suffer. I give Branagh some credit for engaging in this project while simultaneously it seemed that a remake which is not as good as the original may have been ill-conceived. The original 1974 film is, by far, the best murder mystery ever shot. Sort of like remaking ""Star Wars IV: A Good Hope"". What's the point? Given there are many great Agatha Christie books which have not yet had large-screen treatment (the David Suchet series was meant for television), it seems Branagh could have chosen another one. And there are other large screen productions which could be greatly improved upon, such as the Peter Ustinov ""Death on the Nile"".A quick run down of the story. Hercule Poirot, vacationing in Istanbule, is called to take a case back in London. He is to board the Orient Express back to Western Europe. (The Orient Express is a luxury train which runs from Western Europe to the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Today it can cost as much as $1000+ per day.) All expenses paid, he ""runs into"" several of the quirky characters which are also taking the train. He can't secure a first class compartment right away because the train is full and has to settle for a second class cabin with a roommate.The train gets on its way, and Samuel Ratchett (Johnny Depp), a rather grumpy antiques dealer, asks for Poirot to take his case. He's been receiving death threats and desires Poirot to help him for $15,000, which would be a king's ransom in 1934, or about $275,000 in today's money. The next night, the train is moving through the snow-clad alps of Central Europe. Some strange things are happening near Poirot's compartment, such as someone who rings for the assistant conductor, and someone leaves another compartment, apparently a woman wearing a flowing dressing gown with a dragon emblazoned on the back.The next day, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his compartment. The son of the train owners, Bouc (Tom Bateman), pleads with Poirot to take the case to save the train from the disruption of a government investigation. At the same time, the train has hit an avalanche is unable to move forward. The Belgian sleuth reluctantly takes the case. Will he be able to solve the mystery before authorities arrive?I'll start with the good. Kenneth Branagh, given he will be inevitably compared to Albert Finney and David Suchet, arguably the two best Hercule Poirot's of all-time, makes for a memorable Belgian detective (not French). His performance as everyone's favorite European continental sleuth is definitely better than the choice of Peter Ustinov, who came off like a cross between Poirot, Nero and Mussorgsky in two Agatha Christie films in the 1970's. Branagh more or less pulls it off. His is not a Poirot which will win him any acting trophies (Finney was nominated for both an Academy Award and a BFTA Award for Best Actor for the same part in 1974), but it's definitely not the worst. The cinematography is also exceptional when paired with CGI makes for some spectacular scenes of the Austrian/Swiss alps. Depp is fairly good as Ratchett, and Wilem Dafoe makes a good Gerhard Hardman.The not so good. There was far more mystery in the original than in the present offering. The Daisy Armstrong case, loosely inspired by the Lindbergh Kidnapping case which was recent to the first edition of Christie's novel, was presented in the original with much more dynamic flair. Newsreel type footage shows the case at the beginning while in this offering, the case is revealed through what appear to be home movies.Some scenes were a bit melodramatic. I love Michelle Pfeiffer, but here her Mrs. Hubbard is not quite as interesting as her counterpart from the 1970's, Lauren Becall. Pfeiffer's Hubbard becomes over-the-top melodramatic towards the end while Becall's becomes the opposite when things are revealed. Again, a difficult act to follow. Judi Dench as the Russian Princess Dragomiroff didn't have much screen time. In the original, played by Wendy Hiller, Hiller almost steals the show, and keeps up strive for strive with Albert Finney. Even Sean Connery's famous scene in the 1974 film where he, as Colonel Arbuthnot says ""...are you suggesting that I'm fool enough to have entered Ratchett's cabin, murdered him, cleaned my 'peep', and dropped it into the ash tray on my way out?"" Sadly this line was absent from this new production. Unfortunately, I found the final solution less captivating than the original of 1974.Again, a decent one-watch, but it only made me long to see the original 1974 film. This film is good, make no mistake. But it didn't quite have the wit of the original. Strangely, this film was a bit humorless, save for an opening sequence (not in the book) where Poirot solves a crime in Instanbul. I found that sequence more compelling than a lot of other things in the rest of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"World famous, infallible detective Hercule Poirot is on the case.  Sit back and let him do all the thinking!","Murder on the Orient ExpressKenneth Branagh, DirectorOverheard during Previews of Coming Attractions: ""Well, I like Liam Neeson, but that looks stupid.""We feel ya, lady seated in the next row back. We like Kenneth Branagh, and Johnny Depp, and Judi Dench, and Willem Dafoe, and Michelle Pfeiffer, and Penelope Cruz (well, sorta), and Josh Gad and Derek Jacobibut this movie is stupid.OK. Maybe we're out of line to say such a thing about this lush production full of all these beautiful people. There were at least a couple of noteworthy elements to this 70mm spectacle: 1. Branagh's mesmerizing mustache and 2. that super cool avalanche.It probably is unjust to impugn a film when you're not the intended audience. And there was fair warning. We knew going in that it was an Agatha Christie murder mystery; that Hercule Poirot would treat us like Perry Mason treated our mothers back in the day – rudely! Condescendingly – as though they were in the room, but unworthy of a glance let alone intelligent participation.But we went to MOE anyway. The previews were just so pretty.Also, we grant that it's not reasonable to downgrade a movie that we slept through, even if we snoozed only a very few minutes, 10 at the most.But let's be clear:Hercule Poirot is not normal. Yes, yes, we know, that's the premise. He's extraordinary. By his own declaration, he's ""probably the greatest detective in the world."" But come on – nobody is that deductively gifted. Nobody.We wanted to set aside our disbelief, but we just couldn't. Maybe because he is so irritatingly smug as he plies his powers of observation; though admittedly Branagh in the role brings a more likable facet to Poirot, maybe when he gazes regretfully at the photo of his long-lost love, Katherine. (It's actually a pic of a young Emma Thompson, Branagh's ex!)And once, when he was rejecting the gangster Edward Ratchett's (Johnny Depp) request for Poirot's services as a body guard, did he seem to be acting on normal, believable human instincts.The rest of the time Poirot ricochets from suspect to suspect, exposing their most obscure inclinations and carefully secreted skeletons with barely a glimpse of their knuckles. He revealed Gerhard Hardman (Willem Dafoe) as a phony because of a misplaced accent on one syllable of one word! Lucky it had no impact on the plot.Hercule Poirot doesn't play nice. He has all the good clues and won't share them. His mode of operating is to spring them on us when it's most likely to make us, embodied in his shadow tag-along, feel dumb – less competent, less insightful – than HE is. We want to play along with the detective thing and feel at least dull-normal in our ability to track. But Poirot keeps all the real clues for himself, never giving the viewer a fair shot.Speaking of which: Too many red herrings! O.M.G! Every passenger has a perfectly good motive and opportunity. The ins and outs of the convoluted threads of the intertwined lives of the complex relationships and the improbable likelihood of their all having E- tickets on the same train on the same day, across this scary computer- generated landscape – well, it's more than an earnest crime solver can endure.The resolution is beyond implausible. Don't worry, we won't spoil it for you here, but rest assured, if you're a normal, investigation- loving, CSI-binge watching, Forensic Files geek, you will be so angry by the time you get to the Last Supper tableau in the finale, you'll want to turn on your cell phone right there in the theater and, and, and...what? Call your mother? Tell her what she already knows: All this exposition of the inexplicable (in reasonable, believable terms) makes a movie-goer want to spin around and explode.Perfectly good actors left us unmoved because even though MOE is a period piece, NOBODY ever thought those thoughts or plotted those plots or did those things. In this script their characters are useful only in delivering misdirection. So Golden Globe winner & Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer, as Mrs. Hubbard, is only to be avoided. Golden Globe & Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe, as Gerhard Hardman, barely rates a dismissive shrug. And Golden Globe & Oscar winner Judi Dench – Dame Judi! – whose glances can wither, seems bloodless and full of moth balls.Only Daisy Ridley, as Miss Mary Debenham, truly engages and challenges Poirot, and grips the audience with a true air of mystery.So, yeah. We probably weren't the intended audience and this is a biased review. This story, this movie, is of a time gone by. If you can still enjoy Sherlock Holmes talking down to sweet old Watson, you'll be fine. If you don't mind being treated as a lame second fiddle rather than a full on partner in solving the crime, well, this is the show for you. Have fun watching Poirot in action.For today's mystery fans and crime solvers, not so much.*********Six DegreesDaisy Ridley in Murder on the Orient Express 1.

A solid mystery with fatal flaws.,"Murder on the Orient Express is a very enjoyable and pleasant experience, even with its fatal flaws.Kenneth Branagh shines as the star and director. He simultaneously portrays Hercule Poirot, an amazing character you empathize with, and gives Agathe Christie's tale the cinematic treatment in an engaging way with style (having not read the novel). The cinematography, production and costume design, and music is also very good.While the ensemble supporting cast does very well with the very little they've been given (Michelle Pfeifer and Josh Gad being the stand-outs), the film could have benefited from adding an extra 15 minutes to flesh them out, to make the film's big reveal more effective, even if the ending was already emotional. Also, the film suffers from its inability to ""show, don't tell"", especially from a mystery. You aren't able to solve the mystery with Poirot, as the film instead uses flashbacks and exposition scenes.Murder on the Orient Express is a solid mystery that could've been much greater, but still a very pleasant and entertaining time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"If You Already Know The Ending, It Isn't As Good","As with any film centered around a mystery, there's a thrill in following the evidence, trying to figure out the whodunit and the how. If you go back to it afterward, you may find a new tidbit here or there, but the original thrill is gone.Such is the case with the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel.This is a beautiful film to look at, as are many modern films, and it is fun to immerse into the period of the 1930s, especially the details of the crime (which revolve around a case that is based on the real- life murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932), and the mystique of the Orient Express, for as one character muses, how fascinating it is to see a group of people with nothing in common but the shared need to go from one place to another, forced together, never to see each other again.The characters, too, are interesting portraits of the many types of personas familiar to the era, with the most stereotyped personified in director Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of detective Hercules Poirot. Like the critically acclaimed 1974 adaptation of Christie's novel, this film assembles an all-star cast to fill the roles of murder suspects, including Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, and more.The film expertly weaves the tapestry of the crime and the many, many red herrings that are left by the murderer, as well as Poirot's attempts to establish a motive to explain the crime. At each turn he finds links, but something eludes him until the grand reveal at the end.However, it's that grand reveal where the film can feel a bit lackluster, especially if one already knows how the story ends, for as best as I can tell, this film does not add an new twists or surprises to the original Christie story, and when the reveal finally happens, not only does it feel somewhat underwhelming because it seemed perfectly obvious all along, but the motivations is played without a sufficient amount of weight.That's not to say that the reveal wouldn't be powerful to someone unfamiliar with the particulars of the story, but for someone who is, this film's replay value is essentially nil.However, this film's brilliant performances and dry wit throughout makes this film enjoyable for anyone with a taste for mystery and wonderful theater, for this film feels more like a traditional play than a film, and it's the better for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Yet another PC bit of garbage pushing THE MESSAGE,"Not really a spoiler alert as I didn't, couldn't, get very far into it. See below. But on the meantime...Bad from the getgo so I didn't watch very far into it--couldn't stand yet more nauseating ways THE MESSAGE is being forced down our throats. I swear I thought it was Rey and Fin again, and close enough.We get to be bashed as whites with the insinuation that all we care about is race (as if all races aren't concerned equally with race) when one character makes bland comments about black and Hispanic co-travelers. Brannagh, of course, wisely chose his own character to be the ""good guy"" by making rude comments to the speaker. It was clearly a moment when Brannagh wanted every white person watching to cluck our tongues at the ""backward"" views held by everyone else, expecting that our eye-rolling would have been at the views held at the time as opposed to the distaste in our mouths at yet another white bashing.If it's true that Ratchett butchered the French language as badly as demonstrated, Poirot would not have failed to notice that he spoke perfect French through his cabin door after loud noises came from there and am attendant checked with him. We're supposed to believe this? It's been decades since I read an Agatha Christie mystery but I don't recall any such obvious flaws. Rather, I believe Brannagh, in his smug self-righteousness, must be trying to help all of us dumb white heathens and, apparently, dumb black and brown ones, too, by dumbing down the story.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Can't Hollywood do better than this nowadays?,"Kind of disappointing adaptation of a novel that has known better adaptations in the past. Why did Kenneth Branagh do this, when we already have such a superior Poirot in David Suchet? I suppose it's a way to give younger generations a way to approach Agatha Christie, but... what is it with Hollywood and period pieces? At times it reminded me of Robert Downey Jr's awful Sherlock Holmes movies. We get Poirot running after suspects, fighting, absurd chases, just for the sake of inserting action scenes where they don't belong... This is not what an Agatha Christie story is like. It's never credible or convincing as a period piece. No subtlety, no wit, just the usual Hollywood tics.The movie looks pretty, expect for the CGI, as excessive as unnecessary, which does not look real. It doesn't find a way to really profit from the large and talented cast. It's mostly Branagh's show. It would have done better with more real exterior shots and less blue screens.The investigation is perfunctory: a few quick conversations and Poirot has all the facts out of thin air. It's a difficult story to adapt as a movie, true, with the novel being a long series of suspect interviews that would not work on the screen. But still, it can be done better.I liked the ending, though, showcasing Poirot's moral dilemma in an emotional way.",,Anonymous,Mystery

For 2+ hours, I was not watching actors and sets, I was experiencing characters and locations. It felt like I was on the train. It felt a bit claustrophobic. It felt dangerous. It felt like there were so many lies it was hard to know which piece of evidence or statement was a fact.

Damn your Dickens,"Based on the Novel of the same name by Agatha Christie Murder on the Orient Express is directed and stars Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot a Belgian investigator who after a case in Jerusalem receives a letter for another job in London and takes a ride on the Luxurious Orient Express only for the train to get caught in an Avalanche and not only that but a man Played by Johnny Depp is Murdered in his cabin. Now with a hand full of suspects, Poirot Needs to find the murderer before the snow is cleared. Orient Express is by no means a great film and it's very basic, but that is around its charm. It is a traditional whodunnit story. You got the victim, the suspects, and your clues. Overall it captures the old school mystery style Reminiscence of Sherlock Holmes from the music, the setting has this classy feel to it. With an ensemble cast from William Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer. You get a diverse cast each of which makes for a possible candidate. With their unique personalities playing off one another. Kenneth Branagh does steal the spotlight his character Poirot just comes off really as very likable very upbeat yet he's professional his OCD factors are heavy in his job and his character there's always this balance and order that need to be there so how deduces. Though by the end he does start to question is that mentality always for the best. But when he gets down to business he savages. The cinematography is good tracking shots and the top view of the carts. The setting of the train seeing all the food and drinks makes for a great setting, but it's isolated. The only problem that someone could have with the movie is that it's not a thriller in the sense that there's not that much action it is much more focused on interrogations and investigation which can turn some off to the film. Overall a good movie with a good soundtrack and interesting plot if you are a fan of murder mysteries it's worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Totally Disappointing, Despite the Great Cast and Art Direction","""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a totally disappointing film, despite the great cast and art direction. The classic Agatha Christie´s novel and his detective Hercule Poiro never works in a boring screenplay with non-likable characters. Fans of Agatha Christie will certainly hate this forgettable version. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Assassinato no Expresso do Oriente"" (""Murder on the Orient Express"")",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ignore the negative reviews and watch it for yourself,"Despite the fact that I haven't watched the classical version(1974) of this movie, I can say that this ""remake"" is still good enough if not compared with the original version.
Even though whenever I see a movie that contains many famous people, i can automatically conclude that the movie is weak and the director used those actors to boost the revenue, but not with this movie.
The movie talks about murder that happens on a train that got blocked on railroad by snow and the detective on board tries to find the murderer. The movie was performed in a way that every 10min makes you suspect someone but then something happens and you change your mind again and suspect someone else.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not enough clues to solve the mystery,"I never read the book that this is based on or any of the previous movies or tv adaptions. This was my first experience with the famous title.Firstly, the cast are all great with special praise to Kenneth as the detective. He was just a joy to watch and seeing him spit rapid information when he starts to figure parts of the mystery out is a sight to see. I also really love the cinematography which was gorgeous.However, my big issue is the murder mystery itself. A good murder mystery film or show is one where we understand the suspects and the clues. This is so we as an audience can learn and deduce it ourselves while the detective is solving it. The problem is that there is 13 suspects and only a 114 minute run time to explore them. Unfortunately, the suspects all feel one note and forgettable, with me not even remotely remembering what their name was. Some clues are also a bit too vague and I never felt like I was provided enough information at times. It got ridiculous when the movie reaches the climax and there are suddenly a bombardment of revelations that seem to come out of left field.Nevertheless, it is still a fun mystery and there is definitely enjoyment to be had.

Flawed But Does Enough To Recharge the Whodunits,"2017's Murder on the Orient Express is far from perfect, but does enough to entertain aficionados of murder mysteries. Here, director, star and co-producer Kenneth Branagh dramatizes Agatha Christie's 1934 novel, injecting this adaptation with star-power, visual flavor and a lead character that effortlessly commands his every scene. Yes, Branagh's Hercule Poirot could be the fictional character's most interesting version, oozing with savviness and convincing mettle. His supreme level of rapport plus shifts between light-heartedness & intensity, ushers a perfectly balanced character worth the investment. Apart from Branagh's superb portrayal, MOTOE finds success from the gorgeousness of its everything. From the production, the imageries, the costumes & character aesthetics, Branagh captures the grandeur & luxury of the setting, with breathtaking landscapes as bonus.As for MOTOE shortcomings, Branagh's over indulgence over his lead character does come across, making for some awkward shows of intellect. This fixation of sorts as well hampers down the importance & actual involvement of Branagh's star-studded ensemble, leading to underutilized, one dimensional supporting characters whose relevance are questionable. Apart from Branagh's propensities, the investigation over the murder scene was less than captivating, unfolding in mechanical fashion rather than through incremental, suspense-rich discoveries. These revelations then feel disjointed, and a tad convoluted.Overall, Murder on the Orient Express sees Branagh shake-off a mediocre screenplay, delivering a sophisticated character and a well produced & investing mystery, that reinvigorates the whodunit genre. This movie deserves appreciation for this particular achievement alone despite its struggles for substance.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's not irrefutably good, it's not at all bad and it certainly isn't ugly","The first time I saw this movie, it didn't feel like the typical movie I'd see at the time. It wasn't made up of chunks of expositions, emotional build ups and eventual final fights and payoffs of Disney, Star Wars or Marvel movies that you could watch, review and then forget a couple of days later.Now that's not so say it was so groundbreaking and awe-inspiring that I couldn't think of mere limiting words to describe it, only that there was something to it that despite its forgettable nature and mostly mediocre presence I sort of liked it.A couple of days ago I got to watch the movie for perhaps the 4th time and I noticed how it was as if every time I saw this movie I appreciated it more.Especially the big moment of the third and final act of the movie drew me in with how consistently captivating the entire sequence was and it was there that I learnt how effective great pacing and direction can be for a story's experience.This movie may not be flawlessly written, it may not include performances more nuanced than the plot required and you could deduce that this feature will fall short in comparison to the source material even if you haven't read it, however, the movie certainly has an excellent crispness that compels you to watch it till the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tom Bates is one of my all time favourite actors and he plays a very funny and charming character which from his introduction onwards I realised what a joy ride this movie would be, and I was correct because that's exactly what it was like. The only reason that I can't give Murder on the orient express a 9 or 10 is because I just can not remember the names of these 30's characters + there is so much story for each character linking to a murder that I am not sure what the killers motivation was because I completely forgot lol, but the reason such a big problem like that doesn't ruin the film is because of a revolation that unfolds which I can not discuss as it would then become a spoiler filled review which would completely ruin the experience.

Embarassing,"I have just watched this on TV and felt compelled to share my feelings of embarassment and some strange shame for having watched it until the end. I kept wondering if it was me being difficult, not getting into it, but the user reviews turned out to be very reassuring. Yes fellow reviewers, I make mine most of your statements and perceptions - this film was lame, so unbelievably dull. The cinematography and the CGI were so poor that I genuinely wondered if they were testing a new genre (I didn't want to believe that it was just bad, I mean *that* bad) topped by an irritating cheesy soundtrack, which gets increasingly unbearable towards the end. One can't take Kenneth Branagh's past contributions to filmmaking for granted nor remember him as a respectable actor/director after watching this. His narcisism was utterly disappointing - by making this about his ""performance"", not only he has ruined Agatha Christie's classic but has made anyone else's acting pathetic. It felt like he was trying to be the Indiana Jones' version of Poirot without the character's wit (but if anything, without Harrison Ford's charisma). This is truly regrettable for the stellar cast, but that's hollywood so let's not worry about their embarassment, usually well compensated by the cash. Far more worrying is the fact that this kind of thing makes its way to the theaters and the audience pays $15 with no refund or compensation for the 1h50 lost in their life.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Solid Performances, Light on Thrills,","Murder on the Orient Express is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. The set pieces are absolutely devine, and the film manages to pull off what did not seem like a simple task, having the majority of it take place on a train. Kenneth Branagh does a very impressive job directing this, and also shines as Hecule Poirot, his mannerisms and movements are completely unlike himself and he is truly immersed in to this character. Branagh is also joined by a terrific supporting cast that includes Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and Willem Dafoe, among many other big names.I did find that the film was light on thrills and did not deliver the potential this story had as well as it could have. It gets so carried away on landscape and cinematography that it forgets to engage and immerse us in to this story that should have had me at the edge of my seat waiting to find out the killer, instead of waiting for them to just get to the punchline.As well as that, they did not take enough advantage of their fantastic cast. The likes of Judi Dench and Johnny Depp are wasted in this movie, playing characters that are given no scope, and they get nothing to do. I understand that Branagh wanted a star studded cast, but a lot of these characters simply are not given enough to do, leaving Oscar calibre performers in the gutter.Has its moments, but not enough of them. Murder on the Orient Express certainly thinks it is a lot more exciting than it is, worth a look if you are a fan of the novel, but if you are looking to be thrilled, you have many, far better options.A detective must try and solve the murder of a wealthy gentleman aboard a train with many suspects.Best Performance: Kenneth Branagh",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

a heavyweight cast that's given little to work with,"A hollow, high-profile treatment of the Agatha Christie whodunit set in the mid-1930s about Hercule Poirot, a Belgian incarnation of Sherlock Holmes who may or may not be the world's greatest detective, and his attempts to solve a murder case while aboard the Orient Express. Lead actor and director Branagh seems to be overdoing it a bit, recruiting a star-studded cast who are unfortunately used to just show up and be recognized, rather than actually employ their acting abilities. Despite good scenery, a vivid sense of time and place, and the multitude of colorful characters, there's little in the way of suspense or intrigue, two elements sorely needed for a film like this to really succeed. Watchable, but fails to provide a truly satisfying payoff. **",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Solid scenery and acting, languid pacing","They just don't make movies like this anymore, and I am glad someone decided to make this.  The newest film version of the Agatha Christie classic murder mystery MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is a throwback to an earlier age of movie making - lavish costumes and scenery, a slow- ish moving plot and good scenery chewing scenes acted by an All-Star cast giving everything they got.Credit Director and star Kenneth Branagh for bringing this old chestnut to the screen.  Clearly, Branagh, wanted to bring old fashioned movie-making along with modern CGI to bring this twisted story of murder to the screen - and he (largely) succeeds.  The scenery, costumes and sets are lavish to look at (which is why I would recommend you see this on the big screen) and Branagh's acting take on one of Christie's iconic detectives, Hercule Poirot, is fun and engaging, with a mustache that goes on for days.But, it is the All-Star cast that will bring (and keep) you in the theater - and they deliver (for the most part).  Michelle Pfeiffer proves that she still has it, Daisy Ridley is showing that she is more than just a ""Jedi"", Willem Dafoe continues a late career resurgence, Dame Judy Dench is...well...Dame Judy Dench and Derek Jacobi, Penelope Cruz and Lesley Odom, Jr and Josh Gad all have their moments.  But, the ""surprise"" for me of the bunch was Johnny Depp.  He was just about the strongest part of this film (acting-wise) in a part that is ""normal"", gone are the quirks and kinks of hiding under layers of make-up for the Pirates (and other) films.  He just, plain ACTS and he does it well.Is it a perfect film?  Well, no.  It unfolds VERY slowly.  Branagh lingers his camera on the sets, scenery and costumes and lets the acting unfold as organically as it can be.  As a result, I heard more than 1 person snoring during parts of this film in the theater I was in.So, grab some caffeine, and enjoy an old-fashioned murder mystery.  It's worth the journey.Letter Grade:  B (""A"" for acting, scenery, costumes), (""C"" for pace)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Okay - Decent movie,"I wouldn't say that this movie is some cinematic masterpiece. The cast is amazing with a list of award winning actors and actresses known for incredible performances; I expected something much different than what was delivered in this film.The beginning was great. It started out on a high note with some decent humor and action. Unfortunately as it packs on the mystery, what works on paper starts to play out a little awkward.

It's not that bad.,"I really don't understand the brutal hate for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be?

Yes, it does deviate from the book a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think it made it worse that much worse. Not in line with the one star reviews that I'm seeing. I think with everyone book adaptation you have to take into account just that - it's an adaptation - it's not the book retold, but the directors spin on the story.

A better film than others running in the theaters right now,"Kenneth Branagh is a great artist and his interpretation of Agatha Christie's famous detective is more than passable. This is a great looking film and the actor's presence alone gives it an old school charm. Perhaps the most welcome thing about Murder on the Orient Express is the big-budget foray into a genre that motion pictures have all-but-forgotten: the classic murder mystery. The film isn't too long to wear out its welcome and there's something impressive about being surrounded by such impeccable detail and so many familiar faces. Although the film will work considerably better for newcomers to the story, there's enough here to appeal to veterans. And, although Branagh is no Suchet, he's good enough for us to accept him, if for only two hours, as one of Agatha Christie's two celebrated detectives. Just for not being a superhero or other CGI laden half assed effort I suggest you go and watch Kenneth Branagh's Murder on Orient Express.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A film adaptation of a classic that won't become a classic,"""My name is Hercule Poirot and I am probably the greatest detective in the world.""Voila. We Belgians can also be proud of the Hercule Poirot phenomenon in addition to our world-famous beers and chocolate. Probably the best detective in the world. And yes, he comes from this tiny country in Europe. The fact he's actually a fictional person created by Agatha Christie, we forget for a moment. This vain, anything but modest, equiped with an enormous moustache, ingenious Belgian detective has already been played by a whole series of actors. But for me it's David Suchet who lived up the most to the image of Poirot.What should you do when making a film of a world-famous book by Agatha Christie and you know in advance that a large part of the audience knows the story and the ending already? Well, the best thing you do is to gather a star cast and using the necessary digital magic tricks to ensure a wow effect. Whether this is sufficient for most moviegoers is a question for me to know and for you to find out. However, I wasn't that impressed. Ok, the first bird's eye views of a Orient Express cutting through the landscape and those swirling camera movements in the snow, look breathtaking. But that's obviously not interesting enough.So, after the introduction of Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), who got an overwhelming mustache, one can calmly reel off the list of familiar faces. And those are certainly not the least. Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michele Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Colman and Leslie Odom Jr. are introduced one by one. And then we just have to wait for the train to set of and someone is killed, after which Poirot can start sniffing around for the killer. Fortunately for him, a fresh avalanche causes a delay in such a way that he can unravel the exciting mystery before the authorities arrive.Exciting? Well, not for me at least. I've never been a big fan of classic detective stories like those of Sherlock Holmes and consorts. I always thought it's a bit stiff and not really entertaining. Or it must be such a beautiful film as ""Mr. Holmes ""where the retired detective tries to solve a final case at a leisurely pace, before his memory completely abandons him. In ""Murder on the Orient Express"" there is no sluggish pace, because all suspects on the train must be analyzed by Poirot and provided with a solid motive. And all in just under two hours. That is a lot to show in such a short time frame. The intro, the introductions, the murder, the investigation and then the announcement of the perpetrator. And all this interspersed with stylized images of both the interior and the exterior. It sometimes felt rather hasty.Perhaps you've lived under a rock and never heard of Agatha Christie and this world-famous story. In that case you should definitely give this movie a chance. Is it worthwhile for the others to take the trip to the cinema? Well, if you want to admire the general splendour of the Orient Express, then you definitely should do this. And furthermore, the grotesque, oversized mustache of Branagh will certainly leave an impression. For me they can come up with an extra category for the Oscar award ceremony. That of ""Oversized decor pieces""!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Agatha would be aghast,"Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (following adaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting it mildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam even before the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- star cast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even with the latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turns out to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literary crime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famous character is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feet in horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance.Shot on 65mm film, aerial vistas of a train trudging through the Alps sure looks pretty. The production design also boasts of lavish set pieces, plush backdrops, and costumes tailored to that era. But really, all we want is an old fashioned murder mystery. Perhaps an amazing display of deductive reasoning before arriving at a twist ending? Surely, that isn't too much to ask. Add the mouthwatering cast in a plot that thickens into one of the most ingenious yet baffling cases penned by Christie and we have a first class whodunit in this day and age of cinema. But as it turns out, this was indeed asking for too much. Like the bloodied victim, something dies very early in the film. And that's before the story starts juggling the remaining 12 suspects into the 12 agonizing labours of Hercules. Or was it Hercule? Either way, Agatha would be aghast.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm a sucker for good old corny detective movies,"The movie is fine, but it's just that, which is a disappointment given the fact that so many amazing actors are in there.I wondered for a while, about why it doesn't live up to it's potential, and I think it lacks direction. It's almost as if the actors were given the script on the spot, with no preparation, and they just read the lines to the camera. Absolutely no nuance to their expression. The movie tries to have this whimsical quirky quality, but it just comes out as if it's faking it, instead of the characters believing that's the world they're in, like high school acting or sth. And this is surely the directors fault, because I've absolutely seen each and every one of those actors do stellar performances.If you're a sucker for a bit of fun escapism, this is the movie for you. It does think too highly of itself a few times, but you surely won't die of cringe from it, so it's a safe bet on a night that you want to waste a bit of time or to ease you into sleep.I'm giving it a 7, because it's a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, but the film snobs would probably give it like 5 or 6, and they'll probably be right, so keep that in mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Terrible remake,"I love this story and I was really looking forward to the remake. With all of today's technology and the real life location shots, I was expecting spectacular.

Also left out was some of the logic leading to the solution. They could have made a splendid movie with all the great scenery, CGI, etc., without changing the actual story. Poor Agatha, must be having fits.In addition, even though they had splendid actors, only Daisy Ridley and Johnny Depp gave worthy performances. All of the rest were unconvincing, even Branagh.Then the topper.. the last scene has a officer coming to get Poirot to ask him to go to Egypt to solve a murder on the Nile. What is the world???

But when you waste a cast of such tremendous actors like Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Willem Dafoe it is destined to end up in a disappointment. I also do not try to compare it to the nearly flawless original of 1974 but if I did and see where the other one succeeded and which this remake failed it comes to one big thing: The fantastic investigation and interrogation scenes, which were here rather shallow and unimpressive. But to sum up the good things: Cinematography was fantastic. The images we got were outstanding and unforgettable. It created a nice atmosphere. I did like the score, even if it was a bit inconstant at times. The Production Design and general look were extremely satisfying. Some of the acting was good too. Kenneth Branagh for instance did a great performance as Hercule Poirot and perfectly nailed that character. I would not mind to see him revisiting that roe in the future again. Michelle Pfeiffer was great and the only time when I say one of the cast was better than its original counterpart. Johnny Depp held himself very well. No complains about him. Penelope Cruz was fine, but she is no Ingrid Bergman. Judi Dench was wasted but I did enjoy her scenes. Daisy Ridley also showed some versatility and I always like Willem Dafoe doing Germans accents. So yeah no complaints about the cast itself, just about the material some of them were given. Sometimes I felt they were given the most emphasize on Branagh' schnauzer than on the characters, who actually are what makes the story interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Semi-successful but visually impressive.,"When I first heard of this new adaptation, there were two things that came up to me: why do we need an another take on the world's most famous murder case after two successful adaptations, and why in god's name Branagh wants to put himself in the shoes of David Suchet, THE Poirot incarnation in most people's minds. It's a losing battle almost by default, like comparing the bland Kate Middleton to the glamorous superstar that was Lady Diana. But anyway, I decided to give the poor guy a chance to impress me and maybe,do a decent job. This proved to be a false hope from the moment I was confronted with that monstrosity right in the middle of his face, which was so distracting that you couldn't concentrate on the talking whenever his face was in focus, which is quite often. Here, he's trying to solve a murder case in a compartment of the luxurious transcontinental train Orient Express, and each and every one of the title characters seem to have a motif for murder.There are-to be fair-a couple of novelties Branagh brought to the character and the film itself- his version of Poirot (while equally impeccably dressed), has a sense of humour that Suchet was lacking, which occasionally borders on slapstick. The opening plot is completely irrelevant for the main story save for the fact that it was obviously used merely as an excuse to enchant us with Poirot's little petty obsessions and his little gray zellz. Also, in the breakfast scenes we can see Branagh visibly enjoying the role which reassures the viewer that this movie just might be worth the while. The new Poirot is also much more romantic than his predecessor and not afraid to show it (if talking to a photo qualifies as affection). Ultimately, the new sleuth is in a much better shape and doesn't need Hastings to chase a suspect down a dangerously fragile railway bridge. But. Branagh (doing double-duty both as the main character and director) assembled a whole galaxy of superstars to embody the suspects (in the former version, only Jessica Chastain was a known name). What works great on paper proved tricky on film, since there are too many suspects for the director to give each one enough screen time to seduce us with their personalities.Instead, we get just a taste of the immense talent with which the famous train is loaded, and many act merely as prototypes instead as full-fledged characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer uses every opportunity to shine as the flirtatious Mrs Hubbard, someone as charismatic as Judi Dench is reduced to a grumpy princess Dragomiroff who isn't doing a lot of talking but alas, a lot of dog-fondling. This might just be the single biggest issue of this reiteration of Agatha Christie's novel: all those A-list actors are underemployed in the whole scheme of the script. Johnny Depp, of course, plays the shady victim, and Penelope Cruz doesn't really impress as Pilar Estravados, a character borrowed from ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". There are some factual misinterpretations: Vinkovci, in Yugoslavia, where the murder takes place, is in the continental part of the country which happens to be as flat as a chess board, and the scenery in the movie rather resembles the Alps.Other than that, the redeeming qualities of the whole undertaking are the gloriously executed production design: the glamorous Art Deco interiors, the stylish costumes and the breathtaking panoramic vistas of the surrounding scenery. Details from the train are the icing on this semi-successful cake: the table settings, the white tablecloths and decorative lights, the lavish armchairs and the delicious desserts delivered by waiters in white suits. If there's one thing you'll take away from all this, no matter if you liked the film or not, it will be the urge to take a train ride to anywhere at the earliest opportunity. And that might be a success in itself.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fabulous acting and shooting!,"I've come late to the game with this story! Having not seen the original movie or read the book, I cannot attest to how this movie matches up by comparison.

I really cannot say enough good things about this movie! The actors were believable and charming. The shooting was interesting and clever.

"Agatha Christie, 21st century style","It sounds like a fun idea. Take a classic Agatha Christie-story which has last been made into a film more than forty years ago, put together an ensemble cast with a mix of Hollywood stars and British stage actors, and see what 21st century film making can add to that.As for that 21st century treatment: computer generated effects can certainly spice up even a traditional film like 'Murder on the Orient Express'. I was impressed by the images of the steam train moving through Istanbul as it must have looked in the 1930's. Or by the scenes in which an avalanche descends from high up in the mountains on the fast moving train in the valley below.Another modern element that director Kenneth Branagh touches upon very briefly, is the interesting question if our criminal law system is morally just. It's a pity that the screenplay doesn't give this subject more than a few remarks, because it could have added an extra dimension to this traditional film.Apart from this, the film is what you'd expect it to be. The cinematography is breathtaking: everything looks picture perfect, from early 20th century Jerusalem to the high mountains where the train gets stuck. The stars do what they are supposed to do, but in a film like this the emphasis is more on the story and the claustrophobic setting than on the acting performances. It is a pity that great actors like Judy Dench and Derek Jacobi don't get more screen time, but that is the consequence of an ensemble cast. It was nice, though, to see that Michelle Pfeiffer is still going strong. It had been a while since she was cast in a major big budget production.Of course, the screenplay demands a rather considerable suspension of disbelief. Some story elements seem to come out of the blue, and viewers have to keep very concentrated in order not to miss some detail that is essential for the crime solving process. But that's not unusual in a screen adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel.'Murder on the Orient Express' is nice entertainment, and it is good to see that Hollywood is still willing to invest considerable budgets in this kind of traditional film. But this is not a movie that will surprise the viewer.After having seen this film, there is only one mystery to be solved: will Branagh take on 'Death on the Nile' as a follow up project, as the last scene of 'Murder' suggests?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very poor adaptation,"There are any number of unforgivable changes. The plot has been changed unnecessarily if not ultimately in any very material way, mostly it would seem to add drama, but in ways which wouldn't be needed if room had been given to more realistic and nuanced performances. The characterisation of Poirot himself is caricature to the point of pantomime. Christie's restrained and effective dialogue is almost all thrown out and replaced with bloated melodrama.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best films of 2017 !,"First of all this review comes from a guy who haven't seen the original film and I'm actually very happy that I didn't, I've seen and read most of the people reviews and the one thing they had in common that the remake of this film was unnecessary and I think that's just the most stupid thing I've heard, every film that have a remake people just to seem to hate even before watching the film and that's really just summes up the ignorant of that person.From the novel by Agatha Christie, Murder On The Orient Express is about a man tries to solve a murder that happened in a train voyage with thirteen people on board and everyone is a suspect due to an unknown murder that happened at night.I just LOVED everything and every bit of this film, it's just was amazingly director, one of the best performance I've seen this year, the way the story was delivered was just genius with a great cinematography that was simple yet breathtaking and of course a fantastic score by Patrick Doyle that fitted the film perfectly. Mr. Kenneth Branagh, I really don't know by which way or how to praise a genius that he is and also don't know what exactly do I praise him about, is it his direction of the film and the fact that he director a wonderful looking film with great cinematography or do I praise his acting performance which is THE BEST I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR ! I really don't often praise films like that and I'm the kind of person that looks deep in any film just to see any misconceptions or flaws and I really was searching in this one but I really didn't see any ! Yes I waited for the film for about 5 months but honestly speaking I really forgot about the film.I don't recall many films that I've seen and didn't see or faced any problems or flaws with, this film was just Perfect, the fact how funny it was or the fact that the film looked great in a big screen or the soundtrack that made most of the scenes made more sense and very emotional especially at the ending !If I'm going to describe the film to anyone I really have only one word for he/she and the word is: Perfection.I really wish that the academy awards appreciate this film and especially to at least nominate Kenneth Branagh FOR AN Oscar !Overall: One of the best films I've seen this year and nearly as THE best film, Murder On The Orient Express in opinion was just wonderful, beautiful, funny, sentimental and as I said I rarely compliment any film as I've done for this one and it's just simply because the film was perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I did wonder why they chose to make it and would have rather seen a different story used. I think that this movie is aimed at drawing new viewers instead of pleasing old ones.

Very disappointing,"I just watched this new version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" last night and was very disappointed in it. As an avid fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot, I noticed that there were quite a few things things that were not quite right. First, foremost and most noticible was the appearance of Hercule Poirot. The moustache was all wrong and the real Poirot had no chin hair at all. Also, his manerisms were quite a bit off. The story line and some of the characters had been altered. The Kenneth Brannagh version of this movie was not a very good depiction of the original story. I doubt that I will ever watch this version again. I can only hope that the new version of ""Death on the Nile"" will be more true to form. Sorry but there is really only one great Poirot actor.....David Suchet IS Poirot!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A surprising success,"The film ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has been remade many times; the same story; the same setting; the same suspects, and this new installation in the 'remakes' of this film features an amazing lineup of cast members including Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh and Johnny Depp. The film was directed by Kenneth Branagh himself, who also stars as the world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot, and was written by Michael Green who released three majorly successful films this year alone, in ""Blade Runner: 2049"", ""Logan"", and ""Alien Covenant"".The film follows ""the best detective in the world"", Hercule Poirot, who must solve a sudden murder on the famous train, the orient express, with a wide range of suspects, motives and means. Kenneth Branagh gives his performance of Hercule Poirot, an intelligent (seemingly) OCD detective who separates right from wrong and serves justice to those via his deductive reasoning and ""little grey cells"", which is fantastic despite the shrub growing off his face (which eventually passes as unnoticeable). In fact, ""The Murder on the Orient Express"" emits spectacular performances from all cast members, who all manage to extract perfectly dramatic and interesting performances at appropriate times - particularly Josh Gad, who also starred as Olaf in ""Frozen"", who gave a great performance as Hector MacQueen. The script employs few physical action scenes, some of which are poorly choreographed or illogical, but supplies ample psychological action which is dramatic, bold and exciting. Set in a winter wonderland, the atmosphere is sufficient for this perfect crime which will entangle minds, including the great Hercule Poirot himself. The film is a great Agatha Christie adaptation which will suit audiences of all ages and preferences, and will not disappoint, despite trailer expectations.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Branagh delivers on remaking a classic,"Another example of Hollywood trying to regenerate success through a remake, Kenneth Branagh directed and starred in 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Although it opened to little fanfare, the film boasts an all-star cast and has a lot to offer audiences who've been waiting for a whodunit thriller to come along.On the surface, 'Express' is a sophisticatedly simple mystery that follows the world's greatest detective, straight talking Hercule Poirot (Branagh), as he takes an international steam engine from Istanbul en route to London to investigate a murder. While onboard the train, a number of things happen as Poirot meets many interesting people who appear to be cut from different cloths. But it's something rather shocking that puts the brakes on the extravagant trip (as the title suggests).The best aspect of 'Express' is without a doubt the plot. There are enough twists and turns to keep your attention, and it's fair to say the reveal at the end is one that's hard to see coming. But the cast comes in a close second, as we get to see strong performances from everyone from Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. But veteran actors really steal the show, including Dame Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and the aforementioned Branagh - there's really nothing to complain about - or find fault in. And it would be remiss not to acknowledge the amazing cinematography. From sweeping views of cities and landscapes to the use of the close quarters on the Orient Express, the camera work is worth noting.Sure, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is a remake, and as such it must overcome the challenge of not being the original. But Branagh manages to deliver in a genre that doesn't get much attention anymore.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"for those who have watched Sydney Lumet's 1974 version, this redux can only eat humble pie","For the sheer grandeur of its production design, Kenneth Branagh's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS reboot is something should be fully appreciated on the silver screen, shot in 65mm film (a rara avis today), the period setting which it punctiliously re-enacts is a fetching treatment for a sore eye (although it would soon give way to a single-location detective procedurals when the train is halted on a truss by an avalanche amid the white wilderness), but for those who have watched Sydney Lumet's 1974 version, this redux can only eat humble pie, both in regard to its structural design and the central interpretation of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian gumshoe Hercule Poirot.For starters, the murder mystery is almost exactly the same as its antecedent, whether it is due to the hallowed reverence to its source material or screenwriter Michael Green's incapability to ginger up the whodunit scenario, clearly and dishearteningly, slavish safety is the keynote to adhere when it comes to remakes, why bother if there is no substantial upgrade in the making? A transposition to 21st century would be a nice idea for instance.Perhaps, just to gather a star-studded cast can justify its own existence, with Branagh's gonzo- moustachioed Poirot hogging the spotlight, who is even granted a tepid prologue comes about in the Wailing Wall to introduce his fastidious quirks, and Branagh infuses an edgier temperament into Poirot's no-grey-zone presence of mind, but the over-familiarity of Sherlock Holmes is a dangerous sign of losing the detective's own distinction (since the Nile-cruising sequel has already been green-lit), also his underdeveloped omniscience begins to tell when magically, he gets the hang of everyone's carefully concealed identities, bearing in mind it is a time before Google, everyone!Approximately 10 minutes is fairly doled out to each of the rest core members of the cast, where most of the sequences are commonplace shot-reverse-shots and red-herrings are dished up, save some innovative camera arrangements either looking from the ceiling or outside the train. But despite the embarrassment of starry richness, only Michelle Pfeiffer's widow Caroline Hubbard (channeling some more soft-headed levity against Lauren Bacall's stern predecessor), manages to steal some thunder in the reveal, plus lending her exquisite voice in the song ""NEVER FORGET"" over the end credits.The biggest artistic license is needless to say, the gorgeous THE LAST SUPPER tableaux vivants when Poirot pompously solves the puzzle, we must hand it to Branagh for the flourish, only pitifully it is also at the expense of the film's own plausibility, because the whole act conspicuously reminds us, as if there were no other passengers on the supposedly fully-booked Orient Express other than those circumspectly postured suspects, or rather, alluding to a more dismayingly insidious note, that the class stratification has completely forbidden those in the less fancy coaches to even disembark the train whereas those privileged few are allowed to step out of harm's way in face of their final judgement, this really stings.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fun But Flawed,"Who doesn't love a good mystery? Murder on the Orient Express is one of the most famous mystery novels of all time, written by Agatha Christie, and now has two big screen adaptations. The first, made in 1974, was critically acclaimed and featured some of the greatest actors at that time. The second, released this weekend, features another fantastic ensemble cast, and manages to be a serviceable crime-mystery-thriller, if not as exciting or shocking as some would hope.Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as Hercule Poirot, the ""greatest detective in the world"". While the rest of the film consists the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr, Lucy Boynton, and Daisy Ridley. Safe to say, it's one of the best ensembles any film has ever compiled, and truthfully, they actually do a great job of giving each actor a scene here or there to show their talent. At the very least, I found it nice to have such a famous cast because it's nowhere near as obvious who is at fault when it could be any one of these award winning actors and you would believe it.I think where the film struggles is its script. The problem is with the way the film is constructed. It's very difficult to put together a good mystery, I can acknowledge that. But having the background of the characters pretty much laid out in front of you within the first half of the movie, raises an eyebrow before an eyebrow is supposed to be raised. Of course, I can't get into the major specifics without spoiling the surprises, because there are definitely some surprises. I just found the way the film was written to be interesting and not the way I would have gone about things. I guess my point is, less is more when it comes to revealing things.Branagh brings the most out of the script that he can, even considering the enormously difficult task of balancing serious subject matter with quippy humor. That part of the film is impressive, as is the cinematography and production design. There are mind blowing long shots taking you through the train that bring you right into the Orient Express as if you're just another passenger. Surely, the production design will get a strong Oscar consideration, even if the overall film is a bit of a letdown in terms of award hopefuls.Murder on the Orient Express is far from a perfect film, and can be a bit of a mess in some sequences, but it's an enjoyable film that presents a worthy mystery of telling. Sometimes that's all you can ask for.6.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Murder on the Orient Express,"This film is proof that any movie that may have a slow start can be partially justified by a powerful end. By containing an intriguing main character, who displays intelligence and a charming performance from its lead, as well as stylistic visuals, the film remains engaging throughout. However, despite the engaging aspects of the film, the movie suffers from a slow pace, causing the film to loose momentum for the viewing experience. It also fails to have characters to gravitate towards due to the over reliance on the like-ability of the ensemble cast playing them. The cast is skilled with what they are given, but what they are given is not enough to fully connect too. In a shocking turn of events, however, the film can be slightly redeemed through its surprisingly emotional ending, giving a satisfying conclusion to a film that was middle-of-the-road up until this point. This film, despite its flaws, in the end manages to create a pleasant viewing experience, with an ending that justifies the majority of the means in this perfectly average watchable film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What? Again!?,"The biggest mystery about this movie based on Agatha Christie's famous novel is why they bothered. It isn't as if this book hasn't been filmed umpteen times already. This movie features great sets, a marvelous soundtrack and many famous and talented actors but it brings nothing to the story that we haven't seen before. To be honest, we certainly wouldn't want anyone to change the story, but if we're going to see it done again we would like to see it done in a way that brings something fresh. Maybe that's no longer possible with such a familiar tale.Kenneth Branagh plays Hercule Poirot. He is a very brave man to do so. Most of us remember Poirot played by David Suchet. Suchet is, without a doubt, the definitive Poirot. He has Poirot's mannerisms and quirks down to a tee, his acting is impeccable and Suchet even looks like Poirot, just as Christie described him. I believe that every book Christie wrote featuring Poirot has been filmed starring Suchet, including Murder on the Orient Express. If you are a fan of Christie or mysteries generally, you should look these productions up. Kenneth Branagh looks nothing like Poirot, but then again neither did Peter Ustinov or Albert Finney or other actors who have played the role.If there is a problem with this movie it is Branagh's portrayal of Poirot. We know Poirot is a very eccentric even narcissistic man, but Branagh goes over the top in portraying these aspects of Poirot's personality. His is not always a subtle performance. In fact there are times it seems that Branagh is envisioning Poirot as sort of an early 20th century superhero. There is one scene where Branagh's Poirot is outdoors walking towards all the other cast members and we see him walking towards the camera with his voluminous coat swirling about him like Superman's cape. There are times too that the landscapes in this movie look decidedly like computer generated images. I suspect some of them are. They are certainly gorgeous but sometimes have a cartoonish quality to them. One other thing I became aware of as the film approached its conclusion is how many secrets Poirot was progressively exposing with absolutely no evidence or clues presented to support his deductions. He was always correct of course, but that's not the point. We would like to see the clues too so we could try and solve the mystery along with him from the comfort of our lounge chairs.I don't mean to sound like I am disparaging this movie. That is not my intention. There is nothing terribly wrong with it, but there is nothing special about it. This movie concludes with the suggestion that a sequel is planned - a remake of Death on the Nile. Honestly people, Mr Branagh et al, don't bother.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitely not a detective movie,"I am a Hercule Poirot fans because I read all books of Agatha Christie and yes, Hercule Poirot is a lovably living character in my mind, short, unique mustache, gentle with women, french accents, and meticulous. This figure can only be looked inside David Suchet, no other actor can be Hercule Poirot, nor this actor in this remake Murder on Orient Express. Kenneth Burough is tall enough to be Hercule Poirot and his mustache in this movie is too much. Well, this first appearance makes me judging other things, especially the plot. This movie is a remake, so does the murder and the ending. This is not surprising, because while I was searching the murder weapon along with all characters, I could not find it, so that I had assumed that the ending must be remake too. Well, the imaging of the train, snow, old cities, wardrobe are amazing. I can not bear it if this is coming from modern time, with good quality and angles. This movie is really having a great fashion designer and imaging Director, but for the plot director, I am quite disappointed, even though this movie has a big budget with such kind of actors, Johnny Deep, Penelope Cruz, etc, but the plot is not interesting, is boring, and is predictable.

Atmospheric and stylish adaptation of a crime novel that has changed literature,"The new adaptation of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express impresses with lush settings, a gloomy atmosphere and great acting performances, particularly by Kenneth Branagh as clever detective, Johnny Depp as arrogant gangster and Judi Dench as arrogant aristocrat.On the negative side, the investigation on the train is a little bit rushed. The movie exposes plenty of theories for a potential murderer but doesn't go into detail. It's at times difficult to follow the numerous characters and their motives to commit a murder in the second third of the movie until the final third wraps it up coherently. Another negative element is that the introduction to the film is a little bit long and also unnecessary as it doesn't really add anything to the character development.Those who have never read Murder on the Orient Express or watched one of the numerous movie adaptations will obviously be surprised by the clever story. On the other side, if you are already familiar with the story, there aren't many new elements to discover that would justify to watch this film.Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is an entertaining, profound yet stylish adaptation of one of the greatest crime novels ever written. It's important to continue to honour this novel that has changed the world of literature. On the other side, this version is neither as detailed as the novel nor as charming as Sidney Lumet's version of the seventies.

A detective story that underachieves,"Despite the all-star cast assembled, the story really has little screen time for the various suspects we are meant to develop some intrigue and mystery about. There is a murder, as expected from the title, and then there is the unraveling. The detective has the requisite moments demonstrating that he is clever and steadfast, the cast has moments where each person shows the requisite amount of ""maybe they did it""--but really it's a case where the plot it not necessarily predictable, it just doesn't feel like it matters--murder has never been so forgettable.There aren't much stakes in part because we have no real reason to care about any of the characters, or meat with which to build anything other than a superficial idea of what their motives might be. Consequently there isn't much drama, but they go through the steps of a detective procedural.There is the twist at the end, some may guess it. It is not a bad movie for a group to watch to keep them occupied. This passes the ""is the plot coherent test"". But is it novel? Interesting? Fun? Intense? Not really.

Go along for the ride,"I saw the star-stunned 1974 film version of Agatha Christie's famous 1934 novel, so I knew the outcome of the equally star-stunned 2017 remake, but I still found it an enjoyable ride through the snow. It has to be said that the plot is massively contrived and the whole thing sags somewhat in the middle, but the cast and direction make the work eminently watchable.Heading the cast is Kenneth Branagh as the Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot and he is splendid in his clever deductions, while it is a special pleasure to see the return to the screen of Michelle Pfeiffer who is particularly good in a cast-list that also includes male stars Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe & Derek Jacobi and female talent such as Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley & Penélope Cruz. The director is Branagh who offers us a flashy production with lots of soaring camera-work and plenty of colour and noise.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Murder on the Orient ExpressMost train slayings occur when tramps board a boxcar filled with drunk hobos.However, the choo choo in this mystery is too ritzy for silly rail yard homicides.While returning to London aboard the famed Orient Express, the equally eminent Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is propositioned by a fellow passenger (Johnny Depp) looking to hire the detective to protect him for the duration of their journey.It's not until the man turns up dead does Poirot grasp the seriousness of his offer. Intrigue, as always, he gathers the other passengers/suspects (Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Penélope Cruz, Daisy Ridley) and interrogates them.In the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's whodunit, Branagh manages to pull off her meticulous sleuth, but stumbles as the film's director. While the reveal is still a classic, the real crime is the underutilized supporting cast.Sadly, most killers in train related deaths are distracted engineers.

It starts in a campy style but loses that edge partway through,"Most of the film takes place on the Orient Express train on the way from Istanbul to Paris.Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is an obsessive, analytical detective not unlike Sherlock Holmes. After solving a theft in Jerusalem at the Wailing Wall, Poirot plans to take a break to read and relax. He takes the Orient Express at the last moment with 12 other passengers in first class.One of the passengers, Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp), a crooked art dealer, asks Poirot to protect him on the journey, but Poirot declines. That night as the train passes through the mountains, an avalanche derails part of the train. The next day Ratchett is discovered to be murdered, stabbed 12 times. Poirot agrees to solve the case.In his investigation, he quickly learns that Ratchett is actually John Cassetti, the man known to have kidnapped and killed Daisy Anderson, the young daughter of a famous pilot, John Armstrong. He also learns all the first-class passengers and the conductor have motives. He solves the case and has to make a moral judgment at the end before he departs for another case.This is a ""cozy"" mystery, as we see the dead body and a flashback to the murder, but no real death scene. This is a famous Agatha Christie novel and is very stylishly done in a costume drama kind of way. Almost all the passengers/suspects are well-known actors, e.g., Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Olivia Colman, etc. It starts in a campy style but seems to lose that edge partway through. It really had the potential for more but is interesting for viewers who are not familiar with the Agatha Christie novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the good remakes,"I've seen a lot of people critiquing this for being a poor remake, on the contrary I found it very gripping and well made.First thing's first Kenneth Branagh is a brilliant Hercule Perot and apart from being a bit mumbly in some scenes he was top class. Michelle Pfiffer, Johhny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judi Dench, Leslie Odom, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi and Willem Dafoe whilst perhaps not as fantastic as they usually are they were still good and it's a huge star studded cast!The cinematography was top notch and had some interesting camera angles. However, I would have liked to see some more environment shots. The actual train is just a wonder to look at, the interior was lavish and pleasant too.The plot was about as good as the novel, making a few little changes here or there, I feel like the film could have benefited with an extra 20 minutes or so of screen time to flesh out some of the characters it was a very good rendition of the novel I feel and had a modern twist to it without losing its charm.7/10: A good film, all I could hope for with a modern adaption.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An enjoyable murder mystery with a famous twist,"Following a prologue, where Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, exposes a thief in Jerusalem, our protagonist heads to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express, bound for London. After dinner he is approached by a man who claims to be an antiques dealer who feels in danger after selling dodgy goods to the wrong people. Poirot declines the request for help. The following night the train is derailed by an avalanche; when the compartments are checked the man is found dead... with multiple stab wounds. Poirot is soon investigating; the problem isn't a shortage of clues but an excess... each pointing to a different suspect. Before the case is solved he will uncover truths about the dead man and how various people on board are connected to him.I was surprised to see just how unpopular this film appears to be as I really enjoyed it; perhaps that was because it was quite a while since I'd seen any other Poirot mystery so could accept Kenneth Branagh, and his ridiculous moustache, in the role. Despite knowing who did it before watching the story was fun to watch. The case provides plenty of clues to keep our protagonist, and the viewer, guessing. Even if you know how it ends seeing how that conclusion is reached is entertaining. The all-star cast does a fine job bringing their somewhat over-the-top characters to life. The opening scenes are somewhat superfluous for anybody familiar with Poirot but serves as a nice demonstration of how quick thinking he is for viewers new to the character. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable film but acknowledge that may be a minority opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
To my mind is pretty well movie for one time.,"To begin with, I want to say that picture is awesome and given a lot of attention to details. Dialog I can evaluate as higher than middle. However, if you read the book, you will find a lot of different between book and movie. I really don't like that they made from detective story, where Hercule Poirot was thinking almost all the story, action detective story. To sum up, it's not bad movie, but it will be better to watch it at home, not in the cinema. 7/10 p.s. Sorry for my English ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He looked a more like Dick Stawbridge after a beard trim. This excellent story has been made many times and doesn't need to be made any more.

Remakes can be great!,"Murder On Oriental Express is a film directed by Kenneth Brangan about a famous detective, Hercule Poirot, played by the director himself. He was on-board of a train called Oriental Express. However during the trip there was a murder happening and the killer is being limited to passengers in just one cabinet. Being the best detective in the world, Poriot must try to solve the crime before the police took the matter on their own hands. Right off the back I can tell you that this is Kenneth Brangan's best film to date. His film to be are mostly very classical and Shakespearian, he made mostly Shakespeare film. I enjoyed his interpretation of Thor 1, it has flaws but I enjoyed it. Cinderella is an eye candy film but didn't last a long impression. Jack Ryan shadow recruit is a massive disappointment that derailed the Tom Clancy franchise. I really loved this film and to set the record straight I didn't see the 1970s version or read the book so I came to see the film with blank state. I think this is a very masterfully made film. The biggest strength is its cinematography, the only film this year that came close to rival with Blade Runner 2049 in this category. I highly recommend seeing it on a big screen because it is absolutely gorgeous. There were many long takes and it took its time to use the camera to tell a story, reminds of some old films like Casablanca. This also compliments the acting, which are superb. Everyone did an amazing job. There were many close-up shots and it is, again, one of those films where images tell a thousand words. Some may not like it but I loved. Speaking about acting, the stand out is definitely Poirot. The way I see it, this film is taking from his perspective rather than your normal crime drama. From the start of the film, you can see he is an overconfident detective who is obsessed with precision and logic. But as the film goes on and he is discovering the depth and the cause of the crime as the audience we can see that crime is eating him up and inside and by the end of the film he is completely changed by this experience. The supporting actors aren't there just as show piece, their emotional turmoil pushed the story along. To name every single one actors showed up would take a while. There were no particular stand outs but some of the more memorable ones are Daisy Reily, Josh Gash, Michelle Piher and William Defoe. The writing was very good and there were a great deal of humor too. O, let's not forget about the absolutely amazing score from Patrick Doyle. I loved this movie so much that I decided to wait for 24 hours before I post my review just to clear my head a bit and I have to say I still love it. To me, this is the most surprising movie and certainly the most underrated one. As for flaws, the beginning felt a bit rushed because they have to introduce all the characters also there were few moments where I felt I was watching a detective Conan live action movie when Poirot was rumbling. And I do know that some people may not enjoy as much as I do because the film is made very old fashioned and it is not your average crime drama. But for me I had a great time and I can't wait to see it again. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
thank god for that music at the end of the movie,For a remake it was not bad at all. in fact it was enjoyable....a passable remake which could been a lot better as it was kinda boring at times until the assassination took place somewhat in the middle of the movie but the movie takes the average grade easily.the real money came at the end of the movie.last 20 minutes were the best and the song called justice from doyle was one of the best music score u ever heard.it reminds me another similar melody from the past but I can't remember which one.this melody is divine.it's worth to buy the cd only for this song.overall a worthy remake but nothing we never watched before.there is a twist if u remember what happened to the 1974 movie but I leave that to see it for yourself.Grade // c+,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nothing that will stay with me for very long.,"'MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A new cinematic version of Agatha Christie's classic 1934 murder mystery novel, which has been adapted into films three times before. Kenneth Branagh directed, produced and stars in the movie; as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Poirot is in charge of investigating a murder on the famous Orient Express. It was written by Michael Green, who's recent writing credits include co-scripting 'BLADE RUNNER 2049', 'LOGAN' and 'ALIEN COVENANT'. The film also features an all-star supporting cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad and Johnny Depp. Ridley Scott also served as a producer on the flick, and it was shot on 65mm film. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (although none are really raving about it), and it's also done modestly well at the Box Office too. I found it to be well made, and mostly (at least mildly) entertaining, but I'm definitely not raving about it either.The story begins in 1930s Jerusalem, where the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) is solving a case. He's then expecting to go on a highly anticipated vacation. Before he can go on it though, he's given a telegram asking for his assistance on another case. His friend Buoc (Tom Bateman), who now directs the famous 'Orient Express', offers him a three day ride to his destination. Poirot meets a variety of different characters on his trip, including an American criminal named Samuel Ratchett (Depp). Ratchett asks the detective for his help, in acting as his personal bodyguard, but Poirot declines (stating that he doesn't aide criminals, he only catches them). Later Ratchett is killed, and the train is derailed by an avalanche. While the passengers are all stranded there, Poirot conducts an investigation to find out who killed Ratchett, and of course it has to be someone who's still on the train.The movie is beautiful to look at; it looks like a classic big screen epic at almost all times. Branagh is of course a very talented filmmaker, and actor too, and he doesn't disappoint here. Most of the rest of the celebrities have little to do though; with the exception of Pfeiffer, who's always good in almost everything she does (it seems like). The story is a classic mystery as well, but (as I already said) it's been done multiple times before, and there's nothing really new here. I did have a mostly good time watching it though, but it's also nothing that will stay with me for very long.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classical Filmmaking,"The scope is massive without it being a stupid brain-deadening superhero movie (God, someone shoot Marvel and DC dead...video games come to life are not FILMS!!). This is real filmmakers making a real film, and by all critics who've bashed this film on this site have overlooked, it is as patient of a film you will see. And if we're to wish pure storytelling to exist in the future, this is a reason to hold it tightly to your chest. Instead of beating the drum to comic book heroes. In this case it is a simple detective tale with characters stuck together in order to solve crime. Director Kenneth Brannagh seems to have an affinity towards both the source material and the Sidney Lumet 1974 version (the train full of stars). So what if you knew the answer to the who-dun-it. You know how most Thor movies end (here's the hint, with your brain melted and fat from stupidity). This film is photographed as old Hollywood. Something desperately missing are, less cuts and more staging. This is the film that showcases it with a great deal of zeal. It's exciting to see camera angles from the heavens that peep in on a intimate conversation. THIS is filmmaking. Or that we see multiple characters introduced throughout the train as background characters. Or that there is a coziness to this like playing the board game ""Clue."" And to top it all off...there is a deeper idea with the detective's story that wasn't in the 1974 version. Can I defend this to the simpleminded film goers today who lambasted this film for everything making films is all about. Oh right, most of you have or will never make a film in your lives. That's why you watch movies and not films. See this movie and re-calibrate your compass to how they're suppose to be made.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A competently made remake that no one asked for.,"I have not been too kind on Hollywood remakes. Generally they take a film that was very successful and want to 'recreate it' for younger audiences, hoping that it would make even more money. However often these films are the remakes of brilliant originals and whilst these remakes can be very entertaining, they are still miles away from the quality of the original. Murder on the Orient Express is such a film. It has an amazing cast (like the original) which consists of great names such as Kenneth Branagh, Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz and Josh Gad. All of these actors give their everything, in particular Branagh who is amazing as the eccentric Hercule Poirot. He manages to recreate the character but also keep the traits that made him so memorable when the likes such as Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov played them. However the rest of the characterizations felt dull, I was uninterested in them plus I saw the original and knew how it ended. So even in that category the film failed to surprise me. What made the original film so good was that when Poirot was investigating it felt like that he was investigating real people. The characters were all flashed out well thanks to excellent writing. So when Poirot spots something odd, you as the viewer are ultimately challenged to re watch and check whether you can see what he sees. You were investigating with Poirot. In this adaptation the characters were so one dimensional that I honestly didn't care. I knew the ending of the original and so didn't care about the actual murder either. The film looks beautiful, it has awesome camera work and costume design. The actors do great and Branagh will no doubt catch Oscar buzz for his performance. I only recommend this film for audiences who have never read the Agatha Christie novel or seen the original film. This is because that way at least the murder remains interesting, if we know the conclusion the film loses much of this effect. The original had great characters that were three dimensional and felt real. There was re watch value, this film is a perfect Netflix watch. If you have never seen the original you will be entertained while it lasts but you are not encouraged to watch it again (at least I'm not).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
First class enterTRAINment,"Fill a train with a most impressive cast line up, throw in a grisly murder mystery and have the mighty impressive Kenneth Branagh go on a quest to find out who done it and you got yourself a delightful little movie which will most certainly entertrain.A take on Agatha Christie's popular novel Murder on the Orient Express, the story follows that of detective Hercule Poirot, who is called on business to London, and so takes the last available room on the Orient Express. Though wanting nothing more than to relax and enjoy his journey, he inadvertently finds himself working, when one of the passengers is mysteriously killed.It's a wonderful simple story which sees detective Poirot go from guest to guest questioning them on their whereabouts on that fateful night. The opening scene did worry me somewhat with it's overly smart-arsed series of events, akin to that of a last few SHERLOCK TV episodes. It risked going off the rails and being too clever, well beyond believable, but thankfully for the main mystery it calms itself down.The 1h 54minruntime steams by as I sat and enjoyed first class performances from all the cast. Stand out characters were Daisy Ridley's Miss Mary Debenham, Josh Gad's Hector MacQueen, Leslie Odom Jr.'s Dr. Arbuthnot and of course the brilliant Kenneth Branagh as the brilliantly quirky and intelligent Hercule Poirot. Only Michelle Pfeiffer's performance lacked somewhat and took away from what could have been a much more emotional scene towards the end.For a story that takes place almost entirely on a train, the director uses the limited space well, for as this narrative unfolds, it doesn't feel too claustrophobic, even in the narrow hallways and the tight compact cabins. Shifting the camera into creative perspectives at times helps keep the scenes fresh and visually stimulating (I especially enjoyed the birds eye view of the murder scene). The pacing is snappy and energetic and at no point feels like its running out of steam. Kenneth Branagh should also be commended for the way he juggles a story consisting of such a myriad of actors, by giving each character their own perspectives and motives, helps to keep the viewer on their toes; questioning every nuance and detail and while some are barely given any screen time, most feel substantially explored.Overall Murder on the Orient Express conducts itself well, an interesting ""who done it?"" mystery that will keep you guessing throughout. Wonderfully paced and fantastically performed.

Agatha Christie certainly doesn't need to be ashamed,"Yours truly is a massive admirer of Mrs. Agatha Christie! If her hand-written grocery lists ever become published, I will surely read them and watch the film adaptations! Many people in my surrounding asked me if I was ecstatic when the news got spread about the upcoming and hi-budgeted new version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Well, yes and no. Contrary to general belief, there certainly isn't a shortage of Agatha Christie adaptations. The ""Queen of Crime"" died more than 40 years ago, but just recently I purchased the newly released mini-series ""And then there were none"" and ""Witness for the Prosecution"", which are both produced by the BBC and star an impressive list of famous players. Indeed, there hasn't been a cinematic adaptation in quite a while, but personally I didn't see the need for one. Fans of Christie's work can easily enough find the aforementioned mini-series, or a variety of other TV-series, on DVD, but are her writings still appealing enough to be shown on the big screen? After all, Christie delivered old-fashioned whodunits and convoluted detective stories that invite the audience to guess along for clues and red herrings, but my impression is that people generally don't care for these anymore. Whodunit stories have evolved into CSI showcasing and modern detectives turned into superheroes who are able to solve a crime before it properly happened, like for example in the new ""Sherlock"" series with Benedict Cumberbatch. Of course I'm happy there is a new Christie adaptation, but honestly I was even more concerned that it would flop at the box office. Kenneth Brannagh even took an additional - but comprehensible - risk by choosing ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as his project. Partially thanks to the fantastic 1974 film version directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Albert Finny, this has arguably become Christie's most well-known tale and literally everyone who saw the film or read the book will have remembered the denouement.But once again it turns out that I was overly worried! Kenneth Brannagh's ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is by no means a masterpiece, but certainly an entertaining and very competently made mystery/thriller. I'm grateful that it remained a traditional adaptation that treats the source material with great respect. In other words, Hercule Poirot luckily didn't rejuvenate into a martial-arts action hero, while the cinematography and decors are kept stylish and sober rather than turning the whole thing into a hyperkinetic and winnable trendy ""The Matrix"" clone. And the story? Well, the story is still powerful enough to remain surprising and absorbing. Just as the 1974 version, this film can rely on an impressive all-star cast including names like Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench and Dereck Jacobi. Some of these big names have really few screen time, but they will lure people to the theater nevertheless. Kenneth Brannagh himself depicts an admirable and likable Hercule Poirot, although perhaps the size of the iconic mustache is slightly exaggerated.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very mediocre rehash.,"I wanted this to be great but sadly it's not, the plot is uninteresting and Kenneth Branagh is part pf the problem, he comes over as an actor playing the great Hercule Poirot, not immersing himself in the role only strolling about trying to look Belgian. Also the all star cast is sadly wasted in the director's personal ego trip. The scene between Hercule Poirot and Edward Henry Masterman is tedious and too quiet and the conversation is bland and doesn't lead the mind to a convoluting plot, you are still conscious that you may have left the kettle on in the kitchen, and that the dog may need to go outside. The whole film is tedious in the extreme, you have to have suspense, you have to have alluring flirtatious ladies, you have to have sneaky suspicions of murder, you have to have impending danger, all you get is boredom, no suspense. Judi Dench looks suitably ancient and semi interested in what is going on around her? Hopefully the next effort will be better, but Hollywood doesn't do decent scriptwriting anymore, it seems?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was actually moving and engaging enough to provoke tears. Just re-watched the 1974 version, but still found we enjoyed the Branagh version more.

A fine murder-mystery film,"There is a murder on the Orient Express and Hercule Poirot played by Kenneth Branagh is trying to find the murderer. He has twelve suspects that can be the murderer but he has to find which one is it, while also everyone isn't really helping because no one is really answering his questions.Let's start with the performances, everyone is truly great in the movie especially Kenneth Branagh. He gives one of the best performances of the year. The beginning of the movie is very unexpected because it's very light hearted and funny. There is a scene were we see how good Hercule is at being a detective and then the next scene we get told how good he is, even tough we just saw it. When the murder happens then the movie starts getting good the story is very interesting and we are invested in it. But when you know who the killer is after that they try to make this statement about revenge and it's just stupid and not logical, no spoilers.This movie is fine, it's perfectly watchable but the end is just dumb and it's a shame because I felt like this could be one of the best movies of the year and it's not even close.

Good but a little dull,In 1934 a train (the Orient Express) is traveling from Istanbul. Aboard is an all-star cast including Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who is trying to relax. However an avalanche leaves the train stranded for a few days. In that time a passenger is brutally murdered. Poirot reluctantly agrees to solve the murder.Well-done remake of the 1970s original. It LOOKS great--wonderful production design and costumes. Also it's beautifully directed by Branagh--some shots of the Express moving through the snow took my breath away. Good acting by the cast too--especially Branagh (although his mustache is distracting) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Still it is slow at times. Also I knew the twist ending from the original so I always knew what was coming up. Still it WAS well-done and if you don't know the ending you might like it more than me.

Close to the book but not close enough,"How many remakes of this will there be?This is a lavish star studded presentation of a timeless tale. The attention to 1930's detail is excellent, the scenery superb, the camera angles are all excellent. Brannagh holds the Belgian accent well. Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer steal the film with Depp being remarkably understated.So why only a 7 out of 10 ? The first scenes are all totally unnecessary and not even in the book! The ""prostitute in the kitchen"" aside .... (where did that thread come from ? ) ... I was unsure of the purpose other than Brannagh's bombastic monologues. The ending... oh my ! ... was definitely not in the book. And the ending paves the way for another film. But knowing the book in question, I am unsure how they will work that one. Brannagh is rather too bombastic and sharp to be an excellent Poirot but he works it well. Not all the characters on the train are the same as in the book.I enjoyed the film well enough.

It was a big ask for Kenneth Branagh to replace David Suchet as Poirot in our minds, but he puts a different spin on the character that is entertaining.I have not read the original source material, so can make not points about how accurate a retelling it is, but for nearly two hours of escapism I found this to be an entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Fantastic atmospheric classical style mystery - with great actors/actresses!,"Wow, I didn't see this coming! I had seen previews and since I'm a British mystery book enthusiast, I very much was interested in the movie. But my expectations were not very high, because of all the disappointing drek that Hollywood has been churning out in recent history. Hollywood seems to have been having a really rough time in trying to make good movies lately.So I was very surprised at just how good this movie turned out to be. It's filmed in a very classical style, and reminds me of older movies, when they knew how to make good movies. Great atmosphere of a luxury train in the 1930s, and the train interior scenes are done in a way that doesn't feel cramped at all, like you might think. It all feels very natural.The ensemble cast is excellent. My favorite characters and performances in the movie were Kenneth Branagh as the esteemed detective Hercule Poirot, Willem Dafoe as Professor Gerhard Hardman, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard.I don't know what it is about Michelle Pfeiffer, but I have taken a real liking to her as she has become an older actress. I used to not like her at all when she was ""young and hot"", but now I think she is a really good actress and I'm excited to see her name in a film. Here, she is really superb playing a mature woman who still has a wild streak in her, and she almost steals the entire movie all by herself.But Kenneth Branagh also gives a sterling performance, and I was very impressed by his portrayal of the detective Poirot in the movie. He was pretty amazing in how authentic the character came across as, and had a hell of a presence in the movie, basically anchoring the whole movie around his performance.Willem Dafoe was solid, as usual, as a fine character actor. And he had a really good reveal type scene near the end of the film, I thought. That said, the acting from all the characters in the movie, both major and minor, was of a very high caliber overall.The film's mystery is based on the famous Agatha Christie novel, which I must confess I never read. So, the entire plot was a surprise to me, and I have to say it was a damn fine mystery! I now know why this book is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery novels, its quite fantastic! I didn't see the solution coming at all, and even though I have read numerous detective books and seen a ton of mystery TV shows, the climax even surprised me, which shows just how special this mystery really is -- definitely written by a master.My only real criticism is that the film is shot in 65mm, which gives the film kind of a fantasy, story-book like look to the whole film. A lot of the landscape shots especially looked fake and like CGI because of this.I prefer the more realistic look that you get from normal 35mm film.A minor complaint is the film feels a bit rushed to me, and maybe should have been half an hour longer. This is a very unusual complaint coming from me, because I don't like and often will criticize the too long running times of many movies these days. But this movie felt like it could have used another half hour to expand upon, and not feel so rushed.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys traditional style mysteries, it really is a must-see!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent adaptation that gets better as the film goes.,"I grew up with Christie's books and David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.The thing with ""who don it"" mysteries is that if you know the ending then your experience will differ from that who's seeing it for the first time.Is this a decent adaptation of the book? Yes, they followed the plot and a lot of attention was paid to the little details to make it look like an actual train from the 1920's.Up until the end the theater was full of murmurs ""who did it? who was it then?"" and even though I knew I was still interested in the movie till the end.One thing that lowers this movie's score is Hercule Poirot himself. As a fan I know the character is a bit eccentric however here he was a full blown OCD with non-sense scenesE.g. get the poor 6 year old to run half way across the city to get him eggs then insist on having them be equal in size and cooked for exactly 4 minutes then do it again because the eggs weren't just right... why? that just seemed cruel.E.g. 2. have him stand on the roof of the train in a snowstorm ... just to show the scene, there was no reason for that scene at all.The film gets better as you get past the ""character intro"" and onto the actual train however and Poirot is more himself then. Also I'm arab myself and I found the little bits of subtle humor in the first part actually cool and unexpected in an American movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant Revival of Classic Murder Mystery,"I thought this movie was great! I love a good thriller/murder mystery, but movies nowadays are all about the gore and horror more than the strategy. There is a point in the movie where you realize there are too many coincidences and you can pretty much guess who the killer is, but you really can't say for sure until the very end. I loved all the scenery and vibrancy of the time. Each character in the film is very much their own and unalike others. I have never read Agatha Christie nor seen early versions of this movie, but I really enjoyed her plot. I think the classic murder mystery needs a revival because very many these days leave me feeling down about the world, but coming out of the theater from this one, I felt satisfied. For those wondering, there was no foul language and no sex scenes, so, besides a scene of violence, it's pretty safe for all ages to see. I hope I see more movies like this coming out.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"a view from someone who hasn't read the novel / the 74 movie, yet.","i'm writing this review from a perspective of someone who hasn't read the famous novel nor see the 1974 feature film based on it.first of all, i do hope the character, Hercule Poirot played by Kenneth Branagh can be present in another movie(s) with another case(s) despite of what happened with this one.Murder on the Orient Express is starting as an intriguing and appealing movie, with the beautiful 1930s background, with the quirky Poirot solving a rather quick opening exposition. I don't get hyped because of the casts but i expect something grand from the main case and how 2017 can squeeze the elaborate occurrence happened in the train.the positive vibe that i get from the beginning of the movie is constantly becoming bland repertoire among the detective and his suspects. i wish they prepare this movie more serious, in a sense, with an exception of the ending, the whole movie is rather boring, there's no suspense or thrill. i am clueless on how much the movie deviates from the book but i lost the same excitement i got in seeing other distinguished detectives or crime-solving movies.however, it is concluded with a stunning ending that in my opinion can do some amend to salvage the movie.i am not sure how much were skewed from the source due to the filmmaker interpretation, and certainly as someone who hasn't read the book i cant compare both of them, but after seeing this movie, i think it's rather a disappointing one, again, with an exception of the mind-blown reveal at the end accompanied by a question about the value of justice when justice is fail to be served.i am quite satisfied with the start and the end but i think the movie can be more interesting in the middle, its just too plain. i wish i can give 7 but 6.5 for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very mixed - some things great, others godawful","The Good:
-Well done visually. Great color palette, sets, costumes, and especially the cinematography
-Impressive cast, and all of the actors who received a decent amount of screen time gave good performances
-Some very good scenes sprinkled throughout. The scene between Branagh and Depp was the only truly great scene in the movie.The Bad:
-Underused actors. Many great actors are given barely any screen time. Judi Dench in particular only has a couple of minutes. Hardly what an actress of her caliber should receive.
-Awful CG shots of the train. The movie legitimately looks like The Polar Express at points.
-Drawn out first act, including a very unnecessary and poorly done opening.The Ugly:
-The dialogue/script. The dialogue has occasional moments of greatness, especially in the second and third act, but most of it is unbearably bad. All of the characters just give a giant monologue explaining themselves completely out of nowhere. The movie even had the perfect opportunity to put this exposition into Poirot's interviews with each character, but instead characters just launch into monologue. Bouc in particular is very grating and poorly written. 
-The mystery. In the book, Poirot's detective skills, whilst extraordinary, still felt grounded and realistic. In this, it feels almost supernatural. Clues and leads from the book are cast aside and Poirot pulls all of his revelations from thin air. Very lazy writing.
-The pacing. First act is too long, second act is too short, third act is too long. The film takes it sweet ass time to get going, but leaves out all of the setup from the book, making it feel less like setup and more like 40 minutes of nothing. Less material took more time than more material should have. The investigation, which should be tense and slow burning, is rushed through and feels empty. Rather than letting the audience figure everything out alongside Poirot, the film makes the audience watch him interview everyone and then explain everything. Very boring. Ending was simply drawn out, unsatisfying, and too long.
-The twist. Didn't make sense in the book, makes even less sense here.
-Filler. The film, without filler, is barely feature length, when if done properly it should be well over two hours.TLDR- Boring and poorly paced, despite interesting visuals. Very disappointing. 3/10",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A visual treat devoid of precision,"To begin with, 'Murder on the Orient Express', in general, is an absolute treat to the eyes for its cinematography, the acting and the music score. It creates that dramatic flair that good movies have in tthem. However, for those who have read the book of the same name by the genius, Agatha Christie, the movie is definitely a step down in terms of content. Nothwithstanding the fact that it is not possible to include every little detail of the book into the movie, but it did feel as if the movie missed out on certain key moments which was quite an important part of the book. The movie began really strongly, with a precise portrayal of the famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, the colourful visual setting and certain other nits and bits did altogether set the stage for a truly pleasing next 100 minutes or so. Tha being said, once the characters were introduced and settled and the movie really picked pace, ironically, it somehow was inconsistent in its approach. It changed pace quite bizzarely and almost rushed too quickly to the end, leaving lots of important moments to the book only. On the brighter side, the performance of Kenneth Branagh, who also is the director of the movie, was really impressive and I never had any difficulties picturing him as the Hercule Poirot, so much loved in the book. He did carry the movie on his shoulders throughout the middle portion. Great support from Penelope Cruz, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench and co. provided with some sort of flair to the movie. One slight blemish that kind of stuck out like a sour thumb was Johnny Depp's performance. In general, I rate him very highly as an actor, and he had treated us with some outstanding performances over the years, but, and it's just a personal inference, he in his recent movies, his acting has becoma quite monotonous and predictable. His voice always takes me back to the Jack Sparrow days and sometimes it helps me liking him more in the movie, but on this particular film, it was more a nuisance than a relief. The movie has it's fair share of inconsistencies, but it all faded away during the final moments, especially in the final couple of scenes. The way it has been put forward is a visual treat and is largely responsible for making this movie from a ""onetime thing"" to a geniunely good movie.
To sum up the movie in a sentence, it is good, but less than its potential.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Lots of suspense, a good story and great acting.","The main characters are played by the director of the film Kenneth Branagh. The film also stars Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johny Depp, Daisy Ridley and others.

During the film Poirot finds interesting facts about the passengers of The Oriental Express. The film has an interesting twist though.The film has its faults like it was so boring in the middle.

All those famous names seem on paper: Wow but in the film they do not bring much (which is expected with their names).

Shame on Branagh - ruined an excellent story,"It is a shame the way this was directed, the first 20 min has some overacting and some scenes that don´t really match the style of the rest of the film, out of place and weird. Branagh is unable to film anything that is not from his own culture and it also has to take place in his own country, and here he has an international cast and action in a foreign country - that apparently brings some serious problems problems. A cast full of stars with Christie´s story should bring crowds to the cinema and what does bring instead is pure disappointment. Add a ridiculous, very distracting mustache on the main character (what is the point of doing that? such a stupid decision), some unnecessary scenes, pointless conversations here and there making this kind of boring - Poirot starts an interview in German but he turns to English after 2 sentences, it makes no sense, but it is kind of what happens with the entire movie, the first part seems to take one direction then it turns into another.

The detailing, the train, the music it was great. The character of Hercules Poirot was a little ""camp"" but largely well drawn.What was bad, amalgamating characters, racial rincing, changing Agatha's language and perhaps crossing the line by dumbing down her prejudices to make it more palatable for modern audiences.Overall it was a 6 outta 10 for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good effort but highly inaccurate and a mess,"Although I am a great fan of Kenneth Branagh but the adaption of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery is full of major holes. For starters they eliminated an important character, colonel Arbuthnot who served with John Armstrong. His famous line ""I prefer a jury of 12 men"" was a major clue to Poirot. Then they renamed the doctor's last name to Arbuthnot for no reason. Secondly, this case happens later in Poirot's career and he is older, and much heavier and bald. The reinvention of Poirot is utterly wrong in this hip sleek back hair with a giant mustachio. The real Agatha Christie's Poirot cannot fight! He is a brainy but physically unfit man. The (Spoiler alert) fight seen with the doctor is another made up seen to add some Hollywood action to the mix. But it is out of place and again distracting. Finally another major flaw is (spoiler alert) the stabbing of Ms Hubbard which is made up to add some sort of diversion that does not exist anywhere else. The set and cinematography is very nice with high production value. But overall this movie fails to capture the real fans and can not appeal to casual mystery fans either as it is too distracting. I was really hoping for a masterpiece with this star studded cast and Branagh acting and directing. But clearly something terribly went wrong as it is the usual case in Hollywood these days.

Was expecting much more.,"As a fan of murder-mystery movies, I was quite eager to watch this film when I first heard of it.

What I got was quite the contrary.The premise of the film was quite intriguing, however the plot was dull and beyond disappointing. There is a promising start, but the rest was just... purely mediocre. There is no building of suspense, just the detective indulging in idle discussion with the suspects that leads nowhere. The ending was also quite predictable, though I won't spoil it in this review.My 6/10 rating receives most of its credit for the aesthetic cinematography, which did an excellent job in creating a fitting mood for the type of movie this is.

Today's audiences need to actually SEE the murder (if not the murderer) and watch the blood flow.
When the TV show Murder She Wrote went off the air it wasn't because it didn't have ample viewship. It was because those who tuned in were older and therefore not as susceptible to advertising.

"Solid, but comes of the rails a little.","I do love watching movies in preparation for watching movies and here I am again, preparing for the return of Kenneth Branagh's take on the famous Belgian detective by rewatching his debut, a throwback of sorts, with an all star cast gathered for a retelling of one of Agatha Christie's most famous tales.Having solved a case in Jerusalem, famous Detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) travels to Istanbul and encourages his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman) to grant him passage on board the Orient Express train to Paris. Hoping for a relaxing time he is instead forced to put his talents to the test when Edward Ratchett, a controversial art dealer, (Johnny Depp) is murdered. With an avalanche forcing the train to halt its progress, Poirot must identify the culprit from the passengers and make a dreadful decision about the nature of justice.Much like they did with the Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney movies in the 1970's, this version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has an all-star cast. Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Olivia Colman and Willem Dafoe all feature as guests on board the train. Tonally, it's quite an odd film, with Branagh's Poirot bringing in more broad comedic aspects that what we, in the UK, are used too - where David Suchet played the definitive Poirot for decades on television. Largely though it's a fun ride through to its conclusion.The conclusion was a bit of a problem for me, even the first time I saw this at the cinema. The resolution is quite famous, and I remembered what it was going in, and watching a mystery knowing the outcome is never quite as satisfying as it might otherwise be.It's lighter than I remember it being, particularly given some of its subject matter, and I was less impressed with Branagh's detective than I remembered being.

Lots of nice playful camera work, tons of epic vistas and extravagant scenery, characters played flamboyantly over the top. I quite enjoyed it and was thankful for Depp's early departure, when did he last deliver a decent performance? It is missing something though and I suspect it's that it's merely a remake and the question has to be asked, why? I don't think this film answers that well enough, but I still think it's better than the reviews it received.

Insufferable,"This movie is insufferable, and the fault is squarely with Branagh, both his acting and his directing. In any movie, TV show or theatre production, it is fundamentally essential that the audience be able to understand what the actors are saying. Incredibly, Branagh does not understand this. His phony French accent is utterly unintelligible. Far better to have a French actor trying to speak English in a way that allows people who speak English natively to understand him than to have an Irish actor trying to speak his native language with a foreign accent. And most of the other actors similarly speak unintelligibly, the fault for which is also Branagh's, because he is the director, and it is the director's job to make the actors speak intelligibly.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fun way to spend two hours.,"Watched this because Haunting In Venice (2023) looked like a movie I wanted to watch and I know it's a movie in Kenneth Branagh's Agatha Christie cinematic universe. So I went into this film only knowing that it was a murder mystery and had an ensemble cast.First I have to address the same thing I feel like I always do when I watch British media: it is so difficult for me to understand the silly accents from the English people. That isn't even counting Hercule Poirot, whose accent is almost indecipherable. Because of all the accents that I am not used to, I unfortunately had to watch this film with subtitles on.I think this is the second Agatha Christie film adaptation that I've seen and I've seen countless mystery films in general. This is an intriguing genre and this is another good addition into that group. I know nothing about the books so my only reference for Agatha Christie are the movies and they do make me want to read them eventually. This film is very compelling and definitely kept my attention, which is a low bar but a lot of films fail to clear it. There wasn't even too silly of an ending that is disappointing, like a lot of detective stories do, but there was a lot of convoluted nonsense.I don't remember everything about Crooked House (2017), because I watched it two years ago, but I definitely don't remember it being so similar to Sherlock Holmes. So many of these stories can feel so similar and this one definitely has obvious influences but it still does feel a bit unique and not entirely like a knockoff, even if Poirot himself does seem like exactly that. My frame of reference is the detective stories that are so popular now like Sherlock Holmes and the like, but it is nice to watch an Agatha Christie adaptation because she was pioneering in the genre back in the day (but still followed in the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes). So in a way it feels strange comparing this film to those but also that is historically where Hercule Poirot was, in direct comparison to Sherlock Holmes. So I think it is amusing that they both exist as the world's greatest detective in their own fictions. It is a shame that their movies still don't really compare to Benoit Blanc's. I don't think I've ever liked a detective story as much as I liked Knives Out (2019). Having seen that film flip this genre on its head really puts these into perspective.Everyone involved does a good job, even if some of the accents make my brain sad. I still respect Branagh for starring in his own movies. Michelle Pfeiffer, Willem Dafoe, and Daisy Ridley being in this is pretty cool. Johnny Depp playing an ******* is very believable. He should play an irredeemable in all his roles. I think the camera work is relatively interesting and the film isn't really too visually distinct otherwise, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.I had some fun and this film justified it's runtime. I look forward to watching Branagh's other Agatha Christie films and maybe even other iterations from film history.(p.s. I think it is pretty cool that they made the Armstrong family Jewish when the real life Lindbergh family was headed by Charles Lindbergh, historical Nazi sympathizer, but the events of his son's murder happened before he went public)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Inferior to the original,"In most aspects, this new version of Murder on yeh orient express is marginally inferior to the earlier version directed by Sidney Lumet. This film is not as good because Kenneth Brannagh, while managing the role well, is not as good as the self assured, confident Albert Finney playing the same role in the earlier film. The older version also has a first rate ensemble cast who are all very credible, while the performances by yeh cast in this film is serviceable but nothing spectacular. The last issue I have with this version is it's script- the dialogue of this film lacks the wit and sharpness found in the earlier version. Of course, this Agatha Christie by itself is already pretty fantastic, and as a result this film also has the ability to entertain and capture the audiences attention throughout its entirely length. While this may make for a fun watch, those familiar with the earlier version would find not much changed here, and whatever that has changed is inferior to the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Branagh grows too fond of his own character,"Kenneth Branagh's remake of Agatha Christie's classic, which was last given a theatrical release with a successful and critically acclaimed 1974 version by Sidney Lumet, is a lavish spectacle with great production values and a stellar cast. Branagh has also taken it upon himself to embody Hercule Poirot, and he nails both the look, the sound and the mannerisms of the famous detective. The first part of the film is atmospheric and instigative, as we embark upon this exciting journey together with a motley crew of characters. And this is where it all starts floundering, because Branagh grows too fond of his own character for the other characters to really come to life. They remain two-dimensional and fleeting, not helped by the uneven editing from a narrative point of view. The result is that the denouement, which is supposed to be the pinnacle of any Hercule Poirot story, feels scurried and academic. The film looks great and has the outlines of a great, classic detective story, but alas falls short at the most crucial moments..",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Meh. Too much added political correctness which made a boring adaptation just that much more boring.,"Im not sure if they were trying to make it modern, or what they were doing, but all they managed to do was put me to sleep. The re writing was just vile. It completely contradicts the reality of the 1930's. No one would have gone to a black doctor then, not even if he had been in the war, and had been sponsored by someone. It was all about current issues. The word ""race"" was said over 20 times until I lost count. I just got tired of them talking about segregation laws, and whatever else. Not that this isn't a worthwhile subject, but it simply does not belong in a Agatha Christie mystery at all. Then they went out of their way to go after sexism, making sure Penelope Cruz's character was ""trained to fight"" which is also absurd given the time period, and generally absurd given that she is tiny, and a reasonably healthy fifteen year old boy could probably win a fight with her. Agatha Chritie didn't write Buffy. The most likeble character was Ratchett himself, which is a big problem, and the opposite of what Christie wrote.

One of the worst films ever made by a reputable and talented director/actor!,"So bad that it takes your breath away.Appallingly awful; it actually led me to revisit the David Suchet version made for British television, and upgrade my previously poor opinion of that strangely conceived version of Agatha Christie's best book.Of course, neither is a match for the extraordinary 1974 Sidney Lumet film, with its extraordinary cast and transcendent Richard Rodney Bennett score--despite the eccentric (but ultimately quite serviceable) performance of Alfred Finney as Poirot. But the Suchet version is better than this monstrosity.The less said about Branagh the actor's crazy rendition of the detective the better...other than to wonder how Branagh the director let him get away with it (or those mustaches!).Poor KB has not been himself since the break with Emma Thompson. Almost all of his excellent films were made before that divorce. Since then he has become progressively more self-indulgent and commercialized. If not his muse (or perhaps even a co-creator), she certainly seemed to supply some kind of governor, which is now sorely missed. Her career has moved on from strength to strength; his seems to be going down the crapper.**Added in 2022** His career is not completely gone to the dogs--see All Is True, and Belfast.

A floundering beginning and middle make this film go from whodunit to who cares,"An adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel, Murder on the Orient Express has finally been released after months of Kenneth Branagh promising it will be an exhilarating experience. This film should have been a great mystery thriller because of the all-star cast and amazing source material. However, all that star power and pizazz can't save a plot with poor pacing and a director that can't decide how to use his cast appropriately.The film opens in 1934 with famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) solving a missing jewel case in Jerusalem. While in the city, Poirot meets an old friend, Bouc (Tom Bateman), who happens to be the owner of the famous Orient Express. Poirot is persuaded to ride the Orient on his way back home to Belgium. Along on the train are thirteen other finely dressed passengers. There's the governess (Daisy Ridley), the lustful widow (Michelle Pfeiffer), the gangster (Johnny Depp), and a host of other riders. One of the passengers is murdered after the first night and the culprit is one of the passengers. Poirot must use his world-renowned detective skills to catch the killer before the train arrives at its destination.The biggest problem the film has is the beginning and middle phases. The pace is uneven as it shifts from starting out slow when introducing Branagh, then quickly speeds through the rest of the characters when they are boarding the train. Characters are given little backstory to make them stand out apart from each other. Johnny Depp and Josh Gad are the only actors who have a fully fledged character that is memorable to watch and care about. The rest just fill in space and patiently wait their turn to get a few lines here and there. It makes it really hard to care about which character is the murder when none of them are that special to begin with. This lowers the level of suspense and mystery which in turn makes the film drag until the final act, which is actually really well done.Branagh as the director is another problem the film has. He constantly makes the wrong decision when it comes to camera placement. The amount of overhead shots is staggeringly high and they really don't serve any purpose other than to confuse and annoy. We also have a tracking shot of Poirot boarding the train that could have easily been improved upon if Branagh had filmed it from another angle.The production aspects of the film are really well done as they make the famous train setting glamorous and pleasing to the eyes. The decorations inside and around the train are lavish and really give off the impression that this is a luxurious haven for the wealthy elite. The costumes for each passenger are also really well done. They are the defining traits of the characters and the main thing that we remember them by apart from their faces.The acting here is inconsistent and only a few of the actors stand out in their roles. This is because the film has to juggle over a dozen important characters and their story arcs in only two hours. What we end up getting is a lot of Poirot and Bouc, but little of everyone else. Poirot himself is a very annoying character that tries to walk the line between eccentric and dramatic. His mustache is even more annoying to see on screen and it too is given more time than it deserves. It looks as if Branagh put it on to say ""Hey look at me! I look funny and you should laugh!""Johnny Depp gives a surprisingly good performance as the runaway gangster, Ratchett. He gives off a suave, but dangerous look that works perfectly for his character. He commands every scene he has while also playing well off everybody else. Josh Gad and Derek Jacobi also do a good job as Depp's assistants.Both Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. struggle in their medium sized roles. They try too hard to be memorable and end up making things worse. The absolute worst performance comes from Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton as the Count and Countess. They are insufferable to watch as the barely speak fluently and act with the same skills as an overly serious high school theatre student that is trying too hard to impress the director.Veterans Judi Dench and Michelle Pfeiffer do a respectable job in their criminally undersized roles. Dench plays a princess that knows she is more important than everyone on the train. Pfeiffer plays a widow that is searching for another husband as she recovers from her second divorce. She gets some show-stopping scenes at the end of the film, but it's too little too late for her character.Murder on the Orient Express is a moderately watchable drama where the stakes never feel that high and the suspense never reaches its potential. The quality of the film is like a seesaw with each scene going from good to bad to good again. It's an inconsistent pattern that makes the film average with not many redeeming features to remember it by.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fun movie, from a newcomer's perspective","I've never read any Agatha Christie books in my life, nor have I ever seen any previous adaptations. The only sort-of previous history I have with the character of Poirot is the parody in Murder by Death (1976).This movie was ridiculous but fun. I think that's often the case with Branagh, and he certainly raised the ridiculousness for this one. His accent went all over the place, ridiculous jokey scenes and his acting performance, not to mention his moustache.The shots were lovely and the ensemble cast did a good job. Can't say I'm a big fan of Depp the last few years but the scenes he had he did very well. He also had one of the funniest throwaway lines I've seen in a while. Something about dogs... the rest of the cast, including greats like Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and perhaps a future great like Daisy Ridley all did very well and showed their chops in the scenes they had.I couldn't really take it all that seriously but I enjoy that in my movies sometimes. Combine the ridiculousness with a good cast, good performances and quite beautiful cinematography... I can't complain too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Yes, Kenneth Branagh seems to like himself a lot but in this case it fits with this version of Poirot. The movie overall is pretty well done with great performances from a pretty stellar cast.

Only watch if you don't know the story,"When young, I was a big fan of Agatha Christie and I've read most of her books. Most of them have a ""unexpected twist"" at the end, which is probably the reason one just need to grab her next book. Needless to say, A. Christie was a master in playing games with readers mind. But you know how's with the stories that have ""unique"" twist at the end: one is surprised (jaw-drop) only reading/seeing them for the first time.
Murder on the Orient express is no exception: if you know ""the story"", then there's no point to watch this remake. Actually, compared to the book, this remake is quite poor and I can imagine, those who didn't read the book, may be disappointed (in sense ""what made this title so famous?""). We have a bunch of great actors, but none of them leaves a mark -except K.Branagh playing famous detective. I would blame a script for that. Let me explain:
In A.Christie's books, reader has always the feeling he can solve the mystery. Of course, reader's guess is usually wrong.. still, even after the crime is solved, reader still believes he could solve that, if he would pay enough attention when reading. Now, in this movie, that feeling doesn't happen.. it can't happen, because there's no time for small details and hints.
Regardless of my title above, I recommend the book.Being picky about details myself: landscape between Vinkovci and Brod (where story happens), is in reality totally flat.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst Poirot ever portrayed and worst Poirot script,"Is the worst Poirot picture ever filmed. Hercule Poirot is completely misunderstood by Kenneth Branagh. Is dull, thin, melodramatic, almost stupid, has a girlfriend, he fights!, he cried and sobbed!And the script is all wrong for a Christie's story or any thriller whatsoever. Like if the writer did not read a single Christies novel before writing the scriptIt anticipate the conclusion. It jumps to the evidence with no method. You have no surprise at all, because is like an spoiler all the time. OK that is a very famous novel, and has very famous films, but you can spot the end since the middle of the film. Is terribly boring.They want to be very politically correct, so they are many thing that are out of time, character and remarks impossible at that time. Is ridiculous. No rigor at all. Is not a serious effort. Poor Agatha Christie.The other actors are terribly wasted. Judie Dench, Olivia Colman, Derek Jacobi, Willem Defoe wasted.But, of course, lots of special effects by computer, that add nothing to the film, and a lot of takes for Branagh that has no respect to Hercule Poirot",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Murder on the casting directors part(?),"I often feel when Hollywood studios adapt acclaimed novels, particularly popular ones, that they are mocking me for having never read them - condescending in their attitude of ""oh, well you've heard of it, but you've never actually READ it, have you? Ah well isn't it so much easier to sit and watch the film now that we are releasing it anyway?""
Either way, as somebody with little to no knowledge of the source material, MOTOE is a fairly well directed, well executed, well acted by an all star cast (for better and for oh so much worse in the case of a certain actor whose name is nothing short of dirt right now) and has a twist that is fairly satisfying - that and I'm always a complete sucker for mystery/detective stories.

A single mistake,"I was quite saddened when I walked out of the cinema: it was very hard for me to accept that, while the film was nearly perfect in almost all technical aspects, a film that you could feel that those involved took their effort in making it as perfect as they could, it failed at one of the most important: its pacing.Let's immediately start with this issue the film had, which ultimately resulted in the rating I chose to gave it. The problem was that, particularly the whole murder solving part of the film, felt almost rushed, too quick. It all felt too obvious, almost too simple in deduction, as if anyone could have solved the case (and I, not having read the book or seen the previous film, did solve it a bit earlier than the revelation scene, due to the way clues where showed). My assumption is that producers allowed only a short lenght to the film, for commercial purposes, which lead to heavy cuts on that part of the film. I personally think that it would have been wiser to cut some of the scenes from the first third of the film: it takes about 10-15 minutes for the viewer to finally be aboard the Orient Express. Those 15 minutes, which did introduce Poirot and the other characters, could have been shortened or even cut altogether, in my opinion, even though they where fun, as they didn't focus on the main story. With a better pacing, the film could have decisively been saved.Another thing I didn't enjoy was the score: it felt too lightening, especially in the revelation scene, when it should have been much darker, and it being too lightening in that scene ruined most of the moral ambiguity that the finale required.Despite these two aspects, Murder had outstanding photography (I particularly liked the final shot), the settings (The choice of not displaying the revelation scene inside the dining hall, as, it is my understanding, Lumet's version did, but a much more scenographic setting), and notable is Branagh's impersonation and acting of Poirot, did with great cure, and which I particularly liked.Ultimately, I do consider worth my ticket, although not at the levels of satisfaction I hoped. I hope that, for the planned sequel, Branagh will reprise at least the role of Poirot.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good performances let down by the screenplay,"Murder on the Orient Express is the second most known mystery novel by the Agatha Christie, the best selling mystery novelist in of all time. And it's a pretty good book, with a very out there mystery which Poirot, in his usual manner, sums up in a seemingly impossible series of logical leaps right at the end as all the twists and turns are suddenly revealed.And therein lies the problem with this movie. Oh, to go over the rest, well it's fine and dandy. Branagh brings a great, thoroughly entertaining Poirot to the screen. Really he's the reason I enjoyed it at all. The rest of the cast feels like they're giving a good effort as well, even if most of them don't have enough screen time, or lines, to be as effective as they might have been.Heck I'll give an extra bonus to Daisy Ridley, who gives the best performance of all them next to Branagh himself, and that with far less screen time to do so. Other than being obviously too young for the part she's playing she's near perfect in the role. And while I'm praising the movie I might say I'd be tempted to vote it for best Cinematography in the Oscars. It's an absolutely gorgeous film at times.But, well it's a mystery film. And that's getting back to the problem that lies at the heart of it, which is that writer Michael Green doesn't give the audience nearly enough credit in figuring out what the actual mystery is; nor does he give the actual mystery part near enough focus. Unlike the book we are given far, far too many real suspects, and far too many hints and coincidences to really be blown away by Poirot's revelations by the end. Instead of a dramatic, shocking twist ending that makes the likes of The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense feel like they broadcast and foreshadowed their endings to the high heavens we just get an ""Oh. OK I guess. That makes sense.""And this preys upon the rest of the movie as well. It isn't an engaging mystery where the mystery itself is the star of the show, and we're honed in on trying to figure it out. Instead it plays more like a character piece with the amiable Poirot himself as the star, rather than the mystery where the focus should be. Which is a shame really. The writer does a very nice job otherwise of adapting a book that could be a stage play into something more filmic. All the characters are introduced well, taking Poirot's personalityless Watson clone/foil out entirely works out wonderfully. But a mystery without the mystery as the star really does fall short in a fundamental way.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Atmospheric, Superbly Acted, and Highly Emotional","This is Poirot as I have never seen him before.

All the shots either give a sense of the isolated cold winter outside or the tense claustrophobia inside the train cabin.Each of the actors give quite good performances. For Branagh, David Suchet's Poirot is a hard act to follow not to mention an Oscar-nominated turn by Albert Finney. However, he makes the Belgian detective charming, witty, likable, and portrays all the brilliance the character has to offer. Some of the other stand outs include an amazingly dramatic Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and suspicious, Johnny Depp oozes all the vile traits for a putrescent man, and Daisy Ridley plays a strong-willed and delightful character perfectly.This version goes in a not before seen direction by adding heart and emotion into not only the suspects, but even the detective himself. This is rarely seen in other incarnations, but Branagh gives chills of emotions while others leave you in tears by the charged ending.This is a wonderful blend of classical and modern film that Branagh has gotten so good at over the years with his Shakespeare adaptations.

Riveting plot,"""Murder on the Orient Express,"" directed by Kenneth Branagh, is a modern adaptation of Agatha Christie's classic mystery novel. This star-studded film promises a visually stunning and suspenseful journey aboard the famous luxury train, and it largely delivers on that front. While it may not be without its flaws, this adaptation manages to capture the essence of the original story while adding its own twist.The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast, with Kenneth Branagh himself stepping into the iconic role of Hercule Poirot. His portrayal of the eccentric detective is both entertaining and believable. Additionally, the supporting cast, including Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Judi Dench, delivers strong performances, breathing life into their respective characters.The attention to detail in recreating the opulent 1930s setting of the Orient Express is commendable. The train's luxurious interiors and the breathtaking landscapes it travels through are captured beautifully by Haris Zambarloukos' cinematography. The film is a visual treat from start to finish.Alexandra Byrne's costume design adds authenticity to the characters and the era. Poirot's perfectly symmetrical mustache, in particular, stands out as a work of art.Agatha Christie's story is a classic for a reason, and this adaptation maintains the core of the mystery. The gradual unraveling of the murder plot keeps viewers engaged, and the suspense is effectively built throughout the film.Patrick Doyle's score complements the film's atmosphere excellently, enhancing the tension and drama.The film, while visually captivating, struggles with pacing issues. Some scenes feel unnecessarily drawn out, which can detract from the overall suspense.Given the large ensemble cast, some characters receive more attention and development than others. As a result, a few feel underdeveloped and lacking depth, making it harder to connect with their motivations.While it's common for adaptations to take creative liberties, purists may find some of the changes made to the original plot and character dynamics a bit jarring. These alterations are meant to modernize the story but may not sit well with die-hard Agatha Christie fans.Branagh's exaggerated Belgian accent and Poirot's obsessive-compulsive quirks might come across as a bit overdone for some viewers, bordering on caricature.In conclusion, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a stylish and well-acted adaptation of Agatha Christie's classic mystery novel. It offers a sumptuous visual experience and successfully captures the intrigue of the source material. While it has its flaws, such as pacing issues and deviations from the original story, it remains an enjoyable whodunit that keeps you guessing until the end.

So I did not have a clue who was dead.( so no spoiler! An hour had passed and the rest of the film trundled along like a slow goods train, whilst Branagh did his stuff.

In fact had it been a musical, I was waiting for him to burst into song! Mercifully this travesty ended and we left.

A big misfire,"As director, Branagh cast himself as the main character and milked the opportunity as much as he could. This movie was all about him; and unfortunately that meant that all the other characters felt underdeveloped and the amazing cast underutilized. Perhaps if he was amazing in the role, it would have been forgivable for wasting the talent he had at his disposal; but he was not very good Poirot. His accent was comical, almost to the point of insulting; his arrogance was too much; and his moustache was just ridiculous. The opening act is completely irrelevant. We see Poirot in Jerusalem, where he's solving a case of a stolen relic. It set the tone for the movie by demonstrating Poirot as an all powerful God-like figure who knows all. It had nothing to do with the story whatsoever. As far as the main plot is concerned, it was unbelievably boring. This wasn't helped by the fact that the score was one of the dreariest in memory. but to be honest it didn't really matter because it didn't give me any clues to the ending anyway. Poirot would interview each of the passengers and we'd learn a little of their back story. Meanwhile they'd all be looking at each other suspiciously wondering who the killer was. I found the whole thing to be incredibly slow, and having taken against Branagh's version of Poirot. By the time we eventually get to the end and discover who the murderer was it was incredibly underwhelming. but as someone who didn't know beforehand who the killer was, I can't say I was too pleased when I found out. To be fair to the film, I guess that disappointment was the source material's fault. On a positive note the costume design was amazing as it fit with the period. I thought everyone was dressed very well. The movie also had a very nice set design, especially inside the train.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fine experience but it'll never beat Lumet's classic,"Yet another clumsy remake of a powerful classic trying to emulate its steps, throw a big cast and big budget, make some improvements in order to cash 
in and maybe entertain its new viewers or mostly the ones who can't stand ""old films"". To talk about this ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is kind of more of 
the same specially to those who watched Sidney Lumet's brilliant psychological study starring Albert Finney as famous detective Hercule Poirot. Most folks 
had seen that movie, gave it a shot to this one and thought ""well, there's something missing here"" or ""it's not good enough"". Lead actor and director 
Kenneth Branagh had one thing in his favor while making it: speed. The story flows more like an adventure flick in some parts, with some great exterior shots 
at times ruined by weak special effects while Lumet's film was more like a play where you could catch every nuance of each actor and each character the more 
the classic story progressed - and to resume for those who haven't seen it, Poirot investigates the murder of a mysterious man on board of the Orient Express 
while the train is stuck in the snow, interrogating all of the passengers, important figures or people of little relevance. 
 
I'm not a detractor of Branagh's film, in fact, I had my share of good time with it and find it very stylish, impecable costumes and art-direction, and 
in times where plot twists are common place for the same type of project, to bring back a little bit of class and long dialogues is something that it's worth 
seeing. The cast doesn't disappoint despite not having one prominent performance in it - and that's why the 1974 film was the better one. Branagh is a fine Poirot 
but far too eccentric (and I'm comparing it with the books written by Agatha Christie, who presents him as a man of rituals and manners but Branagh makes him look 
like a Phineas Fogg, evidenced in his opening scene with the eggs); Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, 
Josh Gad (finally breaking from his usual annoyance) are all good but no stand-outs here - maybe Dafoe grabbed my attention the most. 
 
However, I've found it an exhausting experience not just because I already knew what was going to happen but mostly the rush in presenting some things 
and slowing down anothers - the ending felt like a disappointment if compared back (sorry for the repetition) with the other film - of which I wasn't much of a fan 
during my first viewm neither the book (that chase sequence between Poirot and MacQueen was dumb). Lumet's ""canon"" version never loses momentum despite the play aspects of it, you're intrigued through it all while Branagh reserves some 
thrills here and there and then it becomes a snooze fest halfway through. It's like much ado about almost nothing (no pun intended with Kenneth's previous film), I 
haven't felt it was a necessary film or one based of Agatha's novel that was needed to be remade - she has several great mystery books that weren't made into a film 
or just became TV projects, I'd like to see a version of ""After the Funeral"". Good news is that the movie's apparent success excited Branagh enough to the point of already announce that ""Death on the Nile"" will come and perhaps new audiences will be interested in following the footsteps of the incredible Hercule Poirot. Challenge is: that one was already made in 1978, also an Oscar winning film and with a stellar cast; difference: as of now, I still haven't seen it. We'll see. 
 
Conclusion: ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is fine, entertains but it's far from being on the level of quality and memorable works where a gathering of movie stars makes you feel impressed or overjoyed with the experience. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excessively poor movie,"Although i did not expect a lot when going to see this movie, i was still very disappointed by the quality, or better said lack thereof, of this movie.The movie is incredibly (sub)standard in presentation. Eg showing train wheels moving with lots of noise all the time. And what is the purpose of showing the train blowing out steam and honking frequently throughout the movie. Should this impress the viewer? Or cover the lack of content of the movie?None of the characters sparks any interest. And in all honesty the story and the plot are also of no interest whatsoever. I actually had a problem following it, due to the enormous challenge of keeping at least some level of attention at the movie. I have not read the book, but i hope that it is significantly better than the movieI am certainly a movie lover, and go to cinema very frequently, have been doing it for >20 years, lots of art-house as well as blockbusters and have never written a review on IMDb. In this case i felt the need to share this info. Hope anyone else can enjoy it.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How do you tell a story when everyone already knows the ending?,"Agatha Christie was the queen of all things murder, and in perhaps her most quintessential story, she gives us an ending so incredibly inventive, so inspired, that few have dared repeat it. For the few of you who haven't read or seen Murder on the Orient Express before or had it spoiled for you, I won't tell you the ending. Suffice to say, it's extremely unpredictable and could only have been done by Agatha Christie.But for those of us who do know the story, how do you make it entertaining when we all know how it ends? Therein lies the genius that is Kenneth Branaugh. In the next installment of a stellar career, Branaugh shifts focus from the comedies of Shakespeare to the suspense of Agatha Christie and proves that his talent knows no bounds. Expertly directed and wonderfully cast, Branaugh's adaption keeps all the charm, glamour and suspense that Christie intended, while modernizing it for a younger audience. And for those who say the story is no longer relevant, I argue that Branaugh's true genius lies in the ability to make a period piece as just that: a period piece. While the story itself may not be as relevant as it was in its day, the lessons behind it are just as true today as they ever were. In perhaps her greatest work, Agatha Christie blurs the very lines of good and evil and causes even the great Poirot to question his long held morality.Was it necessary? Maybe not. But is that really the point? It's entertaining, the cinematography was beautiful (the murder scene especially), and it stayed true to the source material. I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it.Now, can we all please petition Kenneth Branaugh to remake And Then There Were None?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Watchable but highly unlikely to happen in that era,"This novel and its modern day adaptation of it only proved one thing: The females' logic and their reasoning ability are indeed not quite fully developed. It also explained why the ancient female-controlled tribal structure was gradually phased out to be replaced by males. All of Agatha Christie's so-called murder mysteries, just like nowadays murder mysteries written by female authors, lacking reasonable logic is the common problem that resulted why I always shy away from most of the female mystery writers, i.e., pure imagination without any logic foundation, full of poor reasoning and self fulfilled laughable justification.This ""Murder on The Oriental Express"" and her ""Murder on The Nile(?)"" are the two typical ridiculously written murder mystery cases. This murder case is crafted in the early nineteen century. We might have the primitive communication techniques such as telegram and telephone, but still not as popular and convenient as today's smart phones. Lower working class won't have such luxuries to contact each other by phone or telegram, albeit a bunch of unrelated strangers who didn't know each other. So how could it possible these people communicated with each other and make up a plan to get together and get the exact timing and timetable to go to a foreign country, aboard on a luxurious Oriental Express that usually only be affordable to the higher class rich people? The don't have iPhone or Samsung smart phone yet, they don't email, they don't have PC, they don't even have APP that could allow them to text each other, to cover up each other in a group murder on a train.From the very beginning, the storyline, the plots, the scenarios....are simply ""IMPOSSIBLE"", how come it could be further developed into a murder case? But, if based upon what I've pointed out at the outset, the female take-everything-for-granted logic could make everything happen, no matter how ridiculous it might be. That's why we have so many cartoon-like characters in this novel and in all of the adapted movies. You can still enjoy the film or the novel, but first, you've got to make yourself a moron to accept all the illogic dramatized and exaggerated crap.",,Anonymous,Mystery

All Aboard For Another Mediocre Adaptation,"Mysteries, a genre that intrigues so many with complex tales, intertangled deception, and often drama to help build suspense before the big revelation. While many people try to combine mystery with other genres, there are those who choose to focus on mystery alone. One of these artists is Agatha Christie, a forefront writer who continues to tease our brains with crimes that dive into deeper levels. And with great literature, comes great grounds for Hollywood to make movies from it. This particular tale has gotten a remake this weekend, one with a star-studded cast to try to bring people into the movies in this modern telling. What's in store? Please read on to find out as we review Murder On The Orient Express.LIKES:Setting: Start off with a simple like, this film is a shining example of green screen visuals blending with real world shots. The snowy wilderness of the mountains is a dazzling spectacle of symbolism that mirrors the foreboding crime that hangs over the Orient Express. It's a breathtaking display of technology that keeps the darker spirit of the movie alive, and may leave you chilled at the menacing nature hanging in the air. But the highlight is the train and the recreation of those elegant cars and cabins the locomotive industry was famous for. This recreation takes you back in time and immerses you in the classical setting, while also designing a death trap to which our players partake in.The Mystery: For a movie that focuses on the classic question of who done it, Murder on The Orient Express did a nice job keeping the mystery going. The screen adaptation drops enough hints to throw one off the path, all while keeping you engaged in deciphering the identity of the culprit. As our detective interviews all the characters, you will start getting an idea of how complex the whole case is, further shrouding the scene in a veil that tries to keep you from the answer. It works, keeping suspense going and the film moving, which isn't easy in mysteries these days.Kenneth Branagh: Acting wise all the cast do their jobs very well, some better than others in terms of screen time, elegance, and of course capturing their accents down correctly. Yet of all the group it was Kenneth Branagh who I enjoyed watching the most. True, he is the main character and thus gets the most screen time, but his acting was very enjoyable to watch for nearly 2 hours. His French accent is not the best at times, but he gets the OCD detective role down pat, catching the nervous energy and single minded focus that comes with the disorder. His explanations of the crime are delivered in such a serious tone, confidence filling the voice as he presents his logic and convinces you of all the facts. Finally, his comedic delivery is also very well done, not too forced and well-integrated into the conversations, Branagh carries a lot of the movie on his sharply dressed shoulders.DISLIKES:Slow: We know mysteries have to go slow to build things up, but Orient's wheels really slog at times. Primarily when it comes to linking a few backstories together, the movie sort of derails into from the path at hand. Losing this momentum takes away from the suspense, and sort of gets a yawn if you don't pay close attention to the dialogue. And even when they resume chasing the mystery once more they drag things out in a grandiose display that does hold emotion, but steps far over the line for this reviewer.Unbalanced Characters: A star studded cast again calls for time management and using your resources well. Orient took a nice shot, but they failed to really give the characters equal time on the screen. I don't know how the book is written, but it was obvious the casting favored certain actors over others. Certain characters really get the shaft in this installment, brought out of the shadows for mere seconds and a few answers, before dropping off the screen. This happened with at least four characters for me, brief introductions that were certainly important, but almost confusing at some points. Certainly, Christie did better in displaying her suspects in the book, but they didn't do it as well as I think they could.Rushed development: It's a plus to have a mystery that moves, it is not so much a plus when your key development areas move like a blur. Murder on the Orient Express involves one having to listen to the dialogue extensively to piece things together, primarily in the alibis of the characters. For me, there were a lot of rapid dialogue exchanges that hastily were spilled out in an attempt to give our characters some background. This background information is incredibly important, so perhaps they should have shifted to a lower gear to clarify this information and establish that depth they were going for. Such a shame to have all these details smeared in a half-sloppy manner when there was such potential to be had.The VERDICT:Compared to the book and the older rendition of this movie, Murder on The Orient Express 2017 is not the shiniest noire in the box. Great visuals, a luring mystery, a phenomenal main character will carry the audience far in this film and provide the main source of entertainment in the film. The main problem is that the team didn't deliver on the potential that this story/cast had. It was unnecessarily slow at points, characters were lacking in a very character centric plot, and it was rushed in areas that was the sustenance. Therefore, the movie overall is mediocre, and better left for a free pass/RedBox in this reviewer's opinion.My scores are:Crime/Drama/Mystery: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too Many Qualifiers to Recommend Strongly,"Is it just me or have trailers now fallen into the habit of selling movies as something they're not. I started noticing this trend sometime around last winter's Passengers (2016). The film was sold as a sweeping sci-fi space adventure when, what it ended up being was a weepy drama with sci-fi trimmings and the mentality of a 90's romantic comedy. Book of Henry (2017), Suburbicon (2017) heck even the very excellent Mother! (2017) all sold themselves as one thing then blindsided audiences by being something entirely different.The trailer for Murder on the Orient Express and the accompanying movie definitely fall into this trap, though not in the way you'd expect. It is, a point of fact, a candidly old-fashioned whodunit with a showy lead performance by director/star Kenneth Branagh at its center; that much you know. Yet if you're not familiar with the Agatha Christie novel, the stunningly overrated 1974 film or the even more unbearable 2001 made-for-TV movie, you'll be somewhat surprised that the whodunit at the head of this story is very much beside the point. This isn't a murder mystery as the title suggests but rather a social investigation on whether pre-meditated murder can truly be justified.The film begins at the tail end of one of detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) world famous criminal investigations. Tired and in need of rest, relaxation and Dickens, Poirot takes the advice of an old friend (Bateman), and hitches a ride on the Orient Express, a luxury coach that winds through the snow-covered Carpathian Mountains before chugging through some of Europe's most important cities. Finding a full train of interesting and potentially dangerous characters, Poirot's relaxation turns to suspicion when a known criminal with plenty of enemies, is discovered dead on board.During Poirot's careful deconstruction of events and motives we get a sense of Hercule's intelligence, poise under pressure and innate sense of justice. ""To me the difference between right and wrong is as clear as black and white,"" says a tired Poirot right before hopping the train. Little does he know that his brief holiday from crime will have him plumbing through the depths of human sorrow, guilt and anger, ultimately shifting his antiquated worldview.If you come into Orient Express with that in mind, you may end up having a pretty good time. Agatha Christie invented the popular Poirot for her many novels but the character is a creature of the stage. His mannerisms are big and his emotions are even bigger. Branagh knows this and imbues the super sleuth with a certain theatricality that works well in the cramped quarters of a gently rocking train. He has a stage and fills it with deeply felt emotional stakes. When the big third-act twist reveals itself, we actually feel for Poirot's internal struggle and hardly do we envy him when things start to fall apart.Of course getting there, and feeling for Poirot much less the rest of our characters involves entirely too many qualifiers for Murder on the Orient Express to warrant a strong recommendation. If you have seen the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, this newer, flashier version feels like an unnecessary remake. It's prettier and quicker paced but like a clear night in a big city, it just feels less impressive and has far fewer stars than you'd like. If you've read the novel then the film's fidelity to the source material may warrant some brownie points. But again, if that's what you're looking for than the 1974 version straight up does it better.If however, you're coming in fresh and you're jonesing for a good 'ol fashion mystery where you can play along at home thenI have some bad news for you. This movie (and let's face it, every other incarnation of the story), leaves the mystery to hang out just long enough for you to engage on an intellectual level then pulls the rug out from under you in the most unsatisfying of ways. I'm being coy because I don't want to ruin it for you but let's just say Orient Express has always felt like taking a final exam that you've been fretting over for weeks only to discover that everyone's getting an ""A"" regardless.So yeah, if you want to get the most out of this movie, you need to have either read the book or seen one of the films. You have to be at least familiar with Kenneth Branagh's directorial efforts and realize that the intellectual exercise in this case is not finding out who the killer is but spotting the differences and similarities between the many versions of the same story. The characters are as always interesting and as I said, this one is prettier, but the greatest version possible out of the source material, this film is not.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually stunning,"Let me first say this: many negative comments here are based on comparison with the previous adaptation of the book Murder on the Orient Express. My review is based on this version the way I just viewed it on the big screen. And even though the story may be known, even though it's a star vehicle with a group of big names and not all of them get the time to truly show their strength, it works in my eyes. Why? Because of the spherical way it has been filmed. In a way, it reminded me of the Grand Budapest Hotel. And I have to say, I loved it. The book was written for entertainment, the first movie was made for that and this movie has just one purpose and that's entertainment. A good night with visual pleasure. Not to find out who did it, most of us already know. It's the way it is found out that matters. People who say it was an unnecessary remake in my eyes are in love with the first version and rightfully they are. But that does not make their review objective. If you have an open mind, if you like to be entertained. Then go watch this movie and have yourself entertained. For me, it was a pleasure from start to end. Only negative... it's a bit short. And in the end, Michelle Pheiffer can sing a nice tune during the end credits.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not great, but not that bad either","Bottom line up front: This adaptation of the classic Agatha Christi's book is a decent who done it story and is very exacting in the details. While the film does not seem to follow the original book too well it still follows the book enough to allow the viewer to be engaged. This film also has a spread of characters filled by many cultures, which Christi did not do in the book, to appease the PC police, it is passable in this case.While I am not an Agatha Christi guru I have read this particular book and felt this film was a decent adaptation to the original story. The detective was exacting and in some ways compelling but that is pretty much where it ends. The suspect's, which many are played by well known actors/actresses are good but felt their talents would have been better spent on other projects. This was evident by the lack of character development in many cases. If the character development had been better I think this film would have benefited greatly but probably would have suffered from time limitations.Cinematography is pretty good and the effects, when needed were well done and complement the film. Plot line follows a Christi like line but does take a few liberal turn to appease the PC police. This is usually annoying but is not as bad in this film.If you are an ardent Christi fan I would avoid this film as it is likely to upset you. If you are a mystery fan more than a Christi fan, you may find this film worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
PURE EXCELLENCE!,"I've always been a fan of Agatha Christie, so when I saw this was a remake, I knew I would see it. When I discovered the mega-cast, it became imperative I saw it! But the cast wasn't way I had to see the movie; I had to see it because Agatha Christie is one of the world's greatest murder mystery writers!So when Hercule Poirot travels towards a case, he decides his ride will be a short holiday. Sadly, he quickly finds himself inspecting a case along his travel! He looks from a countess, to a doctor. From a chauffeur to a footman. From a co-worker to an actress and dancer- so many suspects... but Poirot gets it figured out.The movie is excellent and visually stunning! With an amazing cast and accents out the wazoo- I loved the movie just as much as the original. Sadly, I can't tell you too much about the movie without giving it away! Even stating the stars and what they do could mess things up for you! Primarily when I say who gets killed - but Dame Judi Dench is magnificent. I'm a little biased...If you are a lover of mystery and Agatha Christie, Murder On The Orient Express is your movie. Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Star studded good film,Kenneth started well with his witful acting. But the film could not keep up with that till the last. Top actors were studded here and among them i found jonny depp getting much attention in his character. There was always a suspence about the murderer and it was the only suspence after the murder.

A decent family movie,"I enjoyed this film - I wasn't sure that I was going to, based on the reviews I'd read - but I did enjoy it, in a mixed kind of way. This despite the fact that I remember the 1974 version, and the TV series version with David Suchet fondly.A lot of films nowadays tend to be big budget, all action, sweary-mary kind of films. It was refreshing to see a movie that was entertaining and suitable to watch with family members from teens to seniors.Hardcore fans of Agatha Christie may not be to happy with this adaptation/remake because of the way it's been Hollywoodified - maybe the finger can point to Kenneth Brannagh for this, as he directed and starred in the leading role (which can be seen as a vehicle for his success/reputation). Elements of the film had been modernised, primarily to meet expectations of it's potential audiences, rather than to drive the films on. It was fast paced, moody, sexy and clever at different times - but I don't think it actually needed to be or should have been. The cast was undeniably brilliant, and between them they probably have a massive trophy collection - but did it need to be? I suspect that if the cast was an attempt to do a star studded feature like the 1974 version then it meets that expectation. If the cast was chosen for acting prowess, then perhaps unknown stars could have faired equally well because the film isn't about personality and connecting with the characters, it's about their story. (Perhaps the use of superstars was a clever way of diverting the obvious revelations from the audience so they kept on guessing 'whodunnit' too.)If you haven't read the book or seen the other versions you might get more enjoyment out of this than anyone who knows the story. Either way though this was a decent family film which wasn't offensive and was made to fit for modern audiences. I'd watch whatever follow-up is planned (and hinted towards at the end). 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Everyone is a suspect,"Being based on the book with the same name that came out in 1934 by Agatha Christie, I know what the book is about and who the main detective is in this book and the other books he is in, but not having read the book I was hoping this would be an entertainingly fun murder mystery. Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was an investing fun murder mystery that made me put things together along with the detective and question certain things about each character in the movie making a mystery that well done and nicely handled.Kenneth Branagh as detective Hercule Poirot was particularly good in the role; being skilled at what he does but can also be a bit funny when needed, with a hint to his past. The cast in the movie was great, having a lot of big names like Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Johnny Depp; all the actors in the movie are great each character having their own story that could connect to the case and having their own personality. Also, there are moments when meeting each character and questioning certain events that happen that could be because of the character's actions or the train they are on.Kenneth Branagh not only plays the detective, but he also directed the movie, and he does a respectable job giving the movie a 1930s feel to it; the train looks good being well shot and visually nice to look at in this snowy landscape. The cinematography is pretty giving with nice camera shots outside and inside the train making it a nice location for a murder mystery to take place. Also, the mystery was not too obvious to where it is easy to know who the culprit is, but it is easy to follow so you can connect things at the same time Hercule Poirot when he either finds a body or clue.Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was an investing fun murder mystery that fans of murder mysteries or Agatha Christie's murder mystery books will like; good acting, a good mystery, and a detective who is likable and you want to solve the case. I will not say this movie is perfect or anything, but I do recommend giving this film a watch, even if you are not into murder mysteries that much, I think you can find enjoyment and suspense in this.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Murder Mystery in the Classical Style.,"""I need a holiday, I need time in my hands"" (sic), are the words of Hercule Priorot with the acute if not astute observance of a famous detective renowned for his excellence in detecting. Accordingly, it seemed, Priorot ate my words as that was my sentiment as I went to see this film adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel at the cinema recently.The film's cinematography laid bare the scenery through which the steam train chugged through snow clad mountains. The film set left, it seemed, nothing amiss, and the attention to detail, from the decor to moustaches to hairstyles of the period, was perfection itself. And yet, such extravagant a visual feast seemed worthy of more than the modern day cinema with its minimalist theatre and pop corn munching audience.And while the period was given attention to detail, the director, Kenneth Branagh, who also plays the Belgian detective, forgot that in a freezing cold setting we should see breath belching from the mouths of the characters during the outside scenes in the frozen isolation of the mountains, where the Orient Express runs aground. Likewise none of the characters appeared cold, or shivering. This is especially given that they are all suspects in the murder case.The suspects are played by such a rarity of an all star cast with none other than Kenneth Branagh, Johhny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dame Judy Dench, Derek Jacobi, Willem Defoe and Penelope Cruz to name a few.And so if you love murder mystery, and Agatha Christie and plush, period settings and snow covered mountains, then take a look at this film.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Beautifully shot, packed with perfect actors, captivating movie","First things first: I haven't read Agatha Christie story. Shame on me.

Somewhat slow ensemble mystery,"I think this story would have better been served as a limited mini-series on TV than as a movie. There are SO many characters that need to be developed for both the mystery and for the sake of just developing the characters so we care. But 2 hours isn't a lot of time. If it weren't a cast jam-packed with stars, it would have been even harder to care about them. Because there were sooo many characters, I found myself a bit bored at times. It was just impossible to get to know everyone enough to feel invested in them. That said, the conclusion at the end was quite good - how it all came together and the who/what/why/how of the murder. I hadn't evet read the book, so I didn't know how it would end, and the conclusion did surprise me. If you're looking for a suspense/thriller, this is not that.

Avoid this at all costs! See the 1974 Sidney Lumet version instead!,"Kenneth Branaugh receives the raspberries for this unnecessary remake of Dame Agatha Christie's classic novel. Having seen the 1974 version when first released, it was full of glamour, as a period piece set in the 1930s should have been, and each character was fully developed. Branaugh spent too much time and energy with his development of his portrayal of Christie's sleuth, Hercule Poirot, that the development of any other characters failed to occur. Branaugh focused on Poirot's obsessive-compulsive disorder to make his own character three-dimensional, leaving all of the suspects characterizations as one-dimensional MacGuffins, to use a Hitchcockian term. Another weak point in this film is the dramatic score, which contains nothing memorable other than Michelle Pfeiffer's vocal over the closing credits. Lumet's 1974 film contains a score by Richard Rodney Bennett, lushly orchestrated with hummable themes that complement Geoffrey Unsworth's beautiful Panavision cinematography. Although Branaugh's version was shot with 65mm cameras (the same ones used by Christopher Nolan for ""Dunkirk""), the process was wasted here since most of the shots in the film are confined to a set, and only the exterior shots benefited from its use. Super 35mm (what was once known as SuperScope), Panavision or digital cinematography would have been just as suitable for this production. Lumet's film also made use of an all-star cast whose acting skills were well proven in advance. It's unnecessary to list the cast here, as it can be viewed on the IMDB page for that version, however this version has few recognizable names, and some will even enjoy the fact that the murder of Johnny Depp's character occurs less than halfway through the film, and that his screen time is kept to a minimum! Sitting through this poorly-done remake of what was previously filmed with style, class, and glamour in 1974 is a waste of time. If you want to view a great whodunit, beautifully crafted, with excellent characterization, see the Lumet version. Dame Agatha Christie claimed that Lumet's version and Billy Wilder's 1957 film of ""Witness for the Prosecution"" were the only two films that did justice to her literary work.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not for classic Poirot fans.....!!!,"Once you've watched the classics this can't be fulfilling. I don't think it is terrible but couldn't create the magic of a slow whodunit. Like Jeremy Brett can't be surpassed as Sherlock Holmes (no offence to Mr. Cumberbatch), there's no point questioning David Suchet as the Poirot Madam Christie would've dreamt of. Mind you there's some lovely picturesque and some strong performances too but something is missing, something which keeps you bound to a murder mystery; was lacking. Kenneth Branagh, I think is a bit rigid, a bit strong. The subtleness and the mischievousness of David Suchet is what I missed may be. The plot can't be wrong as it is a classic in itself. In the end, for the newer generation it would be watchable but for the older fans who have seen David for decades scratching his little grey cells, this would never suffice....!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lavishly constructed whodunnit,"Murder on the Orient Express has a central twist that's pretty obvious regardless of if you've seen or read any previous iterations but it remains a lavishly constructed whodunit that's got plenty of emotional weight and thanks to that remains very engaging regardless of the reveal.Both directing and leading the film Kenneth Branagh's performance could've been self obsessed but his rendition of Poirot commands the screen and is really funny. There's plenty beneath that surface as well, seeing a character so obsessed with right and wrong face a moral grey that makes him question everything is thrilling.Everyone else here is giving a performance in the literal sense of the word. Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe and Michelle Pfeiffer are the best but at 109 minutes with a cast this large some unfortunately get lost in the mix, including Olivia Colman who is massively overqualified for the role.Behind the camera Branagh proves that claustrophobia breeds creativity with camerawork as methodical as his character whilst managing to get in some of his trademark canted angles. The music by Patrick Doyle would almost go unnoticed if not for one deeply affecting piece that communicates sadness wonderfully.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredibly disappointing,"I am an avid Agatha Christie fan. Murder on the Orient Express is a timeless classic. It is hard to mess this up, but Branagh managed to do it.He over played the role of Poirot. His mustache was way over top and totally distracting in every scene. There were many inconsistencies in the movie....scenes of the frozen mountain here the train is trapped in an avalanche frequently shows the cast outside without a coat, or sitting in a freight car with the side doors completely open, wind blowing their hair WITHOUT COATS or any signs of being cold; and then at the end, in the big reveal scene, Branagh WEARS A COAT!! but later briskly goes up and down narrow steps covered in 'ice' without any caution and gets inside vehicle WITHOUT A TOP...in the snow, in the mountains, in the winter.The cast of this movie is outstanding, so it took some effort or arrogance to mess it up....but Branagh succeeded.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The star studded stellar cast including the likes of Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, the excellent Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer and Star Wars actor Daisy Ridley deliver first rate performances, in an adaptation with enough nods and tweaks from previous incarnations to remain fresh as Hercule Poirot's famous Belgian Moustache.A simple must see for film sleuths.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting remake,"As a huge fan of Agatha Christie, I find myself thrilling by the idea of another movie adaptation of her books, and I was not disappointed by this one.
This remake is an interesting try, with good casting, amazing photography and very good acting from Kenneth Branagh. It is clear a great challenge to play this role after David Suchet, who's by far my favorite Poirot of all times and the most talented Peter Ustinov, and, in my opinion Branagh interpreted Poirot in a fresh way, focusing on his wits instead of supporting its ""caricature"" side. Of course Agatha Christie at her books praised this features of her detective, but even though, the main power of Hercule Poirot always was his little gray cells and his upright character, qualities that Kenneth Branagh brought to life successfully.However, I cannot give more than 6 stars because of that almost unbearable,dreadful mustache! Whose idea was that and Why?
Please, if there's another movie, spare us from this mustache.
Also there were some useless fighting scenes and the completely unnecessary mention of a past love of Poirot. That spoiled Poirot's true nature according to the books

Depends on your frame of reference...,"It's funny how the reviews are all over the map for this movie. I came into this cold, I'm not an Agatha Christie aficionado, haven't read her books, have not seen the 1974 movie. So using that as a basic guideline I thought Kenneth Branagh did an excellent job with this movie both in direction & acting (hamming it up) as Detective Poirot.The style, the sets & the scenery of this movie are Sumptous, to say the least. I don't think I've ever used that word before but that's what came to mind while watching it. I was connected to the story, the characters and I was entertained. And this type of movie is certainly not the norm in 2022, it does feel both modern & old-school Hollywood. I watched the trailer for the 1974 version & maybe you had to be of the age to enjoy it back then, but seeing the trailer now, I don't know if I could even give the '74 version a chance. That 70s melodrama etc, don't think I can do it. But many reviewers favorably compare that movie to this one, for whatever that's worth. Guess u'll have to decide for yourself.So depending where you land in age, Agatha C experiences might affect how you feel about this movie.

Strong start,"I felt it started out really well and had a great atmosphere while getting to know the detective. The atmosphere even thickened some once he got on the train and you begin to see each of the characters interact with each other, but once the murder happens, that I when I feel the movies starts going down hill.They then throw in some racism ""they might find him guilty because of the color of his skin"" and feminism with one woman saying ""I know I am just a woman"" when she is giving the inspector some information. This is part of the reason that movies made in this day and age are 99% bad movies. They always have to ""empower"" women or point out racism against blacks. It's tiring and why I don't go to the movies anymore. I mean seriously, why would I want to pay to watch a movie that is going to tell me how racist my race once was and how women were considered lesser once? I will admit, this movie only touched on those two touchy subjects, which is why I gave this movie a 6 and not a 1, but it is ridiculous how 90% of the movies made now have racism and feminism in them.Moving on beyond that, I did enjoy the movie, but I knew who the killer was half way through the movie.

"Christie fans, take the express to see this new, lovely version of a classic","Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh, who also directed) is, by his own admission, the world's greatest detective circa 1930. Its true. Using his ""little gray cells"" he has solved some unsolvable crimes. At the start of the film, in Israel, Poirot discovers who stole a rare, bejeweled artifact and it wasn't a rabbi, priest, or iman, as suspected. Now, Mr. Hercule just wants to get back to London. His mode of transportation is the famous Orient Express, from Istanbul to Paris. On board, he meets kind folks like Mary (Daisy Ridley), a governess, Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom, Jr.), the grand Mrs. Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Princess (Judi Dench), among others, and a man described as most unpleasant, Mr. Ratchet (Johnny Depp). In fact, when Ratchet finds out Mr. Poirot is on the train, he asks him for a huge favor. Ratchet, a self-described art dealer, insists someone is trying to ""off"" him and wants Hercule to protect him. Poirot says no, for he has his doubts about who Ratchet truly is. As the train passes through mountains, an avalanche stops the train in the early morning and it is soon discovered Ratchet was murdered in the night, even though he slept with a gun. It appears his late night coffee was drugged. One of the first things brought to life, too, was that the dead man's name wasn't Ratchet, but Cassetti, and as such, was the kidnapper/murderer of a young girl, Daisy Armstrong, some years before. One by one, Poirot interviews the rest of the passengers, trying to find a killer. Could it be his secretary, McQueen (Josh Gad), who was stealing money from his boss? Or perhaps it was the Austrian professor (Willem Dafoe) who seethes with hatred for others? The culprit, whom Poirot DOES uncover, is almost beyond belief! Who done it? Thie classic tale is a feast for the eyes and ears. The scenery is breathtaking and the script witty, amid the horror. Then, too, the cast is superb, each doing fine work, especially Branagh as Poirot. Needless to say, the costumes are likewise wonderful as they recreates the garb of the thirties. Perhaps the only criticism might be leveled at the pace, as it is slow at times. Nevertheless, discerning movie goers will want to EXPRESSLY make a date to view it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasantly surprised,"Although not a patch on the 1974 original, this totally unnecessary remake proved to be not as bad as first feared. Kenneth Branaghs portrayal as Poriot which I initially viewed as hilarious in the extreme given the ridiculously comic moustache he donned for the role culminated in a rather convincing performance with me totally buying into him as Belgiums finest ever detective. The film although beautifully shot is still just a little too glossy and smooth, lacking the atmospheric tension of the original. The plot is pretty faithful with the cast doing what's expected of them, although some like Penelope Cruz had peripheral characters who offered little throughout. Remaking a whodunnit especially a famous one seems rather pointless, as most people will know who the culprit is anyway. But nonetheless I was pleasantly surprised, it is worth a watch and if Branagh returns as Poriot in Death on the Nile as is hinted at in the films finale, then those little grey cells may get another outing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Remake of famous Agatha Christie story.,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. In truth a highlight for me was in the VD ""extras"", old clips of Agatha Christie herself explaining her writing and where inspirations came from.This is a sort of vanity project for Kenneth Branagh, directing and also starring as Hercule Poirot, a fictional character who is the best detective in the world. He sounds French but he is from Belgium where, near the French border, they speak French.The term ""Orient"" has not meant the same thing in all historical times. Derived from the Latin it vaguely refers to places East of Europe. The Orient Express in this story is carrying mostly Brits and Europeans from Turkey to Calais for an eventual leg to England or Germany.So Poirot and others board the train and at night a notorious man is found murdered. Poirot's task is to use all his detective skill to solve the murder. It is eventually solved but the real entertainment are the characters themselves. Agatha Christie stories aren't anymore what I suppose they were 70 or 80 years ago. Still the movie is appropriately entertaining.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Interested in this one? Well...,"Incredible Hercule Poirot returns and it's Murder on the Orient Express that will have to take his presence once again. Going into this movie knowing how Poirot established himself as great detective you will probably find it very delightful and sweetened but as soon as serious action and plot kicks in you will realize that it's not what you thought it will be. You have seen how serious cast of the movie is and without blink of an eye you will want to see this, it's not to blame you but after coming to screening of it the excitement will come down as movie starts to come to it's end. Samuel Ratchett is murdered and Poirot tired and on vacation gets into his role and solves the crime one more time. It started pretty amazing and with potential but as story went it just kept losing it's so much needed tension and it will just lack that mystery that keeps movie like this going. Pieces of puzzle start to get into it's places as you find out more and you realize movie is trying to play tricks with you but if you have been careful you will not get distracted and will find movie pretty astonishing from directing point of view and there are some pretty beautiful scenes in movie. Plot is also great but somehow it just can't live up to it's true potential which will get you stuck to you seat and in wonder what will strike next. Directing of Kenneth Branagh was pretty amazing and also his contribution as main character Hercule Poirot as which he gave a truly good performance proving his talent over and over. Rest of cast featuring Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Tom Bateman gave probably as much as any of them had some of them even stole scenes more than others but they didn't have that power of intimidation that could help us being dragged into picture and scenes. Movie was stunning to watch, cast was very good at their job but they just could get their hands on attracting audience enough to care for all mystery. One more thing portraying journey and placing actions of movie between Vinkovci and Brod was pretty amazing seeing all scenes but showing it as mountains that even Alps could envy considering that part of Croatia is the flattest and mountain free was just absurd but all in all it was amazing scene. 2.5/4",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Using creative angles you rarely feel that the cramped setting of a couple of carts in a train is ever an issue, rather it's taken advantage of well by using the long lengths of the carriages. You're sometimes intimately placed in the middle of the conversation and sometimes looking down upon the cast which you can recognize immediately by the unique styles of each and every one.If you, like I, have not seen the original we can consider ourselves lucky (at least according to user Bob-the-movie-man) and I do consider myself lucky to have went into this movie knowing about the original but not yet seen it.

Amazing Remake!,"Murder on The Orient Express is a remake from the previous Orient Express from 1974, a movie with Hercule Poirot in the main role, this time played by Kenneth Branagh.

Someone was murdered on the train, when Poirot is on vacation and want relaxation, he got very annoyed over a new mystery. But he is Poirot, and he has to solve it. Johnny Depp didn't have a big role but I think he did a good job at playing what he was supposed to play. Kenneth Branagh was the best, and Judy Dench did her job great, too. The music and the picture was amazing, and the length was just fine. The mystery itself was amazingly storytelled and presented. I was surprised over and over again, and that feeling continued across the whole movie. Some violence, that gave the movie a creepy and bloody atmosphere, and the deep look of Poirot was amazing. That look, was full of fear, but courage. I think that Hercule Poirot in the more humorous and funny way is good, compared to other Hercule Poirot's.

Not bad but not Breathtaking.,"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS- 68%
I am still surprised this movie (which had an amazing story and phenomenal actors) didn't really amaze me. 
Before i give detailed feedback, I must say that the camera work in this movie is astounding. 
Okay lets talk about the story... the story is absolutely brilliant but had very poor execution. I felt bored in between, which is never an ideal situation in a crime/thriller. 
Lets see the acting. 
I was quite disappointed with performances from Johnny Depp and Willem Dafoe. I was incredibly impressed by Josh Gad, who really showed how flexible he is as an actor. 
The rest of the cast had good expected performances. 
The ending was very artistic which saved the movie from being a terrible waste of time.
Story wise and execution: 18.9/35
Acting: 15.8/25

A solid adaptation of one of the most famous murder mysteries,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017) is an adaptation of probably the most know book written by Agatha Christie. I haven't read it, but in my life i saw probably at least 2 or 3 adaptations of it - in TV series and few movies. So the whole revelation was well know for me. Yet this movie is a solid one even if you know the story at this point very well. Then cast in this movie is one of the kind, and everyone did a solid job with limited screen time they had. Directing and acing by a lead was solid. Its fun to see another incarnation of this legendary detective.Overall, if you never read of watched previous adaptations of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" you should definitely check this one out. It features of the most famous revelations at the end, which is still works. Great cast and solid directing makes this a solid watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
an useless remake,"With all due respect to Mr. Branagh's ilustrious career as actor and director, one question arises in my mind: WHY? Why ruin an exceptional book, and a brilliant who-dunnit plot, only for the ambition of YOU playing the Master of little grey cells? Yes, Albert Finney played a poor Poirot in 1974, mumbling around and shouting, but the assembly cast was remarkable: starting with easy-to-hate Ratchett/Widmark, to the other exceptional actors. Of course, the 2010 version, with David Suchet ((= Hercule Poirot as would've been blessed by Dame Agatha Christie herself...) was the most accurate, from start to finish, beautifully played (even there, were some weak characters but, Poirot WAS top of the act). Now? Poirot involved in fist fighting, holding a gun (?), watching with deer-like eyes to his lost love Katherine (not Vera Rossakoff, everyone?). climbing on top of the train, Arbuthnot changed as rase and behaviour (sorry, Mr. Connery!), Penelope Cruz was not a good choice, even Johnny Depp plays a poor Cassetti, going down the hill, and easily forgotten, the Andrenyi guy a martial arts expert (really?!) and, of course, THE moustache (like a cavalry colonel in India or Burma, in late 20's). Of course, some hints of a different view on the plot arised from the trailer, a while ago but, come on, folks! Sorry, but I think I've lost 114' of my life, watching this poorly directed/played so-called ""remake"". Unfortunately, the world of cinema continues to go down, slowly, living out of remakes (Death Wish on the run, right?), poor acting, and vision lost. Hardly a fresh adaptation of a brilliant book: where is the thrill of any Poirot mystery? Long gone, after the 25 years Poirot/Suchet reign, sorry. The Sherlock Holmes from Guy Ritchie was not Jeremy Brett, but it was fun to watch. This one, no. I rate it 6 only from enormous respect to the work of Agatha Christie (who made this movie possible, after all) and to the efforts of Mrs. Michelle Pfeiffer, the only true actor in this 2018 version. I am SO disappointed...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classical and timeless,"""You tell your lies, then you think no one will know. But there are two people who will know. Yes, two people. Your God and Hercule Poirot.""(I have not read the novel. Thus, this review is not comparative.)First of all, the plot is quite exceptional. It is neither really fast paced nor really slow paced. Yet, it keeps you hooked.For me, this starts with my admiration for such high intellect and Hercule Poirot's interesting character: He probably has a form autism, is resilient, a true gentleman, respectful, yet unyielding when it comes to logic. He owns who he is in such a self-reflecting way that one will keep watching just for this.However, the crime is also quite intriguing as we learn about the perpetrator's true motive and how most of the passengers actually have a relation to this. It does point to a glaringly obvious question: Was it justified morally?Additionally, the characters are all rather round, complex ones with their own lies, lives, and passions. This is really refreshing. It makes it interesting to guess about their stories because the characters themselves are perceived as interesting.The acting is also very good. All the characters are truly brought to life. The acting adds great nuance to the dialogues, highlighting the individuality of each character.Furthermore, I absolutely love the cinematography. The people responsible really have an eye for aesthetics. The snow, mountains, train and clothes have a really unique flair that is underlined by stunning video sequences of astonishing nature.Especially the camera angles highlight the emotions and gravity of each moment. Sometimes, even the (emotional) distance is represented by the chosen frame. By this, there is even left room for interpretations on nature vs. Human nature's destructive tendencies extending not only to themselves and others, but also to nature itself. This way, we may ask, whether humans can overcome their own (destructive) nature or, more fundamentally, asked what the human nature actually is like.Lastly, the music is used sparsely but on point. Primarily relying on the natural sounds, such as footsteps e.g., adds to the expectant, mysterious, and therefore eerie, atmosphere. It adds to the purpose of delving deep down to the roots, down to the very nature of human atrocities.To sum it up, I was utterly amazed as it was a pleasure to watch Hercuke Poirot's great mind work.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fascinating transposition,"Taken from the homonyms novel of the world-famous writer Agatha Christie, this ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is presented as an alternative film version to that of 1974.
What most attracts the viewer is surely the cast that makes use of many big names such as Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Penélope Cruz, Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, Judi Dench, Willem Defoe and Kenneth Branagh, who also directs the film.
Being a choral film, however, none of the roles allows us to offer memorable performances, given the limited amount of time available for each character, even if all manage to provide more than discrete performances, except for Branagh who, being the protagonist, naturally has more space and, also for this reason, he is distinguished from other interpreters and gives the public a perfect transposition of the famous inspector that is well interpreted and that, thanks to its characterization, mostly aesthetic (the bizarre and huge mustache), manages to be immediately recognized by viewers who have already read the famous book, because he is simply the same, or at least I could not ask for a better transposition for this character.
What instead differentiates this film particularly from the book from which it is taken, is the narrative structure: if the book is linear (the various interrogations are carried out one after the other) and precise, especially in the details, the film is much more dynamic, fast and less linear; this decreases the possibility for the spectator to be able to process the various clues but allows the film to be much more entertaining, light and if we also want fun and engaging; a type of narration that lends itself much more to the big screen than to the pages of a book and, for this reason, I consider a right choice that of Branagh to make everything more movement, thanks for the most part to a dynamic editing, a presentation of the characters more hurry but functional and a pressing and immersive soundtrack, entrusted to the two-time Oscar nominee, Patrick Doyle, who had previously worked with the aforementioned.
As for the direction is also very dynamic, Kenneth Branagh uses, in fact, often the use of dollys to be able to achieve many long and precise machine movements, moreover many of the shots are studied in detail and, if on a hand, this scrupulous search for the perfect film gives an excellent aesthetic appearance, on the other it hurts a bit the fluidity of the film: in some moments I have had more time to notice the various virtuosities of the director than to pay attention to the story, precisely because in some cases distracted me. Despite I liked them (the virtuosities) some have me just surprised and pleased, I would have preferred a little 'more naturalness, in some moments, by the director without having to always have to look for the perfect framing or the perfect camera movement.
For the rest I was very impressed by the cinematography that gives the film a modern look without betraying the historical period in which it takes place.
In general I found it a great transposition and a good entertainment film that can satisfy various types of public without disappointing any.
Now I just have to see the 1974 film and wait for the future sequel of this version.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Painfully dull,A very self-indulgent film from Kenneth B. Lacks any form of pace and compulsion to keep viewing.Having a stella cast does not mean it will automatically give you momentum.

Murder on the Orient Express (2017),"I remember enjoying Sidney Lumet's original adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel. It felt long, but was thoroughly entertaining. The remake had me slightly intrigued. Mostly because it had a really good cast to boot. I'm not the biggest fan of Kenneth Branagh's directional efforts, though I quite liked the live action Cinderella remake. With this film, we have a rather dull and uninspiring effort that does little to warrant its creation. It looks nice but feels like a wasted effort.The film follows ""the greatest detective in the world"" Hercule Poirot as he is stranded on a train with other passengers. One night a murder occurs as one of the passengers is stabbed to death. It is up to Poirot to find out who committed the crime, while realizing the passengers on the train may not be as random and innocent as they seem. Branagh both directs and takes the lead role of Poirot in the film.That's kind of where the problem lies. Branagh as Poirot takes center stage, and its a little too centered. There is a real talented cast here, that is not much more than background characters with limited material. Judi Dench is in the film and is rarely involved with screen time. I think Branagh is good as Poirot but the film kind of plods along and doesn't garner enough interest or shock as it goes along. The film feels like it just states the plot without delivering it for the audience.The film remains quite faithful to the novel and is closely similar to Lumet's adaptation. I wanted more liberties taken to provide for a worthy and innovative adaptation but I can understand why it isn't that way. The film does not make use of its potential, and is an inferior adaptation of the novel. The visuals and picture is prim and proper but the film derails along the way which is unfortunate.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Drama but watchable.,"The concept and plot is good. I didn't guess the murderer. As usual, Agatha Christie fooled me every time. But there are a lot of things in the movie which I don't like. Firstly, I want to say that it's better than Crooked House. This film is a little bit of drama and a little boring. But at least it didn't make me feel sleepy.Second, the accent is killing the film. I know that some people like to have real national accents. But for viewers, the accent is quite difficult to catch, especially for me. I put a lot of effort on listening. So, I prefer British accent or American accent. Thirdly, it might just me. I don't see the built-in translations for French. Not everyone in the world knows French, you know. Thankfully, the one I watched had Chinese translations, so, I could understand what they were saying in French language.Finally, some scenes are not clearly, especially the camera angle changed when they shot the dead body. The viewer can't see the wound on the dead body clearly. That is the only fact that made me angry. Maybe the director didn't want viewers to be afraid, I guess. But my opinion is that if we could see the wound on the dead body, it'd be great.Finally, the train. That train seriously has one exit door?Okay, all in all, it's not that much perfect but watchable because of the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not awful, but not great either. Just a decent, probably unnecessary remake.","I saw this film at the request of a friend, and was less excited going in than I usually am when I go to see a new movie, as I saw this movie getting mediocre reviews. That being said, this is a very decent film. If you like movies that are shot and acted in a very traditional way, you'll like this film. That is to say, it's a murder mystery, which isn't done much these days, as well as mostly shot in one small location, which doesn't happen in most films as of late. It has some really great talent in it as well, but does do that thing where there's big name talent that doesn't do much (like, Judi Dench is great as always, but WHY IS SHE HERE SHE HAS LIKE ONE SCENE). If you already know the story of this film, as it is a remake, you could probably skip it, as from what I can tell there really isn't anything new done here. It's very well shot, with the acting and directing performance from Kenneth Branagh being very notable, he does a great job in both roles in this. The whole cast does a pretty good job (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad, Judi Dench and ESPECIALLY William Defoe are all favorites here), although there are a few corny line deliveries and the computer effects and makeup are sometimes kinda distracting (at one point I turned to my friend and asked; ""It's 2017, why does the train look like the Polar Express?""). Overall, I'd say if you're a fan of old movies, you'll like this film. It doesn't have anything offensively bad with it, it's just not the best film in the theater right now. 6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Fun whodunit murder mystery.,"'Murder on the Orient Express' features an ensemble cast and is almost entirely set on a train. It is a classic whodunit murder mystery, but with a reveal I did not expect. I wasn't entirely happy with this outcome, but it does make sense.Kenneth Branagh stars as Agatha Christie's famous detective, Hercule Poirot. Hercule is a very observant man, and so prone to perfection it might even be considered OCD. Alas, I suppose that makes him the good detective he is!Aboard the Orient Express, we meet a host of interesting characters, each with their own agenda. When a man is found murdered on the train, it is up to Hercule to find the culprit. As he starts interrogating the passengers, it becomes clear there's more than meets the eye, and almost everyone had a motive.'Murder on the Orient Express' is visually beautiful with good cinematography. It is a stylish film made in a lighthearted manner, without being a comedy. It's never too serious and never too funny, allowing for a pleasant viewing experience.

Overall very well done rendition,"In this new rendition of Agatha Christie's 1932 murder mystery, Murder On the Orient Express, director Kenneth Branagh stars as Hercule Poirot; the world rebound Belgian inspector. In this all-star movie we see actors such as Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and Willem Defoe. However, many of them were given not much more than cameos as Branagh perfects his own part.
During a lavish trip on the Orient Express, famous inspector Hercule Poirot expects a relaxing journey instead has to race against time to find a murderer. As an avalanche blocks the Orient Express, Poirot uses this to his advantage to find the killer. Not only is everyone on the train a suspect, we soon come to learn that many of them have a strange connection to the Armstrong case and a motive of revenge for the fallen billionaire.
There have been many depictions of not only Agatha Christie's Murder On the Orient Express but also the famous inspector Hercule Poirot. Hercule Poirot is described as a very confident man, who is very attentive to details, as said ""I can only see the world as it should be. And when it is not, the imperfection stands out like the nose in the middle of a face. It makes most of life unbearable. But, it is useful in the detection of crime"". In this version, I feel that Kenneth Branagh played Poirot exquisitely, but a tad bit overdramatized at times. As for the rest of the all star cast, we see Josh Gad portraying Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to Ratchett, he shows more of a range that we normally don't get to see from him. As always Michelle Pfeiffer, was amusing and entertaining as she played the rich chatty husband finder Caroline Hubbard. Other actors such as Willem Defoe and Judi Dench, though perfected their roles as a German professor Gerhard Hardman and the Russian Princess Dragomiroff, were given not much more than underwritten cameos. I feel that the screen time could have been better divided betwixt actors.
The overall design of set, costumes and makeup almost perfectly match the time period and create the cozy but yet mysterious atmosphere. The wardrobe matches the time period as well as the characters themselves. The women wore long silhouettes that go just above the ankles, which were a new trend in the 1930s, as well as pantsuits and pinned up hair. Men wore suits which was proper in Europe, very few wore leisure wear as it was not the custom in this time period. For example, Inspector Poirot's attire matches his OCD personality, he wears a clean cut suit, everything is is place including his facial hair. The setting of the train quite accurately represents the furnishings of those in the 1930s, a very lavish a luxurious club car represents the feel that the Orient Express is trying to convey.
If you have ever read or seen Agatha Christie's Murder On the Orient Express you know the whole whodunit mystery.

Off the Rails?,"Murder on the Orient Express, a modern adaptation of Agatha Christie's classic whodunit, is a testament to the enduring allure of her signature style. It features a locked room mystery, where a group of strangers trapped together with a murderer among them, and all of them are suspected. This Christiesque narrative approach thrives in the hands of Hercule Poirot, who, amidst a cacophony of deceptive utterances from the suspects, masterfully unravels the perplexing web of deceit.However, despite the thrilling plot, the grandeur of the Orient Express, and an all-star cast, this adaptation somehow manages to derail itself. In an unfortunate twist, Kenneth Branagh, who takes on the iconic role of Hercule Poirot, appears to have brought his own oversized ego aboard the train. While Poirot's eccentricity is part of his charm, Branagh takes it a step too far, leaving the other characters in the dust and turning this ensemble piece into a one-man show. (It's as if he's still playing Gilderoy Lockhart!) This departure from the spirit of Christie's narrative is disappointing, leaving this adaptation, despite its visual opulence, trailing behind both the original and the 1974 adaptation. It's a puzzling outcome, where a murder mystery's most significant mystery is why it couldn't live up to its own legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Worst remake ever!,"I loved the 1974 version of that story directed by Sidney Lumet. Back then, the stroy was plausible, and the characters were interesting and the plot males sense. In the 2017 version, I was expecting to see the same characters, but unfortunately some were simply replaced in prder to fill some affirmative action quota I imagine.The historical innacuracies are immense, for example the fact that you had black and white interracial couple on the train, and the black man was a ""respectable"" doctor who was some sort of soldier before. The strory doesn't fit, since in order to go to medical school (which was way more elitist back then), you needed years on prep school or private tutoring. Besides, there were black doctors in the US, bit they were part of an elite, and attended the Historical Black colleges and Universities. Talking about affirmative atcion in tye movie, in the end we see a very dark skinned black soldier posing as Yugoslavian, a nation so intolerant that they were killing their own neighbours because of a different accent (most recently in the 90s, especially Bosnia).Then, we had a Hungarian Prince married to a Jewess girl, when in nobility, we know that interreligious weddings are gery often forbidden (in the UK, there are rules against an Anglican marrying a Catholic for example). That didn't happened then, and even nowadays there ar no incidents of interfaith families in the high nobility (by the room he got, we see the prince was a hot shot).Then there are the German bashing moment that every Hollywood movie insist when in the year 1934, the country was still a democracy, and the references to ""the war"" are annoyingly every minute, when Agatha Christie's books deal mostly with the upper classes, who are not involved in conflicts.Again, the director includes some token characters: a mexican chauffer, a german assistant, and a Russian countess, who were almost absent from the plot, and could be better used.

Captivated Throughout,"Kenneth Branagh stars and directs the thrilling instalment of Murder on the Orient Express, an Albert Finney, Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery classic original which turns 50 in 2024.After a murder takes place on a train journey, a detective decides to investigate and find the culprit amongst the passengers aboard. In the process, he also learns the true identity of the victim.We've all idolised the distinctive silver moustache of the world's greatest detective - Branagh has an extremely difficult job in portraying the famous Hercule Poirot as well as directing the production to his own taste. The picture is masterful! The warm, shaking train setting offers a tone of uncertainty to the image on-screen. This contrasts to the harsh surroundings that the express comes across, the glistening snowdrops falling onto the pale mountains. This uncertainty creates a tense environment among the suspects of a murder case which remains unsolved. Branagh brings a fantastical feel to a slow-moving picture which contains excellent, well-timed moments of humour in slick, conversational exchanges so that even the light-hearted moments of the film can bring comfort to the gritty and dark concept.Amassing over $350 million, 'Murder on the Orient Express' boasts an extremely impressive cast, Daisy Ridley is one name among many, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, William Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz and Olivia Coleman all contribute to the events depicted on-screen.

The bones of Christie's mystery are at least good enough to carry this update for the uninitiated,"It doesn't take a detective to deduce that this remake/reimagining of Agatha Christie's esteemed novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was about 20th Century Fox trying to overloading a movie poster with big names in hopes of big box office returns. Yet in the hands of Kenneth Branagh, who directs and also stars, the film avoids a complete slide into gussied up, hollow period mystery.Branagh plays literature's second greatest detective, Hercule Poirot, whom screenwriter Michael Green (who had a huge 2017 with ""Logan"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"") wisely treats as the centerpiece of the story. Poirot could simply have fulfilled his functional purpose as the audience's eccentric mystery-solving surrogate, but the film commits to him as a central character, whose journey in some ways supersedes the crime itself.Hoping for some respite aboard the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to France, Poirot reluctantly becomes chief investigator on a case when a passenger is murdered on the train. He then interrogates the passengers, which include the likes of Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Oliva Colman, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr. and more, slowly revealing secrets and deceptions until he cracks the case.Having neither read Christie's novel nor seen previous film adaptations, I can't comment on how this update compares, but its tried and true bones provide sufficient entertainment. The film relies a little heavily on interrogation scene dialogue and the glee of Poirot spouting off some genius bit of detective work from evidence we hadn't considered, but the twists that clearly made ""Orient Express"" a classic find a way to work their magic regardless of any changes or tweaks in this version.That said, Branagh's tone is one of fantasy and heart more than a gritty, claustrophobic thriller. He's more interested in the thematic elements that complicate and layer the truths that Poirot uncovers than crafting a gripping, heart-pounding genre film. Curiosity is the entertainment factor he wields rather than suspense. It's meant to provoke our intellect and our sense of wonder above anything else.Green's script misfires mostly in regard to the mystery within the mystery, or the backstory that Poirot uncovers which proves to be integral to his solving the case. It doesn't quite make the necessary emotional ties. Yet Green's commitment to playing out Poirot's personal story arc and coloring in who he is with some small details makes up for it. He's a character I certainly wouldn't mind seeing on the screen again.The actors playing the passengers don't get nearly the same legs to stand on, so most of the flashy names on the marquee are just that, flash. Only ""Star Wars"" star Daisy Ridley manages to show off some chops in her brief scenes and in a way Gad gets to show he can do more than comedy. All in all, despite each getting one-on-one time with Branagh, there's not much in the way of meaty, dramatic content.Given my inexperience with this classic mystery story, it's impossible to say whether this version has enough to hold on to for those with greater degrees of familiarity. My instincts say it might be a close call - knowing the truth will surely place more strain on Branagh's interpretation of Pourot. So climb aboard at your own peril if you hold a deep reverence for Christie's novel or Sidney Lumet's 1974 version. Objectively, it's an engaging film suitable for mainstream tastes.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretentious and boring,"This was a remake that should never have happened. Boring, overly long dialogue that never went anywhere, a Poirot who was unlike the Poirot we love in the books, unnecessary additions/removals from the book in order to make the characters more ""modern""... And what the hell was the point of adding Pilar?? She was a perfectly interesting character from another Poirot novel. It really, really distracted me hearing her name.This is not a movie for fans of the books, or even fans of the series with the amazing David Suchet. I've read all the Poirot books and watched all the David Suchet episodes. This movie is a poor and pretentious imitation.I have to say, however, viewers who have zero knowledge of Poirot will likely enjoy the movie. Both my siblings loved it. So, show the movie to someone if you want to introduce them into the world of Agatha Christie, but avoid it if you are already a fan.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining Adaption.,"I am a late starter on these films, I started with A Haunting in Venice which I absolutely loved. Then I thought I would visit Murder on the Orient Express. I knew the casting was stellar, we all know the story, but I was comparing it to how much I enjoyed AHIV, so I'm afraid Murder on the Orient Express fell a bit short for me. Regardless, I still enjoyed it. What is there not to enjoy? I really enjoyed MP in her role, she was mesmerizing and possibly the highlight of the whole film for me.

Branagh is the McCartney of movies,"Some people have it: the ability to enthuse other people in their projects, however rubbish they actually might be. Maybe it's people who recognise a gap in the market for a contemporary remake of a detective story written around a hundred years ago. Branagh is such a person, as is McCartney in terms of keeping the memory of a very lucky pop group alive.There are people who don't know whodunnit, who are the target market.Unfortunately, this movie is about Kenneth Branagh and his wonderful ability to do woeful impressions of other actors - he even gets Poirot's moustache wrong, here it looks like a slug that's slithered through the dog's bed. As for his Belgian/French accent, well; Dick Van Dyke's Cockerney one in Meery Poppuns is now forgiven.Is there anything Branagh can't spoil?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The already trivial story of murder,"A film with caricature performances but that amuse, script that intrigues but it does not stop seeming a great script of series, in spite of being inspired in the great book of Agatha Christie, and a good direction. Agatha Christie's books full of mysteries, intrigues and twists are phenomenal, a pity that today would hardly work in a visual audio work, the fault of the thousands of series that do this, perhaps not always with the same perspicacity, years and 24 episodes per season, so the whole mood of the mystery of the movie nowadays is almost trivialized by the infinity of similar audiovisual works, even though it may not contain the same charm. The film pinpoints attempts to address social issues but does not focus on it, the focus is all centered even on the unfolding narrative of the murder in question, and that is a good thing. The film has a very good direction, almost all happening in a claustrophobic train with narrow walls and tiny rooms, the director arranges subterfuges to gain space in the train and to show its history completely, for example, the great cameras with vision panoramic view from above, or the sequential plans lining up characters, besides having a beautiful photograph, but a rhythm that makes the viewer feel too much the floor of the film. With a spectacular cast, it's hard to say anything negative about the film's performances, but even with a magic cast, we do not have any masterpiece in terms of acting, but Kenneth Branagh does well as Hercule Poirot. The film changes some details in book relations, many serve and crutch for character development, and some are very well developed and others not, the film deals with justice and reminds of glimpses up to spectacular ""twelve men and one sentence"" in the final speech , but it's just a fun and enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Mustache Did It,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 stars)GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This film gets derailed in its confused storytelling, a less than stellar cast, and some misdirection...facial and otherwise.SYNOPSIS: Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery is remade for today's modern audience.JIM'S REVIEW: I think it was...Kenneth Branagh...on the train...with his mustache...that killed the movie. The who, what. where, and how may be answered in this unnecessary remake of Murder on the Orient Express, but the ""why"" still nags at this moviegoer. Why dig up this buried gem when one could easily view the far superior 1974 murder mystery classic by Sidney Lumet and his all-star cast of screen legends (Finney, Bergman, Bacall, Connery, Redgrave, and such)? Can this new treatment with state-of-the-art CGI, a more expensive budget, and a cast of today's recognizable actors improve upon this tale of murder and deceit?￼The answer is a resounding ""no"" in comparison. The specter of Mr. Lumet's masterful film haunts this earnest but standard remake. It's foolhardy filmmaking that does little to improve its literary source. Whereas the 1974 version streamlined a convoluted plot, focused on some fine directorial touches, brought an air of elegance in its elegant Art Deco decor, delivered some interesting well-written characters, and added a first class tier of legendary actors to its roster, this new, but far from improved, update muddles its complicated story, provides stagy direction, has an dark sedated period look, introduces some characters in need of more clarity and motive, and brings a second class group of celebrities to this remake (combined with a few star-worthy replacements). Overall, this 2017 tale has lost all of its sense of glamour, wit, and fun.It seems that rebooting and re-imagining has taken the place of creativity these days. So with that said, my remainder of my review on this latest attempt to fill the pockets of the producers and filmmakers will try to concentrate on only this movie...a hard task, indeed.￼For those newbies unaware of the plot: Aboard a high-class speeding train, is super sleuth, Hercule Poirot. It is there that our fussy Belgian hero meets a shady criminal who fears that he will be killed before disembarking and asks our fastidious detective to prevent his demise. Alas, the deadly deed does take place (no real spoiler here) and the list of passengers become his targeted suspects as he unravels the mystery. Clues are scattered through the narrative as, one by one, each traveler converses with Monsieur Poirot. Rest assure, the culprit (or culprits) will be found by the film's end.The casting is paramount to make this mousetrap work. Mr. Branagh serves as director and lead actor and his dual contributions are a tad uneven. As a director, he layers the narrative with some skill but never involves his audience, choosing to look more at the panoramic scenery than concentrate on the characters. The screenplay by Michael Green doesn't help matters either. The film begins with a totally unrelated crime that establishes Poirot's quirky behavioral traits but adds little to the plot, except confusion.￼However, Branagh the Actor captures the detective's dialect and his mannerisms well, but he is essentially miscast by his own physicality...and his odd choice of including that ridiculous fur- piece posing as a mustache to the Poirot character. Yes, it is a trademark of the sleuth, but, seen here, it is an absurd facial prop that interferes with the character and the story. He takes the term ""stiff upper lip"" far too literally. Always upstaged by the damn mustache, the actor fights for equal screen time and loses the battle. Plus the fact that the actor himself is rather tall and handsome upends Agatha Christie's unlikable but beloved toady character.￼Some ""stars"" match their predecessors with style (Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer), others acquit themselves rather nicely (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr. ), a few are underused and underwritten (Willem Dafoe, Olivia Coleman, Derek Jacobi, Johnny Depp) but some haven't a clue on how to create a memorable character (Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz). In their defense, the writing may be suspect too.￼Jim Clay's fine production design shows off the opulence without the elegance. Cinematography is first-rate and the period costumes are true to the period but hardly show- stopping. However, the CGI avalanche scene is so fake and jarringly bad that is literally stops the film cold.No, this cinematic game of Clue remains a mystery. With all its fancy trappings, Murder on the Orient Express may look the part. But under closer examination, some less than stellar casting bits, a few excessively theatrical moments, and a meandering script make this whodunit more of a ""why-do-it"".￼NOTE: Those unfamiliar with Dame Agatha's book or the previous aforementioned Lumet film may enjoy this movie more than those already acquainted with the story and its twisty ending. I was mildly disappointed with the end result.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film Liquet on Murder on the Orient Express,"The world's greatest detective's (Kenneth Branagh) trip through Europe comes to a halt when a murder mystery unfolds aboard the train. Covered by an avalanche, the train passengers are all stuck in the train with the killer, as the detective races against time to solve the crime before the killer strikes again.Not far from the other three screen adaptations, the 2017 remake of the Murder on the orient express does not present the film with an active question, solving the mystery for the viewer it lacks engagement and therefore is made as a passive audience film. Even though it does not stimulate the viewer to ask active question after, the film does indeed succeed at telling a murder mystery plot. Sweeping us off our feet, as any deduction made by us along with the detective is then dismissed and started anew.With good set design and good cinematography, the film tries to capture the aesthetic of the 1930s, however fails to do so, as the visual effects, used to recreate Istanbul, do not stand up to the expectations of a large budget feature film. Although the design of the set is everything imagined upon hearing the words elegant and beautiful.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mediocre and dull, unfortunately","A mediocre murder mystery movie. If you're not familiar with Christie's Poirot stories or David Suchet's version of Poirot, you might find this film more entertaining than I did. David Suchet does so impeccable job as Hercule Poirot that it's almost impossible to beat. And as someone here already said, Branagh's Poirot is from time to time more like Mr. Monk than Mr. Poirot. Branagh's Poirot has too many quirks that don't feel like ""Poirot's quirks"" but more like Mr. Monk's or someone else's. So, I'm sorry to say, but I didn't like Branagh's Poirot.The plot has a couple big holes in it, which makes the film bit clumsy. Maybe the erased scenes would shed some light to few things. Nevertheless, the film is ""easy to watch"" and scenery is beautiful. Not a mind-blowing spectacle, but not totally garbage either. So, if you have plenty of time to watch films, you could check this out, but if you don't have that much time to watch every mediocre film, choose some other movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mediore Piece Of Nothing,"Oh my God. How can it really be possible? A great cast, with such stars as Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp or Daisy Ridley among those, pretty good director and the lead character who is Kenneth Branagh, seemingly lossless plot, a classic Agatha Christie train murder story... and what we have is a horrible, grotesque, crooked, over-played, over-done, over-cooked, over-made up, over-made, over-performed, over-everything piece of truly fetid garbage. What is even more insulting, the movie is a tedious endless ebb boredom fest.
 Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and a half stars, and stated that he felt it focused too much on Poirot to the detriment of the other characters, adding, ""Never let it be said the director misses an opportunity to place his star front and center, unfortunately relegating just about everyone else in the obligatory International All-Star Cast to a paper-thin character with one or at most two defining personality traits.
Truly so.
 Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club rated the film a C+ and complained that Branagh's ""erratic direction-more interested in cut glass and overhead shots than in suspicions and uncertainties-bungles both the perfect puzzle logic of the crime and its devious solution.""
Very truly so.

A bold venture that became a stunning movie,"Being a lifelong Agatha Christie fanatic, and of course having seen the magnificent 1974 version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" literally dozens of times, I was very curious to see what Mr Branagh, who had actually been bold (not to say crazy) enough to attempt a remake of it, had made out of it. I tried to go into it with an open mind, yet sure that it simply CANNOT be as good as the original. Well, I was mistaken: at some points, it's even better, unbelievable as this may sound.Where he deems it adequate, Branagh makes some changes and additions, like the very first scene set in Jerusalem, where he also introduces himself with an enormous moustache (make no mistake: Dame Agatha had actually described Poirot many times as having a really big and extravagant moustache!), the fixed idea that his breakfast eggs should have exactly the same size, and a twinkle in his eye.Then we get to know the first suspects - familiar territory for those who have seen the 1974 movie or read the book, but with a new twist: Colonel Arbuthnot is now a black doctor, which adds a nice note to his romance with Mary Debenham. Then the Istanbul train station - one of those moments where the new version surpasses the old one. A genuine Turkish chaos, through which Poirot, his friend Bouc and the other travellers have to make their way to the train.We meet Mrs Hubbard - and very soon we stop comparing Michelle Pfeiffer to Lauren Bacall; she's different, but she's just as good. Ditto the other passengers; in some cases, Branagh sticks closer to the book than Lumet had done, and the casting in each case is brilliant. Then the train sets out on its journey - magnificent shots of it moving out of the station and into nowhere. As the plot unfolds, we see familiar elements mixed with breathtakingly beautiful outdoor scenes; while Lumet had decided to keep the whole thing confined to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the train compartments, Branagh enjoys making us see things from various internal and external angles. No matter which approach you prefer, they're both brilliant.The only thing critics might claim as a minus is that Branagh's Poirot is perhaps a little bit too heroic, even to the point of personally fighting off and pursuing attackers; scenes that were never in the book, but in this day and age a movie probably simply can't do without them anymore. Anyway, as for the portrayals of the famous Belgian detective: while David Suchet simply WAS Poirot, Branagh, just like Finney and Ustinov before him, creates his OWN Poirot - a new version, but a most lovable one. And Branagh does a great job both as actor and as director - after having watched this movie I'd go as far as to say that, actually, he's a genius.Unless you're totally biased and unwilling to accept new approaches to classic works of literature (like the many different Shakespeare productions that are being played all over the world), chances are you are going to be very much impressed by this uniquely bold and beautiful remake.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More visually interesting then engaging,"Hercule Poirot solves the titular crime in this lovely but somewhat bland version of Agatha Christie's famous story. The cast of A-listers are sumptuously dressed and bejewelled, and the luxurious train interiors nicely recreated, but the characters always seemed more like characters than like people, giving the film an artificial, stagy feeling. Having not read the Poirot books, I'm not familiar with the character, but Kenneth Branagh seemed OK as the somewhat obsessive-compulsive Belgian sleuth. Judy Dench, Derek Jacobi and Johnny Depp were as good as always, but I found Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Caroline Hubbard unconvincing. The plot is interesting, if implausible, and the look of the film is fine, although the CGI images of the train moving through the Carpathian(?) Mountains were substandard (at least when viewed on my TV). OK, not great, and a reason for me to hunt down the 'star-studded' 1974 version for comparison.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Kenneth Branagh, the greatest figure of literary adaptations since Laurence Olivier, is at the top of his game!","I often thought, if the 1974 classic had to be remade, it had to be with Branagh as Hercule Poirot. But it got even better as he was also behind the camera on this remake. First of all, you cannot find anyone better than Branagh to pull this off both as Poirot and as a director. Secondly, the other actors were cast remarkably. I especially enjoyed Judi Dench, Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer. And Daisy Ridley reminded me why it was still worth it to see The Force Awakens in theater, she pulled it off well.I also have never had the chance to appreciate Branagh's directorial work this much since his 'Hamlet' (1996) until this particular film, the visuals are great,cinematography is brilliant. This is a film you want to see on the Big Screen. I cannot wait for the follow-up 'Death on the Nile'.

"Quibbles aside, I preferred this version to the 1974 film.","Yes, one can quibble. Yes, Branagh's Poirot moustache was prominent enough to qualify for separate billing, and only once, upon his waking do we see it encased in its own individual overnight casing.
Qualifying as a more serious 'goof; is that the multi passenger-car Orient Express was reported to us, the audience, to be filled to capacity; yet there are only a dozen ticket-holders in evidence. Granted they occupy first-class compartments, and the rest of the coach cars may well be filled withe invisible hoi polloi segregated from everyone rich, famous or had a motive to murder, and forbidden to enter the club or dining cars. It seems the screenwriter was determined (thank heavens) to speed along the journey by ignoring each inconsistency as if it were a third-class passenger trying to enter the clubcar or an avalanche threatening to impede the pace of his plotting. 
On my plus side are the performances, evero one of which equalled or bettered their 1974 incarnation. Of course, no one EVER betters john Gielgud in any role, but I preferred Branagh to Finney, Although AF is a favorite, i found
d his Poirot a bit too stodgy and forced. Michelle Pfeiffer reminded me she knows an d uses her craft, as did Johnny Depp, who masterfully and consistently chose an intonation and vocal rhythm unlike I've heard before from him.
Does anyone know the background of Sergei Polunin? Is he related to that clown genius Slava Polunin?
Also on the plus side for me was Kenneth Branagh's direction. The 1974 version moved like cold molasses, and some of the acting seemed like star turns rather than ensenble work. I appreciated Branagh's comparatively brisk direction that momentarily whisked us though and past an infelicity in the script. The denouement chugged and then halted along with the train. Perhaps it was blocking: the actors arrayed in a row, waiting for Poirot as if they were at an employment agency agency awaiting a chcck and, hopefully, their next gig. Yet I do not regret for the two hours spent in their company.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A decent, but forgettable Sunday afternoon flick","Murder on the Orient express is a forgettable Sunday afternoon flick. There is nothing special about it, there are no stellar and breathtaking performances, there are no nerve wrecking scenes or spectacular music. This is a movie I would recommend if nothing else is on the TV (and I do believe that was the intention).Two things must be distinguished from one another. The first is the directing and acting, and the other the story. The first is spectacular, the other is a cliché to the point of non belief.Branagh's direction is surgically precise and to almost every point flawless. His effort to make the movie look and feel like a novel was achieved as one can actually see where some chapters end and others begin. He has no unnecessary prolonging of scenes or dialogue, the execution is ""to the point,"" bright and concise. The viewer is never bored or tired as Branagh switches from scene to scene, depicting character after character, and the background changes simultaneously as the characters and scenes. There are also interesting camera angels and long one-shot scenes that make the movie visually very interesting. But there is much more to a movie than just technical and directorial precision.The actors had a really ungrateful job. Most of them had just a scene or two in which the were expected to execute their roles and lines to utmost perfection because no second chances were given. That does explain the all star cast consisting of Dench, Depp, Dafoe, Pfeiffer, Cruz, Jacobi, Gad etc. All of them did their jobs respectively but most of their performances lacked heart and or soul (with the exception of Gad who was really quite good at his role and Pfeiffer who had a little more to say than the rest of the cast). The most disappointing were Cruz (whose performance was way over the top) and Odom Jr. (who was not fit for the role at all).Most of the discussions were pointed at the performance of Branagh himself. His take on the legendary Poirot was, different than what we are used to. NO comparison will or should be made. All of the actors who portrayed Poirot had their views and ways they approached the character, and so did Branagh. As his directing, his acting is flawless, precise and his ability to switch emotions and portray different thoughts just with an eyebrow or gaze is amazing, not to say a bit disturbing. Even though he is not what we are used to as Poirot, he really did an amazing job and stands out among all the other brilliant actors with which he worked with on this movie.The story is, another problem. Considering that the novel was written about 80 years ago, the standard that we are used to in murder mystery thrillers today is far beyond what we are served here. It is unfair to criticize the screenplay when the source material hasn't aged well, and if one pays close attention to all of the clues, at a certain point somewhere at the middle/last third of the movie it is really not that difficult to put all the pieces together. The conclusion lacks a climax because the viewers are still under the impression of what we today consider cliché, that the grand reveal becomes anticlimactic. And therein lies the greatest problem. No emotions, no thrills, no WOW factor. Just a bland, expected conclusion that leaves one a bit disappointed. Again, that says more about the aged novel and not the screenplay.All in all, entertaining and suitable for more than one viewing, but unfortunately forgettable. I cannot shake the feeling that not much more than that was the general idea of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
