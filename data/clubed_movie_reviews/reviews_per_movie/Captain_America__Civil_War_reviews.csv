A master class in screenwriting,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents;
then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain America: Civil War is one of the best in the MCU,This movie has a fantastic plot and brings all these characters perfectly on screen. The conflict between Steve and Tony is written so well.

Excellent character dynamics,"Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the ""correct"" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Br√ºhl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Captain America: Civil War"" Pits Two of MCU's Biggest Heroes in One Epic Confrontation","The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited ""Civil War"". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties.""Captain America 3"" starts off where ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.It is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel's Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in ""The Winter Soldier"". Though ""Civil War"" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America's saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.Kudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel's lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast's collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.For all the makings of a summer blockbuster, ""Captain America: Civil War"" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel's other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU's future, including Tom Holland's ""Spider-Man"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More of the same,"Aren't you getting sick of seeing the same characters doing the same things? How many Marvel movies do we need this year? Maybe its just me but I'm getting bored seeing the the same old stuff.The first half of the this movie was extremely dull as they set up the premise for the civil war. You'll know exactly when it starts getting exciting. Its moment you saw in the previews when they introduce Spider-man. In fact, Spider-man was my favorite part of the movie and the only reason I didn't hate it. His lines are funny and his interaction with the other characters is very entertaining. Tom Holland will become your favorite Spiderman.The only other part of this movie that I found entertaining was the other new character Black Panther. Without these two new characters this movie would just be same old characters doing the same old stuff. Yes, Marvel has great characters and great actors to play those characters, but that doesn't mean I want to see a movie with them every other week.P.S. If you haven't seen all the other Captain America, Avengers, and Ironman movies you'll probably be lost. I believe all movies should be able to stand alone, even in a trilogy, but if you haven't seen those other movies you're not going to understand a lot of whats going on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now this is a good superhero movie!!,"Hi,  I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME!  Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing!  Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done  with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 10/10  Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or  iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin  in the series. 8/10   Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing  action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING.  You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  20/10.   Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn  close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Huge amount of spectacle & character moments,"When an incident involving Wanda Maximoff causes a deadly explosion in Lagos, the UN want to regulate the use of the Avengers.'Captain America Civil War' is an enjoyable but slightly overlong MCU movie that has some fantastic spectacle and strong character moments.The plot has an excellent premise with a plausible world reaction to the exploits of a group of people with superpowers and a good villain. Where it slightly falters as a stand-alone movie is the introduction of several new characters that somewhat bogs down the proceedings, but for the wider franchise narrative (and expansion) it is necessary. Several characters have emotional arcs to go through in this story and there is only so much time to do it all.All that being said it has some of the best moments of the franchise, particularly during the scenes of internal conflict amongst the central characters. Iron Man, Black Panther, Captain America and the Winter Soldier are involved in some very compelling scenes, as are Wanda and Vision.Some of the visuals are incredibly well done. The early Lagos action scenes hit like a sledgehammer and you can almost feel the impact of what is being shown. The airport showdown is excessive but so much fun you can imagine the writers planning a fanboy's ultimate fantasy. The final confrontation is well made from a spectacle and character perspective.The first time I saw it was my first sight of the digital effect that makes actors appear younger. This is a very impressive use of CGI that feels like real movie magic.All performances are strong especially Robert Downey Jr and Daniel Bruhl.It's a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exceeded my expectations.,"I loved every second of Captain America: Civil War. Everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. This movie is everything Batman V. Superman should've been. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times!

a wonderful character study to go along with the BEST action I've ever seen!,"At the start, the film finds Captain America yet again adjusting to working under the increasingly morally ambiguous ways of the new Avengers structure. The set up is masterfully done. This is the fifth time we've seen the character and it's remarkable how complex and how much depth has been layered on to developing this icon. The Avengers film touched a bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, and Winter Soldier drove the point home. Following that classic sequel, Civil War is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of Captain America but also give Tony Stark a perfect finishing arc and more development himself. What makes BOTH Steve and Tony interesting aren't their abilities or weapons but the men themselves. Steve's moral code and ""man out of time"" elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming. The viewer that normally would trust that Cap is doing what's right can look at his actions in a different light. He is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era. Putting Bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the Winter Soldier movie has changed him. It's exactly like all the epic events and decisions Tony Stark has made over five films has changed the character of Iron Man. The resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be.Like in Steve's last solo movie, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life. Tracking down his old pal Bucky, who was once an amoral assassin and a mind controlled Russian thug, proves to be a catalyst to everything that happens. Everything happens and unfolds in a believable and an intelligent manner. Every single ultimately cool character gets a chance to shine including Bucky but also incredible new characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man. Each one is fleshed out wonderfully for their supporting roles. Again, beyond cool.I really enjoyed both previous Captain America films but this movie is as dark and exciting as Winter Solder but also adds a degree of depth. This movie has a whole new flavor and that's exactly what was needed and what Marvel does so well. The 1940's romance and even the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" tone fit the first film quite nicely. The conspiracy thriller vibe of the second film was refreshing and so well done. Here, just like the Cap character, adaptation is a key. What they deliver with this Civil War feels fresh and is certainly amazing. Steve is still a patriot but he's continuing to question authority. His old-fashioned values pay off in many cases but here, are they leading him astray? Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. Yet, being old school stubborn can result in missing key points and can result in bad consequences. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos and we all can relate to him. He is out-of-place and he is old-fashioned but proud of that in a way. In a movie like this, pride comes before the fall. Tony Stark is ahead of him on that curve. Tony knows the price of arrogance and even the price of acting unilaterally with the best of intentions. He knows the road to hell is paved with those best of intentions. When these two philosophies and life lessons collide, that's as cool as the superhero brawl that accompanies it.The story itself is an amazing action thriller with a ton of intrigue and psychological issues. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever and this deep. I did expect it to be exciting and it certainly delivers on that. Each new character and each hold over Avenger character works in to the story perfectly. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot. It could be Marvel's best effort ever.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why civil war is so overestimated,"I'm a big Marvel fan, especially the comic books but i have to say it... i'm a little bit disappointed. I know everything about this universe and i love the Phase 1 and 2. But it's without any surprise that i discovered Civil war.Don't misunderstand me, It's a great movie but the story is predictable (bad guy with a thirst of revenge, how original), the sequence of the story is interspersed and finally it's an other Marvel movie without surprise (same storyline has always).They should have follow the story of the comics and bring more character and depth (mostly for captain ! The story behind Tony Stark is touching and moving)fortunately, spidey, Black Panther and the Amazing Iron ""Robert Downey Jr"" man enhance the level of this movie.Special effects and battle scenes are amazing though.with all the hype, the media publicity etc I was expecting a stunning movie and I end up with a good action movie but banal",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time.

Another one has joined the MCU's best.,"Marvel and the Russo Brothers did it again! to simply put, it's a spectacular film overall.Captain America: Civil War has all the things that makes a comic- book movie an enjoyable blast. It's entertaining, it's emotional, it has action-packed scenes that will leave you at the edge of your seat and of course, it certainly has humor in it and just the right amount as well so it won't come out as a jarring or brooding movie experience. This is what a blockbuster film should be.My main fear before watching this movie was how were they going to handle this amount of characters in one film since even the last Avengers movie: Age of Ultron had a difficult time in doing so. After watching it though, all I got to say is that it surpassed almost every bit of expectation I had and gave each of our heroes their spotlight moments which allowed them to standout in the movie in their own way which the Russos did flawlessly especially the newly introduced character Black Panther which they also nailed perfectly and served as a strong introduction for those who don't read the comics and aren't familiar about his character at all.Maybe my only problem with this film is that it's vastly different from it's comic counterpart but I do understand that the MCU is trying something different so I won't bitch about it too much. The villain didn't bothered me as much as people say it was, though his plan was a little too intricate, he was still an exceptionally good villain with a legit motive but I do agree with some people that he didn't need to be in this movie since it's already filled with the necessary conflict that would otherwise make it a thrilling film.Now for my final thoughts about Captain America: Civil War. If you enjoy comic-book or superhero films as a whole with no bias, this movie is a must see and you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it. This movie proves that a film can satisfy the fans, the general audience AND the critics all at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Does it Again!!,"I was one of the few fortunate people who got to watch this early. This movie was everything i hoped Civil War to be. It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move. Most of those reviewers probably haven't even watched the movie. Ignore the haters and watch the movie. You won't be disapppointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Now I just have to watch all the other marvel movies.I had absolutely no idea what was going on at some parts, but that was probably simply because I have barely seen any of the preceding movies. After seeing this I definitely will. To anyone else who thinks marvel is overrated, trust me, give this a shot. You will not be disappointed.

Another winner from Marvel!,"I pretty much like or love all the Marvel Studios movies, starting with Iron Man through last year's Ant-Man. So there was virtually no chance I wouldn't enjoy Civil War. But this might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. So many characters are in it, yet I felt like every one of them got at least one memorable moment, even lame ol' Hawkeye! At the end of Act 2, there's a 20-minute battle scene that involves a dozen super-heroes, and it's amazing, probably the best of this genre. I went in rooting 100% for Cap, but by the end, I was feeling really badly for Iron Man and kinda wanted to see him kick Steve Rogers' butt. We get a couple of new heroes ‚Äì Spider-Man and the Black Panther ‚Äì and they are both just about perfect translations from comic book to film. This Brit they have playing Peter Parker is probably my favorite Spidey yet, even though he's only on screen for maybe 15 minutes. He's exactly as Spidey should be: a nervous kid who handles his anxiety by being a nonstop motormouth during his battles. And the Panther is just so cool. Ant-Man plays a big part in that huge battle I mentioned, getting some of the best moments during the fight. But really, this movie is Cap's, Bucky's, and Tony's story. What helps make it so great is how Marvel has built up their saga over multiple movies ‚Äì we're already familiar with and invested in these characters. And the filmmakers use that to great advantage here. It's sad to see them pitted against each other, but completely understandable in the context of the film. Bottom line: if you've enjoyed some or all of the Marvel movies, you'll have a great time with Civil War. It's a blast!

Yet another one boring and predictable superhero movie.,"The new Marvel blockbuster ""Captain America - Civil War"" is precisely the kind of movie that we've all NOT been waiting for, namely - stodgy, packed with every superhero that that the directors Anthony and Joe Russo could get their hands on. What were the writers thinking when they included Natasha Romanoff, or the so called Black Widow in the script? Is she really a superhero? Or maybe being a double agent is considered as some kind of a super power?Why was it so cool to pick as many superheroes as they could and put them in the movie? This kind of philosophy does not add any positive points to the movie, even the opposite - it makes it look like a stage audition for teenagers possessing superpowers, which each one of the teens want to boast with. I went into the local cinema hall with the belief that this movie will not be like the others prior to it, namely the two Marvel's The Avengers and the two Captain Americas. Alas it did not meet my expectations. It happened to be just another predictable superhero- based movie with all its no-twists-and-turns and especially the trade mark of all movies of this type - the unique score that is present during the climax scenes, when your favorite superhero is looking into the wander, with his hands on his waist and saying some really inspirational words about the prior battle or the upcoming future (just like SAN ANDREAS). The ONLY suspense that I had to be kept in was when the Black Panther was on his way to remove his helmet.Sorry to say it, but this is yet another dull high-budget movie that is probably designed only for teens and kids that could stay all the 2 and a half hours watching a dozen superheroes fight with each other.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Used to be Black Hats vs White Hats. Now its No Hats,"Since it is increasingly important in these reviews to appeal to all readers, and not offend anyone, I am offering two reviews. Simply pick the one you like.1. Great Production Values, Two and a Half Hours of Action, Whats Not to Like?This, the shorter review, simply states the obvious. Marvel is getting progressively better at delivering action and most people today go to these films for the action, so this is win-win. Yeah. Everyone smile and wait for the next Marvel release. Have your wallets ready.2. As Marvel increasingly monopolizes the Superhero space, the themes get darker and darker.The early 1920s believe it or not were a lot like today. Everyone sensed a growing unease in the collective gestalt, so they compensated by more partying, less critical thinking, and going to more movies. Interestingly, movies both before and after the Great Depression offered pure escapist entertainment. You went to the movies to get anything BUT reality.A century later, that paradigm has shifted. Ever since the ""graphic novels"" started to tackle serious adult themes, there seems to be a race among superhero writers to see who can put his (her) hero through the most angst, and drag the audience along for the ride.I am not sure this is a good thing but I seem to be in the minority. I have seen a Spiderman movie where Spidey's main squeeze was killed because Spidey was a few seconds late. I have seen Superman movies where the main goal seems to be to discover how many buildings you can smash with Superman's head. And now, picking up on the same thread, I am seeing Avenger movies where governments -- these would be the same governments spying on your emails and trying to ban cash -- are trying to tell the ""enhanced"" humans what to do and not do.Now, the suits at the studio would argue this must be what the audience wants because they are making money. This reviewer would argue that when you have a monopoly on a product line that people want, they will see it regardless. Only one of us is right.In my view, the best superhero films are the ones that are the most humanistic. Superman comes out of a coma to be with the child he did not know he had. Iron Man rewards a boy who helped him when no one else would. Hulk drops out of an airplane not knowing if he will change or not, but he has to stop the bad guy and protect Betty.My attitude is, if I want adult themes that badly I don't need to go the theatre, I can simply try to renew my license or wait in a hospital emergency room. I ""get"" this is how they are making superhero films these days. I suggest that in a year or two someone will rediscover the older, more sentimental, story lines, the audience will love it, and people of the future will look back at the films of today and wonder, what were they smoking?Comment added 2021 -- With hindsight, the last ""legit"" Avengers movie before the suits decided to burn all the old franchises to the ground and go politically correct, and non-binary. A piece of history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"Amazing, amazing film, features new characters naturally as if they were always there. Clash between the avengers is sensational, with strong arguments on both sides and the two right sides. Spider Man and Black Panther very well presented, has good appearances and are introduced naturally different from BvS pushing new characters unnaturally some very superficially hard not to compare these two films unfortunately ... Marvel knows how to use dark colors and fun at times suitable film. amazing America captain as ever, Iron Man expectable, spiderman great the best. Incredible one of the best films of Marvel, Russian brothers showing once again its capacity and this time with a thicker film and more characters weight was a perfect test for the next avengers they will be ahead, credibility and trust in their work was fully guaranteed after this film. Finally, surprising and great movie worth much follow that it is one of the best films of Marvel Studios.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel are on a roll.,"Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Winter Soldier has competition.,"The Winter Soldier has competition for being the best Marvel movie. There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.Civil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day.Steve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.The new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.Civil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America V Iron Man: it's extremely well realized and proves to be entertainment at it's best.,"Captain America Civil WarMarvel knows how to please audiences and after seeing how Warner Bros. largely failed to please the general public with Batman and Superman's first big-screen debut together, audiences are going to question if with Civil War, (which is essentially ""Captain America v Iron Man"") will it really be worth investing time and money into another hero-on-hero mega-budget superhero flick.Well, this is Marvel's answer to DC's failed attempt, and they know these characters, we've seen most of them around in a few movies now over the past 8 years or so, (some of them more recent and some of them for the first time in this film's cinematic universe). And I truly believe the film is a triumph. Unlike the last Avengers film, there are not really any subplots that don't serve as an important piece to the overall story, directors Joe and Anthony Russo did a great job weaving action scene and character-driven scene together to drive the story forward in 2014's Captain America the Winter Soldier, and they do the same here. What makes this even more impressive is that they are handling roughly twice the amount of characters than what Winter Soldier had, but they do it as near-perfect as you could expect from a big-budget, studio-produced blockbuster these days. Though it had it's strong aspects, Star Wars the Force Awakens was a big money maker for Disney, but as a film, it left much to be desired. This film surprised and impressed me, more than any big budget film in the past 12 months save for Mad Max. It was better than Ant-man. Better than Age of Ultron. It was better than Furious 7, Jurassic World, Force Awakens, Batman v Superman and even Jungle Book which I also was impressed with. The film doesn't take any huge risks and does play it fairly safe to being what we've come to expect from Marvel, but it knows what the formula for success at Marvel is and it works with it. It knows how to still be impressive and wholly satisfying while still playing things fairly safe. Marvel, they takes risks with certain movies, and being that this is called ""Civil War"" which is based on a Marvel comic where major characters DO die, the movie doesn't quite follow that and is really more like a ""Civil Dispute"".And then there are moments where Tony is acting like he and Steve used to be friends even though earlier in the film he explains to Cap how his father always talked highly about him to Tony and that he just wanted to punch him in his perfect teeth. There are moments where this built-up rage shines through Downey Jr's performance as Stark, after he finds out a truth regarding his parents, that shows Robert actually put a lot of care into this character, more than we've ever seen from him since Iron Man 1. Lately it has felt like he's been phoning in his performances, but not here. Here he really acts the hell out of what the script asks of him, and counter's Chris Evans' strongest performance of Captain America to date, too.Lots of other big players here, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Anthony Mackie, and Daniel Bruhl gives a strong performance as a villain character who isn't given the most fleshing out or devotion to, but he serves the story well enough and it will be interesting to see if he gets any future roles down the line.If you're a fan of Spiderman, well the studio finally worked a deal out with Sony that allows them to use Spiderman in their shared cinematic universe and he is a very well introduced character played by young actor Tom Holland who probably does the best job as this character we have seen on screen yet, he fits in very well and plays off the other actors very well and proves to be quite a visual spectacle in the film's second act. He gets his own film next year and I look forward to seeing how it turns out, as this film introduced the character properly, and you could tell the directors had a full understanding of what makes this character so great. Overall, if you're looking for a superhero universe to stay committed to and always have faith in, I'd say just stick with Marvel because they know what they're doing and everything are building up to is unlikely to disappoint given the rate they are going now, but I guess we shall see you until then I would definitely recommend this film 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another over hyped Marvel movie!,"After an amazing second movie with The Winter Soldier I kinda had my doubts as to whether this excellence could continue. I was proved right.Never mind what the reviews say and what the journalists print, I've become more suspicious of ""reviews"" in this multi billion dollar industry. Especially after the negative reviews for the far superior Dawn of Justice over this ""Civil War"".I thought this was supposed to be a Captain America movie, not Iron Man 4 or an Avengers flick. There's too emphasis on trying to up the super hero count in this film to get paying customers into the cinema, oh look Spiderman's in it, lets go watch.Far too much comedy, we're dealing with super heroes here, which is serious sh*t, ha ha.....but unfortunately some people think a films great if it makes them laugh.So personally I still think the best Marvel films so far are, Thor, The Winter Soldier and Dead Pool (now this is sold as a comedy).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers 3: Civil War,"It's basically the Avengers 3 but directed by the Russo brothers that did Cap 2: The Winter Soldier. I guess that's why it's called Captain America instead of avengers. Anyway the movie was the best Marvel movie I had watched at the time in 2016,
(I saw it at the cinema when it came out). It's made by the Russo brothers so basically anything Russo bros + Marvel is just amazing. The action and direction was very good. The addition of Spider-Man also very good. I couldn't wait to see Black Panther in live action and I wasn't disappointed at all. He was really cool.

Best Superhero Movie of the Year.. yet!,"Hey everyone! (""spider-man voice"")This is by far the best superhero movie yet. I put the word ""yet"" at the end of the sentence, because i'm still waiting and looking forward to ""Suicide Squad"" and other superhero movie that hasn't been released yet. Although i'm a DC and a marvel fan, This movie is the one i enjoyed the most.The movie starts off nicely, building the scenes for the main event. The character's are well put together, Tom Holland as spider-man is as great a spider-man is in the comic book and black panther is also good. The CGI is also great, i really can't add any insight on this cause i've been sucked into the movie and hardly any focus on it. Although the villain is not that good, it hasn't affected the movie overall. The actions are great, the best action scene that i've seen in a movie 10/10. The airport scene is the most spectacular thing that happened, you're always at the edge of your sit. The plot is great, there's this clip that will horrendously trigger something at the end.This is really a great sequel to the Captain America franchise, or maybe the best marvel superhero movie to date.I'd give this MOVIE a rating of 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Smarter, More Complex Superhero Film","I'm going to be honest in saying that over the past few months, I've slowly become bored with the constant superhero releases, the current box office seems rife with them, not that that's a bad thing, it's just a tad repetitive. But then there's the Captain America series of the MCU films which seem to venture away from the typical action-packed, over-the-top aesthetics of other superhero films and instead focus more on the drama, the plot, the characters, and instead form a thriller in the style of 'The Manchurian Candidate' or the 'Bourne' films.Personally I was a huge fan of 'The Winter Soldier', abandoning the action to instead create a political thriller was a fantastic idea, and it seems that the Russo's have yet again gone down a similar route in creating a more complex film (that does unfortunately contain plot holes here and there) that instead leaves the audience thinking rather than just presenting mindless action, however 'Civil War' is definitely more ""actiony"" than 'Winter Soldier' was, and unfortunately I dislike the overuse of CGI which this film does contain, but thankfully the interwoven smart plot allowed for some material that'll hopefully be an influence towards other superhero movies, to actually create clever content instead of dumbed-down footage. Definitely one of the stronger Marvel films!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Best Marvel film, Yet.","Cynically speaking, the whole mold that the latest Marvel movie creates, is a colossal set up that engenders subsequent sequels and solo outings in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third for titular Captain America, ""Civil War"" is essentially the third Avengers film, starting with events happening a year after ""Age of Ultron"". That is not to say the film is mistakenly titled, because it still is, in all important aspects, a Captain America movie. It's just that, he isn't alone. The sheer size of this potential billion-dollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who also both helmed Cap's previous film, Winter Soldier. Their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece, whose towering bravura, bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality, which may not be the first for the genre, but enough to make it Marvel's best film, to date.In ""Civil War"", the brewing enmity between Steve Rogers/ Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) inevitably arises and turns bitter in the wake of their relentless campaigns to save humanity. The irony emerges amidst of their efforts, when greater authority finally asked who should be held accountable for the collateral damages brought both by their offensive and defensive operations. The motion begins to roll when a mission in Lagos resulted to unexpected amount of destruction and deaths.Differences in views divide the once solid group into two colliding factions. With Stark and his allies resigned to submit under the Sokovia Accords, Captain and the rest of his team, move away with staunch stand to operate freely under no greater force's jurisdiction. There is an intelligent attempt from both sides to meet halfway, but battle line is imminently drawn as a result of another attack which Cap's best buddy, Winter Soldier‚Äî now simply, Bucky Barnes‚Äî is believed to orchestrate. Doctrinal contrasts force heroes to pick sides, and the resulting chaos ensues a much bigger damage than what came in the missions they've previously pulled off together.While Joss Whedon's ""Age of Ultron"" is as massive as a superhero movie could be, Russo's Civil War is colossal in its own right, maintaining the former's size as it shifts to a more character- driven narrative, with its emotional weight heaviest on Steve Rogers' shoulders. There is a striking hint of effort to not overpopulate the proceedings with relentless chaos and destructions, but the ones inevitably allowed, are delivered in immaculate visual glory, each explosive action set- piece captured with breathtaking panoramic ingenuity.Even with all the intersecting plot lines laid out for every important character of this superhero extravaganza, they all eventually converge at one point, in which Captain Rogers and his connection with Stark, plays a key part. There is a visceral profoundness in how his character is written that finally places him at the center of his own film, and Evans has his commitment fully deployed for the role. And for a film whose own size seems to undermine its very own titular hero, the accomplished feat is truly massive for Captain, himself.A film of this size naturally gets devoured by its very own ambitions. Character-wise, Civil War is as big as the last two Avengers movies. And while Thor and Hulk are both missing in action here, newcomers are welcomed to fill in their shoes. The film facilitates the solid introduction of Chad Boswick's Black Panther, whose stand-alone film is due in 2018. But perhaps, as most people who've seen it, will say, the entry of the amazing web- slinger is the film's most anticipated highlight. Tom Holland's Spider- Man is a breath of fresh air, and it delivers some hope for the character's looming third big screen incarnation, next year. His comic timing may have been at par with that of Paul Rudd's Ant- Man, who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie. This lightness comes amid the political tensions and philosophical differences between the opposing forces, one that is utterly missing in DC's Batman v Superman's messed-up attempt to pull off an essentially similar drama, last month.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An absolutely spoiler-free comment,"OK, saw Civil War two times already here in Peru, the second time just yesterday April 30th with my 73 years-old father that really loves movies since he was young. He knows and loves everything Superman-related, and even so, he couldn't help but snore through BvS (almost the same with MoS back then). But oh boy! yesterday at the theater i saw my father laughing and even clapping like he was a 13 years old kid watching the ""serials"" he sometimes tell me about! It was that good!. On my first watch on April 27th (first screening), the theater was packed and the crowd reaction was the best i have seen since the first Avengers movie, but that was nothing compared with seeing my old man's reactions. I just wanted to share this because if any movie deserves to be ranked top just by the sheer joy it causes, is this one. An excellent movie, full of surprises (I have seen just the first trailer prior to watching the movie, and avoided spoilers like the plague). Acting-wise, the characters were spot-on, some of the best moments were the ones without any special effect, and the ones that used them were wisely edited. About the villain: a superb and realistic plan (within the boundaries of their universe). Only minor gripe was Martin Freeman overacting. Otherwise, the introduction of characters (new to the universe or to the Captain/Avengers films) was perfect, and rest assured, this is the best on-film version of the web-crawler yet!

"My Personal Favorite Marvel Film To Date, Topping All Expectations","Captain America: Civil War is directed by both Anthony and Joe Russo and is a sequel to 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo brothers. After an accident occurred while the new Avengers were on the hunt for Crossbones, the United States government proposes that the Avengers be government controlled. Captain America disagrees with the idea, and Iron Man is all for it. This conflict in decision begins to rip the Avengers apart, starting a civil war.I was really on the edge over Captain America: Civil War. I loved both the previous two Captain America movies, and the two Avengers installments as well. Walking out of the theater, I got all I had wanted and more. Captain America: Civil War is now my favorite Marvel film to date. I loved everything about it, and was so happy to see just how amazingly well everything worked out.The Russo brothers did absolutely amazing with this movie. Not only are all of the characters flawlessly well rounded, but the direction and script are fantastic as well. The direction perfectly captured all of the action throughout the film, and was handled very nicely. Many wide shots were used, and the action was without shaky cam or quick cuts. All of the dialogue was near flawless as well. The audience is very subtly introduced to the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, and dives deeper into it as the film progresses. The points presented by both sides are both right in there own ways, and that adds so much to this movie.The characters in Civil War are as close to perfect as it gets. I cared for every character in the film, whether they be a superhero or not. Black Panther's introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was great, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Spiderman in this film is, in my opinion, the best on screen Spiderman of all time. I like Tom Holland as the web head a bit better than Tobey Maguire, and way better than Andrew Garfield. His suit was great, and he delivered a lot of quips while fighting, just like the fans wanted. Lines such as ""You have the right to remain silent!"" or ""You have a metal arm? That's awesome, dude!"" made Spiderman near perfect in this movie. I loved the characters of both Spiderman and Black Panther.Besides the fact of the new characters, the Russo brothers also went deeper into the characters that we've already seen. Vision was given a lot more depth through Civil War, as was Scarlet Witch. The relationship between the two was great, and was given the attention it deserved. Both Hawkeye and Black Widow got a lot of screen time, and Hawkeye's relationship with Scarlet Witch, which he inspired to become an Avenger at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was explored more deeply, and played off very well. Black Widow's internal conflict with which team she truly supported was shown neatly, however not distracting from the main plot.Both Iron Man and Captain America were fleshed out much more than they have been before, despite how long the two have been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their struggles with each other was astounding at how well it was used. Falcon and War Machine were both given a lot more attention than they have been before, and that worked amazingly. As seen in the trailer, War Machine gets injured, and that gave his character a lot more depth. Falcon's friendship with Captain America was expressed more heavily, now that they know each other better. Cap's relationship with Bucky was also incredible. The exploration dealt to Bucky's character was high, and appreciated very much. And, without spoiling anything, Ant Man's character was, simply put, flawless all throughout Civil War.All of the acting was great as well. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, and Daniel Bruhl all did fantastic. Each performance was unique in its own way, and all of the characters were played greatly. Each actor's portrayal of his or her character was amazing, and each and every character was given the depth they deserved.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and my second favorite comic book movie, topped only by The Dark Knight (2008). The Russo brothers have made a true masterpiece of a film, heightening all expectations for Avengers: Infinity War Parts I and II (2018-2019).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""I'm doing what has to be done... to save us from something worse.""","Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.The world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?Civil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.Each character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.The grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did.Fans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character ""show up"" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"After this hype around the movie and people telling me how great it is, I have finally seen it and did not understand what the fuss was about... Too much of the movie is just talking about ""do we sign the agreement?"", ""Should we sign?"", ""Will they sign?"", ""I feel so bad about what happened"", ""How can they not see what is right?"".. There was barely a time for anything else, and until we did see something else and you think that maybe that's it, the movie is starting, we soon go back to the same talking. I have given it 6 stars since still on its own, its an OK movie, but if you compare it to other Marvel movies, it's relatively at the bottom and one of their worst.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding! Marvel is unstoppable!,"CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is the best Marvel movie yet. It's superhero conflict done right! Spectacular action sequences, it's well thought out, it's got nicely placed humor here and there, the plot and the motivations make sense, all the characters have fair share amount of screen time, and may I just say that the new Spider-Man is totally awesome! Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's ""The Avengers."" One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories. And in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, the repercussion of Cap vs. The Winter Soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward, because it's actually more layered than we think.I know what you're going to ask me. What do I think of the new Spider-Man? Fair enough. Before we get to that, let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of Avengers 2.5 instead of a Cap movie, because of the inclusion of so many characters, my initial concerns subside because again, by this time, Marvel already knows what they're doing, they know how to balance fun and intense action, they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all. Screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are all master storytellers. OK.. so Spider-Man. He's alright. I'm kidding. He's awesome! And I truly mean that. Actor Tom Holland is perfect in this role. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but Holland's version is the Spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and I'm not talking just about his wise-cracking sarcasm, Holland owns it, he embodies it, he has some of the coolest lines in this film. And this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix, is absolutely brilliant because Spider-Man's time in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is as significant and as scene-stealing as Quicksilver was in ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past,"" he's the one most fans will talk about long after this movie's done.Another great addition is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and wait till you get a load of the surprise that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) will have for you in the well-choreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash. That said, there is an underlying secret, there is a common enemy so smart that he doesn't even have to get his hands dirty, that's how clever this script is, because it's more than just about Sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check, and the reason the characters clash makes sense, it's more than just about a simple payback. That ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many, many strengths of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. The story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like Thanos finally comes to town. What an outstanding film with great performances across the board. In this year where Daredevil is fighting Punisher on TV, Superman is fighting Batman on the big screen and apparently Charlize Theron's Ravenna is fighting Emily Blunt's Freya in ""The Huntsman: Winter's War,""... CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR trumps all.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Civil war beats Deadpool!!!!!√óo√óoüëåüèª nuf said!,"I didn't really had hopes from Spider man, This Movie just hyped me for whatever next is coming From Marvel.

Warning - boring,"Walked out after 45 minutes. Sheer boredom.80% of screen time was devoted to violence. Loud noises (crashes and explosions) and the destruction of cars, doors and buildings.Luke Evans had center stage and he has zero 'magnetism'. Did not make a good case for his side of the debate. Downing looked tired. The Bucky character was okay.Plot was paper thin. It is logical that the human world would want to rein in the superheroes after they conduct epic battles in population centers. But, the humanism is overridden by the violence and the negative motivations.My conclusion is that this movie was made solely for teens. For adult fare, look elsewhere.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So...Just saw Civil War...IT WAS FRICKING AWESOME!!!,"This movie defines the definition of awesome! This movie is amazing! I absolutely loved it! Thank you Marvel for creating the superhero movie that we deserve! None of that Batman V Superman crap! Ohh no! This is how you do a movie about superheroes fighting each other! This movie can even live up to the epic of the first Avengers! Wow!!! I felt so excited and pumped up in every scene of this movie...Even the boring talking parts. Seriously! Oh my god this is such an awesome film. The first half of the film was good but the second half after the intermission was by far the best part about the movie! Also, another thing, I loved Spider-Man in this movie. Nerdy and Funny! I'm really excited for Tom Holland to continue with HIS take on Spider-Man! Thanks for reading!

Amazing.,"Just saw the movie this morning with my roommate. I have heard great things about this movie and I thought that I was going to cry given how the Avengers are dividing over the issue of government oversight. I haven't picked a team and I don't think I will. I'm a mix, I guess.Anyway, back to the movie. Wow. Woo-hoo! This movie is a wild ride of action, effects and story. I haven't read any of the comics, but I have been following most Marvel movies, and this one did not disappoint in the least. Even though the story is more mature and brooding, there is also plenty of humorous moments, especially in Tom Holland's Spiderman.People, those fans were not kidding. This Spiderman flat out steals every scene that he's in with his humor, agility, nerdy persona and Tom Holland is the perfect choice to harbor Marvel's youngest superhero. He even looks a little like Toby Maguire. He was undoubtedly the best part of the movie, even though he didn't get much screen time. Totally looking forward to the new Spiderman movie due next year.Another huge highlight is the jealousy between Bucky and Falcon. Maybe jealousy isn't the right word, but these two do not exactly get along. Their moments together, though brief in number, are awfully hilarious as well.Wondering what's going to happen in the next movies to come. This one really helps set the field for what Infinity War will possibly bring in the future. Check out this movie. It's quite a ride",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Disassembled,"Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a film so sincere in its aspirations, so determined to stand out from the superhero crowd, that to see it collapse under the strain of its ambition is quite underwhelming. The film pits Avengers Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) against each other in a clash of ideologies, and to see them fairly debate in lieu of individuality and regulation, respectively, is nothing short of compelling and thought-provoking, especially since both sides have their own set of consequences.The action sequences and fight choreography are top-notch, probably the best in the Marvel crop, with the Russo brothers proving themselves the studio's golden goose. They (with mightily impressive stunt choreography from the John Wick directors) direct with a slick, brutal efficiency and perfect comic timing that can make action junkies sigh with relief, which aides greatly in that big, highly-hyped superhero throwdown.But the villainous cog behind the conflict nearly collapses the entire film. It becomes increasingly preposterous the more I think about it. To pit Cap'n and Iron Man against each other, there has to be a plausible catalyst towards their tension to bring any real emotional weight to the film. This villain, all by his lonesome, uses preparations and tactics that would make Bane and MacGuyver blush in comparison, resulting in plot/continuity holes so big a dozen helicarriers combined can fly through them. However, and this doesn't spoil the plot, what he does at the end of the film ditches the core of the film and resembles a Saturday morning cartoon.It's still a better film than Batman vs. Superman.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Could have been a game changer, but they opted not to....","I've come to this late, as I seem to now with all comic book movie. I'm tired of them, and probably this was impacted by that.The premise to this seeing the superheroes go head to head is really interesting, and a geek's fantasy come to life. However, that all seems to get lost soon after, but Captain America is the show stealer but not helped by the creators trying to ram everyone in possible like a big fancy dress party, in order to advertise their new films to come (Black Panther, new Spiderman etc).Shame really, this could have been so much more. The comic book films are becoming tired and repetitive, despite the genuine efforts of some. There's a lot of life in them, but they need to divert a bit more. They aimed for that and then seemed to just divert back.Disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the Best MCU Movies So Far,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of this movie. From the opening scene till the final battle, I was completely blown away. First off I'm gonna start by talking about the performances.This is the best acting we've seen in the MCU hands down. To highlight a few, Robert Downey Junior gives a Tony Stark a more personal side that we have yet to completely see if him. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland are both perfectly casted as Black Panther and Spider-Man respectively.The action was great. The relationships that these characters have built over the course of several movies creates a new level of complexity that makes these fight sequences more emotional and powerful. The Airport Battle is the best action scene in the MCU and is rivaled only by the Quicksilver scene from DOFP.The final thing I have to say about what made this movie so damn good, was the fact that all of the events in this movie are permanent and will have a long lasting impact. The only complaint I've had with the MCU is the fact that most of the events in their movies are resolved by the climax and there is no lasting impact on future films. While no future films have come out at the time I've written this review, it still seems safe to say that the events in this movie will have a permanent effect on the rest of the MCU.It is rare that I go into a movie with this high of expectations and i leave the theater completely blown away. 10/10 Great Movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a GREAT film and everything an adventure movie should be!,"Captain America: Civil War is everything an adventure movie should be, and more. It's the best film in any comic book movie universe.What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The movie gets just about everything right. The plot and shades of gray give much to chew on and think about. This installment perfectly picks up where we left Steve and his new team after Avengers Age of Ultron. It also follows up with Tony Stark perfectly. Yet, you need not even have seen any of those other films to enjoy this one even though it greatly adds depth to the overall story. Another huge strength is the casting. Evans again finds his pathos and his chops in this film. Robert Downey Jr. certainly has the acting chops to hang with anyone and he is again shear perfection as Tony Stark. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is no one dimensional character even though it easily could have been. This may also be Spider-Man's best turn on screen that we've seen and young Tom Holland is great. Sebastian Stan is again spooky perfection. Scarlett Johansson is AGAIN every bit the wise yet sexy female mainstay and a match for any male on screen. Emily Van Camp and Elizabeth Olson are smaller supporting characters but they simply shine with strength and depth. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson certainly adds to the casting perfection. Every interaction and relationship works well and is certainly one of the many highlights of this remarkable film.Again, this movie gets everything that matters right.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America or Avengers??,"I have to say I am confused here. I thought I was watching a Captain America movie but after 1 hour I had to check the ticket to be sure it is not an Avengers movie. If this is a Captain America, shouldn't it be more focused on Captain America and less or close to 0 about the Avengers? We all love when all super heroes gather together but hey, let's focus the stories on the main character only. This was a bad stunt just to sell in the box office. Besides the fighting scenes which were awesome, the story behind the movie is very thin. I am a comics fan but I have to say I was getting bored at some times. Is it much to ask for a movie with a good plot and story line?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Civil War was about a family being torn apart, and this movie gives you that, AMAZING","Let's make it clear here that I'm not biased with either Marvel or DC, I enjoy both and I gave Batman v Superman the benefit of the doubt. You can read more of my thoughts on my review of the film. I'm a huge fan of DC and felt that the movie suffered many problems with it's story and character development. That's where Marvel has the upper hand for many years now, by setting up all these movies and stories we get well developed and likable characters that we already identify with. Once you get to a movie like Civil War, you've laid out the groundwork for an epic movie. Sure Marvel doesn't follow their story lines exactly like the comic but it approaches it in a very respectful way. The thing that always stuck out to me about Civil War in the comics was how personal the fight felt. The characters were all part of a team and were like a family, they loved each other and cared about one another. It felt like a realistic take on what really happens when you argue with the people you love, you see things one way, but they see it differently, and you both struggle to find a middle ground. This element I was pleased to see made it into the film, the motivations were different than the comic but the intentions still felt the same to me. We've seen the Avengers grow together as a team and as a family, but now we see them forced into this situation nobody wants to be in. These characters that were friends, partners, brothers, get torn apart by different circumstances, and you really feel the weight of it all. Especially between Tony and Steve, the Russo's have talked about betrayal being a theme in the film and I can see what they mean, Tony and Steve have such great dynamic in it all I'd hate to give away what draws the line between them but it sank my heart into my stomach to see their friendship being shredded to pieces. The Russo brothers did a spectacular job with the Winter Soldier and this film is no exception. The action was just phenomenal, every set piece was timed right, and the story didn't drag by any means. One of the strong points of the Russo's that me and a friend of mine agreed on was the fact that they have a good understanding of character arc, they added so many new characters in this movie, and they were used perfectly, each one had a shining moment. Black Panther and Spider-Man rocked it the most in my opinion, both are just a hoot to watch and I can't wait to see them star in their own solo films. I think many people were disappointed with Age of Ultron because it didn't really feel like anything new, or improve on what we've seen before, it was the first Avengers just a little bigger. This movie is what Age of Ultron should have been, emotional, conflicting, and epic in it's own way. I was worried this movie would be black and white, making Tony the antagonist and Steve the ""good guy"". I felt conflicted and didn't know who to side with, and you know the movie's done it's job when you don't even know who's right, and who's wrong. A 10/10 for me, and easily one of the best Marvel movies to date. I've only given Marvel a 10/10 for the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians. If you love their films, this one you'll easily love. Great way to start the summer and a perfect way to kick off phase 3!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"No, ""Civil War"" isn't the Best Marvel Movie Ever Made","When early word had it that Captain America: Civil War was the best film Marvel's done to date, I should have known better. I guess having the privilege to see big blockbusters in advance does make one want to overpraise them into oblivion, even if it's something like Batman v Superman. But don't worry. Civil War is at least better than that, but it's certainly not the best Marvel film to date. Far from it.I have so many thoughts regarding this film that it would be too much to write out in a review, so I'll boil it down to this: Marvel will be Marvel, and that's what kept Civil War from being great. Like most of their films, Civil War follows a certain formula that we've come to expect from Marvel flicks, and it doesn't stray away from that path. Its unwillingness to take risks is ultimately disappointing but not all that surprising. While the trailers for Civil War promised something dark, serious, and challenging, where lives and relationships between the characters we love are at stake, the film is anything but. In fact, Civil War has a surprising amount of humor, so much so that it severely undercuts the tension and central conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Why call it a CIVIL WAR when there are one-liners and quips spoken every minute? Since when were Falcon and Bucky buddy-buddy towards each other? Their scenes, among many others, felt like something out of a freaking sitcom. Despite the many flaws BvS suffered from, the film at least had a consistent tone and the climactic battle itself felt significant and crucial to a point where someone could die.That's the biggest weakness of this film. Everything felt so trivial and inconsequential. Calling it a Civil War is an overstatement when the war itself never amounts to anything more than a bunch of kids fighting together on a playground. There are no real casualties in this film, despite the fact that the film tries so very hard to convince you otherwise. ""You've caused so many civilian casualties!"" our heroes are told, but just wait until the next scene when there are some jokes thrown in to lighten up the mood, because you know, talking about endangering lives and having security vs. freedom shouldn't be *too* serious a discussion. You can't have your cake and eat it too, Marvel, and that's exactly what Civil War wanted: to be sincere about the very real and relevant issues it's tackling but also make it fun and entertaining for the whole family to enjoy - because more $$$. Even during the climax when motivations and reveals come into play and you feel like someone could die, it ends in such a whimper that you feel what occurred won't have any meaningful effect in future films.And that's just it. Civil War is entertaining and watchable for what it is - and again, a whole lot better than BvS - but it could have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Tense Showdown Unleashed,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Captain America: Civil War. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 12, 2016. It has a runtime of 2 hour 27 minutes. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and created by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby.Summary: The Marvel Cinematic Universe reaches a pivotal moment as the Avengers face an ideological rift that threatens to divide them. Following a series of catastrophic events linked to their superhero activities, the government introduces the Sokovia Accords, a set of regulations designed to oversee and control superhuman operations. This legislation ignites a fierce debate among the Avengers about accountability and freedom.Review:-I found the storyline to be both engaging and fast-paced, which kept me thoroughly entertained. The movie featured remarkable action sequences that seamlessly integrate choreography with narrative elements. The airport battle scene stood out to me due to its creativity and the emotional stakes involved. The choreography showcases the distinct abilities of each character. I found the casting to be exceptional; the actors were perfectly suited to their roles, and their performances resonated authentically within the film's narrative. I appreciated how the film skilfully delves into complex themes of loyalty, freedom, and accountability through a nuanced conflict between two characters with opposing views on government oversight and personal liberty. Their confrontations provoke thoughtful reflection on critical issues such as government surveillance and individual rights. The movie effectively addresses contemporary concerns about civil liberties and the risks of unchecked authority, resonating with audiences interested in social justice and political accountability. It also underscores how authority figures can manipulate power dynamics for personal gain, enriching discussions about governance. The film incorporates realistic consequences for superhero actions, contrasting with many superhero narratives where heroes face little to no repercussions; it emphasizes the lasting impact of events within the MCU. The film skilfully balanced its serious themes with moments of humour, offering a sense of levity that enhanced rather than detracted from its more poignant scenes. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. The film extensively utilized wide shots to establish the setting and scale of the conflict, allowing viewers to grasp the magnitude of the heroes' struggle and their positioning within chaotic confrontations. Medium shots were often used to focus on characters while providing background context, effectively capturing facial expressions and body language to enhance emotional engagement. Close-ups highlighted key moments and emotions during intense confrontations and pivotal decisions, drawing viewers into the characters' psychological depth. Over-the-shoulder shots enhance intimacy and perspective during character conversations, highlighting their relationships and tensions.Bird's eye view shots offer a distinctive angle for action sequences, particularly in large-scale battles. Tracking shots follow characters through environments, adding fluidity to action scenes. Establishing shots introduce locations before the action begins. Cutaway shots provide context by showing reactions from characters indirectly affected by the moment. Selective slow motion enhanced drama during pivotal moments, such as fight scenes and critical decisions, allowing viewers to absorb key developments. Meanwhile, POV shots immerse audiences in a character's perspective, particularly effective in combat sequences where understanding their viewpoint increases tension and stakes.I found the CGI utilized in the film to be particularly impressive. The visual effects played a crucial role in shaping the overall impact of the movie. One standout moment was the airport battle scene, where numerous superheroes engaged in combat. This sequence showcased a seamless integration of CGI with live-action performances, creating an immersive experience. The effects significantly enhanced the realism of superhuman abilities while ensuring clarity during complex action sequences. The combination of choreography and CGI resulted in dynamic visuals that kept me thoroughly engaged throughout the film. I appreciated that the CGI did not overshadow character development or plot; rather, it complemented them effectively. The film employed advanced motion capture technology and digital compositing techniques, which contributed to its high-quality visuals. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.-I thoroughly enjoyed reconnecting with the characters and was delighted to see some fresh faces introduced. Notably, one of these new characters is set to have their own film, contributing to an exciting line-up in this current phase-Phase Three-which will feature not just one, but two films by its conclusion. I think that this movie adeptly handled a large ensemble cast while keeping a clear focus on each character's development. I appreciated how the motivations of each character were thoughtfully explored, providing viewers with insight into their perspectives. The film effectively highlighted their differing ideologies and how these beliefs influenced their decisions, which added significant emotional depth to the overarching conflict.-I appreciated the film for its unexpected plot twists, which kept me thoroughly engaged and deepened my connection to the characters' struggles throughout the story. The conclusion was particularly satisfying, leaving us with a sense of anticipation. I am eager to see how events unfold in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and what challenges await the team. I was delighted to find two extra scenes cleverly woven into the credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.6 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Downright awesome.,"Marvel Studios have done it yet again. Just when they appeared to be running out of steam after Age of Ultron and Ant-Man sat comfortably in the middle of the MCU canon, they strike back with this enormously entertaining series-booster. Essentially Avengers 2.5, this movie is crowded with so many well-known characters it's a miracle it's a movie at all, let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one. When the end credits roll there's disappointment rather than relief, unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts. The plot mechanics don't completely hold up under scrutiny ‚Äì especially the antagonist's scheme ‚Äì but it is the pitch-perfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kick-arse action sequences. And what kick-arse action sequences they are! Bookended with an impressively gritty Bourne-esque set piece and a seriously personal (and intense) punch up, each battle is cleverly given it's own spin to avoid feeling repetitive. Nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though; with everyone fighting everyone, a web-slinging newbie stealing the show and a HUGE surprise, it confidently challenges the New York alien beat-down for MCU's greatest set piece. It doesn't quite reach Guardians levels of humour but there's a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quip-filled dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, strongly aided by the rock-solid cast (both familiar and new). Picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible; series regulars ‚Äì Cap (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ), Black Widow (ScarJo), et al ‚Äì are always excellent, whilst newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are both downright awesome. Somehow fresh despite having a dozen films come before it in the MCU, Civil War is a near-perfect popcorn flick that galvanises enthusiasm for the upcoming onslaught of Marvel adventures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing!,"Let me just start by saying I love Superheroes but have never been a big fan of Captain America - He is too much of a clean cut, charisma devoid, goody too shoes IMO. That said, I enjoyed the first Cap Film and both Avengers movies. I even praised the second Captain America film because, despite a couple of things it was a good film with lots of action and some awesome visual sequences.What spoiled it for me is exactly what spoiled Civil War too. The Winter Soldier himself. I accept the second movie was centered around him (hence The title) But, Captain America's unwavering efforts to rescue and re-establish his friendship with his psychotic, murderous ex-friend (despite the many deaths caused by him) was sickeningly repetitive and boring.Fast forward to Civil War, which I was really looking forward to (new characters joining the fray - wahoo) only to suffer the same fate again; seeing an otherwise great movie spoiled because it revolves around the winter soldier....again. Urrggghh! I mean: the Winter Soldier has even less personality than Captain America and that is truly an underwhelming experience to endure.After watching a superhero movie, I am usually excited, happy and hyped. After Captain America: Civil War I was quite angry, simply because I knew it could have been so much better!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel delivers it's trump card!,"Civil War is a standalone movie drenched in a stupendous show of power, ideologies and action weaved into a meaningful plot and crafted with finesse by the Russo brothers.Oh Captain! My Captain!Captain America is the luckiest Avenger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for three reasons. The number one being he never ages (Come on man! that's pretty cool. Imagine what you would do with that!), Secondly, he had to deal with only one real villain in his entire trilogy of films, and that also was kinda non existent (Red Skull was as ugly as he was stupid), and thirdly and finally, because two of his three films were directed by two visionary directors who appreciate the very aesthetics of Comic Book movies, and are not afraid to challenge the formulaic plot boiler; The Russo BrothersCaptain America: Civil War is a blockbuster, in every sense of the term but not because of Captain America or his prehistoric ideals, it is because of the dangerous and colorful array of characters that join him in this movie. Each scene and subplot are taken care with sterling craftsmanship, and not for even once you are made to feel that the story exists only to give mold to the action sequences. (Zack Snyder, are you listening?). Age of Ultron shoved a tremendous amount of information into our faces, which the Russo brothers slyly avoid. You can separate between the arc of story you should be following and the one that is on a need-to-know basis. The distinctions between the ideals of Captain America and Iron Man are clearly stated from the first arrival of either characters. We all had a little concern over how they would fit Bucky as the reason for the entire devastating stand off, but as it turns out, the film is actually Captain Buchanan Barnes: T'Challa War. Because both The Winter Soldier and Black Panther had a lot more to add than we were promised in the trailers. And nobody's complaining!Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther has been a perfect example of casting. His grave, ideological approach to the Civil War is often needed, as he is the only character who supports neither Tony or Steve, but is dead set on his set of notions, which he carries on till the end. Tom Holland does a beautiful job as the new Spiderman. His quick witted replies, inquisitiveness in this hyper mumbo jumbo is often veered towards caricature but that is actually what Spiderman is all about. He is the guy who jokes about the Infinity Gauntlet as an 'old fashioned glove' on Thanos' face. So clearly we finally have a Spiderman which is much closer to the comics, not disagreeing to the fact that Tobey McGuire will always have a special place in our hearts. (Come on, Andrew Garfield was ehh!)The tiff between Steve and Tony is something that will really claw you nerves. Even if you are steadfast on a single team, several moments will question your own decision making? Is Captain actually right? Does Tony actually mean well? there are moments when the singular line of their motives are blurred but each of them are stuck with their own set of beliefs, something each responsible and powerful being must do.The airport fight sequence is hands down the best superhero action sequence you will ever see. And kudos to the duo for taking even a handful of characters from the universe so vast and creating such a perfect film. The only problem which I had with the movie that it was supposed to be the end of a Captain America trilogy; but honestly Steve reaches nowhere near closure. Maybe that was intentional, something to ponder upon, is a concrete ending necessary or is the legacy of Captain America as vast as his courage?Captain America: Civil War is a magnum opus, something which changes the way you approach something fictional by incorporating it into the part and parcel of the world, and yet it does it with such splendour, you often wish it was true!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Un-freaking-believable!!! (NO SPOILERS),"I was never a CA fan. I always thought Iron Man was so much better and was always fighting with my brother -he was addicted to CA. So when we found out CA 3 was CA v. IM we got really excited. We were speculating on who was gonna win and kick the other's ass. We had seen EVERY trailer, EVERY spoiler to this day yet none of that really spoiled the movie for us.Because it was un-freaking-believable, over the charts good. And, yeah, this is coming from someone who hates Cap America. It was well balanced, showcasing every hero's abilities giving them the time they needed on screen -no more, no less. The storyline kept going smoothly, having very small but clever cliffhangers between some scenes keeping us on the edge and I really have to congratulate the writers for that. Whoever says they did a crappy job with this movie they're just haters -don't listen to them.This movie is not an Avengers one. It's focused on CA and his struggle to do the right thing. You can't really hate him, or hate IM. They both had some points in their arguments. By the end of the movie, I felt sympathy and love for both of them -yeah, even CA. So the characters were not ruined as individuals at all. I really like their relationship, their chemistry and their friendship -which, by the end, I realized was quite deep.As for the debuts... BLACK PANTHER SLAYS!! He was skilled and strong and such a badass. I loved him and I'm so excited for his solo movie. SPIDER-MAN literally stole the show. We all know Peter is funny and goofy but that actor did a really good job portraying the character. He was a badass as well, but with a funny hint to it. IM and SM actually made a pretty funny duo. I'm so excited RDJ is set to play in the SM movie. And... CROSSBONES. Well, don't expect much from that douchebag. He's not much of a threat -he gets killed in the first 10' (oops! spoiler alert!).CAPTAIN America and his hero hair were working overtime to save the world while trying to save his best friend. IRON MAN was trying to reason with CA and get Bucky in prison while using some new awesome tech that had our jaws dropping (not just the glove). BLACK WIDOW was kicking a lot of asses and ANT MAN was surprisingly awesome (I didn't really liked his solo movie) and hilarious as expected. ALL THE OTHERS were awesome as well as their evolving powers.To sum up, it's a MUST WATCH. It was the BEST one in the Avengers/CA franchise. I can't wait for Infinity War 'cause it sets up a new world for the MCU.GO. SEE. THE DAMN MOVIE. NOWWWW!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best superhero movie of the year,"We've seen deadpool and it was great. We've seen batkill v. Supersad which was horrible. Now get ready to be amazed!This movie was amazing in everyway. The action was so good! the acting was good. the story was a lot better than batman v superman's story. it is everything that bvs wanted to be, but couldn't because snyder isn't as talented as either of the russos bros and the writers are better as well. civil war is the perfect comic book movie. dc lovers suck on that. even dc fanboys will cry because this movie is that good. thismovie doesn't have flaws, because.. it isn't a dc movie of course and it is absolutely perfect.Verdict: if you hate mediocre superheroes movies, don't go to batman v superman, but if you love good superhero movies then go to civil war. it's perfect in everyway. I made this review as compensation for some idiots thinking they can bring down the score of civil war before it comes out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the biggest plot points of the MCU,"This movie is a great thrill for marvel nerds, as it contains everything you want in an MCU movie all wrapped up into a nice package. A great villain with steaks on the line, amazing character development, and of course, some of the BEST action in all of marvel!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Movies Of All-Time!,"This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the thrills. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America Civil War is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen since Avengers. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining an intriguing plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of true patriotism, honor, duty and puts it all together in one amazing package.The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character. They turn convention on its ear by making Steve Rogers' flaws more apparent in this film and at the same time making Tony Stark's journey and growth very sympathetic. Steve's never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes him a true hero but those traits can lead to something not as noble. As in real life, never say die can turn in to painfully stubborn in a hurry. Both these character's motivations and journeys are more interesting then most. Can Steve remain the ""good man"" his creator instructed him to be in the very first film even through the most trying of times? Can the once cocky Tony Stark continue to learn and grow and work to humbly serve others even thorough anger and his own selfish tendencies?This movie delivers on all that and on every level. It does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it- most entering film made for a while,"Civil war is one of the best Marvel Films made. It's just so entertaining. If you want to be entertained by awesome fight scenes, this is defiantly the film for you. If you want some sort of emotional impact along with awesome fight scenes and quick humour, Civil war should be the first film you see. It's interesting, emotional and awesome.All the characters you already have met on the silver screen- Ironman, Captain America, Antman etc... are great. They are looked at from all perspectives- we see their flaws along with their powers. The new characters are a bit of a hit and a miss. Black Panther was my favourite character of the film, and was really nice to see him fight it out on the big screen. However, Spiderman was less of a spectacle. Tom Hollands version of Peter Parker is oddly irritating, and actually made me despise the character, just wishing he would leave the screen. The look of Spiderman was fine, but every time he spoke and said something utterly stupid, it made me want to shoot the screen. But besides Tom Hollands Spiderman, the rest of the characters are interesting and accurately portrayed.The filmmaking skills displayed by Joe and Anthony Russo are brilliant. But don't expect anything too flashy as this is a blockbuster Hollywood film. But they certainly do their job well, and should be credited more for the films success then they have been. Ian Johnstons Captain America: The First Avenger was good, but it lacked an epic feel that the Russo brothers then gave to the Winter Soldier. Coming into civil war, we shouldn't have expected anything better then the Winter Soldier, but we did get better. The epic Russo vibe was clearly evident in this film, and for this 'vibe' alone, Civil War is the superior film to Batman VS Superman.Personally, I don't see it as ""Marvel VS DC"". I see them all as just comic book movies, even though I'm more inclined to enjoy DC films then Marvel. I loved Dawn of Justice, but Civil War tops it. It has more well constructed action sequences, and compared to Dawn of Justice, we love both of the heroes clashing(Ironman and Captain America) as they both have reasonable heroic reasons for their actions, compared to Supermans selfish, almost villainous ones. But having said this, both films are brilliant, and great in different aspects.Overall, Civil War is an amazing film, and quite possibly the most entertaining film of 2016, and one of the greatest marvel films ever made.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You're in for a treat,"I honestly can't express the amount of awesome in this movie. This is how you make movies let alone comic books movies.The story has been well thought out and and follows effectively. The characters and their motivations are well developed. Although a direct comparison between Batman V superman and this movie cannot be made, certain aspects can. For instance in BVS the new character introductions seemed rushed, however in CW the whole movie flowed really well.Age of Ultron was a bit of a let down it wasn't anything different from the previous Avengers movie. CW however was a definite step up the fight scenes themselves were astounding.This is definitely a movie I will be watching several times in the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good story with Amazing fights!,"Civil War is another great Marvel's movie. The way they make the combat between Captain America and Iron Man is like Batman vs. Superman, but it is not bad. Actually, this movie has so many fight scenes among superheroes that you don't care about the story.You may notice that Iron Man is not only 100% jokes at the movie and sometimes he is really angry. It is a good thing, because I usually like the humor in Marvel films, but sometimes they overcome a bit, and everyone knows Civil War is a movie that can be treated with more suspense.There is no doubt about that Spider Man was the most awaited character and yes, he is the best in the movie. Just a kid in the middle of grown people and he has to fight with them. A great surprise in the screens and he is present in almost half of the movie.As I said, the combat among superheroes is the best part of the movie. I am sure you have already thought in fights which involves superheroes vs. superheroes. In this movie, you watch great battles and you don't get tired of it because it is awesome to watch.I think it is not necessary to compare Civil War and Batman vs. Superman. They are different movies and you can undisturbedly enjoy both of them.Well, I highlighted the good parts of the movie and in general I liked it.To sum up, in my point of view, the story is not one of the best, but the fights exceed the story and transform the movie in a great job.I am anxious to watch next movies...Thank you guys to read my review and I hope you enjoy the movie.Bye, everybody. See you later!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Does not work as a film, only as a hub of the MCU's narrative","Captain America 3 is more like Avengers 2.5, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe becomes truly a running narrative because of itSteve Rogers, leading the Avengers, continues to cause chaos across the world in a noble cause to stop terrorism, but powers that be have had enough. Spearheaded by Tony Stark, a new initiative is set up to keep heroes in check so no more innocent lives are lost in the crossfire. But this causes further strife between the two men as Rogers tracks down his brainwashed friend Bucky Barnes, who is still being used as the assassin Winter Soldier by shadowy forcesAfter Captain America: The Winter Soldier whipped up audiences and critics alike into a state of euphoria, Civil War has a lot to live up to. So is it surprising that the sequel falls a little short? Winter Soldier was a welcome change of pace and a change of tone, bringing the character into the modern world with a sense of urgency and political clout. Civil War by comparison is one part thriller and another part playset romp where all fifteen action figures are hurled about. When everything is said and done, and the dust settles, Civil War felt alarmingly vacuous.We have seen Marvel heroes fighting each other before, we've seen it a lot. Ever since Thor's hammer struck Cap's shield in Avengers Assemble, the franchise has indulged in the clashing and harmony of super powers. Civil War isn't driven by a theme or even a tone, in fact the only theme is quite literally ""heroes get to fight each other"", and there's a certain vagueness around motivations and morals of characters. Did Stark really just hire a high school student to go to war?? Did Falcon really know how to find Scott Lang? Did Hawkeye just¬Ö come out of retirement? Why? Did Bucky really just fall back into the amnesia assassin story again?But having a theme about fighting isn't always bad. Hell no! The airport fight that the trailer teases, is so much fun. It had me laughing aloud in giddy, childish enthusiasm. Here we have ten superheroes from across the last two phases of the MCU punching each others lights out, but the star of the scene is Marvel's own interpretation of Spider-man. When the fight starts with Spidey asking Stark: ""So what do I do now Mr Stark?"" you know things are going to get ridiculously fun. If it weren't for this particular battle, Civil War would have been a colossal downer both in tone and execution.As great as Spider-man is in this fight, and as interesting as newcomer Black Panther is, both men feel shoehorned into the film. Peter Parker's introduction (as good as it is) virtually stalls the movie! It genuinely feels tacked on, perhaps due to Sony eventually giving up the rights to the character during Civil War's initial production phase, likely pushing Black Panther's screen time to accommodate the web slinger. The battle sequence that opens the film between Avengers and Crossbones (alias of a bit part player in Winter Soldier, who no one will remember, nor need to remember) has some of the worst shaky cam in recent memory. Not sure how critics are ignoring this. While a highway chase later on, which is a foot race, looks laughably fake.Ultimately, if you are keeping up with the Marvel movie narrative you will take more from this movie. Personally, I am putting my foot down to say that this continuous narrative device is getting tiresome. Civil War does not work as a singular film, it works as a hub connecting multiple movies from the past as well as numerous future projects together, but that isn't what I am looking for in a film.It is a fun movie (the dialogue is just as snappy as always) and it proves that the Russo Brothers can direct something as massive as the upcoming Marvel's Infinity War two parter with confidence. But it didn't feel like there was enough at stake, especially when everything is said and done; the ending felt really anticlimactic. It is a poor follow on from the concise Winter Soldier, but is perhaps the best Avengers film since 2012's Assemble.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the most epic superhero movies ever made,"Yesterday it was premiere and time for the second big superhero film this year, Captain America Civil War. I really like Captain America as a superhero, mostly due to his lack of over powerful strength. He is a soldier who during WWII, was subjected to experiments intended to make him a super soldier. The result was superhuman powers but nowhere near the likes of Superman or the Hulk. Frozen down and later awaken in present day earth, he struggles to adapt in modern society where everyone he has known or loved, is gone. In Civil War he is pinned against Iron Man. The government of the USA, forces the Avengers to sign a contract stating that they have to obey and work under supervision of the leaders of the world. Iron Man is convinced that it is the right thing to do while Captain claims that they will be forced to do things they don't want to.I really liked Captain America Civil War and I would say that it is one of Marvel's and overall among the best superhero films ever made. Forget Superman's or the Avenger films' extremely over powerful enemies that practically can erase the earth with a wind blow. Here it is brains before muscles and I like it. The film practically has more in common with James Bond and the Mission Impossible films, than with other superhero films. The spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film, with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries. There is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering today's world situation. The other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters. Civil War contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone. But with finesse and a prioritized focus, they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters. Very smart and thought-out. With most focus on Captain America and then Iron Man, they succeed much better than the previous Avenger films and most of all the latest Batman V Superman.The biggest question we all had before the film was, how will they put Captain America against Iron Man? Where Batman V Superman totally failed to motivate why those two giants would even fight each other, here they succeeded better from an even more difficult position because Captain America and Iron Man are friends that becomes enemies due to ideological and psychological differences. Overall the characters' actions are really well motivated. They have worked hard on giving every character a believable back story that drives them forward. Aside from the main conflicts and the superheroes, it is an incredibly well made film. The battle between the superheroes is so good looking and well choreographed that I can't think of an equal. Also the tempo and editing of the film works well towards it pretty long but still good runtime. The film constantly moves closer to the truth with small surprise moments and turning points along the way. It is perhaps necessary to have watched some of the other Marvel films before this one, but I still think that this works well on its own and that you should definitely take the chance to watch it in the cinemas because it is really exciting, good looking and well madeDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As much a Captain America as an Iron Man movie,"It is amazing to me that a movie like this manages to be not just a great sequel to The Winter Soldier, but also to Iron Man 3, AND Age of Ultron, and still also be a good movie. A movie like this could easily crumble under the weight of so many characters, and yet it doesn't. Most of them get plenty of plot and an arc. Enough time is also dedicated to the new characters that this movie introduces.This is not just a mindless action movie, like Age of Ultron. This is a pretty clever movie, with a solid plot, some red herrings, and twists. Of course not all characters get equal screen time. Thor and The Hulk aren't in the movie at all. And Hawk Eye is barely in it either. Other characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow do get a decent plot. Vision struggles with human behavior, Wanda struggles with people being afraid of her, and Black Widow is caught in the middle, and struggling to pick a side. But in the end, I found myself strongly agreeing with Tony Stark. Even by the end of the movie, me and my friends had strong disagreements about which character was in the right. I find this a clear sign of a very strong plot.Where the movie especially shines is it's first half. The movie spends a lot of time explaining the conflict at the heart of the story, and addresses the cost of all the absurd destruction from The Avengers, Iron Man, The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. There's really good dialogue in this film. I loved hearing every characters point of view, and it's hard to argue with any of them. They all have solid motives. The new character Black Panther isn't just thrown in at random. He is central to the plot. And the plot feels very serious, just like with The Winter Soldier. It isn't until the middle of the movie, that it embraces the over the top comic book action and the humor from The Avengers. So in a way, this movie is half Winter Soldier, and half The Avengers.As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the best so far. It stands in stark contrast to the recent Batman V Superman. How can one movie be such a mess, and another do so much right? It honestly is some kind of miracle. Considering all the characters they need to juggle in this movie, and all the plot threads they need to tie together, this is one heck of a script.The action is also top notch. There's a lot of really good car chases and free running action scenes in this. This makes some of the action feel very grounded in reality, just as in The Winter Soldier. I also got the feeling that they made plenty of use of practical effects. Of course there is also plenty of use of CGI and this. But at no point did anything really stand out to me. Again, this is quite a miracle, considering all the different effect studios involved with this.Stay around till after the credits. Because the movie has both a mid-credits sequence, and an after-credits sequence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"With two big sides taking place, Captain America: Civil War sets up for an awesome superhero movie and story about friendships.","Though we're still a few weeks into the release, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice seems to be setting itself into the position on ""how to NOT make a superhero crossover film"". While I didn't hate the movie as much as some are really making it out to be (some are even calling for director Zack Snyder to be booted from the upcoming Justice League movie that is still good to go), it was still overstuffed with a ton of stories that either needed to be their own movies or cut entirely. Warner Brothers will need to try and model Disney with what the latter has been doing with Marvel Comics and their heroes.Not only does Marvel allow their stories to pace themselves over several movies and bring in a more playful tone, but they seem to try and actually bring in modern day issues that have been controversial. Captain America: The Winter Solider managed to mirror the real life events that have surrounded the NSA and their surveillance on the general public. The American people are split over the upcoming election with extreme rights and extreme lefts about to burst into an electoral civil war. The Avengers too burst into their own struggle in Captain America: Civil War.It seems that the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: Age of Utron have become a bit of a nuisance to the Untied Nations with the amount of damage caused by our heroes. While Captain America (played by Chris Evens) is leading some of the avengers on a mission in Lagos, an accidental explosion strikes a building, hurting many people. This seals the deal for U.S. secretary of state General Ross (played by William Hurts) to set up a UN panel that would oversee the Avengers and decide when to be called upon. This is called the Sokovia Accords.This puts the entire team in a divide. Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) feels that U.N. intervention is necessary as that they need boundaries and that this could prevent further villains from emerging. Steve Rogers sees the Accords as a bureaucratic headache that would keep them from helping everyone. When the Captain rescues Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) from UN's arrest for a bombing in Vienna, this creates sides. The Captain gets the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man to join his side while Iron Man gets War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man to join his side. Both sets of heroes fight while a Sokovian terrorist Helut Zemo (played by Daniel Br√ºhl) plans for a bigger attack.With all the heroes shown in Captain America: Civil War, there is a lot of hype to deliver. Amazingly, it manages to both satisfy those that wanted to see an all superhero melee and paints a great story about friendships. There was a huge risk trying to put in all of these heroes yet remain a story for Steve Rogers.The focus is where it needs to be as it shows a guy who's got to figure which friendship is more important; Bucky or Stark. Both newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man are welcomed warmly into the Marvel Cinematic universe as they get plenty of scenes. The actual battle in the civil war is twenty five minutes of pure joy that show why movies were made; to see moments like that come to life!Now how is the rest of movie supposed to go on after that scene? It's difficult to say because the third act does falter towards the end. We get one more big fight between Captain America and Iron Man that's great, but does not top the civil war sequence. I'm not sure if the solution is to make the final fight bigger or tone down the middle fight. I think that after such a rush of amazing, it's difficult to even continue.I'll give this nine battling heroes out of five. Captain America: Civil War makes for a great start to the next phase of Marvel movies. If not uneven, it's at least exciting. I'd hate to be the one that misses this hero epic in theaters, so don't miss out and pick a side.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good for superhero film,"Not a huge fan of superhero movies, but this is good.The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie.With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts.On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man.They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A really well put together movie, on par with quality we expect of Marvel","This movie does everything right. All the things that BvS struggled with are handled beautifully here.The movie takes the time to develop all of the many characters in this series and introduce new characters. Two previously known additions to Avengers namely, Spiderman and Antman, and a brand new badass character, Black Panther, who proves once and for all that you can intro a new character without a damn origin story and have them play just fine.Every character gets screen time to develop an opinion on the issue that divides the ranks of the Avengers. Their conclusions feel natural to the character's experiences and therefore their motivations feel genuine. As such we are easily able to associate with characters on both sides. When the fights happen it's hard to know who to root for, you feel like you are watching your friends have a falling out. Even when you pick a side on the issue itself from your own perspective, you feel like the characters on the other side reached the ""wrong"" decision based on logic that makes sense to them.The characters on screen also act the same way. They love the avengers that oppose them, but they see no way out. They try to pull their punches, but eventually things escalate. This is brilliant, and makes you as the viewer much more invested in the fighting.The movie manages to get the pacing right also, the entire thing feels like it's 40 minutes long. When it was over I couldn't believe that all that time flew by.In conclusion this was an extremely enjoyable action movie. All the fights and effects are extremely well done and very exciting as we've come to expect from Marvell in recent years. But most importantly you care for the fights because the characters are likable and well developed, this lets you get invested in the universe and the conflict that it presents.

Popcorn Entertainment It Is!,"The sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger & 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 'Captain America: Civil War' is Popcorn Entertainment!

This is how a Superhero Film should be.'Captain America: Civil War' Synopsis: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.'Captain America: Civil War' is not perfect, its not even close to it. But what it is, in totality, is an arresting Superhero film, that shows Marvel's most prolific Good Guys fight it out. And I'm gonna say it again, the Sequence involving Team Capt vs Team IronMan, is exhilarating. Just a month ago we saw a STINKER involving Superheroes, but the real gift for fans like me, is this one.Screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely is mostly arresting. Although, its a bit too long & a bit too busy. I did not particularly enjoy the final 20-minutes, I felt the ""final showdown"" could've been sharper. But otherwise, I ain't complaining. The narrative slowly builds up & the reason why the good-guys go against each other, makes sense. Its involving & undoubtedly entertaining. Anthony & Joe Russo's Direction is superb. They have handled this blockbuster, with flourish. Cinematography is top-notch, while the Editing could've been crisper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences & Graphics are FANTASTIC. Henry Jackman's Score is great.Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, delivers a committed performance, but its Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, who steals the thunder. This is a more serious Stark we see here & its a welcome change. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, is in form. Daniel Br√ºhl as Helmut Zemo, is solid. William Hurt as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, defines command. But The Highlights, however, are Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man & Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther. Holland is scene-stealing good, while Boseman is electrifying. I personally can't wait to see their standalone films in the coming future! And Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, shines.

The front-gate of marvel cinematic universe.  Marvel gives an intense depiction how superheroes movie could be.,"By far, this is the widest, deepest, most-detailed, and best- choreographed of marvel movies. In this movie, marvel distinctly send message that superhero genre is not on the fringe of degradation. It erase all the cynical and doubts feeling from people. Of course if we seek for the realism action, there are no such thing in superhero genre. In my opinion, a superhero genre needs to be rated in different perspective than a normal action film. Thats also happens for CGI. Still, civil war (which solely captain America franchise, not avengers or bigger context) is complete as a film. It consist of well-directed storytelling, good character performance (especially Downey), good jokes, and very good choreography (especially airport scene). Russo brothers did well to made choreography for captain America winter soldier and he did it again in civil war. This director develops in a nice way.Civil war got some good rating from metacritic. Its not a surprise, because to be honest this movie is good in such way even as superhero genre. Definitely, its not overrated or underrated, it is correctly rated. There are some strong-point that makes civil war is one kind of movie that given so many applause by audience at the end. First, i highlights the team work choreography. Even with so many character casted, there are no wasted superhero. Everybody takes their part precisely with an accurate duration given by the director. Each superhero contains their unique characterization so the character development is greatly well-done. Some funny, some charismatic, and some cool. One thing that prove this statement is at the airport fight. Intense, tough, and hilarious. The superhero combination was marvelous. The fights full of surprise and good choreography, everybody express their unique.The second was its balance. Russo successfully add good portion of jokes, intrigues, and their character development duration. Superhero genre also can be something that beautifully made if brewed by a right formula. Imagine if there are no spiderman, maybe there are no jokes or cool moments right. Russos brave enough to add spiderman and black panther even without their solo movie before and it gives a huge impact to the film itself. Yes, this movie keeps making surprise to audience as the duration goes on. This also one of the strong point of civil war.Third, civil war carried so much by the charisma of Robert Downey JR. We should give credit to this talented actor. To play the role as a superhero is not easy, because you need to be balanced between physical, imagination, and acting skill. You need to be agile in fighting scene, have a good body, and deliver good acting. Yet, you need great portion of imagination because superhero basically using CGI shots, so you need to imagine how the final editing could be from raw green screen shots. Thats why we never met such a good characterization of superhero before. But today, i found one person that truly pass it, yes the iron man by Downey. His acting skill always evolving since his three iron man movies. In civil war, Downeys performance was on the apex level. He successfully mastering the character of tony stark the iron man with rich-man gesture, intellectual person, and funny. The expression and charisma he had is so striking.Objectively, i can say Civil War was marvels best. This is how superhero genre movie could and should be. Maximizing their characters with a balance of storytelling and amazing superheroes teamwork choreography. Even a little bit too dragging, I truly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Near Flawless,"The Russo's just get better and better when it comes to directing action. Civil War is one of the best looking movies I have seen this year and is definitely showing that Marvel is not losing any momentum and is here to stay.While The Avengers are trying to stop Crossbones in Wakanda and something happens that kills a lot of innocent people. This causes some powerful people to put The Avengers in check, this also divides the team as some believe it is a good idea to be put in check (Iron Man) and some think it is unpatriotic (Captain America). There is also drama surrounding Bucky's past and this creates great tension between certain characters creating very emotional fights which again look amazing and are directed perfectly by the Russo's. We are also introduced to two new characters in the MCU, Black Panther and Spider-Man. Black Panther is a wild card and has his own motivations for being in the middle of the fight and he is a total badass who earns his right to be in the film but I feel that Spider-Man was a little tacked on. Don't get me wrong Tom Holland played the wall crawler better than anyone we have seen on the big screen yet and I'm very excited to see Homecoming next year but while it was a strong introduction, it did feel a little tacked on at times. There are also moments where you find yourself wondering why a character is even in the movie, you never quite get a clear motive for him being there and it is a little noticeable but it will not take you out of the film.Overall this was definitely one of my favorite films of the year so far with great direction, cinematography, and great performances.

Excellent Superhero movie!,"I was a little afraid going into Captain America: Civil War because many movies with a lot of strong characters tend to focus less on the story. I am ecstatic to said that this did not happen. Each opinion of the characters are shown and the story comes together nicely.Now let's talk about the fight scenes and CGI. They were awesome! I think Black Widow had some the most intricate fight moves. Sure it was not actually Scarlett Johansson and probably her stunt double, I say this because her back is facing the camera most of the fight scenes. The CGI was so well done and the biggest CGI image is in the very beginning of the movie that involves Tony Stark. I don't want to spoil too much about it but it is very neat.I had only one issue. The fight scenes while they were great they did go on for a while. I do not know if I was just tired that day but one fight scene I started nodding off. But like I said it may have to do more with me then the movie.Better than the second Avenger movie, Captain America: Civil War is action packed and enjoyable for all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Marvel Superhero movie,"Captain America: Civil War is an action superhero movie directed by Joe Russo, Anthony Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Late Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland and Daniel Bruhl.This is one of the best Marvel series movie and one of my Favorite. Great cast and characters, superb action scenes with a pinch of humor, commendable VFX and an memorable ending.The team has surely worked on the script and plot of the movie and this is a different plot altogether. The point which is to be noted is that the villain of the movie doesn't has any super power still he created the havoc amongst all the superheroes.Screenplay of the movie was superb and keeps you engaged through out the movie. Acting is the another strong aspect of the movie with some of the best Hollywood actors this department never disappointed. Climax of the movie is good.One of the best Marvel movie with a great plot and good execution",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What can you say? The MCU's batting average is pretty solid,"The Marvel films have come a long way now. First they started with movies establishing the characters. Then they all crossed over to fight threats. Now the only sensible thing to do is to start having them come into serious conflict with each other.The MCU films have so far been solid. You have had great ones like Iron Man, The Avengers and Winter Soldier. And you've had meh ones like Iron Man 2, Thor the Dark World. For me personally, the worst of the bunch is Iron Man 3 but even that is somewhat well made.I will say Civil War is the more appropriate Avengers sequel. Ultron somewhat gave me a headache as it was all over the place. And its no surprise Joss Whedon just quit after that. This film is surprisingly contained despite being based off of Mark Millar's very extensive storyline. Having removed Hulk and Thor really helped contain the story.The action set-pieces, while not as all over the place as Ultron was, were still sometimes difficult to watch. I like that the Russo brothers introduced some grit in the Winter Soldier, but they introduced a mild form a shaky cam in Civil War. Yes the camera jolted up and down at times during a frenetic action sequence with some quick cuts.The best set-piece though had to be the airport throwdown. And unlike Batman v Superman earlier this year, there was a proper build-up to the throwdown between the two disagreeing factions. Not only that, the airport was empty so you can watch the fight with maximum comfort and not worry about civilians or wanton destruction.And with the build-up to the fight, you can definitely see the characters really develop, not only in this film but the preceding ones as well. Tony Stark started off as basically a neo-con in the first film, then to a guy who opposes the government to now believing in accountability therefore being surprisingly in favour of the superhero registration accord. Steve Rogers a guy who is a relic from a different time is basically someone who always wants to do the right thing and working for the government that looks out for its own self interests may not be the right thing. Both have equally valid points.There are two new additions. Black Panther or T'Challa is the first. And I'm so glad he finally got his big screen treatment. He is such an awesome character and adds to the diversity sorely lacking in superhero films. His costume is amazing as well. With the director of Creed making his film, it will kick a lot of ass.The second addition is Spider-Man. And this is one of the better adaptations of the character as they really embellished on his youth. We keep forgetting that Spidey is in his teens. Although I am concerned now that the Marvel films have an over-abundance of quippy characters: Iron Man, Starlord, Ant-Man and now him.As usual in an MCU film, the villain is forgettable. In this case however, you can excuse that because the main conflict is between the heroes. The revelation in the third act really helps to reinforce that.So yes this film was really enjoyable. More focused than Ultron and better story telling than the DC films. The only gripe is just with the filming and editing of the action sequences. Marvel, you done it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrific,"In short the movie was terrific. In spite of the big cast, the story has been built up beautifully. Every one has had their chance to make a mark in the movie. The fighting scenes were shown beautifully. It was planned and made perfectly. This marks the beginning of the 3rd phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel did it with style. The 3rd phase already got a kick-start. The story had a different theme here. Marvel has always launched a solo film of every superhero before adding them to a cast in the big banner movies. But this time they did well and experimented by adding Black Panther to the cast who hasn't yet had a solo movie. Apart from all the brilliant performances, the addition of Spider- Man to this Universe was welcoming. Hope this phase also builds up the story of Infinity War slowly and steadily. And the road leads to the end in an interesting way. Also waiting for the rest of the movies of the third phase, especially the new heroes that are to be introduced to the Universe. Hope they also does well and the story is connected.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel just keeps raising the bar for multi-superhero movies...in every aspect...best one so far!!!,"The Russo brothers raise the bar for multi-hero movies to a whole new level after their earlier success of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. As expected the CGI and Stunt team does a fantastic job, better actually, than Winter Soldier which is in itself a masterpiece. Those of us, someone like me who haven't read much of the comics, may be expecting a different plot/background on which the 'Civil War' happens...although the movie takes on many different angles and perspectives through which we can see the characters in new light. With Winter Soldier, they've already laid the platform for this one and it builds beautifully on it. Marvel has always had this knack of handling multiple characters and preserving their individuality while keeping them in sync with the plot, and it doesn't disappoint this time as well. Quite a few character introductions were hinted in the trailers itself what with Black Panther and Spidey coming back to the MCU. What is impeccable is they give each character its own space while still building up on the story. A lot of tussle, both emotional and physical can be seen between the so-called two teams, each member struggling in their own stead of facing someone who until quite recently was fighting with them side by side. The background score complements each scene perfectly well and the camera team captures each stunt with breath taking perfection.Overall, it is a brilliant attempt given the complexity of the plot which I won't discuss here for the sake of the thrill of actually witnessing it in cinemas. If you've not already watched it, you're missing out on some serious entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Getting tired with superhero movies.......,I don't know about you but i'm starting to get tired with so many superhero films they release almost each month.I don't know why marvel have so much success with those films but for me it's time to withdraw from those kind of films especially the superhero vs superhero films like avengers and this captain America film.in those kind of films we most experience video games cgi effects as a superhero fights another superhero.......feeble minded boy stuff.At least solo superhero films are more serious than the S.H vs films.as for this movie it was not bad at all...it had fights...plot...action but like i said we get too much of these movies lately AND IT'S KINDA BORING.I think as long as those films will be in fashion we will always get new ones plus TV series.next similar film in line to be released is the new X-MEN film and a dozen more were announced including characters like DR. STRANGE who are not well known to the public.don't know bout you.........but for me it's getting boring.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome addition to the Marvel Universe!,"Great action.All these are shown in trailers so I'm not giving anything away!Black Panther's car chase has flawless CGI.Bucky grabs a motorcycle and flips it around in motion.Spiderman's fanboy is pretty funny. Great actor pick for Spidey.Personal touches between the characters is a great break in the action.Another director could have allowed the movie to drag over the 2 1/2 hour behemoth. Never drags, great throughout. Moves along great.Of course the action and pace accelerates in the 3rd act and is great!It's a toss up between Avengers and Cap 3 on which is the best. Avengers probably edges out because it was the first group movie that really worked. Sorry X-men.You'll definitely enjoy it on the big screen and later at home. Saw it in 3D but would also be great in 2D.Sorry Batman v Superman lovers. I saw it and it's not as good. Saw Batman v Superman in 3D too.Enjoy and have fun!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well made and decent,"When I agreed to go and see this movie with friends, I regretted that decision. This is mainly because I do not enjoy many superhero movies and I rarely go out of my way to see them. But this one was an interesting journey and had a cool concept of superhero beating the hell out of each other. So I don't regret the decision anymore.The movie is well shot but it felt like it had quite a bit of shaky cam in the fight scenes which I find quite annoying usually. The pacing of the movie felt quite fast and neatly laid out which was great. I wasn't bored through the movie like I have been with other recent Superhero flicks so that was great. The exposition can be a bit boring and tedious but the movie gets going quite quickly and has a good balance of everything you want with this type of movie.The action is great all the way through. There are many fights spaced out through the exposition scenes, all the fights felt brutal. And because its superheroes vs each other it can feel quite personal and gripping, even though you know they wont kill each other really. If you want to see this movie, the best reason to see it is for the action and characters, as there is a lot of both them things. Plus the stories or structure are never the strong part of superhero movies usually anyway.The characters are pretty much all the people we've seen before in the past movies plus a few new ones added in. So if you love the characters then thats one of the greatest reasons to see any movie! As the focus of this movie is more aimed at Captain America, Tony Stark is less witty then he probably would be in a movie where he is more of the focus but he still manages to get some humour in still so its not gone completely. All the actors play their parts great and all work off of each other well. No one lets the team down with a dodgy performance.The story of course is the main point and it may be the weakest point of the movie, at least to me anyway. Superhero movies very rarely have a story that actually makes you feel anything and the story just feels like it has to be there to keep the audience away from action for a while. With that said, it isn't badly done or in need to be ranted about. The overall point in the movie was apparently done in Batman Vs Superman which doesn't surprise me as Hollywood love to release two movies at the same time with a similar narrative and message. With all this said, this movies main focus is characters and not story. And the characters are all there, so if you love them, then you'll like the movie.It has the humour and the drama that the other films have which you may like if you enjoyed it in the other movies. If you are a fan of superhero movies at all then you should really like it as I believe it ticks all the boxes for an enjoyable superhero flick. If you aren't a fan though then you may still possibly like it because of the concept, or something else may wow you. If you hate these types of movies with a passion then you may not like this one, in fact you'll hate it. It doesn't break any ground or do much too differently that the other movies do. And given that I don't enjoy them ones, then I guess I like the movie mainly for the concept.The movie overall is a good experience and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't mind watching it again. If I had to choose between all of the superhero films, this would be on my list of likely to pick. People might be wondering if its better than Batman Vs Superman and id say, given all the criticism that movie got, this one must be the better one out of the two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Honest Review (No fanboyism.) of Captain America.,"This was a movie that had an intriguing story, and since I own the Civil War comic, I was curious to see how this movie would play out. I had hoped it might right the wrongs made by Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Well guys, I was wrong.No bias, completely honest. Captain America: Civil War is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.This entire film is nothing but rabbit trails, it is leading up to a film that never happens, Baron Zemo is one of the worst villains in a comic book movie to date (Next to Dr. Doom.) This movie is a complete cashgrab, the fight scenes look so fake, it has absolutely no emotional weight.The fight scenes have no stakes or consequences whatsoever. They are making quips every other second, and it's super cringeworthy. The Ant-Man stuff (No spoilers.) in the movie is so laughable, I could not take the fight serious whatsoever.The things in this movie that are supposed to make it feel epic, is total complete garbage. A lot of the characters come off whiny in this movie (Stark, Romanoff, Black Panther.). Black Panther, i will admit did have some cool moments, and he was one of my only positives of this.Movies are supposed to make you care, feel the heat of the battle, and feel the suspense of what's going on. I felt absolutely nothing for these characters, and the fact they kept deflating the movie with their stupid jokes made it even more difficult to feel the intensity of the battle.At least I felt it with Batman and Superman. That movie may have had a lot of problems, but I like it more because it was bold and I felt for Batman and Superman in the battle (Like the mother scene, it felt really emotional, but the movie kinda smothered the premise.) And every punch thrown in that movie, you felt it. Like the Warehouse scene, it felt real and I could feel the heat of the battle because every punch thrown could be felt. And with that movie, at least they had the balls to do bold things. This movie had no balls, let alone a spine.The main hero of the movie; Captain America, his reasons and logic to fight is completely stupid, and he was the most annoying character next to Stark.This is a Captain America movie, but I did not care for him. This was my issue with them doing Civil War with this movie, I knew they would not do that story justice, and it was a mistake from the beginning to include ALL the avengers. And regardless of whether you agree with me now, you probably will agree with this 2-3 years from now.Spider-Man, all I can say is, this guy will not shut up. I hated his suit and found him totally annoying (I liked Andrew Garfield more than Tom Holland.). Yes, I realize that's what he's like from the comics, but he comes off so over the top in this movie. At least Andrew Garfield balanced it to a point where he's not annoying, the movie just didn't do him justice (Both TASM and this.)Do not believe in the hype of this movie at all, cause you are being deceived (Like that moron Chris Stuckmann giving this movie an A+? What the heck is he smoking thinking that?)Don't buy into the lie about seeing it just because it's fun and entertaining. Cause your setting yourself up for disappointment.I'm going to give this movie a 3/10. I'm sorry Marvel fans, I just did not like it. As a matter of fact, I hated it.If you love or enjoy this movie, that's fine and I'm glad you guys enjoy it. But you have to acknowledge sooner or later that Marvel has no spine, and this fun and light tone is extremely cringeworthy and them smothering powerful stories is just wrong (Civil War was a total game changer in the comics, people died, consequences happened, this was no where near that.)",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This film provides the breath of fresh air I needed,"Captain America: The Winter Solider pitted the titular protagonist against an organisation bigger then himself, all whilst battling his own demons, particularly his best friend-turned assassin, Bucky. Civil War at its core follows this narrative, exploring the relationship between these two characters even further. After numerous, wide-scaled and deadly incidents, the US Government, and now Secretary of State, 'Thunderbolt' Ross introduces the Sokovia Accord-which aims to prevent the heroes from acing freely but rather work in accordance to rules and regulations of the Untied Nations. In this regard, Civil War retains the political driven narrative and themes of The Winter Solider, but makes it more personal. The characters have different viewpoints and conflicting ideologies, causing them to split apart and form their own sides. Tony Stark for example feels guilty after a confrontation with a mother leads to him realising the cost of his actions; helping him realise that he shouldn't be allowed to act on his free will. Steve Rodgers believes ""that the safest hands are still our own"" and refuses to sign his name and adhere to the Sokovia Accords. The film perfectly sets up their conflicting beliefs, providing depth to the reasons they fight. We know these characters and their relationships with one another, both of which combine to make an interesting plot.Now I have to address about one big talking point, the introduction of a new (yes a third!) Spiderman. And boy was it an introduction and a half! 19 year old Tom Holland perfectly portrays the characteristics of Spiderman we love; he is witty, inexperienced and most importantly, young. He is a breath of fresh air to this older team but also the character itself. The Amazing Spiderman trilogy nailed the chemistry between Peter and Gwen, but there was nothing special about those films that really stood out to me. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit hesitant at the casting of a younger Spiderman as well as the recent announcement of the title of the official film, 'Spiderman Homecoming', but seeing the way he was presented just got me so damn excited. There is no origin story for the character, but that's partly because its safe to assume that at this point, almost everyone knows his tragic upbringing and the way he gained his powers. He is a character who is fascinated by characters like Tony Stark and idealises him, we, the audience share his excitement. He seems identifiable, something Spiderman needs to be.Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is a straight-faced hero but a pure bad-ass. I really enjoyed his cat-like agility and ninja-esque fighting style. His agenda was clear too and he is a likable character, but more character development is needed, especially in terms of establishing the vastly different country, known as Wakanda, he comes from.One issue I did have was the pacing. Now the film certainly makes the most of its two hours and seventeen minute run-time but I personally found the opening quarter to slow. Yes, it is broken up by sudden bursts of action, but for the most part it just felt too slow. I do have to stress that this was a personal opinion however.Daniel Br√ºhl's antagonist, Zemo, is nothing spectacular, but fits in with the theme of responsibility and vengeance. Civil War does a good job of blurring the line between good and bad, right and wrong. You can argue that Steve Rodgers is wrong, but that Tony Stark is right and vice versa-but one thing is abundantly clear, this film did not necessarily need Zeemo in any way.I did enjoy the choice of locales, particularly with Germany featuring heavily, although perhaps slightly excessive and repetitively. The action was massive in scale and most definitely well choreographed. Speaking of which, the 15-minute IMAX fight was brilliant. It looked extremely cheesy as the two opposing sides sprinted (or flew) to each other in the trailer, but boy do the characters get their chance to shine. It just works, with the fight (the only exceptions being Hawkeye and Black Widow) being balanced. Spiderman just makes the scene however. This was hands down the best thing about the film for me.Now I absolutely loved Batman V Superman (I am sorry for bringing this film up, but it is an important point!), but one thing lacking in the film was the depth to establish the characters agendas. In Civil War, we (speaking in terms of the general audience) understand why they are fighting each other and it makes sense. Sure, it does feel slightly rushed and forced, but the Russo Brothers have used this idea effectively. This was a vital strong and one reason why I felt this film was good. I think another special aspect of this film was that, despite my initial worries, it's not an Avengers film. Yes it features these beloved characters, but it is a story about two friends in the face of adversary, caught up in a world they don't belong in, but have inadvertently become so deeply involved in.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This is how a ""versus"" movie should be done.","After a disappointing ""versus"" movie we got a couple of months ago, Captain America: Civil War was clearly a remedy for that. The best thing about it was they've had a reason to fight and a reason to end it without a lame excuse like sharing the same mother's name. The story was simple, not about who's right or wrong, it was about what you believe in and how that would make you different from the others and the results of it sometimes not what you expected. Throughout the movie I couldn't decide which sides I would take because both team had valid reasons to defend their decision. The actors were really on top of their games. For me, the highlights were Elizabeth Olsen and Tom Holland (yes, he's a perfect Spider-Man). I also agree to some people who didn't like this version of Baron Zemo, but after watching the movie for second time, I think Zemo was a brilliant mastermind in creating the conflict between Avengers and I hope that he will appear in the future MCU films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel show DC how it's done,"I was expecting big things from this film. Especially with the mild disappointment of Batman vs Superman. I had a lot of faith in the Russo brothers to deliver, especially after what they did with The Winter Soldier. And, boy they delivered. Again, they've delivered the perfect blend of action, humour and seriousness we've seen in other Marvel hits, but this time they had about 10 superheroes to fit in. And they did it. They actually gave each character a chance to shine in their own respect. Which I thought was outstanding. The action was expertly done, with minimal CGI and lots of hand-to-hand combat, which is how it should be done. In summary, this film has made me very excited for Infinity War. P.S: Spiderman is f***ing awesome!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally. Marvel movies grow up and tackle mature themes.,"Following a series of battles and a fatal error in a Mission that saw much collateral damage, the world finally calls for regulation on the superhero team known as the Avengers. Facing an uncertain future, the avengers are split on ideological grounds with captain America aka Steve rogers opposing regulation and iron man aka Tony stark supporting it. What begins as arguments soon morphs into rivalry, then escalates into conflict and ultimately battles. Into this conflict comes The Black Panther, a superhero from Africa who is after Captain America's Friend the Winter Soldier for involvement in an assassination attempt. As opposing sides deal with this new development, a young man gifted with the powers of a spider is recruited into the fight.What comes across as amazing is the directors' way for tying all these plot threads together. You have the black panther situation, the growing differences between Tony and Steve, the overarching political debate on accountability, then you have Spiderman being reintroduced into the marvel cinematic universe. With all these characters and subplots, the film never lets us forget this this is primarily a Captain America movie. Steve Rogers is the main focus with Tony Stark as his foil. With a little thinking by the audience to connect the dots, the plot threads fall into place nicely and the stories fit along parallel themes. Our tale is fast paced, going from tense conversation to awesome action and back again.The tone is, finally, more serious and more grounded, a much welcome departure from the increasingly comedic tones of most marvel movies. There is a true sense that the stakes are high, and the potential for loss is great. The Russo brothers crafted a serious political thriller in CAPTAIN America WINTER SOLDIER, and now they up that ante in writing, characters and action. Though some of the fights have that ""sped-up-in-post-production"" look, it is grittier, more brutal and less ""dance-like"" than most of other marvel movies. The final battle between Tony and Steve stands out as the best marvel movie fight ever not only because of the perfectly shot scenes but in the emotional aspect as well. Conflicts are framed in a ""no nonsense"" approach, rather than the cartoon-like quip filled play battles of before. Not that there aren't quips but these are from characters defined as such in their original comics, namely Tom Holland's Spiderman.Easily the freshest aspect of the movie, Tom Holland embodies the youthful wall crawler that comic fans love. His introduction foregoes the usual overly long origin tale and gets him right into the action. Everything is perfect, the way he moves, the way he talks, his emotional journey through the movie that runs parallel to that of the Robert Downey jr's Tony stark and Chris Evan's Steve Rogers. Everyone brings their best to the roles both new and familiar, with the two veterans conveying the emotional anguish and turmoil of two brothers-in-arms forced to opposing sides.This movie's emotional weight relies heavily on continuity and would be more effective if one had been following these characters from their first movies, through avengers and marvel phase two, right up till now. Without the 8 or so preceding movies, it is difficult to get a grasp on Captain America's or Iron Man's differing ideologies and unresolved interpersonal tension. Their motivations seem propelled by stubbornness and ego which would seem shallow without their relational context as provided by past movies.Thankfully the magnificent chemistry between this cast who have co-starred together for so long, shines. Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. And the rest all truly become their characters, drawing the audience into this fantasy world where secret Organisations, spies, superheroes and people with powers co-exist. There are some ill timed comedy, especially those that come in the middle of intense scenes. It kills the drama and the serious mood. Thankfully, these are few and lesser in number than previous marvel movies.The big downside, especially as a fan of the comics, is how different this is from the original civil war miniseries. The original was a tragic tale of good intentions carried out in bad ways, it deconstructed super hero feuds, touched on politics, delved into the philosophical question of freedom or security; themes that resonate with the world deeply entrenched in the war on terror. The movie version downplays a lot of that. Message to marvel: if you are going to use a title, at least respect the source material. This does have a few fleeting similarities but all in all feel like a completely different story which had no business using the name of an existing one. The political themes, touching on the accountability of those in power, are present but never at the forefront. By the movie's end, it does not even feature within the climatic showdown. What could have been a physical and metafictional ""fight"" between two friends representing opposing sociopolitical ideologies suddenly descends into a weak excuse for revenge.As a whole this is a tremendous improvement in every aspect over previous marvel team up movie AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON. Comic book movies will be hard pressed to match up to this standard set by CAPTAIN America CIVIL WAR. Yes there is ill placed humour, yes they kill a certain amount of the drama with cheap comedy and yes the relatively generic musical score by Henry Jackman seems wasted on such an epic. But the few flaws aside, this is finally the kind of movie that marvel should be making. One that takes its superheroes more seriously, tones down the jokes, and delves into deeper themes both social and political. More focus could have been given to those themes, but this is a very pleasing start to what I hope is the maturing of the marvel cinematic universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Same ol' Stuff,"Do you ever go to a concert for a band you loved 30 years before? It's great seeing the whole band back together, singing their songs with loyal, adoring fans. You have a wonderful night of nostalgia and, for a moment, you're transported back in time with the reminder of things you used to love. You overlook the fact that the band is a bunch of old fat guys, that their voices crack, their timing's off, etc ... you just love the fact that your favorite rockers are together with you again. That's the way I felt watching Civil War. While it's fun to spend a few hours with these characters again, the experience brought nothing new, nothing fresh and simply reminded me of the better films that preceded it. I watched it with a packed crowd that barely chuckled (barely made a sound) and who applauded meekly at the end like parents at the end of an elementary school play before filing quietly out of the theater. Few remained for the final stinger. For a 2.5 hour movie, it felt like it lasted longer.I loved the first Captain America. Its sense of patriotism and nostalgia was infectious. It's my favorite Marvel film. I really enjoyed the second CA, too, although at a point I felt a bit of CGI overload (especially when Widow removed the CG mask). But overall, they are definitely my favorite MCU films. I also enjoyed Ant-Man and the first Iron Man but could have easily skipped Guardians and the Thor films.When I read the sort of reviews this movie got (along with the reviews of Jungle Book three weeks ago), I can't help but think that Disney has brainwashed the world's critics. After seeing this film, I know it's true. Captain America: Civil War is in the bottom % of the Marvel films, right there with Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and the Hulk movies. The multiple chase and fight scenes are monotonous and, ultimately, pointless. The pacing is tedious and the story is jam-packed with too many characters. A scene in which Stark meets Peter Parker is not only unnecessary, but stops the movie in its tracks for ten full minutes. I don't understand the excitement reviewers have for the character; in my opinion, Spider-Man's role in the film was annoying and desperate. It would have been as if Robin appeared in the final battle in Batman v Superman asking the heroes if they had ever seen some 80s action movie in the middle of the fight ... a movie that the new movie was clearly ripping off. That's what Spidey does here - he provides comic relief for the kiddies.About halfway through the film I glanced at my watch. I kept glancing at it about every fifteen minutes. The movie seemed to go on ... and on ... and on. But there wasn't a single scene I loved, no musical score to embrace, no development from the first act to the last. The characters were the same at the end as they were in the beginning. And it was definitely Stan Lee's worst cameo in a film, a nyuk-nyuk joke setup that fell flat.Just so you know this isn't a hate-fest, let me tell you what I liked. 1. Black Panther and Scarlett Witch make memorable contributions to the film. 2. I have never been so glad for Paul Rudd to appear in a movie as I was in this one. His Ant-Man provides a much-needed spark. 3. I was glad to see William Hurt reprise his role as General Ross.I spoke to a few moviegoers on the way out of the theater. They thought Deadpool was much better (so did I, and I only marginally enjoyed that one). My kids were satisfied enough, although one thought Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman could have easily bested all of the Avengers by herself. They have no desire to see it again. Both enjoyed Batman v Superman better (both saw it three times).Like any loyal groupie, I will pay money to see my favorite rock band again when they come to town in concert and, likewise, I'll stand in line for that next Marvel movie. But I have a feeling I have heard their best songs before. Their Greatest Hits are in the past.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Most Impressive,"Captain America: Civil WarCaptain America and Iron Man have to very different ideals about how the avengers should work. Iron Man wants everyone to be in check since they've killed so many people and he feels bad. Captain America knows what happens when good people do nothing and doesn't want government telling him who to save and who to not.The Russo brothers directed both this movie and Winter Soldier, the precursor to this movie. I've only see that and The Community, and so far they've done nothing wrong for met yet. The direction of this movie must have been a massive undertaking and for that I applaud them.Christopher Markus must have done a ton of research into the Civil War event because there are so many amazing shots in the film that he must have wrote in. I can't wait for Infinity War since he's also writing the screenplay.The cast in this film is a mile long and a mile deep. Each character gets their own screen time but not without taking away from this being Captain America's movie. It all felt like this was his story and yes there are other characters and here are what they're doing. It didn't feel like a three act movie but more like 4 or 5 almost. Leaving the film I felt almost exhausted with details to think about.Newcomer Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman. I first saw this young actor in Draft Day and man he played that part well, he's showing his range and why he deserves to be in the avengers.Tom Holland was by far the definitive and best Spider-man we've had. I say this having loved Andrew Garfield's performance, but he felt too old and not funny enough. Tom Holland encapsulated what I felt was a genuine performance and quotable spider-man.Emily VanCamp kinda disappointed me. I don't want to say this film is flawless and she along with Daniel Bruhl also were some of the downfalls that keep this film from being the best Super Hero movie. I kept waiting for Sharon Carter (VanCamp) to do something and it all felt mute in the end.The Easy list. Best Captain America. Best Winter Soldier Best Falcon Best Scarlet Witch A great Iron Man A great Ant-Man Meh Black Widow Meh War Machine Meh Hawkeye Disappointing Vision Disappointing Crossbones.Verdict: Everyone should watch the film. There's barely any cursing and the violence is not over the top. Some scenes are: ""what's the importance of this?"" few scenes later, ""Oh, okay well that makes sense.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superb Film That's Fun Yet Textured and Intelligent!,"This movie is simply amazing. I was worried that I was expecting too much but this easily fulfilled and then exceeded all my already lofty expectations. I just loved it. The action sequences are spectacular and the story-line keeps you riveted from start to finish. The first act grabs you and eventually drops your jaw right to the floor. From there, the story has you and it's one big roller coaster ride to the heart rendering finish. I honestly believe movies like this are exactly what the cinema is for... a well structured and smart thrill ride.I have a feeling that the writing and intelligence of this film is going to surprise those that don't know any better. They think this must be a silly ""comic book"" film and don't realize that the comics are indeed deep, textured and intelligent. This is everything that is complex and cherished in years of quality comic book runs.Thank God literally that we all get to watch something this good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Comic Book Movie,"So far we had many comic book movies, but we never had so far, THE comic book movie. Not until Civil War! The Russo brothers did something I did not expect, exceed The Winter Soldier and make not only the best Marvel movie so far but the best movie in its genre so far. The movie is not only an epic proportioned spectacle but also a very well thought conclusion to what previous movies have been leading up to. From a technical standpoint the movie is, just like The Winter Soldier a delight. Practical effects, very good implementation of CGI, beautiful camera work and choreography, sound and a solid script. The Russo brothers take action to another step with amazingly cut action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. I need to mention that Captain America Civil War has one of the best action scenes I have seen, ever. The movie not only offers great action but also very good character development, strong performances from each member of the cast and more than enough screen time for everyone. The newcomers, Black Panther and Spiderman are as expected among the highlights of this spectacular flick. The movie has its issues, while it is up for debate the villain played by Daniel Bruhl is most definitely the biggest low in this movie along with some specific scenes where the editing can get a little confusing and tiresome making it hard to keep track on what is happening on screen. With all these said the movie is absolutely excellent and a whole new level for comic book movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thanks Russo Bros for making movies great again!!!!,"Aside from the fact that its a movie based on Superheroes, It really is a great movie! Unlike a lot of these kinds of films, there is an actual plot. The characters here feel real. They are complex and deep.You actually get emotionally pulled into the story and care about what happens instead of staring at your watch every 5 minutes. I loved all of the actors in this movie. Chris Evans as Captain America was good as always. Tony Stark aka Ironman is my favorite but Black Panther was everything! The guy is a total BADASS!!!I loved all of the superheroes in this movie.A lot of other Hollywood hacks could learn a thing or two from the Russo Brothers on how to make real movies. For me one of the best movies of 2016. Just saw it today and will be going back tomorrow with a friend! I cant wait!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overall Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero film and arguably one of the best ever (For me it's no challenge) the best MCU movie yet with amazing characters,"Hey guys it's STARK here with my early screening review of Captain America: Civil War!Expectations: Going into the early CA: CW screening I was pretty hyped. My expectations were high and maybe the highest I've ever had for a marvel movie. The film did not disappoint.Review: The Russo brothers directing was next to perfect for this film. I can honestly say there were no real or huge flaws from their directing. The fight scenes sometimes got a bit unrealistic from some characters but we're still so good. The fight scenes did not involve very much CGI at all and had a beautiful pace that was quick. The fighting was clear and did not make you confused or dizzy either. At the same time though they did a great job of getting in touch with the emotional side of the film and were able to put the film on the same scale as both Avenger films. The directing was amazing and Infinity War is in great hands.The screenplay for the film was also amazing. The majority of the script was suited the plot really well and did a great job with all the MCU characters especially with the first besides a few corny lines. There were lot's of great lines in the film involving comedy and drama. The way the plot was together was great and one of my favourite MCU ones. Once again Infinity War is in amazing hands.The films soundtrack was engaging and very good. Even though I couldn't distinctly remember it bar from bar It was still interesting and gave the story more life.Finally the characters. Chris Evans brings his best Captain America performance yet and really dives into the characters ambition this time and does a great job of showing both the characters good and bad side. The character of Cap in this film really makes you question the nature of him and if he's really the good guy we all know and love. Robert Downey. Jr brings another good performance of Iron but I thought even thought it wasn't bad it wasn't his usual best. The Iron Man character was great in this film and stayed the same at his core throughout the film so it was still the Iron Man we still knew and loved. Mostly. But I'll leave it at that. Elizabeth Olsen does a much better job as Scarlet Witch in this film with a more familiar style of acting for herself that wasn't as forced and much more natural. (More less thick accent). The character of Wanda I thought was much better and had developed a lot more. She was less of an annoying character and brought a lot more interest to the table. Sebastian Stan's acting as Bucky was great because he was able to play the character with humanity and the monster/drone very well. Bucky's character had change a lot since Captain America: Winter Soldier but there really isn't much I can say without revealing anything. Frank Grillo did not get much screen time in the film but the time he did the character was better than the acting even though his acting was not very bad. The character was portrayed as a terrorist and was one of the films darkest characters and also brought a dark sense to the film. Daniel Bruhl did a great job as Baron Zemo. His acting was great and very interesting to watch. The character himself even though he was a bit of a clich√© was perfect for the film and rest assure, did not take away attention from the actual Civil War part of the story. His character was controversial and maybe one of my favourite Marvel villains yet. Chadwick Boseman. Black Panther. Boseman becomes the perfect casting for Black Panther portraying absolutely comic accurate but also being appealing to the audience. His acting never seemed off for a moment and never seemed corny. He made you believe and trust the characters motivations. The character of Black Panther was also very comic accurate and cool. His fighting style was entertaining and awesome. He was Marvels Batman and brought a new refreshing character to the MCU. They aced Black Panther in all ways. Now finally... SPIDER-MAN! Tom Hollands performance was not always great as Spider-Man but as an early actor it's okay and still wasn't bad and was very fun to watch. As he grows older I think his acting will continue to get better. The character of Spider-Man himself was better than all other Spider-Men and was next to perfect. He looked awesome, provided great comic relief that actually gave me a good laugh, great action and awesome character interactions/development. He was the most comic accurate spider yet and one of the most comic accurate comic characters seen on screen yet. Besides one or two cheesy lines (That went with the character in a way) Spider-Man could not have been better. Returning characters like War Machine, Ant- Man, Falcon, War Machine, Black Widow, Vision etc did not change too much. Though Ant-Man in a film with Avengers was a delight to see and he fit pretty well with it.Overall Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero film and arguably one of the best ever (For me it's no challenge) the best MCU movie yet with amazing characters and an amazing story with no real flaws. Infinity War will be amazing.

"""The Opening to Marvel: Phase Three is a simple: Oh, by God!""","""There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe""This ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen ""Civil War"" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.A few years ago, approximately, five or six years, Marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns. That project would receive the name of ""Avengers"". The biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist, may break the story, be boring and completely commercial. Two years later, on May 4, 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" landed in all movie theaters, solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office. Today, Mayo 2016, ""Civil War"" increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains. Will this be the film event of the year? I don't know, I can only assure, Marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection (Avengers: Infinity War Part:1 or 2).Based on the Comic of 2006-2007, movie serves as a sequel to ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". After all the fighting and disaster in ""Ultron"", the Avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015, the death of innocents (something very, very similar to what we saw in ""BvS"", with Superman, and then say that they are polar opposites) and the dilemma, Does our help really help?Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from The Incredible Hulk) immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes. After showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions, it opens way for the culprit of this civil war. Sokovia Accords established by the United Nations. That treaty, aims to put each of the actions and missions of the Avengers in the hands of the United Nations for so, take care of each human life, taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not. As expected, not everyone agrees. They needed something for fight, here is their reason. After discussions, different thoughts, ideologies and equations, the decisions are made. 36 hours, two teams, a objective, an end, and Russo Brothers, Civil War has begun!I affirm with all security and respect that ""Civil War"" has the best sequences of action of Marvel films so far, with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training. A true example, and personally one of the best parts of the movie, the fight at Berlin airport. The presentation of both sides, literally, made me cry, its class, its style, its elegance and its professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities (physical and emotional) of the old and new heroes, to create a scene of entertainment, quality and long, long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to ""Marvel"" for continue, (Curious fact: Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (""John Wick"") are part of the second unit of the film).""Spider-Man is the equivalent to Wonder Woman in Civil War""Special relevance has the presentation of Spider-man and Black Panther. Their inclusion is appropriate, the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic, who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the Peter Parker story.Another hero who had appointment was a Black Panther, an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain, perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance. In addition, other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as ""Ant-Man"", associating the world of past facts (seen in the films) with the present, something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the Marvel Universe. While many characters used this as a springboard for their own films (Spider Man - Black Panther), all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men, it is something that goes beyond policies, laws, treaties or rules, this is personal. Russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight, they there will be no more effects, flying planes, cobwebs, or CGI, for that moment, they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story, Tony, Steve and Bucky.And then, arrive the final fight, ""Iron Man"" vs. ""Captain America"" a dispute of friends. The fact that Bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic, this is not a trick more to win more money, it is the destiny. Personally, I felt like the final fight between Batman and Superman, that anger but at the same time love, that hate but at the same time forgiveness , it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism. ""CW"" had all the unimaginable, and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of Stan Lee.Phase three has begun. If Marvel offers us more equal or better products that this, will sound crazy but, they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to ""Star Wars"" . Goodbye to the clich√© about Marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sh_t, quality exists. ""Civil War"" gives us a true contrast of ""BvS"", but is just as tasty, fruitful and exciting. ""CW"" is the best film of ""Marvel"" so far. It plants strong and resistant foundations to the future to come, leaving a hard and impossible work for Warner Bros. with ""Suicide Squad"" and Fox and Marvel (again) with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" in May and ""Doctor Strange"" in November.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain America: Civil War,"Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.As the third Captain America entry jump-starts the summer movie season, and so called Phase 3 of the MCU, its box-office muscle is beyond question. When the Avengers first assembled four years ago, it felt like a grand culmination, THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. Since then, the studio's ever expanding Cinematic Universe has delivered sequels or varying quality and introduced new heroes in stand-alone movies, but it has never quite matched the ensemble-balancing finesse and Earth- quaking action scale of Joss Whedon's initial assembling. Not until now. This is not some hastily assembled battle to sell more movie tickets; these two have been quarreling over the course of two Avengers movies - one of their first conversation includes Captain America telling Stark ""Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds"". It's all been building to this; with hashtag-powered marketing campaign, prompting True Believers to pick a side.This film is build around a bigger conflict that, despite the title, does place it as a direct sequel to Age of Ultron. While Bucky and Cap friendship being the core of the film, makes it Captain America Three rather than Avengers Two and a Half. Captain America: Civil War might be the best Marvel Studios move yet. There, I said it. It does what the best Marvel films do: juggling between characters so each is allowed to shine in a story that pushes forward the series continuity and while also forming and concluding its own plot.Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one film. And that is what you call THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. What could serve as the detriment to some hero-stuffed movies, actually works to the advantage of Civil War. Part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters, the majority of which we've come to know over the course of thirteen Marvel Studios movies, interact and play off each other. However, it all comes to these two characters, ultimately Captain America v Iron Man and their own beliefs, personalities, neuroses and paranoia coming out to play. For both of them, the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good.Steve defense of Bucky is questionable: he may be his childhood friend, but now he's a lethal, robot-armed killing machine forever in danger of being reactivated. Sebastian Stan remains, for the most part, as blank and frosty as he was in Winter Soldier. Chris Evans meanwhile, further hones a role he has effortlessly owned for five movies now; pushing Rogers to impressive new depths and reminding us that his straight arrow still has a dangerous edge. He's perfect. The stoic heart and soul of the MCU. There's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded as fugitive to follow him into battle (I VOLUNTEER!). And as perfect is Robert Downey Jr., who shows a completely different side of Tony Stark. He's more the elder statesman here than the witty merchant; reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. The brilliance of Downey Jr. sympathetic performance is that even if (like me) you are resolutely #TeamCap you can still (obviously) feel for him.As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners wherever he's on screen, Vision stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is ""HUGE"" fun in relatively brief appearance. Moreover, Black Panther gets a lot of shine too. Going in I didn't know much about the character, so this bing my strong introduction to the character, I really liked him. He works for this story and situations in many ways ( I can't reveal in a spoiler free review). Now let's get into what everyone seem to be waiting for - except me, because I've never really been a huge fan - 19-year-old Tom Holland's Spider-Man. he might be the best Spidey so far. His Peter Parker is great: nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight, in which he's truly spectacular, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways; while his wit couldn't be better. I have to admit that I'm in love and I can't wait to see more of Holland's Spider- Man. And no Loki or Ultron equivalent this time. Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.Civil War is rises above the series' greatest weaknesses. In a movie that has an almost literal army of superheroes, it's remarkable that a film this big can still feel intimate. Reflecting the material's comic book roots, the Russos keep the film's action heavy. ""It always ends in a fight"", says > You could read more on my blog",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really Good Film I Enjoyed It (No Spoilers),"being a marvel fan for me this is one the best marvel movies it has fantastic character arcs, great action and really good acting. and my god SPIDER-MAN!!!!!. just seeing peter parker interacting with the other avengers made my day and also he does awesome stuff with his web shooters. i think to say tom Holland is the best spider-man is to soon but i think he will be after we see is standalone film next year. and also Chadwick Bozeman nails it as black panther he has a personal goal in this film and you fully understand his motivation and his action is the best in the film. the performances from Downey and Evans were great and it was such a emotional film because you've seen these characters grow and you have history with them. Anthony Mackie stays awesome as falcon and has a couple standout moments. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/winter solider is fantastic a great and strong performance from him. and i also want to point out that Elizabeth Olsen was much improved as scarlet witch i thought she was a bit underdeveloped in age of Ultron but she had a fantastic arc in this film. the airport battle is phenomenal one of the best superhero action set pieces seriously it's crazy i couldn't believe what is was watching. there is only one thing that was bad about it which has become very familiar in marvel movies the villains. once again marvel makes a another generic and disposable villain in Baron Zemo its a shame because Daniel Bruhl is a really good actor. but i look at it that he wasn't really a villain this film didn't need a villain it was a family dispute between the avengers. but other than that overall it was a very good and entertaining movie which makes sure the marvel train keeps on rolling 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: Civil War was AMAZING!,"NO SPOILERS HERE...I watched the film on the 29th of April, Sadly only in 2D ;( so I cannot comment on 3D and what it looked like and if it's worth seeing in 3D.But...What I can comment on is how AWESOME this film actually was; by writing this review and breaking it down into small, tasty, bite-size chunks for you.The StoryMarvel films have hit a wall recently when it comes to story lines they just haven't been as 'well-done' as other Marvel films like Iron-Man and Avengers Assemble. Green Lantern was a letdown even though the amazing Ryan Reynolds was Green Lantern, also Deadpool could have been so much better all the elements of an amazing film were there: amazing actors, great fight scenes, there just could have been more to the film, the story was so simplistic. But Captain America: Civil War's storyline was so perfect it brought in all the elements of a great film in and they bounced of this amazing storyline that tore people between Cap and Iron- Man. It's so difficult to pick a side, and that's what makes it so great you are constantly changing from one team to the other and when they fight each other you're so torn between the two teams you can't decide and then you just don't want anyone to die are be seriously harmed and if any of them do it's a huge shock. The story easily gets a 9/10.The ActingThe acting was amazing, the emotions run high in the film and the actors killed it, the emotional scenes hit you right in the feels. Shut out to Robert Downey JR who was amazing in the film. But we all know who we really wanted to see... SPIDER-MAN and BLACK PANTHER. Tom Holland for me is the best Spider-Man so far, he is a real Spider-Man I love how Marvel have decided to actually use a teenager to play a high school kid and not a 20 year old actor to play a high school kid, Spider-Man stole the lime light in the film with his humour, fighting abilities and that fine new suit! Black Panther didn't have many lines, but when does Black Panther need to talk as soon as you see him you know it's about to go down, and that vibranium suit was just Purrfect. The acting was a solid 9/10.The Action ScenesWOW... just... WOW they were visually stunning and so well done in all aspects, the main fighting scene in the airport lasted nearly 20 minutes of pure actions, every character was shown and used to full effect, Spider-Man kicked ass left, right and on the ceiling. Ant-Man was actually useful and was so well used. Scarlet Witch was ridicules in the fight scene she was a titan she protected everyone and was like a brick wall full of cars she controlled with her mind. You would think nothing could top off that fight scene in the airport, you would be wrong... very wrong... but no spoilers :D. The action scenes smashed a 10/10 perfect score.The ConclusionThe film destroys a 9/10 more a 9.9/10 the film was stunning in every way. I would recommend going to see this film as soon as you can and then go and see it again. The film took three different film series The Avengers, Iron-Man and Captain America and combined them and just... well played Marvel... well play, you have made the best superhero film so far by a solid 400 miles. I really hope upcoming Marvel titles like Doctor Strange, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok and the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War films with most of the characters from Captain America: Civil War going to be in the film, will hopefully be as amazing as Captain America: Civil War is.GO...AND...SEE...THIS...FILM!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than expected,"I have to admit that my expectations weren't very high on this movie. Although the interesting trailer, I always thought it will be the same like with the Age of Ultron, few good moments in kind of boring movie. I have never been so wrong in my life.In my opinion, this movie has good action moments, with the pinch of humor in right moments (I'll never forget car scene with Cap, Bucky and Falcon). And, once again, Marvel hit the spot with the choice of actors. Chadwick, Tom and Daniel rightfully took place side to side with the rest of the excellent standard crew. Also, Paul Rudd as Ant Man fitted like a puzzle in Team Cap.Not to lie, there were some moments which were a little bit too long and made you think ¬ÑOh, come on already"". Exactly for this reason I gave 9/10, because I couldn't wait the second after credits because I had to go to the bathroom. But, overall impression is positive and I would watch it again soon. Team Cap FTW!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You just gotta love Marvel.,"I don't know why but everything Marvel puts it's hands on succeeds somehow. 'Captain America: Civil War' is the third ""Captain America"" stand-alone movie and the first of Marvel's Phase 3. I've never been a comic-reader nor am I a big Marvel-geek, but the MCU has in the meantime become a part of my annual movie visit's. And I'm not yet tired of them, especially not after Marvel's supposedly best adaptation to date.With 'Civil War', Marvel reaches new depths and significance. Apart from the typical Marvel humor we are offered a side that proves high demands as well as some seriousness as we have seen in 'Winter Soldier'. The Russo Brothers here, too, prove their skills and show us a new, more grown up side of the MCU. First and foremost ascribable to the grounded story, that does not only put the Avengers to test but will also get every Marvel enthusiast into a conflict. The discord between our otherwise well attuned superheroes is the core of the story and the reason for the imminent ""war"". But we aren't pushed in an alleged right direction. Both sides are justified in their individual views and comprehensible in their motivations. The conflict, which is the incentive of the entire movie is inarguably clearly to be felt and appears most of all plausible. Every fan that chose a side will find himself questioning his decision, if he allows himself to.¬† But not only do the motivation of the torn Avengers seem reasonable but also those of the antagonist Zeemo, though they are maybe held a little too simple. Besides all the old characters, 'Civil War' also introduces two new characters: Black Panther and Spiderman, who finally returned to the MCU, last year. I can't even put into words how incredibly awesome both are portrayed and how much I'm looking forward to seeing both their stand-alone movies. I don't even want to say much more about them. You simply have to see and enjoy them on the big screen yourselves. All the characters appearing in this movie fit into the storyline and are in no way incoherently presented to us. Not for one minute does the movie feel crowded or simply disorganized. Even though not all of the characters have the same amount of screen time, everyone has their shining moment and reason to be in the movie. The interactions throughout the movie are especially great to watch. Partly pretty hilarious and entertaining but also severe and emotionally touching. In general this movie has throughout alongside the unique humor much more grown up and serious parts. Not only palpable through the stunningly written script, but also to be seen in the nerve-racking fight sequence of the last act, that will thrill but also shock everyone watching. The tension that is build up in those few minutes is incredible. Needless to say, that the action scenes are well choreographed and beautifully filmed just like they were in it's predecessor. 'Civil War' probably delivers one of the best on screen action in the history of Marvel.Conclusion: 'Civil War is Marvel's most mature movie and in addition has a big emotional impact, that I haven't seen in any Marvel movie before. In combination with the for Marvel typical humor the movie seems to be well balanced and atmospherically harmonious. 'Civil War' is without doubt Marvel's most grown up movie to date. Whether it is the best, that's up to you to decide. It's definitely far up on my list, because just thinking or writing about it makes me want to go back to the movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: Civil War,"With the excess of superhero movies coming out these days, I wish they were all as complex and thought provoking as this one. When I say this is the best superhero movies since ""The Dark Knight"" I mean that, and it's undoubtedly the best of the Marvel movies. This is because of genuinely interesting, believable, and flawed characters that all have understandable motives. Now if you're like me and, during climactic superhero scenes like the one in the avengers, always wonder ""What about the people in those buildings the 'heroes' are smashing up? Aren't they killing thousands of people right now?"", then you will love this movie from the get go. Because in this film, the heroes begin to start facing the consequences of the actions, and start to feel genuine guilt for what they've done, besides Captain America, who seems to believe that he needed to sacrifice these people for the greater good of others. Seriously, while in almost all superhero movies there is a clear good guy and bad guy, in this one I genuinely couldn't decide who was good or bad. Even the man who at first seems like the stereotypical bad guy is revealed to have much more behind him. He will make you realize that that some of our so called ""heroes"" aren't much better than what seems at first to be a stereotypical villain. The morality is grayer than most action movies of the past 20 years.Its not only got great writing, but its got the great action we've seen in the last Captain America film, but cranked up to 11. There are many great action scenes in this film, but the ones that stick out the most are the car chase scene, and of course, the big fight between Captain America and his gang, and Iron Man and his gang. The latter is a fantastic scene, all of the superheros using there specific powers against each other, while occasionally another would chime in to help someone else out in a fight, and so on and so on. But it's handled with such grace that it never becomes excessive or confusing. All of the camera movements and cuts make it easy to understand what is happening while also handling all this action and all of these superheros at once, going from one battle to the next, and yet they still find time to put genuinely hilarious moments in all of this. It's incredibly impressive, and these great action scenes are already on top of the great writing. Possibly the only part of the film that I felt was unnecessary was the romance between Steve Rogers and Kate, and that is a minor complaint considering how little that portion of the movie is.It's an ensemble character driven film like ""Boogie Nights"", mixed with the usual humor of a marvel movie with action from ""The Bourne Supremacy"" but with superheros, but also with the moral complexity of ""The Dark Knight"" (although just not really as good as ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Boogie Nights""). And if that's not a recommendation, then I don't know what is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Massive entertiner,"Captain America: Civil War is an abundantly-entertaining piece of blockbuster entertainment which gives lie to the notion that an adventure film with lots going on must devolve into chaos. Following the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the world has become understandably concerned about gangs of super people destroying bits of the planet every so often. When Bucky Barnes (Stan) is finally brought out of hiding, he becomes the catalyst to allow Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) to bring the world's super people under control, starting with Steve Roger's (Evans) Avengers.Ostensibly an excuse just to get loads of super people to wail on each other for our amusement, Civil War takes the opportunity it has to delve into the people who make up its world while also at least considering the real-world problems actual superheroes (and by intimation, real-world superpowers) would pose if they did whatever they wanted. And it really makes with the super people wailing on each other.A big part of Civil War's strength is its insistence on avoiding the trap of cameos even when many of its characters only show up for two or three scenes. Instead it gives everyone something to do ‚Äì from Vision (Bettany) and Scarlet Witch's (Olsen) slow bonding to Spider- Man's (Holland) introduction and brush with the big leagues to Black Panther's (Boseman) dogged mission of vengeance ‚Äì and something to feel (so that we feel it, too), creating a joyful smorgasbord of superhero action that is the most Marvel thing Marvel has ever made.The list of such character-based touches is almost endless and fantastic ‚Äì Falcon and Bucky's forced partnership, Tony Stark flirting with Aunt May to Peter Parker's extreme horror, Vision trying to figure out how cooking works ‚Äì with new elements melding seamlessly into the new. Spider-Man and Black Panther are organically accepted into the whole, particularly Panther who is well connected to the main plot, as the various characters work not only within themselves but as part of the whole.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Entertaining as always, but nothing game-changing.","Good movie, but nothing that you haven't seen before (still entertaining and keeps you engaged though).Marvel has followed a simple plot line lately: Just make the biggest opponent the Avengers face...themselves. Genius. Wow.Look, I get that it works, but this movie didn't bring anything new to the table. Yet again, we have someone pulling the strings and pitting these guys against each other, like Loki and Ultron before them but with a different reasoning. Sure there is more explanation behind it, more characters, clear sides...but apart from all that, it was simply just entertaining. And that's what Marvel does well even if it's just recycled and presented differently.I love Captain America, he did pretty much lead the role (obviously because it is his movie technically) but this movie pretty much was building on other smaller characters like Widow, Antman, Vision, and Panther while introducing Spidey to balance out the ""serious dark tone"" the film tried to capture.Sure it sets up future films, but why praise this movie for doing the exact same thing BvS did at a smaller scale two months ago (but apparently was TOO MUCH)? Everything some people hated about BvS was even worse in this one...but we are giving Marvel a pass just because it's not DC? Come on.Marvel did do a good job, don't get me wrong...but they didn't take any risks or freedoms with this film. It had a very predictable plot and subplot that most people will eat up because they are unfamiliar with Marvel comics (unlike DC, where everyone knows who's who before the franchise was even thought of).Sure this movie does a good job as a continuation of the Marvel Universe, but it wasn't really something that builds Captain America role (like Winter Solider did) but, again, was really just building the smaller characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why are they fighting? Are they trying to kill each other or not??!!??,"Wow, such an epic movie, only not.What the heck are they trying to do with the airport scene? Are they seriously trying to kill each other or what? In many places it seemed like these 'friends' are trying to crush or blast the other 'team' with no mercy. Then one of the more generic ones gets injured and oh no, it's such a crying shame. What did you EXPECT you idiot superheroes?? Wasn't that what you were trying to do? This is every bit as nonsensical as Batman v Superman but got critical acclaim piled on it because it's Marvel.The characters honestly act so infantile it's infuriating. Their fighting could have been avoided if an actual adult like Nick Fury was there to deal out corner time.Shaky cam during the mediocre action scenes because the Russo bros are actually hacks, but shhhh, don't tell anyone. And if you look it up you'll see that the so-acclaimed airport fight was shot by second-unit directors. (Again, Russo bros are hacks.)This was the first Marvel movie where RDJ looked tired and bored to be there. As he would in every one afterwards.I did not appreciate the ripping off of the Manchurian Candidate and then name-dropping it, as if that makes the ripping off okay.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprised Stupid Script Was Approved By All!,"Can't understand why Hollywood writers, producers, directors and especially the Actors would agree to conceive a blockbuster major movie purely based on internal differences with political bullshit dividing the Avenger's to practically kill each other! Yea great idea, lets make a movie! Where suddenly Radical Evil risings of powerful villains killing and destroying thousands is blamed on The Avengers who battle to stop them? I only watched this movie to see the characters and some action but really felt like I was watching many boyhood Icon's & Heroes being taken down a notch because some movie moguls decided pitting The Avenger's against each other just for a thoughtless mindless excuse for a movie when nothing else was considered!

"Good Robert Downey, Cartoonish Action and Logic, Dumb Finale","*Spoilers ahead*The Good: 1. Robert Downey steals every scene he's in. 2. Vision is interesting. 3. The recruitment of Spiderman was funny and the highlight of the movie.The Bad: 1. Too many characters with no character development, motive, or dialogue. Probably used to sell more toys.2. A civil war where nobody dies, nobody dislikes each other, everybody going through the motions. Felt like watching a cartoon from the Disney Channel.3. Nonsensical fight scenes. For example in his fight with Captain America, Iron Man doesn't use his capability to fly nor does he shoot straight. If logic was too be followed, Iron Man's suit would overwhelm Captain America's shield. And didn't he have a whole army of Iron Men to help him. What happened?4. Government is just too dumb and clueless. They can't even hold prisoners in a fortress in the middle of the ocean. Pleeaaase!5. Big ending let down. The whole point of this elaborate (and probably expensive scheme) was to show a video. Why not just send Iron Man a Youtube link? Dumb!!Summary: Story is better than Avengers Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3 (which is a low bar). However action sequences are more cartoonish than the first Avengers and a recent superhero movie. Don't believe the critic ratings which make this appear as a better film than the Godfather. Its not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America review,"Captain American is a Marvel action hero movie that explores The Avenger's role in relation to the rest of mankind. It begs the question at which point do super heroes overstep their limits and disregard their actions' impact on the rest of humanity. In an age where superheroes have an unlimited amount of power, The UN tries their best to bring back the balance of power by establishing a treaty that puts the superheroes under the authority of the UN. Robert along with a host of characters try to protect this treaty by fighting against Captain America. Subsequently, the Avengers have a ""Civil war"" in which they destroy each other, with each feeling as though they are doing the logical and ethical thing. Ethical decisions come into play as captain America risk his own life to rescue his friend, and Robert Downey Jr. later risk his standing with the government by trying to help Captain America. The movie begs the question ""Are superheroes exempt from responsibility?""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvels just cant disappoint you with a Superhero flick.,"'CAPTAIN America : CIVIL WAR' REVIEW :- We all loved Marvel's previous Superhero flicks, this is another addition to that list. Makers tried to add more fun this time and they have succeeded in it. Obviously if they are making sequel that means audience deserve more fun than the previous one, this must be the thinking of Makers when they decided to make this movie. Marvel has a separate movie for each superhero then they made Avengers to bring all superheroes together and Civil War follows same idea. Too many superheroes, 2 teams and their face off. Wow sounds great no? Movie starts with kick ass action sequence. Keeps you hooked for first 30 minutes then some necessary scenes to set a plot which gives you loo break. Then after Interval movie is bit of slow but then last 40 minutes are brilliant. Spidey's entry and his presence made it more entertaining. End is quite Emotional (not actually) and bit disappointing or exciting, depends on your choice how you take it. Film wins your heart by its special effects and those scenes are eye pleasing in 3D. Screenplay could have been better but it is not bad either, usually this kind of films are not made to entertain you for complete 150 minutes and you know it. Runtime looks 10 stretched. Story is good and bit a confusing but it ends on satisfying note. Acting is perfectly showcased by all leading stars. Sound work is good too, especially in action sequences. Cinematography is something to clap for. As a whole Film entertains you, doesn't make you feel bore and won't let you think that you wasted money on it. Go for it, enjoy this another Money making entertainer by Marvels. 7/10 stars by me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best superhero films ever!,"Awesome film! The plot is well- derived from the original comic, and each scenes all stick to one another, making the story line ran through smoothly. The depiction of each character is remarkable. You can really understand why they chose their side, with solid reasons, so that everything makes sense. The interaction between each character was a highlight as well, with occasionally funny moments, bringing this film to a next level. The soundtrack was amazing! The music really add on emotions on each sense, whether it was intense, troubled, or depress. The only part wasn't that satisfying was the part of Zemo. He didn't feel like a character full of personality, which he should be. He seems to be there only because they need someone to be at there spot, not for a strong reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One of the best films of this summer, a real delight.","Following upon from the success of Captain America: Winter Soldier is a sequel, once again directed by the Russo brothers, adapting Mark Millar's famous Civil War series to the big screen. The thirteenth feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, backed by Disney, will this turn out to be the unlucky entry in the highly successful franchise?Following on from the events of Age of Ultron, after another incident involving the Avengers ends in some high profile collateral damage, the UN demand a form of accountability in the form of the 'Sokovia Accords'. This would mean the Avengers would only be allowed to intercede in international matters when called upon by a supervising committee. The Avengers are left split by this with one side agreeing with Captain America, siding against the accords, and one group siding with Iron Man, who wishes to follow the demands of the U.N. The issue is complicated further when the signing of the bill is seemingly bombed by The Winter Soldier, Captain America's brainwashed best friend, resulting in numerous deaths, including the killing of T'Chaka the King of Wakanda.Much like Batman vs Superman there is a lot of plot to weave through in Civil War, however unlike BvS this film balances its characters with much more success. By no means does everything flow perfectly, but the ideological clash of the characters is kept clear and concise, assisted by us having gotten to know these characters in previous features. Evans and Downey Jnr continue their fine work as the clashing pair, the figureheads of the Marvel Universe, and this feud has been brewing throughout the Avengers series. Recalling so many characters from the MCU could threaten to destabilise the movie, but as we have met so many of the characters before their importance in the story is flexible, with invested characters taking the foreground. For example Ant-Man appears in the film, in little more than an extended cameo, he has little grasp of the larger situation but his fleeting appearance is highly entertaining. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is one of the new additions to the gigantic ensemble and although Boseman does have a charismatic presence there is so much going on in Civil War that we never really get to connect with him. Although it must be admitted that getting to see more of the character in his own feature, under the direction of Ryan Coogler, is an intriguing prospect. The much hyped appearance of Spiderman within the MCU has been one of the most talked about aspects of Civil War and it is a pleasure to report that Tom Holland did a fantastic job as everyone's favourite wall crawler, capturing the youthful enthusiasm that makes the character so popular. Credit goes not just to the actor, but also to the writers/directors for funnelling fresh creative life into a character going through his third incarnation in only fourteen years. Having referenced the writing it would be ill of me not to discuss the work of Christopher Markus & Stephen Mcfeely (Yes that is his real name, and it's awesome) on their fourth Marvel project. They have written the screenplays for the entire Captain America trilogy, and their ability to translate a character many would have dismissed as ill-fitting for a modern audience, due to the perception of him being dated, has turned Captain America, alongside Iron Man, into the flagship character of the MCU. Marvel have long been accused of under developing their villains, their film's tend to focus on the protagonists by design, and Daniel Bruhl's performance is a brief one as Helmut Zemo. However I will say I was impressed by what I did see of the character, and his motivations complement the film's themes in the larger context. With a cast so large I will give small mentions of praise to the continued impressive displays of Elisabeth Olson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Emily VanCamp. Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier is more of a plot piece than a character and I hope to see him explored beyond simply being a brainwashed weapon in the future so we can see more range, especially if, as expected, he becomes a larger part of the MCU in the future. With a range of action scenes I was impressed by the Russo Brothers use of variety, the earlier fight scenes being very organic, using a hand-held camera to amplify the 'street level' of the conflict. Later when the two superhero sides showdown the style changes to a much more fixed fluid motion to allow us to enjoy the wide open spectacle of what amounts to an MCU Royal Rumble. Henry Jackman, one of my favourite composers, once again delivers a stirring powerful score and it's no surprise he was called back on board following his fine work on The Winter Soldier.With such a massively packed movie I have had to disavow my typical word count just to get close to covering most of the parts of Civil War I wished to discuss. Containing such a monumental amount of content and balancing the narrative, character motivations and plot of the film as well as the Russo's have is a great accomplishment. That the film is therefore unable to completely satisfy all components that hold it together is a small criticism for such a well-made feature but one that needs to be recognised. There is another nagging issue that I cannot elaborate on as it would take us into spoiler region, something I am unwilling to do so soon from release. Suffice it to say it revolves around another common complaint levied at Marvel films in the past that with each passing feature becomes a slightly more aggrandising concern. For now though Civil War is a feast of what fans of the genre will love best, definitely worth seeing, whichever side you're on.Review by Alexander Halsall.

Best Pound-for-Pound Superhero vs Superhero fight scenes,"No spoilers here.I thought this was so much better than Batman vs Superman. The storyline was clean-cut, and it was weaved well to introduce the new superhero characters that were not part of the Avengers. Captain America and Iron Man did a great job as being on opposite teams and also in recruiting more members into the Avenger universe. The fight scenes were well executed and I like how the stuns work between all the superhero interaction.Now, like any other Marvel movie, there's always a scene after the screen credits roll, so watch for that as always.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing superhero flick,"Captain America:Civil War is an excellent superhero flick,with a nice story and awesome action sequences with a powerful editing.Story:With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a heroes actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all- out war between Team Iron Man and Team Captain America while a new villain emerges.The movie has several entertaining moments and not a single dull moment,which keeps you intrigued throughout the entire movie.The direction is excellent.The screenplay is water-tight.The editing is powerful.The action sequences was just awesome.Performances:Though the movie relies heavily on the shoulders of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.,but th the scene-stealer here is Tom Holland,whose portrayal as Peter Parker gives a new yet entertaining image to Spiderman.He is truly wonderful.Chris Evans is excellent,while Robert Downey Jr. is efficient.

Great acting and visuals with a pretty well developed narrative,"The movie dives right into action which sets the drive of the entire film. It is action packed and there is never a dull moment. As well, the movie is a cohesive whole and is very well made. Usually with these many characters and A-list actors, there is unequal screen time between each, and the narrative of each character is separate from each other. An example would be to compare this to Batman v Superman. Even with just two characters the narratives could not interweave, and were very distinct from the other.In Captain America: Civil War, even though the overall narrative mainly focuses on the dispute between Iron Man and Captain America, the rest of the cast isn't left out. Everyone gets screen time and though some inevitably get more than others, it isn't noticed much in the context of the film. So much like how the narrative is about team segregation, the film itself did very well in creating a cohesive, well-rounded portrayal of all characters.This is also probably because most of the actors and actresses are reprising their roles and know their characters inside out. Thus, the acting and chemistry between them aided in creating this cohesive unit of the film. Everyone played their parts well and I was completely absorbed into the world of the movie.The action scenes and visual effects are great once again. Marvel films have established that they know how to create visually stunning action effects. The action too shows some impressive fighting scenes. Both Black Widow and Sharon Carter display kick-ass moves.Overall, this film is greatly entertaining and the narrative well established. The appearance of Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a bit sudden and random, but in the overall context is a good addition and necessary to the plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but not as good as some are saying.","This movie was really more of the same. That isn't a bad thing, but it is starting to wear thin.What I didn't like:As a comic book lover, it was a serious miss-interpretation of the Civil War text. It had very little to do with the comic book tale.It was more of an Iron Man movie than a Captain America movie. It revolved around Iron Man having a horrible day, and Cap being a bystander in his own movie.What I liked:I liked the fact that in this movie we see more character development of Ant-Man and Hawkeye two characters that are not very well represented in the MCU yet.Black Panther was spot on from the character that I knew from the comic books of old.I appreciated the tie in to Agent Carter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Cool action that did not make enough sense,"I complained that last year's Avengers movie felt burdened by the many subplots, characters and cliches. This ""super"" story was more focused, even though the whole gang showed up. It was about friendship and consequences. That works.

I love Captain,"There is no absolute right or wrong position on both sides of the civil war.
The United States team is the embodiment of very justice , he believes in truth, goodness and beauty, he believes in the kindness of winter soldiers (in fact, winter soldiers are indeed manipulated by Hydra). Winter soldier is the only person in the world that the United States team has known since before he went to sleep, a spirit that no one can replace. A lot of people say the United States team is selfish, I don't think so. The Black Widow finally helped the United States team and the winter soldiers leave, so many people on the captain's side, not just a large number of people, but said that the captain's justice and salvation were accepted by more people.
And Iron Man, uh, only wanted to catch the winter soldier, and his conceit in the positive film made him not see the truth of the facts.
After reading the third book, it is heartache in two words. Why is the heartache?
The fight between the American team, the winter soldier and the Iron Man, of course: the captain wanted to protect the winter soldier, Tony wanted revenge for killing his parents, and Tony was angry because the captain knew about it and didn't tell himself. It was a good show for a good brother to die.At the end, when Tony was alone and lonely, he received a letter from the captain. The captain's magnetic voice softened my heart.Fight is hit, emotional injury broken, but as long as you need them to need me, we will be with you to fight with you.That's how heartache it is. I like the United States team.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An amazing movie!,"First off, I will say that this movie was brilliantly made. The soundtrack was stunning, and went together perfectly with the movie.There were a few plot holes, and pieces that didn't make sense, and I didn't like or agree with, but I had a wonderful time watching this.I will not spoil any of the movie, but I will say that I think Ant- Man could have been either excluded from the movie, or brought down a little on the humor. He seems to add too much, and this movie is supposed to be somewhat dark and serious. I also think that Spider- Man should have been added into more of the movie, since he was one of the bigger parts of the comic story-line.So I will say this; if you were expecting something extremely close to the comics, and nothing else will make you happy, you will be disappointed. I have read the comics, and those aside, this movie was great.Bucky and Sam have a very good friendship, it seems.(I think there should have been a darker tone with Bucky's recovery, though that might have come from reading too many very angst-filled fan-fictions, ha ha.)This movie's choreography was amazing! I was happy to find out that the same person who did it for CA:TWS was going to do it for this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.Second, I am very glad that the Russo Brothers directed this movie. They did very well with what they had at their disposal. (For one, everyone actually had earpieces!)The Black Panther was one of my favorite characters. He was very respectable, I think, and extremely mature.All-in-all, this movie could have been more, but it was absolutely amazing, and I will definitely watch it again, and again. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Haters Gonna Hate,"DC fan girls are shaking in their boots, so you know it's going to be good. BvS was okay but DC should really just stick to animation. I hold out hope for Ben Affleck's solo batman film I think it will be a winner. Also I think Wonder Woman was well represented and look forward to her solo project. Marvel knows they have a winner here, though. Thats why they lifted the review embargo 3 weeks before the movie comes out and they were right. BvS lifted their review embargo 3 days before release, assuming they too had insight to how their film would be received. Let's be honest with ourselves please DC fans. Everyone who has seen Captain America: Civil War, and reviewed it, has come to the same conclusion. So these DC shills come onto sites like these trying to drive down the review numbers in hopes they can prevent some ticket sales. The thing is, they know it's coming and they cant stop it.

A fun watch,"I liked most parts, especially the plot, the cast, the characters, the visuals and the spectacular action sequences. Indeed, I was blown away by some action scenes. We are dealing with incredible CGI and good fight choreography. And we did not see the best parts in the trailer. I love that. The mood was fitting and the humor toned down a bit (fewer one-liners than in AoU. I loved that the movie seemed to address every single movie in this universe. I cared about the conflict and felt invested. Even though the movie was ridiculously long, it was intense and exciting.But a few things made me cringe. Ant-Man, Black Panther and Spider-Man felt shoe-horned (people are right to say this) into the movie in a shameless way; it was all so superficial. Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Vision were as awful as ever.The actual civil war bit was also a tad disappointing. It felt obvious that none of the heroes were in any real danger, and that none of the combatants were trying to harm each other seriously. Yes, some of them gets hurt - but we can never fully view this as actual damage done with intent. Not until the very end did I feel that someone could easily die from this situation; and even then news of future movie releases had spoiled who will NOT die. The MCU has again spoiled the fun for the viewers by announcing upcoming movies too soon.The conflict between Rogers and Stark was believable. Even though I was hoping for a different outcome to the final conflict, I didn't feel cheated.Like I said, seven out of ten. It is a reasonable grade. I will probably acquire the movie later for a re-watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun Avengers movie,Totally enjoyed the movie. I've been a Captain America fan since the first movie. No one disappoints but Spider- Man. Since when did they hire a 12 year old to play the part?? Otherwise loved black panther and his accent. Scarlet Witch's abilities. Ant man's humor and his talents. Buckee and the brotherly relationship with Captain. Iron Man's quips. Ultrons sense of ethics. Black Widows martial art moves. Captain America's justifications. Nightwing's (?) toys. Hawkeye's cool factor. So it may seem like I'm being harsh on this Spider-Man actor.

Not a 10 but real close so technically a 9.5,"It was truly a great film, it made sense, was accurate and was what you expect from a Marvel Movie. The action was intense. The characters chosen for this film suited the way the film wanted to be done, in despite of all the seriousness of the movie, it had its funny moments to draw back on to kind of release the tension like all Marvel movies before. It provided a good ending to make future films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have a purpose and direction for the future. I guess in ways it could've been slightly better, but to be honest I don't really how exactly it could be improved but you always think in some ways a movie isn't exactly perfect but this was pretty damn close. It fulfilled the promise of what I was expecting and I am looking forward to future films now to continue with this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
He's my friend. So was I.,"With Conflict and Consequences Captain America Civil war continues on from Ultron, a self destructive mess unable to contain itself of a villain who caused enough chaos to lead to the current predicament. What predicament you ask? Needless to say Hail Hydra will be involved again, leaving poor Cap with his work cut out for him and a Winter Soldier in jeopardy. Thaddeus Ross will walk you through it, the US Secretary of State, who informs the Avengers United Nations (UN) is about to pass the Sokovia Accords, which in turn will instate a UN panel to oversee and control the team. This law will either enforce whether the Avengers can act on certain missions, or if they will now acquire UN permissions to do so. This seems like a mini Avengers film more so than a Captain America, final farewell to the trilogy, though that isn't such a bad thing as the Avengers is yet to disappoint. What is interesting about the concept of this script is how it works on the idea of control and friendship. Captain weighs up the options and decides that if the authorities dictate when and where the Avengers fight many more people could lose their lives due to them being unable to act. Iron man sees the death their destructive heroics have caused and believes implements need to be made in order to serve justice in the right manor. Unable to get on the same page the Avengers are no more, split right down the middle.Anthony Russo and Joe Russo both opened their Marvel accounts in directing the Winter Soldier and after that display it isn't surprising they have been trusted to continue that journey. Although I would say I preferred Joe Johnstone's First Avenger, mostly due to the slower pace and romantic interest of Agent Carter set in World War Two, I still find the sequel rather compelling to say the least. Adding colourful character after colourful character, rarely is there a boring moment in Civil War. As Agent Carter passes in her sleep bringing an end to Steves unfortunate love trap, he has somebody to be there for him, his ally Natasha Romanoff. Adding to this already greatly assembled recipe, it will consist of a Black Panther, Spidey senses tingling and Ants Shrinking up and down to the point of honey I blow up the kids. However, at the heart of all this conflict is the longest standing friendship known to man, in the form of Bucky Barnes and Steve Rogers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A properly done versus movie. A great thriller movie. An amazing Marvel movie.,"As a showdown between arguably the 2 leaders in the Avengers, this movie doesn't disappoint (as I thought BvS did). You have many scenes that illustrate both sides of this conflict, the lawful and the rightful. Captain America and Iron Man are not opposite personalities. They just have different definitions of justice and protecting the world. The movie refuses to pick a side: it will push the viewers to pick one purely on emotion.As a solo movie and a sequel of ""Winter Soldier"", this movie continues to have a ""spy"" feeling. It's not an epic showdown a la Avengers, it's more of a personal film focused in both Captain America and Iron Man. There's several twists of that kind. The action doesn't disappoint, however, the villain is forgettable.As a Marvel Movie, this maybe the best one yet. It loosely follows the comics but I think it made the right changes almost every time. It has an incredible number of characters and yet it almost never feels overcrowded (Amazing Spider Man 2, Avengers 2) and it never feels like it has less substance than visual appealing (BvS). Every character is used correctly, and you can almost feel inside a comic book (Also, Spidey was very good)Greaat job, Marvel. And also the Russo brothers. Avengers 3 is in good hands.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fictional fantasy easy to swallow,"I always check a page of previous comments, mainly to verify I'm on the right webpage but also to verify I watched the same movie and possibly to purr at shared opinions. This time I was very surprised at the vehemence of the angry dislike and scorn of most commenters to the latest Marvel offering, because as a non-purist it was basically what I expected: fantastic in the expected sense, not great as expected but I quite enjoyed it, as I'd hoped.There's a rift in the lute betwixt Iron Man and Captain America and a spat develops when the Avengers are told by a mere 117 governments they must be officially registered to be allowed to continue saving the Earth. Iron Man and his motley crew side with the UN, the latter with his team side with Good. For a commercial work of fantasy it works. If all the Avengers had appeared in a scene singing and dancing in top hats and suspenders I would have accepted it in the same way we have to accept scenes like Bucky stopping and mounting a motorbike going by at speed one-handed and riding it away, or America mega-leaping from a building to the edge of another and continue running with no damage. Thumping whilst flying is routine and as for stopping a helicopter in mid-flight with your bare hands, well that kind of thing happens every day! I do have a minor problem with the chances of a traffic camera being nicely on hand in 1991 to record Stark's parents' brutal murders, the videotape surviving, and being suddenly available to the understandably outraged Tony 25 years later - in front of the murderer. But not much. You can appreciate that an appearance by Hulk would've made for a rather one-sided battle, but I admit I'm puzzled why Thor was excluded. The plot and acting is suitably unbelievable, the many action scenes are so superbly cartoon as to make Jason Bourne look a doddering old fool. My only worry is that it can't be long before the MCU, like the books, disappears up its own fiendishly incoherent plot vortex. Expect no ending, for there no ending in this world.This franchise is financed by hard headed business people expecting only a profit but made by creative people who appreciate what they're doing as well. And in the main it'll be watched by people already looking forward to the next satisfactory Marvel time-filler¬Ö probably including the real D. Trump too I expect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A thoroughly entertaining movie from start to finish with exhilarating action sequences and intriguing personal motivations that gives gravitas to the comic book movie genre.,"Digression : I saw this film at Trinoma in Cinema 5. I was excited to be going in early for the trailers but my excitement turned into disappointment when they dedicated the majority of the screen time for trailers to advertisements. Since this film is property of Walt Disney Studios, the trailers that show up are also upcoming projects of Disney. While this is a brilliant marketing strategy for Disney, it is also a cruel one for the other studios especially the indie ones. This will hurt the other studios' box office numbers and potentially ruin the success of indie films. I hope in the near future Disney Studios would give way to the other studios for the betterment of the film industry. But we all know that wont happen anytime soon. On with the review! When the world divides their opinions about the future operations of the world's greatest heroes, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark's political opinions clash causing the divide of the Avengers. Let me start by saying that the action, drama and comedy in this film are well balanced and well executed which crafts a smooth and seamless story line. This is the amazing work that the Russo Brothers are capable of. The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie. With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts. On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked. One nitpick I have for this movie is that when we are transported to a different place or another time line, there are these huge, white texts that pop out of the screen. It didn't ruin the whole movie for me but it was a bit distracting. The action scenes in here are amazing. The way team members capitalize on their abilities by working together and mixing up their offenses is a spectacle to behold. Each battle is intense and the final battle between Captain America and Iron Man will send shivers down your spine and that freeze frame during their final battle will make your jaw drop. Final thoughts : Comic book readers might not appreciate it that much because the film differs itself a little. What comic book readers should understand here is that the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) is riding on the momentum and the world they created. Films are harder to produce and it takes a lot of time and patience to set up character backgrounds. In the end this is the closest adaptation we will get and it was a damn great effort. This was a very entertaining movie with interesting layers and deep character motivations. The audience that i saw it with even clapped because of sheer enjoyment and I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face I give Captain America : Civil War a 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Masterpiece Marvel will be remembered by,"I've seen all of MCUs but I've never considered them films. More of like a series of product/ TV episodes with great production value.I liked the first Iron Man as its a complete film of its own and structurally sets the ultimate MCU formula that pretty much continue to work with all other movies. I also liked Guardians of the Galaxy which I thought really differed itself from what people think Marvel should be. That being said I've always thought Feige was a genius in the fact that he doesn't set out to do ""comic book"" movies but rather playing with different genres within the same universe.Yet Captain America: Civil War is a totally different animal. It's the ultimate Marvel movie that geeks like myself dream of in their head ever since they announced plan to do shared universe back in 2009.Ensemble movies are hard to pull off strictly from a storytelling perspective. Balancing characters, keeping each motivation simple and understandable, tonally fresh, thematically focused, and with just right amount of pace that keeps the momentum going and in the case of of this one: digging deeper into existing characters AND introducing brand new ICONIC ones without ruining the whole narrative. Civil War actually does all of them but never forgets to keep it fun and action-packed enough in the process.Black Panther is a classic yet niche character in the universe. But they amount of care that went into introducing and forging him into this already crowded ensemble is handled with great care and details. Spiderman is on a mission as well but the Russo brothers spends enough time with him to bring the character, along with his origin and new background almost seamlessly and with great humor into the MCU. All of these make the airport smackdown scene all the more memorable as we can easily root for all of the characters at their most classic selves.Perhaps the most difficult achievement in all of this is that with all the fireworks at play and character motivations, Cap is still at the very core of the story. This is after all, a Captain America movie and they never seize to remind you of that as it starts and end with his arc completed and emotionally satisfying.It just doesn't get better than this. So stop reading now and get a ticket.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid entertainer with a story...,"I was a bit apprehensive based on all the negative reviews and went to the movie without any get expectations, just to kill a Saturday evening. But I was pleasantly surprised. Captain America Civil War is a decent movie and deserves a 7 star rating. By far it was the best Hollywood flick I saw in the past 3-4 months I guess.There is a story, a twist, some good witty dialogues and a cameo by Marisa Tomei too.If you have no other great movies lined up to see, then Captain America Civil War will help you pass 2.5 hours with some light and quality entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty Good,This movie was pretty good there were some scenes in the movie that did not add up but overall it was good. It did not meet my expectations but it was still better than a recent movie that came out. I cannot talk too much about it as it will ruin the story-line for many people. The acting of each character was amazing but the story line had its flaws. I did not know who's side to choose iron man or captain America I was quite confused. Captain Ameriica and Iron Man were the ones who stole the spotlight and made this movie amazing. This movie was a fun action packed movie and I highly recommend it but there were little errors in the story line. But overall loved it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A really good 3rd captain America movie,"I saw Captain America and i've got to say that this was a really good movie, not the best comic book movie ever but a very good. What i like best on this movie was of course Spiderman (he was the main reason that i saw this movie) and i was really curious and very impressed about Black Panther. I'm not very familiar about this character, don't know his origin and basically don't know anything but he was a very interesting character who plays a very important role in this story.I believe that almost everyone know the storyline so i'm not going to say anything about the movie or going to spoil it for the others but some facts. At first and maybe it was only me but i was really disappointed about spider-man's costume, maybe they are going to going to get it much better on Spiderman: Homecoming but at this point on this movie i didn't like it. And second thing about this movie and mostly for the 'fans', please guys don't compare it with BvS movie, Civil War was a very good movie with lot of action and drama and good humor and Russo's tied up the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron really good on this movie and this gives us the view that Marvel has a plan and develop their characters movie by movie than BvS which was the just the 2nd movie of the DCU. So guys just don't compare it.Now my score for this great movie is 9/10. I really enjoy it, it's a MUST SEE movie and i believe that the ticket price is well spend and no one going to regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Civil war is NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!,"Hey! This is my first review EVER!! why? Because I watched Avengers, Winter soldier, thor 1 &2, ant man, but this one is just stupid!!!! why???

Vision is so powerful he can take all of them together yet Cap and Barnes escape!!!I know this is a Captain movie yet you can't just include the other guys yet ignore there thoughts and POWERS!!! its a superhero movie after all!!!

A Stunning Masterpiece of Marvel..,"This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well... It's Marvelous. I loved Marvel movies very much. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! I really appreciate the Russo brothers for making a fantastic film for the audience and the Directors carrier also.The action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The CGI and Visual effects are awesome.The characters like Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Sebastian Stan etc are fantastically delivered their part very well. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is quite amazing no word to say and I am eagerly waiting for the Black Panther movie release.The movie got a awesome climax also. So guys, go for this movie.... You'll love it. It is a perfect start of summer blockbuster and one of the best movies of the year without doubt..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very entertaining, but far from an actually great film.","I'm not a Marvel fan and I don't really care for blockbusters, but I saw Civil War to see if it would maybe change my mind. It didn't. To say Civil War is a bad movie, though, is false. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a good movie, and that's about it, really. Just like most Marvel films - with the exception of Guardians of The Galaxy, their best - directing throughout most of the film is bland, generic, like the camera is there to show what's going on and that's it. Dialogues are shot in the most traditional and tasteless way, exposition is everywhere, editing is irritating and distracting, using way too many camera set-ups because, apparently, they think the average film goer has a 10 second attention span. Not even visually the film pushes any boundaries. There are, though, indeed good qualities to it all: the plot is very good and treated in a straightforward and interesting way, diverging from the traditional Marvel Formula plot we've seen in many movies before but wouldn't be able to hold a film of this size. Apart from that, the true standout here, where the film really is able to be a little more than expected, are the action scenes. Civil War has some of the single best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen in American cinema, a level I had only witnessed in Korean action films, though most of the action in CW is downgraded by the frustrating Hollywood editing. In the end, even considering all the flaws, it's all very fun, and if you already like these characters, you'll probably love the film anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Arguably Marvel's best installment,"Civil War is perhaps the most compelling film within the MCU. A lot of the franchise's future also hinges on what happens in this movie. It is a pivotal point in the timeline for several characters and events.It also holds some of the best action, particularly Black Widow's sequences are at their peak. There are several other great elements; the introduction to Black Panther is fantastic, and the introduction to Tom Holland's Spider-Man is rife with good lines.Happy to have re-watched this movie, and will be happy to re-watch it many more times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great movie,"Captain America civil war is a great action scenes and a thrilling story. Its problems , however, involve multiple underdeveloped characters (scarlet witch, vision, black panther and Spiderman...also crossbones and baron zemo) scarlet witch is developed in this film and we see her struggling with her powers so she gets ticked off the list in this film. Vision isn't really developed much and the only development his character receives is in his relationships. Black panther, as a new character he hasn't been developed, was devolved slightly and we see his passion for what he believes in play out. Spider-Man is amazingly developed and the new Peter Parker is best one so far. Crossbones and baron demo are so horribly boring that they are probably the worst marvel villains so far (which is saying something).The plot was really intense and the action scenes were amazing so the good > bad.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
AWESOME MOVIE! Marvel again sets the bar VERY high.,"Just like the last Cap film, I can see why everyone is praising Captain America: Civil War. Marvel AGAIN manages to deliver a little bit of everything and does it with style and integrity. This extremely talented cast fit each character perfectly, both large and especially the smaller roles. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner and is every bit a conspiracy thriller as it is an adventure. The dialogue is witty and the humor works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. The film certainly is smart and delivers more emotion than most will expect. These epic comic book style slugfests HAVE NEVER BEEN DONE BETTER. What's wonderful is that these spectacular action set pieces are inserted as a vehicle for the story and not just to see CGI things explode.What makes Captain America: Civil War BETTER than just about every action film to date is the fact that it balances amazing spectacle with an intelligent and a moving plot with full character arcs. How many movies can pull that off? Like many other Marvel films, this is movie making of the most entertaining order but actually does it even better if that's possible. It easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. The events here makes everyone long for Avengers Infinity War but also makes me wonder if they can every possibly top this film? Marvel again sets the bar is now set VERY high.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's ENTERTAINMENT allright. And it's good at that. Any bad? Yes, it lasts way too long and the storyline is disjointed. BUT it's still quite enjoyable...","It's blockbuster entertainment. And it sells well, because it IS ENTERTAINING. And entertaining is all it needs to be.Any bad? Well, there are many storylines and many characters, which result in a somewhat disjointed, chaotic storyline. Could have been better with a more tight knit storyline and fewer characters. This story lasts too long as well, 2 and a half hour is simply TOO much for an action movie, in my humble opinion.The good: it;s FUN. It's mindless, good fun. But it also has something few other action blockbuster have: it has great dialogues AND it has great actors. I didnt expect such great dialogues in an action blockbuster. And I am quite PLEASED with that.This movie can be watched by adults as well. Even those adults who usually dont go see such action blockbusters. It isnt special or a must see, but you wont get annoyed or bored either, because (as I have said before), the characters and the dialogues make this into a grown up AND entertaining action blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't wait, go see it!!","Captain America: Civil War was a phenomenal movie. It's perfect blend of Action, Comedy, and Adventure made for a great story. The key to this film was the perfect combination of the plot and all star lineup. Many movies lack a good combo of both, however this movie is an exception. The story of the movie will keep you guessing, laughing, and wide eyed the whole time. My fear was that it would be hard to follow for a person who hadn't watched the previous movies. This is a movie where previous knowledge will help, but isn't completely required. The movie is enjoyable for anyone. The cast complemented each other well and the new additions (hint hint) were great. For action i give the movie a 9 on a scale of 1-10. For the comedy aspect I give it a 10. A 9.5 would be more accurate for the rating. For my recommendation i would have to say........ go see it ASAP! Don't wait for it to come out on DVD, go see it in the theater and enjoy what I believe is the greatest movie of the year thus far!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!""","Captain America: Civil War has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it.What this movie does so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character.Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was good as Black Panther.Now for the problems: Daniel Br√ºhl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was forgettable. Daniel Br√ºhl is great actor but doesn't really stand out.Martin Freeman is a great actor but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes,his character is probably going to developed more in the future, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie.The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to-hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.Overall Captain America: Civil War is a good film but personally I would have preferred this further down the line when more characters had been introduced to the MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain Ameria: Civil War*******,"The Russo Brothers' Captain America: Civil War was a very good film. I do believe that the title adapted from the critically acclaimed graphic novel written by Mark Millar, did not suit it. I felt that an adaption of this title could've have better been saved for another movie, truly felt wasted. In general, I thought the movie was solid but somewhat of a let down, not on the same level and excitement that Captain America: The Winter Soldier gave me but a great effort nonetheless. And honestly, this feels more like an Avengers 2.5 movie rather than a Captain America 3 movie. My favorite things about the movie are Chris Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America as always he does a great job, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther, and Tom Hollad's Peter Parker/Spider-Man. 1 of my least favorite things were Robert Downey Jr.'s character development had taken a toll.

Crap-tain America Civil bore more like Poor man's BvS,"Compared to the first and second films in the Captain America franchise, Captain America: Civil War isn't quite as fun or thrilling unless impressive CGI and loud action sequences are enough to whet your appetite. Captain America: The First Avenger had a riveting plot that kept you at the edge of your seat. This one lacks suspense and is jam-packed with so many superheroes that, unless you're already very familiar with the franchise, you'll forget why you should be caring about these cardboard characters and their relations to begin with. Attempts to generate poignancy fall flat and come across as clunky while the wafer-thin plot feels stretched too thinly.Winter soldier still is the best MCU movie... And this is overrated as hell...critics are ruining good DC movies box office like BvS MoS and Watchmen.. MCU tried to do something different and managed to stick to the same old mediocre formula ..

Civil War is a Masterpiece...,"I am quite impressed with Civil War, because beyond being a simple movie of superheroes, is a Solid, perfect, mature and dark drama. Who is the one who has the reason? That is the question I asked myself while watching the movie. Civil War is a roller-coaster of emotions, because unlike the comic, which all the time favors the Captain America, in the film both sides are defended with various arguments, so much so that you get to have great sympathy for the team of Iron Man.The film is a drama, pure and solid, quite political, I dare to say that it is the movie of the Marvel universe more mature and serious that I have seen, in effect, follows this humor characteristic, but on this occasion it is not feel forced.The action is spectacular, the choreography of each battle is very well developed and the battle at the airport is epic, fun, Brilliant and amazing, accompanied by a good soundtrack. The CGI may be the least impressive of the film, because sometimes the characters looks like a 3D animated cartoon. but those scenes are minimal (thank god)Civil War is a masterpiece.

Downey delivers as usual and the members of the supporting cast shine unexpectedly (especially the new spider-man that i wanted to keep at arms length yet won me over in capturing the childlike wonder and awkwardness that has made peter parker so enduring) but I found evan's rodgers, who is supposed to be the principle character, unconvincing and emotionally one-dimensional.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Russo brothers deliver one of the great comic-book films to the MCU,"Back when Captain America: Civil War was announced during a Marvel Studios event in 2014, the anticipation I have had for this entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been rising with every single passing moment. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, stood on a stage and announced the next Captain America film would be named Serpent Society and every single person was left a little underwhelmed. Then he backtracked and revealed the film's true title, as well as bringing out Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to a deafening noise from the excited crowd.Taking elements from the popular Civil War comic and rearranging a few things to make it fit the continuity of the MCU, Marvel turned to the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who did such a good job with The Winter Soldier, to bring this story to the big screen. The Russo brothers have struck gold once again with Civil War, a film that may not only be the best entry into the MCU but one of the greatest comic-book films ever made.After events in New York, Washington DC, Sokovia and finally, a botched mission in Lagos, the Avengers, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), are brought in by the US government to sign the Sokovia Accords, a document that states the Avengers must work under government supervision rather than their own free will.Many people still see them as heroes yet there is a growing number of people who see them as nothing more than vigilantes who should be put on a leash, or stopped altogether. Captain America, who also has the trouble of finding his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) before he's taken out for good, decides against signing the document, causing a rift between not only himself and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), but splitting the Avengers right down the middle.While the Avengers, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, are all in Civil War, it is still most definitely a Captain America film, driven by a very personal story for the First Avenger. I have to applaud the writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, for the job they have done delivering a strong emotional core to Civil War. Captain America's main priority is getting Bucky, operating as the Winter Soldier for years, back at all costs and the effect it has on his friendship with Tony Stark is devastating, culminating in an emotionally fuelled finale that will leave you torn.These are characters we've spent eight years following so to see them come to blows, especially when you can agree with why both are fighting, makes you genuinely care about the fight itself and the fallout of it all.One of the highlights of The Winter Soldier was the action, particularly the hand-to-hand fights, and it's great to see the Russo brothers deliver brilliant action once again. The film is full of pulsating action whether it be close quarter combat or blistering chase sequences however, the stand-out action sequence in Civil War comes in the form of an all out brawl between two teams made up of various Avengers in a German airport. It's full of wonderful character moments and some brilliantly executed fun surprises, making it quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in any comic-book film.One of my worries for Civil War was whether there would be too many characters in one film. It could have been a recipe for disaster and ended in a convoluted mess but that is definitely not the case. The Russo brothers do the characters we are familiar with justice as well as introducing new faces that I can't wait to see again in the MCU.Both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have never been better in their respective roles of Captain America and Tony Stark. Downey Jr. in particular gives a really memorable performance as a guilt ridden Stark who feels the Avengers should be reined in.All of the other familiar faces are brought to life with good performances but the real stand-outs are the new characters that we'd all been dying to see in action. First up is Chadwick Boseman in the role of T'Challa/Black Panther, a prince and warrior of Wakanda. Boseman cuts a very regal and imposing figure as Black Panther, more than holding his own against the likes of Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Then there is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland. This is Spider-Man's debut in the MCU after Sony agreed to share the rights with Marvel Studios so they had to get it right. They didn't just get it right, they nailed it with Spider- Man. This is the Spider-Man I've wanted to see for some time now, quip after quip during the airport fight and a distinct awkwardness as Peter Parker, and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. I will wait to see how his solo film pans out but we could be seeing the best Spider- Man yet here.Take note DC, this is how you introduce new characters that will go on to shape the future of your cinematic universe.Juggling a film of this magnitude with the vast array of characters on show is no easy challenge, yet it's one that the Russo brothers thrive on. They have delivered a brilliant comic-book film in Captain America: Civil War and, with the stakes even higher and more characters to come for the next Avengers films, they are certainly the right men for the job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It is good, but it is complex and it is important to pay attention to the story.","It was with pleasure that I saw this film from the cinematographic franchise ""Captain America"". It is a franchise that has given rise to increasingly extraordinary and visually ambitious films. The connection to the previous film, ""Winter Soldier"", is very present, but I confess that I was left with the feeling that it would have been better to see the ""Avengers"" franchise first, in order to better understand the film, and the relational mechanics of the characters. I remember, as I said in other reviews, that the world of comics is a maze that I do not dominate at all.The plot revolves around a tense situation: after having made a lot of victims and material damage in their operations (finally, someone realized this), the Avengers were punished: they either subjected themselves to UN supervision or were considered outlaws. While the leader, Stark, accepts the impositions, Rogers sees them as an unfair limitation and bets on going his way, even if he breaks with his colleagues and, especially, Stark. At the same time, a subplot develops around Bucky Barnes, Rogers' childhood friend, and his mysterious past.The script is complex and full of details, subplots and nuances that can escape our gaze if we are not attentive or do not know the Marvel universe reasonably. I felt that sometimes the development of the script didn't quite know which way to go or what ideas to develop, and that several characters appear because they really had to be there, if only for a couple of minutes. The central core of characters, however, receives a very good treatment and has time to develop. I thought it was a little strange to see Spider-Man among all these people. He looks a little out of place. And in a film so loaded with good and great heroes, I missed a truly charismatic villain who balanced things out a bit.The cast is a real nest of stars: it is huge and full of notable names. Of course, the protagonist is Chris Evans, as Captain America. He is already fully acclimated to this character and knows perfectly what to do, and does his job flawlessly. Robert Downey Jr is the eternal Tony Stark, a character he was born to do and who does in an exceptional way. Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan continue to be excellent, as they were in previous films. Paul Bettany seemed strangely robotic until I realized that he was really playing an android. Chadwick Boseman was excellent, serious and very focused. Elizabeth Olsen was fine, but not brilliant, and the same can be said of Emily VanCamp, in a relatively bland performance. Anthony Mackie showed up little and Don Cheadle just did what he really had to do.Technically, it is a film worthy of Marvel and of the quality to which it has accustomed us: it is an extraordinary and stylish visual show, where every detail has been thought out in a meticulous way to increase the audience's visual and auditory experience. Cinematography is great and the filming work has been wonderfully accomplished. Visual, special effects and CGI work add sparkle, power and visual depth. The editing work was very well done, with precise cuts and great balance. The action scenes, especially the one at the airport, are good and will satisfy the appetite of Marvel fans. The sets and costumes were also very well done and look authentic. The soundtrack is quite good, but I didn't feel it was something that was really in the ear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel shine again while DC falter,"Well captain America civil war is a must see for marvel aficionados, from well explained motivations to mind blowing action and an emotional twist, this is comic book film making at its best. Many people complain about Zemo not been important to the movie but take him out of it and there is almost no reason for characters to fight also one of MCU best villain as he didn't need to fight yet he achieved his plan. Yes there will be DC fans nitpicking at silly things but don't listen you need to see this to believe!!!!!!!! Cant wait for Avengers infinity war surely gonna blow us out of the water.

A great movie from MCU with Amazing fight and advance plot.,"I had very high expectations for the movie with early reviews of IMDb and with two trailers, Also I am a fan of MARVEL MCU yet didn't miss any of past MCU movies. I am glad to say that I didn't got disappointed with this movie and it was beyond my expectations with Amazing spider man & specially black panther who does wonderful part of the movie.The fight between Captain America+winter soldier vs Iron man is possible and Cap is right with his opinion and Iron man also got a point. When I go to watch movie I had argument with my friend who was on Team Cap and I was with team Iron man, But finally when movie ends we both had kept out of choosing team and felt sad about what happen, what Baron Zemo did, BTW he is actually not a villain but a man seek vengeance I guess. The movie deserves 9.5/10 and only issue I heard from my friends was if you were not familiar with MCU early movies you might not understand the story well. But I was okay with movie from beginning to end because I was Marvel fan and this movie got on of the best fights I have seen in a movie. The special music during action scenes gave me awesome feeling too.Strongly recommend to watch this masterpiece ASAP..!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very good movie,"Watched the movie yesterday. Without giving any spoilers, I thought that it was a very enjoyable movie, even for non-super hero moviegoer fans. The acting was excellent, especially Iron Man and Spiderman. The cinematography was very good, with the main battle between the opposing factions being the highlight...superb.The only flaw, if it can be called that, was that the movie started out rather slowly, but after the first twenty minutes or so, it was almost continuous action. No wonder that the Metascore rating is so high and the rotten tomatoes website gives the move very good reviews in general. The movie has everything, including a little humor at the right times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Alright but can be too much,"This movie was okay, the action parts looked fun and cool and the plot was just alright. The problem is a lot of the action was pointless, they're fighting each other because of some government rules and then at the end it's another pointless fight. I feel as if it contributes to nothing in the mcu. It feels like a bunch of action put together. I gave this movie 7 stars because it wasn't all that bad, the introduction of spider man was epic and the fight scenes were a bit good just not necessary at times. I do recommend but it's not something to watch many times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Civil War: What is good for,"For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as much fun as it could have been.,"As a huge fan of the Marvel Universe...I must admit I had high hopes for Captain America Civil War...and I was disappointed. Not terribly disappointed,but slightly disappointed nonetheless.Reviewing this movie as simplistically as possible...this is a revenge movie, where everybody is angry at everybody else...and this anger...much of it misguided leads to all types of conflict, between all types of individuals, regardless of their lot in life.This isn't an Avengers Movie...but it really is an Avengers Movie...and I must admit, I like my Avengers movies, much larger, louder, and bolder. Maybe its the absence of the Hulk and Thor, which leads to a bit more subdued of a movie...and trust me they are missed. Yes, Ant Man and Spider Man show up for the festivities, but their presence hardly make up for the Green Guy's or Odin Son's absence (although Tony Stark does give the ""Green Guy"" a shout out). With that being said, however, I personally got a kick out of ""new and improved"" Spider-Man, now that he's been given the ""Marvel Treatment"", and I expect the upcoming standalone Spider Man Movie should be the best yet.As noted already, this entire movie is predicated on interpersonal conflict, and its this conflict which leads to two major battles between our superheroes. The first battle is a bit tongue and cheek, but the second battle is all business, and our heroes are truly intent on inflicting serious harm on each other.Not nearly as big or bad as its predecessors, Civil War is what it is...A study of the human and superhero psyche. Although it is an interesting endeavor, it is not a particularly exciting one. Marvel's crown jewel, The Infinity Wars (or whatever they're going to be entitled) are fast approaching...and the bad blood between our heroes, (spawned further by the events in Civil War), better be healed...and Thor and the Hulk better be planning on showing up...or Thanos and his Infinity Stones should have a cake-walk when defeating our heroes, and conquering the universe they are sworn to protect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's good, maybe not as good as everyone claims...","SPOILER FREE - (As long as you've watched the trailers)(TLDR at bottom)Going into Captain America: Civil War (I'll call it Civil War from now) I was extremely excited for the film. This was something I was really excited for, especially after the success that was Winter Soldier. I knew the Russo's knew what they were doing with Cap and were good at both progressing plot and developing characters. Something I love in film. So how does Civil War stand up? The answer, in short, is that it's good.All I've seen said about this film is praise, 10 stars and shouts of this film being a classic. Whilst I wouldn't say this film is a classic, it's not a bad film. One of the film's main attractions comes in the promise of the Avengers being split in half and going head to head against one another, and you get that in heaps. There are plenty of fights in this film between heroes, with the exception of the very first fight every single fight in this film is between the heroes that have been developed in previous movies, and the action is stellar. Considering the vast majority of these heroes only rely on hand-to- hand combat it's really amazing that the action feels so fresh and swift, it's something to definitely be commended, and all of the fights feel swift and real.With the action pretty much down, how does the story do? Here I have a bit of an issue. In my eyes, the plot is a bit of a mess. Literally so much drama could have been avoided if anyone just TALKED to someone on the other side of the argument, at least ATTEMPT to reason with the opposing side before going in with guns blazing. There is also a villain in this film that has an extremely convoluted plot, a plan that relies almost entirely on coincidence and luck. I think the film could have done without him. So overall, the plot is relatively weak.But how does the character development fair? For the most part it's done pretty well. The film wisely decides to focus most of it's attention on Captain America and Bucky (aka: Winter Soldier) as it is still a Captain America film. With these two characters you can really sense both of their struggles. Bucky's done a lot of bad things that fall on his shoulders but he did them all brain washed and only now is regaining his identity whilst nearly everyone else wants him gone. Cap is determined to help his friend where no one else will, to help that one lost soul from his past, the last healthy memory of the world Cap once knew and can never get back. It's very well done stuff. Iron Man gets some decent development too. It's good to see Stark on the back foot and struggling to keep everything together when it's all falling apart, Stark trying to amend for past mistakes and being fought against. It's a side of Stark we haven't really seen before. Widow also has an interesting plot in her deciding between choosing what she knows is safe and what her guts want her to go. Other than this, however, the development is poor, ESPECIALLY for Vision and Scarlet Witch.But overall, here's why this film can not be higher than a seven. It accomplishes nothing. It's a problem I had with Age of Ultron and it's a problem I have here. In these movies, where the universe is slowly being build upon piece by piece, I want each movie to have an impact on the universe, for the world to adapt and alter because of the events in the film. I felt Civil War could have been more. Ultimately, once the film is finished, everyone pretty much ends up where they began and it just makes me a little disappointed. What I loved so much about Winter Soldier was the pretty interesting plot, the development of characters and the companionship of Cap and Black Widow. Understandably this couldn't be focused on as much due to the cast, but it still feels lacking. Also, Winter Soldier changed a lot. It introduced a new character, new motivations, it collapsed SHIELD and the characters changed. You don't get that in Civil War. It's not that the film's bad, it's not it's actually quite good, but for me it's good in the places I care less about so I can't really give it more than a seven. I had fun and got what I wanted at the core but I felt like just a few more tweaks could have made this one of the greats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great blockbuster! (Non-spoiler review),"I went to see the first screening this morning, and it's a great movie (with some flaws). Let's start with the good things: The actors absolutely delivered, Chris Evans & RDJ are amazing in their respective roles, Spiderman & Black Panther were wonderful (couldn't have hoped for a better introduction for either of them). Scarlett Witch is great too (we get to see her power better now); and even Black Widow is an (much needed) improvement over AoU! It's an action-packed movie, with emotions, humour.. Anything a blockbuster should be. The cinematography was great, good storytelling, hats off to the Russo brothers. The Captain America trilogy finishes on a great note.However, it is not without flaws: The main issue is that once again, Marvel didn't get the villain right. He was completely useless & I believe the movie would have been better without him. His plan was surrealistic & couldn't possibly happen. The humour was sometimes inappropriate, in the way that people wouldn't crack a joke when getting beaten I praised the action-scenes earlier, but they dragged and in the end, you are left quite tired. Then.. the relationship between Bucky & Cap, while enjoyable some times, felt forced -- but that is minor. The soundtrack was okay-ish, nothing memorable (like most Marvel movies) Last but not least, I felt the movie is.. forgettable. It doesn't stay on the mind, all the movie's depth comes from the characters, not the story itself.. and in the end, it has no impact at all.----- To sum up, even if it has some issues, I believe Civil War is a highly enjoyable movie, and is worth every cent of the ticket!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome!,"This film is amazing.I always say that the mark of a good bit of a film is when you're so engrossed you forget to eat your snacks. There were at least two 20 min stretches where that happened. This film is expertly filmed, the fighting and effects are amazing and the characters all have sensible motivations...the minor characters like Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Vision are not just split randomly, you can see why each one goes for the side they do.The Bucky storyline is amazing too...won't spoil this one.The villain is also good....again no spoilers.There is also humour, but it doesn't overwhelm the intensity of the conflict...Falcon, AntMan and Spiderman literally had me cracking up in the middle of big battles when it was intense...but it didn't distract too much.One thing is that if you haven't seen at least both Avengers films, Captain America WS and Antman you will be hella lost...One problem is that it is def",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Does Not Disappoint,"No spoilers here either. The film was action packed from beginning to end. With a movie this good, it's hard to pick a side in this Civil War.

I was pleasantly surprised with the latest Spiderman and Marisa Tomei was perfectly cast in the small role of Aunt May.

Two Words: Airport Battle,"While watching Civil War, I couldn't help but think of DC / Warner Bros.'s desperate failures to catch up with Marvel's unstoppable success, specifically the recent disaster Batman v. Superman. Both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides, only Marvel actually succeeds on every level DC fails. Where BvS botched everything from the basic setup (why are these guys so angry with each other?) to nearly everything else that followed, Civil War soars with nuanced clarity: allegiances will fall / form, friendships will break / build, and summer entertainment will be had. Civil War finds tentpole-heroes Captain America and Iron Man at odds, each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides. Neither side is clearly right-or-wrong. Instead, we are presented with a familiar world, in which ""good-and-evil"" are not black-and-white, but largely grey. Even the de facto villain, one of the better in the MCU, finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations. These disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical, I found my loyalty swinging back-and-forth like Peter Parker at an air show. Speaking of which, Holland's turn as the webbed-crusader is easily the greatest in cinema: young, witty, wiry, and wide-eyed. Our first view of him is a standout, even while placed within the larger context of the marquee ""airport battle"", maybe the greatest superhero melee ever. The Russos, who have taken Whedon's place as go-to directors for Marvel, have such a strong control of humor, story, character, and action, they've even managed to better their fantastic Winter Soldier here. With them at the helm, any assemblage of Avengers is one to anticipate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Comedy saves an otherwise weak movie,"I saw this in IMAX 3D, and my first advice would be to consider watching it in 2D. I don't know if it will help, but the version I saw was almost unbearable half of the movie due to lagging, choppy fight scenes. There is actually only one truly good fight scene in the whole movie, but it is sadly dragged out past its expiration date as well.The plot is a run of the mill thing that could be fully explained in about 1 minute, yet they drag it out for hours without adding new layers to it.The camera work ranges from terrible like in most close combat scenes to average for a high budget movie.The sound track is completely forgettable to the point that I can't remember if there was one.Acting however is good throughout the whole movie and you get what you expect from the characters.Where the movie really shines is in the comedy. Most of the characters aren't funny, but the ones who are (Tony Stark and a few surprises) give this movie a well needed injection boost in the middle of the movie that keeps me from dozing off after a really weak start.Should you see this movie? Yes if you are a real comic movie junkie, otherwise there is pretty much one thing you need to know to be able jump right to the next one, and it is easier to get that tidbit by googling than watching through the whole movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America and the Falcon¬Ö and The Avengers,"Released in 2016, ""Captain America: Civil War"" chronicles Cap (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers mission that results in the loss of many innocents. As a result, the Federal government and UN, represented by Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), want to take the reins of The Avengers. While Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a few others reluctantly support this measure, Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and some others categorically oppose it, which naturally pits the team against one another. Meanwhile, villains like Zemo (Daniel Br√ºhl), Crossbones (Frank Grillo) are on the loose, creating further problems.I'm a big fan of Steve Englehart's outstanding run on the comic in the '70s, which was the precursor to Mark Gruenwald's notable work 10-20 years later (his run lasted a whole decade!). What I loved about the comic was the relatively realistic tone, the interesting relevant issues and the fact that Cap & Falcon were the perfect representation of the USA. You'll see these elements in ""Captain America: Civil War."" The occasional interludes with Cap's babe, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), are reminiscent of the comic. Speaking of The Falcon, I like the way the writers took the basic concept and made him better; for instance, the way his wings deflect bullets and the nature of his 'pet falcon' Redwing.Since the plot ties into Cap's leadership in The Avengers we get numerous guest stars in addition to the ones already mentioned: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As if that wasn't enough we also get Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, believe it or not, freakin' Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with a glorified cameo of a hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), lol. How the movie can juggle all these characters and keep it from getting out of hand is uncanny.Lastly the core question of the titular 'civil war' is interesting and timely: Should the government usurp control over The Avenger's autonomy? Should this incredible team of superhumans become the pawns of the government? Captain America rightly says ""No way.""The movie runs 147 minutes and was shot in Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Germany, Iceland and Brazil.GRADE: A (8.5/10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very solid fun if not quite the spectacular extravaganza expected,"The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong?However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A wonderful piece of cinematic choreography,"It's always fun to see super-heroes ranged against each other - somehow it makes it more of a fair fight than creating some arch-villain who ultimately doesn't really stand a chance. In the X-Men movies, we've always had this conflict with the mutants led by Professor X constantly opposed by those following Magneto. In the DC Comics universe, we have very recently seen Batman versus Superman in ""Dawn Of Justice"".Now we have the mother of all civil wars with a team led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) battling it out with a squad alongside Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) which presents the largest collection of superheroes ever assembled on the screen. The Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ant-Man, Spider- Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision - they're all there. Plus newcomer Black Panther.The great success of this immensely enjoyable movie is that all these superheroes have a decent amount of screen time with good lines and exciting action. When the two tribes go to war, the result is a wonderful piece of cinematic choreography. So what's the argument between them? Well, as in ""Dawn Of Justice"", it's dawned on politicians that, when superheroes smash up cities, there is collateral damage - innocent people are killed.So 117 nations come together to draft the Sokovia Accord which requires them all to operate under the ultimate control of the United Nations. Both ""Dawn Of Justice"" and ""Civil War"" can be seen as metaphors for contemporary debates in our own world: should our security services and our global corporations be subjected to more regulation and restraint?As with all the superhero franchises, there are many allusions to previous films, so here it helps if you've seen all the earlier movies in the Marvel cinematic universe and can remember exactly what happened (I have and I don't).Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have scripted all three ""Captain America"" movies and Anthony and Joe Russo have directed the last two and they have set a high bar for the promised ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part I"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part II"" (2019) by which time I'll have forgotten even more but no doubt be just as excited and welcoming.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The world could be crumbling around you; everyone else giving up; Iron Man, and the other heroes wallowing in self doubt; but the faithful person, who still believes in himself (not for prideful reasons) remains, and that is Cap!.... It just so happened that he was right. His view aged well.While I admire Captain America's faith and idealism, I probably would be more like Black Widow in this film. She understood the bigger picture. Even though she sided with Tony, her allegiance was to a higher cause; that of, understanding both sides, but at the same time, working in such a way as to bring everyone together. That kind of person, often is overlooked. The person who understands the long game, and realizes there are more important matters at hand, like not turning on your friends, and realizing that you are on the same side. Black Widow may have at times appeared like she was siding with Tony, and at other times siding with Cap. She made a concession in the first place by signing the accords; despite not necessarily believing in it for that matter; but as I have argued this was for a higher purpose. Her character embodies the nuance in the world, Sure, it is easy to pick a side. But what if both sides are right in their own ways? And what if that way of ""looking at it"" is the wrong way? Which is to say maybe one has to lose small battles for something greater in the end. Sometimes you need to bend so as to not break. Anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Team Iron Man or Team Cap?,"This movie is the first movie in the MCU i would consider a masterpiece. It checked all my boxes. The conflict between Tony and Steve is not only interesting, but very smart. The whole movie and all of the motivations are driven by the very core of that conflict. Tony feels guilty, that his actions led to an innocent kid dying. Steve understands that, but also doesn't want to be under full control of the government. They both have a very good point and their actions are always understandable, reasonable and human. Plus, this movie gave us the first Spider-Man and Black Panther appearance. The fight scenes were so well choreographed and edited, I loved it. Zemo was a great villain in this film, one of the best villains of the whole MCU. Simply because he was able to do so much damage, even without being a villain who has crazy powers. He was just a dude with motivation, which is enough. Overall, this is one of the best MCU movies ever made and I absolutely love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyed,I enjoyed seeing my favorite marvel characters fighting each other in a dispute about the destruction after Avengers 2. Super hero movies don't often talk about the mass about of destruction they create after messing up the villain. Such as the Superman movies.

"Captain America, the first good superhero trilogy!","When it comes to superhero movies they rarely succeed at making the whole saga of movies (specifically trilogy) consistently good. Some might argue The Dark Knight Trilogy is perfect I think that's bullshit, The Dark Knight Rises is a mediocre at best and disappointing finale to what could have been a nice Batman Anthology. Other trilogies that haven't come out well are: X-Men Trilogy (Last Stand wasn't good), Spiderman Trilogy (Spiderman 3 doesn't need explanation), Iron Man Trilogy (neither of the sequels are any good), Blade Trilogy (Trinity sucks) and the old Superman and Batman sagas (sagas which the first two films were actually really good, but the two that followed were laughable corny crap).. Civil War is actually even better than Winter Soldier and First Avenger which is insane. The Russo brothers continue Bucky and Cap's story in this very well crafted adaptation (which actually has little to do with the comics). The performances are great, specially Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman as the newcomers to the MCU. The airport scene is even better than people are saying. It's as action packed as a film can get. Every superhero in the movie get's their moment to shine. The only weakness I can think of is the villain.. But we already expect mediocre villains from the MCU, THE MOVIE IS PERFECT ANYWAY!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A psychological super-hero movie,"Yet another masterpiece from the Marvel film franchise. Some people went in the theaters being on either Team Cap or Team Iron Man, but by the end of the film, it's clear no one was sure which side to be on.The film presents events, people and confrontations that justifies each and every Avenger's motivations for choosing a side. They are all valid and understandable. Tony Stark wants to make amends for the damage he and his fellow Avengers have caused other people, worried that he won't be able to stop. Which leads him to sign over his suit to the government to control when they decide.Steve Rodgers, on the other hand, is distrustful of the government, which can be manipulated and corrupted by criminals, like the Hydra, and maintains that ""the safest hands are still their own.""After a series of disasters involving Steve's friend Bucky, the two camps get into a confrontation at an airport. This is one of THE best fight sequences ever, as we get to see all of the Avengers (plus two new faces, Black Panther and Spiderman) use their various and unique skills against each other.The psychological aspects, betrayal, friendship and revenge and lessons on morality make this a unique film - and with each Avenger given enough screen time.This is a blockbuster you do not want to miss!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually appealing action, but lacks in everything else.","Captain America : The Civil War is the most awaited superhero movie for all Marvel and superhero's movies fans, but sadly for me, it failed as what it was supposed to be.The movie is about the separation of the Avengers, where Captain America and Iron Man are fighting about an idea, the one where the government wants them to hide and wait for orders before acting. Though it is a serious subject and the two team leaders tries to prove their points, the movie never really goes far enough about this idea. Captain America : The Civil War is a 2 hours and 30 minutes of nothing much happening and where the story will be forgotten.It is mostly about Iron Man more than Captain America the the point where it doesn't feel like a Captain America movie like the 2 first ones.Most of the credits of the movie goes towards the few actions scenes there are in the movies, they were well cut and explosives, though they don't feel like there are anything threatening to both teams. I appreciate the use of most of all the Avengers members and most of them shows good use of they're powers, props to Ant-Man and Spider-Man, they had good surprises. Overall, each actions scenes doesn't feels like a menace or anything, you don't fear for any characters and there are not a lots of emotions. There are evens some characters that are joking in the battlefield while fighting they're friends, it just doesn't feel serious and break the image of the ""war"" that is implied.In the end, Captain America : Civil War feels like a useless entry to the MCU, there is not much things happening in between the action scenes and it feels like a 2h30 introduction to the next MCU movie, probably the next Avengers. Fans will love seeing they're favourites heroes fighting, but there is not any depths at all and was felt unsatisfactory when the credits started rolling. The movie felt long, but I was still surprised when the credits appeared because nothing was felt accomplished in the end. It is probably one of the weakest Marvel movie after the first Avengers. Lets hope The Black Panther can do better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
1 of the best & greatest Marvel movies I've ever seen (and made)!,"I finally saw this movie today! And you know what?This movie is so freaking awesome! The heroes didn't disappoint (even Spider-Man, which is my fave Marvel superhero despite him being on Team Iron Man & me rooting for Team Cap). The action, drama & fight scenes were very awesome & well done! :)My favorite scenes are the following:1) Airport fight scene - Every hero fights one another (the 2 teams). This is my most fave part of the film.2) Cap & Iron Man fighting - This is the last fight in the movie. It was so cool.3) The opening fight scene - It was cool, especially with the scene being shot at a market.So, I recommend watching this movie. It's worth your money & time. And this is my #1 favorite Marvel movie of all time! :)My rating on this movie is 1,000,000,000,000,000/10 heroes!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just kinda fun... That's it.,"Honestly, Civil War is like a huge roller coaster that gets you super high and never has a big drop. Entertaining, yes, but annoyingly predictable, absurdly convenient and cheesy as hell. Annoying shaky cam, annoying one liners, annoying forced jokes amid fights and no high stakes. No depth. No emotional weight. Just loop after loop after loop. In the end, it was fun but not challenging. Seriously, at some points I was actually calling things before they happened. And at this point I thought they had learned to stop making it seem like something's gonna happen and then they back pedal from it, like they're not willing to take risks in the story to make you go ""wow, I can't believe they went there."" And in the end all kinda falls flat, like all the development and tense build up lead to nothing big. It's just a puddle they drag through for a while and then they come out at the other side conveniently squeaky clean. I can't get emotionally invested anymore in these marvel movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The idiocracy dictated by movie tickets,"This latest chapter in the never-ending ""Disney Secure IP Investment"" saga has the usual cartoon characters (such as Captain Return of Investment, Iron Rehab Man and Sony-Deal-Man) quickly moving and jumping through the screen to amuse millennials who are bored with their current smart phone for 150 minutes. This ""film"" adds up a new lineup of heartbreaking sell outs such as Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and William Hurt, all whose their threshold between dignity and bank account have finally been crossed, joining previous familiar sell outs such as Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johansson and, inexplicably, Don Cheadle.The nonsensical, incomprehensible plot follows Formula 1 pilot Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, reprising his role from ""Rush"") arranging an elaborate, over-the-top revenge scheme against the cartoon characters, forcing them to fight for our enjoyment, like a 21st century Mandingo fight for children, a plan only vaguely possible due to uncontrollable and unforseable events such as the United Nations resolution. Under a man-child prism of the world's politics, the script takes the cartoon characters to move between exposition scenes and action storyboards, all in the very awkward dichotomy of juvenile writing and over-expensive ""film making"".Any little enjoyment that can come from this movie requires accepting the dooming idiocracy that controls our world, economy, politics and fate; embrace your inner idiot and laugh at a giant cartoon character holding a small, tin-man character.How many insightful, meaningful and intelligent films we could have produced, under the realms of real talents, with this ""film's"" budget? How many excellent pieces of cinema, inspiring and motivating, touching and thought-provoking, could have been made if the masses preferred content over shiny objects? Ten? Twenty? Fifty?

Loads of fun,"9.3/10 ""Oh what's this? Another comic book movie? Oh well. Wait, is it just Captain America v. Iron Man? I bet it'll be just as bad as that Batman v. Superman movie."" I may be a little tired of comic book movies, as I am sure other people already are and I do not really approve Marvel has planned films until like 2023. However, if they continue to deliver movies of this caliber, they are very welcome to do so. Civil War is a pretty good movie. It has some great action, good stunt work and some pretty good performances and introductions to some secondary characters.First, the things I liked. You're constantly switching teams. I was ""Team Iron Man "" when I went into the movie theater, but the movie presents both sides with great, understandable motivation and you identify with both sides. You never grow to hate anyone but you kind of know where they're coming from and that's a sign of a well written film. It's funny when it need to be, serious when the story demands it and just badass all around. Also, these movies are actually fun and don't feel like the most depressing thing in the world. Yep, I'm looking at you Zack Snyder. Most of the action is pretty good, especially the airport fight which is simply phenomenal, I would even say perfect. The movie also addresses some heavier themes, which are thought provoking and the movie isn't afraid to do so. Another thing I love about these Marvel films is that, sure they are a part this massive MCU, however, most of these films you could watch, without having any previous idea what the other films were about or about who these characters are, and you could still completely follow what is going on. And this is something to be praised: Civil War stands alone as its own movie. This is the first we see of Black Panther and not knowing anything about him I liked his intro to this universe. Spider-Man was the best part of the movie, at least for me. Tom Holland really captured the character of Peter Parker like no one else has and was a great Spider-Man. I can't wait to see more of him.Now, for the things I did not like. The first thing is the villain. The whole movie you're wondering what his plan is but he never feels like a real threat amongst our heroes. He's just kind of there and does bad things. There is a point in the movie where I even forgot he was in it. His motivation was clear and in the end your questions are answered, but overall I think his plan was a little too ""Dr. Evilish"" if you catch my drift. Upon further thought, I realized everything of importance in the film could have easily happened if he wasn't in the film. Sure, the catalyst for the actions would have been different but the outcome would have been pretty much the same. The action was great for the most part, but particularly at the beginning of the film it did get a bit shaky at times, maybe even a little too shaky. You could almost always follow what was going on but it made me kind of dizzy. I've said this several times for the Marvel movies and it does take some points away for me, but the score in these movies is inexcusably mediocre. It always (or at least most of the time) feels like generic superhero music in these Marvel films and it is something that needs to be addressed. No spoilers, but I was disappointed with the way the movie ended and it felt kind of dumb to be honest. It involves a letter so you know exactly what I'm talking about.But overall, Marvel has really done a great job once again with Civil War. The best thing about this film is that every character has something to do and every single one of them has a certain depth to them and you can identify with their actions. No one feels out of place (Well, maybe Hawkeye a little bit, but you can identify with him and you know where he's coming from) and in a movie with as many characters as this, it should be praised. Civil War is action packed and loads of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel at it's best...,"**Warning may contain major spoilers**I'm gonna compare Civil War to a few things here as I feel it's only right to. Especially as the year has opened with hero against hero which creates a good base for any superhero movie. There has always been that debate, #whowillwin when matching heroes against one another and I believe the hype over Batman V Superman was greater with regard to who wins but Civil War had more hype overall.Is it really a Captain American movie? Robert Downey Jr. has been quoted saying it's Iron Man 4. In my opinion it's another Avengers movies which centres around Rogers and Stark disagreement to be put into check. Only Thor and the Hulk are missing and you can understand their absence. Though the Russo brothers have done something rather incredible, and that's a perfect balance between all the characters. It's a super busy line-up yet each and every character gets decent pieces, each having their own moments. It's almost like Vision has devised a formula calculating the percentage each character should have and divided the 147mins perfectly.The debates between Rogers and Stark creates an unnerving tension which eventually tears them all apart. There's a basic agenda there but understanding both sides of the argument it's hard to pick a side, even when knowing certain truths you can still sympathise with the other. As a whole, it's like they've stripped everything back to basics and built it back up whilst letting the heroes tear it back down again.It's not just the characters they balance so well either, but the action versus downtime and comedy. This has some of the best fights out of all the marvel movies put together and I believe that to be as a result of it being mostly hand to hand combat and some web to shield. The staircase fight was Bournish but with super strength, the airport showdown is epic beyond measure again, everyone getting their piece of the action. The foot-come-car chase was clever too and just when you thought you've seen Natasha kick-ass before, she goes and throws all that about. A lot of very imaginative action without it going silly; in fact it's the most believable fight scenes I've seen in a Marvel movie.The comedy element is there and yet again, everyone else having their moment giving the audience so much to talk about, which I reckon most of would be unfortunately lost during the adrenaline rush. It isn't just Stark that throws the witty one-liners and cheesy comebacks, Sam, Clint gets some in and even Bucky shows his sense of humour for a brief moment. This is down to excellent script writing and there's a lot of clever dialogue to go about.We see the familiar heroes, Rhody, Sam, Wanda and Scott Lang having a small BIG part with his quirky uncomfortableness. Clint obviously returns and it seems he has a lot more to say. Or it feels that way; I'm not doing any word counts here. But they introduce two more characters from the marvel universe, one of which is already a major player on the field and the other being T'Challa, the Black Panther.Chadwick Boseman does an superb Black Panther and really makes his presence known. He can punch and kick with the best of them. And what is really great about the introduction of both these characters is that there really isn't one. No origin story for either so not to derail and insult the audience. Like Spider-Man needs a background story. (He's always been one of my favourites)Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man is recruited in comic fashion and what he brings to the arena is nothing short of amazing. Not sure if Tom Holland has the Peter Parker look but it's refreshing and his boyish chatter is brilliant, actually complimenting on his enemies abilities and attributes whilst giving them the slingshot and web bashing. It was his part I was most worried about hoping they wouldn't ruin him or just give us a hint. It works. Thank You.I'm not sure about Martin Freeman and as much as I love him as an actor I'm not sure he fits in. I don't think his part was wholly necessary or to have him play it. Maybe they should have dressed him up to be more like Agent Coulson. William Hurt's character yes but Emily VanCamp's Carter could be seen as a weak link though she has more than one purpose in this fight.Now, it does lack the major bad-ass super villain but there's no need and even though there's a hint of one or a squad of them, there's a clever twist and like Batman V Superman, it involves mothers. (Hmm, was that one below the utility belt?) It totally works and allows the story to finish with the ending it deservesOther things to note are the baseball cap disguises everyone seems to wear and of course everyone being on first name terms. You can't see everyone going about calling each other by their superhero names when sat around desk. It actually adds some humility to each of them. And yes Stan Lee makes his usual comical cameo with some lasting effect thanks to Rhodes.Is it to comic book lore? Well, after consulting my comic hero expert it's better than the comics ""fleshing out their storyline"". Is it better than Dawn of Justice? Yes. So much better on so many levels. Is it better than Avengers? Definitely better than Age of Ultron, it's like a separate movie all together and my current mood is saying it's even better than Avengers Assemble. I think it's because this time it's personal and not so over the top. It's marvel at ground level and at it's best.94% 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Characters and Action,"Captain America: Civil War (2016)*** (out of 4)Politics enter The Avengers as they are asked to sign an agreement, which would basically put them under control of the U.N.. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wants them to sign but Captain America (Chris Evans) believes it's a bad idea and soon the two are divided and a civil war breaks out among The Avengers.CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is another high-powered and fast entry into the Marvel series that is hands out the best thing out there in regards to comic book movies. I've honestly never read a single comic book in my life so I might not be the main audience for a film like this but it's very easy to see why this series has been such a hit with critics and fans. This is yet another highly entertaining film and it's certainly a lot of fun, which is something missing from so many comic movies today.Of course, the greatest thing about this is that there are so many super heroes gathered up in one movie. Not only is there Iron Man and Captain America but we've also got Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Falcon, War Machine, Black Panther, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and yes, Spider Man makes an appearance. I won't spoil the divide that happens in the film but there's a lot of great characters here and thankfully the ""story"" is kept to a minimum and instead we're just given one great action sequence after another.As you'd expect, by this time all the actors are perfectly fit in their characters and there's no question that the studio being able to get the right actors for the parts is one reason this franchise has succeeded so greatly. The film certainly looks great but once again I've only got one real complaint and that's the fact that the film ran on way too long. I'm sorry, but 147-minutes for a movie like this just isn't really needed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Disappointing, but still okay.","I have generally liked all the Marvel superhero movies, but some less than others (obviously). I had high hopes for this one, which might be why I ended up so disappointed in the result.Most of the movie is built around the quarreling between the heroes themselves, but this ends up being uninteresting, and feel more like an excuse to have them go at each other. But even the fights have such low stakes that it's hard to get much excited for them.The villain's plot makes little sense (to me), and seems to be based a lot on luck. Without going into to much detail, it would have been impossible for the villain to anticipate and plan for the situation in the end. But perhaps we are supposed to understand that he is just improvising some sort of plan B? Either way, it was not very interesting.The movie does some things right, though. The movie did not feel over crowded, despite the absurd amount of heroes involved in it. They all felt like they belonged in the roles they were in.

An Outstanding Triumph,"Captain America: Civil War is the culmination of the Cap legacy (just with a bunch of other heroes thrown in too.) What started with the First Avenger now ends literally 100 years in the making as Cap now finds himself at odds with Stark and a certain division of his team. As usual, life is breathed into the character thanks to the awesome performance of Chris Evans, who turned the disaster of the Fantastic 4 around and made Captain America all his own. Robert Downey, Jr. is always great as Iron Man, but seems to work better when he has other heroes to bounce off of versus doing a solo film. Both have equal opinions about why they're right, which makes it very hard to distinguish who's right and who's wrong, which is great film-making. Anthony and Joe Russo have clearly shown how to handle a Marvel film. Even if Spider- Man hadn't made the final cut, it still would have been a greatly hyped film. Even though the film is not directly adapted from the comic book altogether, Civil War is an outstanding triumph in every way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OK Film,"Captain America: Civil War is not bad, but certainly overrated.It has several flaws and issues, few of them are: 1. Too much of shaky camera view. Why many action films want to be another Jason Bourne movie?2. Is Zemo the villain a prophet? How does he estimate the arrival of Ironman and prepare a video for him?3. Non-stop changes of establishing shots, especially the different country shots. Are they trying to sell tourism?4. The cause of conflict is ambiguous5. Why does the mastermind Zemo has to kill all other winter soldiers instead of making good use of them to fight Captain America? So what's the point to trap the superheroes in the secret base? If Ironman never arrived, what could he do as a non- superhero (so he must be a prophet)? Mastermind, seriously?6. Common sense issue. If you want to kill the people at the state of hibernation, what you need to do is not to disturb them or kill them any other time. So Zemo the prophet has been spending so much time and effort to plan just to kill hibernated people and then commit suicide? Seriously....7. If Ironman never arrived, how does this Zemo fight against Captain America? What's his plan B? Clearly he must be a prophet....8. Another common sense issue. Enemy of your enemy can become your friend, what you got to do is to use brain. So what's the point to kill those hibernated winter soldiers? When you are killing the enemy of your enemy, you are helping your enemy. Mastermind huh....8. The quick changes of personality (or you can say ""character development"") for few characters are not making sense 9. The airport fighting sequel is fun to watch, but not epic or even realistic. Why? The main issue of Marvel films is they tend to avoid any violent shot which make the superhero fight look like kids' fights and unreal; in addition, when the cause of conflict is ambiguous, it is hard to establish epic fight scene. Why the fight sequel in Return of The King and Mad Max are great? Established motivation (do or die) and realism (blood were shed, any character could be killed)The best Marvel movie so far is none other than The Guardians of Galaxy; the best superhero movie to date?

I'm getting old,"Man oh man, these superhero movies don't thrill me at all. I fell asleep when I went to see Age of Ultron in downtown LA, Deadpool seemed like the worst movie I'd seen in ages and then there is this.It seemed like the exact same thing to me. Same plot devices, same structure, same plot twists, same characters, same dialogue, same action sequences. There was no freshness, not creativity at all. When the protagonists came face to face in the airport-scene, it seemed like a ballet. It seemed cool, but a little silly and very staged. This movie lacked urgency, it lacked sharp plotting and creative action set pieces.While watching the movie, I was thinking about whether there had been superhero movie that had that, superhero movies that were fresh and sharp. And I started reminiscing, while watching this movie, about movies like Xmen (2000), Spiderman (2002), Kick-Ass and The Avengers. Movies that had a sense or urgency, were fresh and sharp. Between them there are dozens of movies that are lazy and boring. And this is one of them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cohesive and fun,"Civil War is among the best additions to the Marvel Universe. It is quite easy to notice that Marvel movies have been getting progressively darker and more thematically diverse. And this is for the better since it all adds up to being more than mere macho men throwing punches at each other.First off, Capt. America and Iron Man. That these two have had a borderline conflict since the very beginning of their collaboration is very well known, and here we see them up in arms over the manner in which they must function, now that Shield has collapsed and the Avengers have literally no one to answer to. A very compelling aspect of this movie is the way the different viewpoints of the Capt. and Iron Man are allayed to each other and to the viewer. Points made by both sides are potent and definitely need more debate and deliberation, which is precisely what the Avengers don't seem to have time for, considering that there are men out to seek glorious revenge(Read Zemo). On the one hand Iron Man is right in that it is unreasonable to think that the Avengers, as righteous as they might think they may be, have no one to answer to, and so it is their duty as a force committed to saving humanity, to sign the accord and make known their allegiance with the Governments. On the other hand, Capt. too is right in that by submitting to be monitored by the UN, the Avengers lose their ability to take on crucial operations due to their being ramshackled in the quintessential political propaganda and such; and thus the Avengers could end up being a mere tool in the promotion of said propaganda. Furthermore, the Captain's POV can be understood in that his having witnessed the failure of Shield has convinced him that the Avengers are most effective when in charge of their own matters.So with this well fleshed out exploration of conflicting idealogies explored in what was a good, but not great first half, the movie knocks itself right out of the park in the latter. The second half has an exciting mix of comic exaggeration and dramatic exploration of themes and characters. The Airport fight scene is, while I concede hardly a practical realistic battle in that a group of ""fashionably dressed"" super-people happen to chance upon a conveniently deserted airport and fight each other while actually enjoying themselves while consistently smart-talking is well, possibly frown-inducing, yet one of the most exciting action sequences in CBMs, with hilarious exchanges between the many characters. The whole sequence breathes goofy gleeful cherry blossoming abandon, and is after all a coming together of all our favourite superheroes and their collaboration in riding on each others' abilities to execute great action sequences. Ant-man and Spiderman were simply great.Post the Airport scene, the Capt-IronMan-Bucky showdown in Russia has surprising dramatic heft for a Marvel movie. The plot twist that it provides us adds for a searing intensity in the fight scene that follows, all with the character motivations, if not justifiable, definitely understandable.All in all, Civil War was brilliant in that it combined all the elements of the summer blockbuster that we have come to expect, as well as providing us a fairly commendable foray into the political and emotional conflict that arises out of being a superhero. There is a lot of fun to be had here, but of course you're going to have to concede that it is after all a comic book movie. The Russo brothers have done a great job in adding whatever 'realism' is possible in a world with alien gods, green monsters, computer-humans, insect men and what not.

It is darker than previous marvel movies and has a more serious topic since it's about politics, human experimenting, terrorism, and the causes of the destruction caused by The Avengers.The characters are so well written, they all have their motives except a few characters that i will talk about later. Captain having to decide whether he should help his friend Bucky and break the law or to support the government act to control the action of The Avengers. While Tony, trying to do what's right for him after seeing the aftermath of all the battle The Avengers fought before.And of course, the best part of the movie that is, the action. The action in this movie is phenomenal. It has the same style with the one in Winter Soldier, which we all love very much. But now, we had tons of other superheroes involves. And how they introduce and design Black Panther is amazing. But with Spider-Man.. Well i really liked the actor as Peter Parker. He got the witty nerd act going on. But once he jumped to the Spider-Man suit, well he never did actually since Spider-Man is just pure CGI, a bad CGI. And how they put Spider-Man in the movie is so rushed out. The character's involvement in the plot itself aren't even significant. It went the same with Ant-Man. They could honestly left them out from the film and it wouldn't make a difference, well beside that one awesome fight scene will be less epic. But in a serious movie with these deep characters, the two characters felt really out of place with their over the top sense of humor. I really wished they were introduced slower so we get to see the character developed more.The other thing about the movie I didn't like, is that the first half of the movie is very serious, emotional, and political but then BOOM action orgasm comes in. The action scene is awesome though, I loved them. But they shouldn't be very straight forward about it. They really just slapped it in the audience face. And how the plot progressed slow then suddenly every superhero on the earth start hitting each other up and blowing stuff up. But excluding all that, the ending was awesome and very emotional. It's certainly is better than the rest of the superhero movies that has came out this year and I even think it will be better than the rest to come (X-men, Suicide Squad, and Dr Strange). Definitely my top 5 marvel movie.WATCH IT NOW!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yes! Civil War is the one you got to see!!!,"It's rare that the sequels can out do the original, but the first Avenger does not hold a candle to the Winter Soldier and The Winter Soldier is nothing compared to Civil War.A superhero movie with some real depth to it, Civil War is not so loosely based on the Marvel comics event. All the Events since the first Avengers movie are being called in check, when the UN forces a political policy on the Avengers that would allow them to regulate how superheroes battle the forces of evil. Captain America is not for it, while Iron Man is, putting them on different sides.Just like Winter Soldier, what makes this movie so good is that it is basically an Avengers movie, having pretty much all of them in the same film at once, with some extra added surprises, like The Black Panther making his debut on the screen, Spider-Man joining the marvel cinematic universe and Ant-Man showing off his full capability.I was a little nervous that Cap would get lost in the shuffle of his own picture. He does, kinda, but thankfully the movie is about him being the leader of the Avengers so he does get some screen time. I love Cap, he has the flair of a a comic book, but the moves of the greatest action hero, and even though Chris Evans gives his best performance as the Star Spangled Avenger, we all did not come to see him.Civil War has the same appeal of X2, Just so many superheroes in the film, and it was done right. It's hard to say which is cooler, watching the spark happening between the Scarlet which and the vision. Seeing the origin of the Black Panther, or watching Tony Stark having a heart to heart with Peter Parker. Definitely the latter, because I though that Spider-Man's appearance in the film would be overkill, but you could not help but to clap when he comes on the screen. Tom Holland is going to do for Spider-Man what Christian Bale did for The Dark Knight.For those of you who hate how these movie superheroes don't seem to go up against a proper villain, I have to say that Helmut Zemo does not have the flamboyance you expect from a villain, like if you compare him to Loki (he does have the hate of Magneto, however), he was the perfect Villain for Civil War and adds well to everything the movie is.It's big and Epic,and action packed, and within all that is some serious drama that gets to you. Darker than you'd expect these Marvel movies to be, but still a ton of laughs and entertaining fun.It's what Avengers: Age of Ultron could have been and what Batman Vs. Superman really (really) should have been. Sorry Deadpool, but you've been replace as my favorite superhero movie of the year!No matter what side you pick, you win if you go see Captain America: Civil War.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exceeds Expectations,"http://www.metacritic.com/user/SeanVincentCaptain America Civil War exceeds expectations to everyone waiting for this film for a long time.It's the year's best superhero film so far,out of all superhero films that will be coming out.Captain America third outing brings emotional weight and seriousness and it feels more mature than any Marvel film.The action scenes were great and executed well especially the last scene and also the airport sequence.Characters are well written and gives time to shine especially spider-man,who in my opinion the best Peter Parker/Spider-man ever put on screen even if he appears for 20 minutes in length and Black Panther who is such a great addition to the franchise .The story centers in Sokovia accords and also Bucky- Steve friendship,those two plot lines were pretty much well handled and didn't feel out of place.The Villain was good in my opinion, he was given a clear motivation and you can easily follow his plans,well some people may think he is just boring,for me he is interesting.The only problems is that some scenes,The CGI is noticeable.This film can be a mess like the other film that ha the same premise but because of the level of confidence and love for the film makes this a well written,well performed,well balanced,well paced,well edited and a fun blockbuster film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"I'm literally writing this 30 minutes after I walked out of my local cinema, and I'm still shocked.After Dawn of Justice was... less than well received, it gave Marvel an amazing chance to leap even further ahead of DC in the ""superhero war"" and boy did they take that chance.I'm gonna jump straight in with a bold statement. Captain America: Civil War is in the Top 3 Superhero Movies of all time. Probably the best from the MCU, and given the likes of Winter Soldier and Guardians, that's quite a feat.So what was so great about it? The plot was extremely well structured, which should be a given but after the mess that was Dawn of Justice, it's refreshing to see such a well tied together story in a major superhero movie.The characters are all amazing, and there's a few surprises along the way too. As expected, Spider-Man hit it out of the park, as did Black Panther, but the star of the show (in my opinion, anyways) was Falcon. Every line he said was absolute gold, the stunts from him were all amazing, and while he was less than spectacular in Ant-Man, Age of Ultron and Winter Soldier, we're finally starting to see some great potential in a minor superhero, and if Steve Rogers is killed off in Infinity War, I can think of no-one better to carry on his legacy. Also, honourable mentions to Bucky Barnes, Hawkeye and Ant-Man, for also putting on a great show.Any negatives? The editing seemed a tad sloppy in places and in action scenes the camera shook a lot, but why even bother caring about minor details like that, when the movie all-around is exceptional.I can't see anything beating Civil War for film of the year in 2016, though I hope I'm wrong because I have high hopes for Suicide Squad.The future of Marvel movies looks to be in good hands!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A step in the right direction,"I thought it really was a lot better than I had initially expected. Despite it being swarmed with characters, it never felt overwhelming or bogged down in exposition or anything. The central political conflict was given a lot of weight and significance. The first half of it was simply brilliant, very reminiscent of The Dark Knight. Then some flaws started showing up in its second half. One of the things I've gotten so tired of with Marvel is the insistence of pretty much every film of theirs to be bogged down with comedy. That's something that I appreciated about the previous two Captain America films, even if only the 2nd one was good. Here, I never felt like humor started appearing... until the build-up and the first battle scene between the Avengers in the airport. All of a sudden, all of them started giving funny one-liners and sarcastic quips. Were the lines bad? Not at all, but with everything else going on, and considering they were now in a physical battle with their own friends, it just felt like a complete betrayal to the tone and the heft of the whole thing. I loved Holland as Spiderman, but an article that is floating online said is best- he was great in it and it excites me for his own films, but he had no business being in this film or being introduced at all. He and Ant-man, among a few others, just lighten the whole thing up at the exact moment when it should have gotten even more serious. Luckily, the film goes back on track after this battle scene. The battle scene itself isn't bad at all so I don't think it hurts the film significantly, but it does sort of try to change the tone and I don't think that was the right call.Overall, as flawed as it is and as someone who is not really a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at all, this was really great.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel did it better than DC,"First of all, I'm glad that Indonesia had the chance to see this movie one week earlier than U.S.A, and after spending 2 and a half hours watching this movie, I can guarantee you that the wait is worth it..I must gave all the praise to Marvel for doing this movie way much much better than what DC did with Batman and Superman.. Clearly Russo brothers know how to make a movie about our favorite superheroes battle each other.. Even though it is a multi cast movie with a lot of our favorite stars and character just like Avengers, but the character development for everyone is fair and square with the scene-stealer goes all the way to our young Spider-Man with the wonderful performance from Tom Holland.. Russo brothers did it all, with a really simple story they can develop each of our superhero character proportionally that they can shine on their own.. Such as Black Panther which is for me Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job portraying it..Overall, it is a superb opening to the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 3 and definitely can't wait for the Avengers back in action again together in Infinity War",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but suffers from being massively over-hyped","Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed this movie, but it certainly did not live up to it's 90% ratings, which honestly just seem to be spite ratings toward the critically bashed Batman Vs. Superman, which was very similar in plot, similar is kind of an understatement, just with a different tone (campy, Wagnerianly epic, and just downright weird). I love the Marvel movies, but the formula is getting a bit weary. The Avengers is perhaps one of the most balanced and best, the original Captain America and Thor were completely fun homages to their source material, Ant Man was surprisingly unique and refreshingly fun. Age of Ultron was godawful and more deserving of 20% scores than BVS.The rest are good but fall into the sequel bin, this one is close to being bin material, but is saved by the most deservedly hyped element, the airport battle. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems like two hours of filler. I love the characters, so I enjoyed the ride, but because I know the characters so well, I kind of questioned everything and came up with a lot of pros and cons, I'm so torn on this one, I think a pros and cons list will do best. PROS As previously mentioned, the main hangar battle is perhaps the best superhero fight since The original Avengers. Amazing in IMAX. Ant man, is great, Paul Rudd lends a laid back spirit that the plot heavy character heavy movie desperately needs. Spider-Man is fun, but honestly, there's been so many Spider-Mans at this point, it seems a bit odd, but I do like how young he is, it's a new concept for film Spider-Man. The final battle is amazing but kind of underplayed, which leads me to my first and biggest CON The last epic battle between the two protagonists is not even in the IMAX format!??! It's like after the hangar battle (which is more like playful sparring), they just stopped giving a crap, I could have lived without the initial Africa James Bondsy intro action sequence in IMAX but I know they have to have their beginning IMAX sequence.But really, without the awe of the grand scale effect, the last battle left me wondering about the spotty details of the last reveal and the horrible lame ass unnecessary villain, which leads us to Zemo... wtf, so many ridiculous plot holes, google them if you're curious but wow... Just wow. Number one, his diabolical plan is exactly the same as the also underwhelming Lex Luther in BVS... Like framing a super hero for a blowing up a government building and all just to start a fight.... Honestly, for anyone who watches Agents Of Shield, you're sitting there wondering why the Avengers are farting around with each other when Hive is on the loose. Last Con The necessary but cringeworthy spillover from the god awful Age of Ultron. The Scarlet a Witch holds up well but Vision is just as stupid as he was before. Thank God only one embarrassed mention of the awkward Hulk/Black Widow romance is mentioned. Hawkeyes once again abandons his wife/girlfriend whatever with a bunch of kids out in the middle of nowhere to avenge something or rather while hanging out with his best friend, the Black Widow. And as with all Iron Man involved movies, the inevitable Robert Downey Jr. wannabe tear jerker I'm so concerned speech, eh, why couldn't the last scene have been in IMAX format... Tsk, tsk.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An excellent accomplishment,"As brief background I am an avid comic book fan (both Marvel and DC, but I read Batman the most). I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and have been generally pleased with most MCU output. I thought Man of Steel was OK but that Batman v Superman was actually quite poor film- making.Civil War has simply made me think even less of BvS. I know some people don't like comparisons but I cannot help it when Civil War does what BvS tried to do but actually accomplishes it. The good:The action scenes are great - it really felt like a comic book had come aliveI was very engrossed with the story - I felt it flowed well and I really bought both sides of the argument. I could see where Cap was coming from and where Iron Man was. The fights were all justified - it never felt like the movie was trying to force a fight on the characters with tenuous justification like it did with BvS. On the contrary, the characters do not want to fight and are merely forced to by circumstances. This gives it more of an emotional kick. The conclusions feel satisfactory as well.Black Panther has translated to screen well - he is the guy from the comics, good parts and bad. He is also extremely formidable. His very last scene promises great things about his solo movieSpider-Man again seems like the most faithful to the comics we've seen yet. He talks a lot during fights - to everyone's annoyance - and has a great sense of humour.Some reviews have been a bit lukewarm on the bad guy, Zemo, but I disagree. I thought he was given a very human motivation (again, unlike Lex from BvS). By the end you almost feel sorry for himThe bad:It was a bit slow in parts but I was so excited I didn't mind. I question how these parts will hold up to repeat viewing",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extremely Underwhelming (6/10),"I was really underwhelmed by this movie.I have to disagree with the popular opinion. I was so stoked for this one, especially because The Winter Soldier is my second most favourite Marvel film after Iron Man, but I was left disappointed.Spoilers up ahead!Firstly, let's make something clear, it really wasn't a WAR. For 85% of the length of the film, it was a disagreement. And when we finally see the big twist happen, it still wasn't a war, because there were just 3 people fighting. I wanted every hero to be at each other's throat, but sadly that wasn't the case.At the end of the movie, I was indifferent about which side to choose, because both were almost equally wrong. Iron Man's motivations for signing the accords didn't make sense. I mean, since the last 8 years he has been killing people and watching them die, and suddenly he meets one woman which instantaneously changes his mind. Like seriously? He created Ultron and even that didn't change his thought process, but after meeting a black woman for 30 seconds in a secluded hallway did.Cap even once didn't mention how Hydra crept up inside SHIELD, and that is the reason they shouldn't sign the accords. The political angle should have been more fleshed out and written more articulately. They just skimmed over most of the stuff.The only real players in the disagreement (not War) were Iron Man, Cap, Bucky and Black Panther. If you think about it, the movie would have been the same if you take away all the other characters apart from these four.Scarlet Witch annoyed the hell out of me. Why? She kept creeping up in the middle of the fights in the airport scene and throwing the members from Stark's team away. I couldn't enjoy a good hand-to-hand combat scene between any of the members because the annoying little witch had to meddle in every character's fight. Is it too much to ask for a good hand to hand combat scene like the one in Winter Soldier? Honestly, Scarlet Witch is a bit too powerful for the MCU, and she should have been the one to die in Age of Ultron. Her accent is even more off-putting in this one. Nothing against Olsen, it's not her fault her character was written this way.I actually ended up really disliking Cap by the end of this movie. He saw Bucky straight up brutally killing Tony's parents, and still he doesn't show any sympathy for Stark. His motivations were selfish which were clouding his judgement. For the whole film, he doesn't seem to realise that his best friend is a threat to humanity. A simple code can activate his prey instincts.The famous Airport scene that everyone was boasting about was also surprisingly underwhelming. For the first 2 minutes it was great to see some of my favourite superheroes fight each other, but it got boring pretty quickly. Why? Because there wasn't any tension. All of the characters apart from Black Panther were pulling their punches. It was a practice session than a real straight up fight. It really wasn't War. Black Widow had the time to make jokes in the middle of the fight too.And yeah, the movie was really predictable. Apart from the final twist, the movie played out exactly the way I had thought it would. I knew there would be an underwater prison, I knew how Black Panther would become a part of the conflict, I knew that either Bucky would be framed or manipulated to attack a major international organisation because it was all shown in the effing trailers.One thing universally agreed upon about this movie is that the villain was unnecessary and I concur. His plan was extremely complex and it played out the way it did only because the movie wanted to. But, for a change it was refreshing to see a human antagonist who uses his wit and intellect to defeat the heroes. He doesn't have a grandeur motive to destroy to world, and I really appreciated that. That still doesn't take away the face that he was inessential to the overall plot.The things I liked: The final fight between Cap, Bucky and Iron Man was really good. That was the point when the movie became enjoyable for me because the the tension escalated to a whole new level. The look of anguish and sorrow on Tony's face was intense. Sadly, it was too little, too late.I liked Black Panther. He's introduced as a straight up badass, and I liked that. His motives made sense. He was part of the conflict for personal reasons and had his own agenda and that's why his character was intriguing.Spider Man was so awesome. I was waiting to see a Peter Parker who looked and behaved like he was in high school. So that was splendid.Finally, it goes without saying but the actors have really grown into their roles over the course of several movies and each one of them give an amazing performance. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans are just phenomenal in their portrayals. Even the new additions like Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman are really good.My final verdict would be a 2.75/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Honest Review,"The Bad: For those of us that were fans of the comic book, there was a bit to be disappointed with. Captain America was always the liberal super hero, the one the protested Nixon, that protested Regean, and that led a Civil War under Bush. Sure it was all thinly veiled in comic book style, but everyone knew what he was doing, everyone knew what it meant.He was Iron Man's political foil.And then there was the epic feel of the Marvel Civil War, we wanted a movie that didn't start and end with Cap, but effected at least a movie per character in the MCU.Then there was the Black Panther. He is supposed to be cold, calm, logical. In the comics you got the feel that both you and Panther knew that he was smarter than you are. In the movie he was driven by revenge. It was a disappointment. We wanted the Black Panther to act like the Black Panther.Not to mention, especially in 3D, some of the scenes were jumpy.The Good: It felt like another Avengers movie and that is not at all a bad thing.Anthony Mackie got a lot of screen time and, I may be in the minority here, especially since his Falcon has diverged so much from the comics...but he does an excellent job in his role and deserves a Falcon movie of his own.The MCU got Spider-Man back and, after Andrew Garfield's depiction of a Spider-Bully, it seriously needed a reboot. It's hard to surpass Tobey Maguire. For a lot or people he nailed the role...until Tom Holland took over and became the best Spider-Man yet to grace the silver screen.Ant-Man returned. It wasn't as shocking as the fact that Paul Rudd is a super hero, but it's a welcome addition. He brings a sense of humor to the role and even in a small part he's a pleasure to watch.And then we have the story itself, it didn't have the wonderfully tight beauty that Winter Soldier had, but that is excused. Civil War was really an Avengers movie and one that brought the MCU together again. It was a fun ride and it gave you the sense that the MCU is expanding faster than the big bang.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too good not to write a review,"As a comic book fan, reading Civil War was awesome. I am not a purist, I don't believe that they should be exactly like they are in the comic books. That being said, Civil War the comic had a great deal of characters and story. I was worried on how they can could do the movie with losing the great story telling of the actual civil war. While the movie was not really like the comic book story, they still managed to make a great Civil War Movie. And they kept the strong points, action and some of the main characters like Spider- man, Iron man and Captain America all in good form. The action was excellent, copying that same gritty, back and forth special forces fighting that they managed to bring to life in Winter Soldier. Team up scenes, unexpected powers and just coolness of their abilities soared throughout the screen with so many different awe factors. The story it self is believable, they make it a pretty decent reason why one hero would choose this side and the other would choose the other. And other characters that would be in turmoil no matter what they chose. To me when a movie is 3 hours and it seems like 30 minutes, you have a good flick. There was so much to like about it. The humor, was well timed and just flat out great. I heard a lot of people saying Black Panter and Spiderman where awesome, but Paul Rudd as Ant Man was amazing too. So do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an Epic movie that actually lives up to the Hype. Its hard not to like this movie and I'm sure some will, but to me I was in my element and so excited at the end of it all. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

8.2out of 10 And Watch out for spoilers,Now after about 3000 arguments with random Instagram people and hours watching reviews and watching the movie I've decided to take my rating of 9 out of 10 To a 8.2. Captain America is a great movie it's has some fun parts but as a whole movie it doesn't really work but the fun parts are really fun. It's all makes sense why they do this and why they do that in airport scene no one is trying to kill because team iron mans plan is to just arrest them and team cap was to go beat up assassins. And how visions missing for half of fight scene because he's kind of in the middle and only got involved when he beloved he needed to. Zemo is developed enough and man driven by vengeance what else do you need to know like really the one thing I don't agree with is people calling him a weak villain his plan to turn them against each other would have probz been better if Tony killed Bucky but I didn't want anyone to die because thanos will be a massive threat and they need everyone . There's a lot going on in the movie and introduction to two knew characters which were amazing but this was kind of a test for the russos and every flaw they have in this will be perfected in infinity war first they only had to deal with cap widow fury and Sam but now they had all superheroes except 2 but for a first try they did great and I know infinity war is in good hands after seeing what they have done with this movie where they got to bring all avengers together.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wow,"Action-packed, humorous, well balanced and well acted; Captain America Civil War is another insanely good addition to the MCU courtesy of Winter Soldier directors, the Russo Brothers. With a hero cast that greatly outnumbered any of its predecessor, one of the highlights of this battle of the titans was the inclusion of two new MCU characters, namely Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther; who in many ways stole the show. Credit must be given to the full team-up confrontation choreographed in the airport scene briefly depicted in the trailers, which without a doubt introduced us to a gladiator match like never seen before. With plot twists that will divide fans and general viewers alike, Civil War inspires us to seriously consider how the events leading up to this mammoth conflict have drastically transformed some of our biggest and favourite MCU character, building primarily upon the events that occurred in both the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. Identifying weaknesses were minimal as the movie manages to reconcile what was maybe a very fast paced and almost confusing first half with a momentous and emotionally driven finale which justified the need for thorough detail in the beginning. While the film tingled my nerd senses throughout, delivering just about all that I had dreamed of witnessing on the big screen pre-release, I give this title a 9 and only a 9 (I wouldn't of given it quite a 9.5 if it has been an option) was the noticeable structural weaknesses in the first hour in terms of pacing, but also the ever so slightly under-whelming opening act which saw the new Avengers team taking on one of their first big threats. My own personal highlights in terms of specific characters in the movie would go to both Cap and Ironman, but also the short but amazingly sweet appearances of both Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Awesome visuals, acting, and script yet, no good villain (NO SPOILERS)","Characters: The movie shines with really great acting and decent character development considering having many of them. The greatest and most exciting characters are definitely the new comers, Black Panther and Spider-Man. You can see the effort done for portraying both of these characters.Visuals and fight scenes: GREATEST FIGHT SCENES EVER. It definitely beats those in The Winter Soldier and those were PLAIN AWESOMENESS. Every fight scene with Black Panther is especially captivating.Humor: So easy and funny and was very helpful to lighten up the tone of the movie. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are the funniest and you'd expect that. Ant-Man probably had the least scenes in the movie but managed to get many laughs out of me with every line.Plot: Now that's the reason I deducted a point. Civil war is a powerful comic book in terms of story and the movie version didn't live up to that in my opinion. Also, The villain is so poorly written and his scheme is so lame. I couldn't help to think that Cap is more of a villain than him actually :DMusic: Simply not as nearly epic as the movie.Finally: This is definitely the best Marvel Movie ever and I think if they had paid more attention to the story and villain it would have beaten The Dark Knight in becoming the best comic book movie ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I can't believe...but I slept,"I was really excited to see this one after the winter soldier...turned out I was really let down.I think it is a common issue with Captain America movies - story lines are way too long... Avengers for example are to the point...I didn't like the directing, I felt the fights were way too much choreographed, I couldn't see any glimpse of response from the adversaries... in a way it seem the director tried to promote ""parkour"" more than anything. The so publicized airport scene, had me sleeping... really the sound of the blows seemed that they were not even touching each other...Giant Ant?!! The panther probably the only fresh thing... any way this movie was made with the purpose to entertain... entertains little, tires quite a lot...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Little things that matter,"So, its almost summer and its MARVEL time! Who doesn't look forward to MARVEL movies these days? They have been delivering quite well in the recent past and they continue to do so with the new Captain America (or should I say Avengers?) movie: CIVIL WAR. One would have seen the trailer and promos and would clearly have gotten the point about the movie's plot. It is war. A war between two of the biggest Avengers, two of the best friends and two contrast personalities. So the movie wastes no time in creating the rift between Tony and Steve Rogers to initiate the 'war' and the remaining avengers split up conveniently in teams wit their differences of opinions on the matter of Avengers killing innocent civilians in their quest for peace. As a matter of fact one would have seen this coming, with hints about minimizing the collateral damage in Avengers, Age of Ultron. So superhero fans, bombing and crashing buildings, throwing cars are not just to boost the action sequences anymore.Although one can argue that the story is a bit out of focus at times while trying to focus only on the rift, the directors produce something brilliant or give out a little hint twist just at the right time. That's why its the little things that matter that lifts Civil War when its down and takes it to another level. If you though the Winter Soldier played his part in Captain America The Winter Soldier think again. Because, this is more of a Winter Soldier movie than the previous one. The film slightly tries too hard to introduce all the new characters and reintroduce old characters but doesn't take anything away in the way it has balanced it all.Chris Evans for me is Captain America all the way. He is so good every time he dons that costume and leads the way. You just can't seem to disagree with whatever the Cap says. Robert Downey Jr has a slightly darker IronMan role this time. Chadwick Boseman is impressive, Paul Rudd is once again exceptionally funny and Paul Bettany as vision is just too cool. Of course cudos to all the other actors portraying avengers as well. It has been a unique and Avenger-esque introduction for Tom Holland as spiderman and I hope MARVEL keeps the same tempo going. Daniel Bruhl is an exceptional actor and he has delivered nothing less in his role as Zemo. It was slightly disappointing to see Martin Freeman's talent waste in a role with the suit.You cannot compare Dawn of Justice and Civil War. Both are movies of completely different tempos. I personally liked both and what makes Civil War click specially, is those little things, those moments that you will only understand if you watch the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some Moments Were Good...Majority Was Bad,"This movie was obviously one of the most anticipated movies of this year and of the comic book movie genre. As a comic book devotee, I was very excited for this movie. However, my excitement did not meet a good movie. Moments of this film were genuine and stirring such as all of Black Panther's scenes. However, most of this movie was tiring and some elements were not needed. I felt that the villain was not needed or could have been written into the story in a better way. Besides some of the shaky footage, the action was great. There were some intense fist fights and chase scenes that really grounded the movie. However, the main showdown between the two teams felt a bit brief. Besides the main characters and Black Panther, the rest of the characters were poorly written into the story. Everything felt a bit brief and too convenient like all Marvel Movies. I feel that the new Spider-Man will divide fans. His performance way OKAY. Nothing really special, but I guess we'll have to see more of him in Spider-Man Homecoming. I did not like his introduction. It felt too convenient and a bit rushed. In the entire first act, the movie failed to capture my attention. Again, there were some really great and intense moments, but overall the film failed me personally. There are emotional moments and moments you never thought would happen, but too much set up and time wasted ruined these moments for me. The special affects were mostly good except for Iron Man. When Tony Stark is wearing his suit with the helmet off, it is easy to see how poor and lazy the special affects division was in this movie. Overall, this movie had great moments but it did not sell me on the story. I still believe that the first Iron Man and the first Avengers (except for the ending) are better films than this. I am sad to say that this movie did not meet my excitement levels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A More Serious Tone for a Marvel Movie,"Captain America 3 ReviewOne thing right off the bat, you will notice the change in this movie's tone compared to previous the Avengers movie. To a great degree, we are all business here. More red blood is seen on the screen. The setup of all the people who have died is far more heavy-handed than, say, Batman vs. Superman. The filmmakers, instead of second-guessing where to take the superhero formula, instead deftly push it into gritty and mean mode. One way to keep things interesting is to mix-up character groupings. In this case, Hulk and Thor sit things out, while Vision is busy acting more like a butler. New characters are introduced a good distance into the film, as well as allowing Hawkeye to have his own part late in the film. The dynamics between Captain America and Ironman have been setup in previous Avengers films. Many, many details of previous films are chewed over. Of course, this being the continuation of Captain America 2, the storyline revolves around Cap's friend from long ago, now brainwashed into performing hideous acts.Should Bucky be responsible for his actions while brainwashed? That is central split between factions of superheros. Is he guilty or innocent? We the audience are allowed to decide for ourselves, since there are plausibilities entertained. As the fighting goes on, Spiderman, Black Panther, and Antman are incorporated into the ensemble. So in essence, this is a mini-Avengers movie. This all works well, with competent filmmaking resulting in a solid blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Magnificience by Marvel,"One of the most awaited movies of 2016, I watched this movie in Imax 3d for better experience and damn it was too awesome. The movie was full of superheroes including Black Panther and Spidey. With great plot line and fantastic effects, Civil War exceeded my expectation and didn't disappointed the way BvS did. Star studded movie with fantastic dialogues and actions make this movie an outstanding achievement for Marvels. The only thing missing in the movie was a villain. The movie shouldn't have been a part of Captain America Franchise, rather it should have been next chapter of Avengers considering the Superheroes featured in the movie. Nonetheless the movie was an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D. It is one of the best superheroes ever made by Marvel Studios.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Hulk of the MCU, Civil War is a relentless powerhouse that entertains once the wheels start turning","The cinematic equivalent to tossing dozens of awesome comic books in a blender with a heavy budget and pouring it out into celluloid, Civil War is not only a superb sequel and improvement to the Avengers films, but just might actually become the best MCU flick yet. And yes, the movie is extremely bloated. Yes, the movie becomes a bit of a downer especially after funnier offerings like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. But once the wheels start turning and the conflict shifts into the second act you will be enthusiastically entertained up until the final scene.Civil War is honestly Avengers 2.5, but the half is only in terms of chronological order. In the third Captain America installment, the events from past Marvel offerings has the world afraid of the superheroes, and over a hundred nations want to be able to monitor and control where the Avengers goes and what they should do after an espionage mission gone wrong. This creates a rift between all the heroes, especially with Winter Soldier being a fugitive and another threat lurking within; and differing opinions on how to handle the situation. Civil War's biggest strength is the sheer amount of characters; as they bring back all the Avengers, and then threw in some new additions.Black Panther was flawless in performance, visuals, and execution. Second-billing favorites like Ant-Man, Falcon, Black Widow (who deserves her own movie) and Hawkeye make an appearance and also greatly deliver. Lastly, Spider-Man undoubtedly steals the show and he barely makes an appearance here. After 14 years of cinematic Spider-Man appearances, Marvel truly gets it right this time. Unlike what happened with Age of Ultron (entertaining yet forgettable), you will be excited for future features based off the new characters you meet within the 150 minute timeframe----especially Spider-Man. Sadly not all the Marvel personas get enough screen time, but it's part of the sacrifices made when there is such a long guest list to the motion picture party.The chemistry within the MCU is off the charts, and Civil War raises the bar even higher. What DC films are missing is this key element; mostly because we barely see any character development and consistent cast from sequel to sequel. The interactions between each of the heroes is what really allows this movie to go to the top tier of comic book mayhem, as even Bucky has his moments when involved with the others, especially (surprisingly) Falcon. The complicated relationship between Iron Man and Captain America is front and center, and both deliver spectacular performances as two guilt-ridden heroes desperately trying to avoid conflict even though all signs point to a clash.Helping Civil War maintain its bite is a strong (and rather gloomy) script and flawless direction from the Russo Brothers, who have impressed mightily since their debut with The Winter Soldier. The film honestly has it all: deep themes, lots of loss, plenty of surprises, tons of drama, tons of action, controversial decisions, and a good amount of humor to mix it all together---even though we really could have used more jokes in the first act. The action scenes range from clever to intense to downright entertaining. The Airport Battle will become a part of Marvel movie history, I promise you. The scene will be embedded in your memory if you are a fan of the comics. Then there's the incredible Bucharest Chase that's the best chase since Raid 2. At the same time, the final fight will break your heart.Painstaking amount of effort is given to not only making these characters come to life, but also making them likable and relatable. Marvel does a fantastic job picking the right staff behind the scenes, and does even better picking the actors and actresses to represent the MCU. Combine that with a proper budget and an extremely tight structure that connects all the films together and always leaves room for the upcoming sequels and you have a systematic series of films that resonates with the worldwide audience. Captain America: Civil War is now the peak result of this formula, as this is the first mega Marvel film since the original Avengers to appear to not pull any punches and maximize the content with the pieces allotted.As a comic book fan, there's no way you can walk out disappointed. And as a summer blockbuster fan, you will also have a lot of fun while simultaneously think about the events that occurred long after the final punch is thrown. Civil War is absolutely fantastic, and among the best comic book movies of all-time. DC, you need to watch this and take notes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Civil War - Marvel's one of the best movie .,"The movie was very very good and Captain America is the best trilogy of Marvel leaving first one meh . Movie is not very like comics but still it is done so great that we don't even miss comics and can be viewed by everyone and not only comic fans unlike Batman v Superman which I think it was their only mistake . Every Avenger was used perfectly except Vision but Vision has nothing to do in this . At every superhero entrance the hall cheered especially at Black Panther's and Spider- Man's. Black Panther has its moment and they are all awesome , the more you look at him the more you want from him .Tom Holland is perfect as Peter Parker and as Spider - Man by far and he definitely steals the show in Airport fight sequence and so do Ant-Man but they both have small roles in this but Anthony and Joe Russo used them perfectly and I think Avengers Infinity War movies are in good hands . The last fight is good but not that emotional as people are saying but both Captain America and Iron Man were right in last fight so you cant really pick sides on that , other than that Captain is right in this and you will get to see . The only think I don't like is that Marvel still can't get emotional even after 8 years that is the only thing I don't like with Marvel . But this is definitely one of the best Marvel movie till date . I am definitely going for second time tomorrow and everyone should also after their first time .",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"I have just returned from seeing Civil War in the theatre, and I can hands down say that it is not only the best film of 2016 so far, but it is also one of the greatest movies of the last decade. I don't want to go into spoiler territory for this review, but all I can say is that you will enter the cinema as your adult self, and leave a child. I have never been so immersed and captivated by a superhero movie like this before, I felt like my 8 year old self once again.The chemistry between Evans (Captain America) and RDJ (Iron Man) is phenomenal, and although they are both the stars of the film as it were, the best performances of the movie come from Sebastian Stan (Bucky), Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) and, much to everybody's delight, Tom Holland (Spiderman). When I first heard that Holland would be taking up the iconic role, I wasn't sure. I had grown up with Tobey Maguire as my Spiderman, and I thought that he would be irreplaceable for the rest of time. But Tom Holland knocked it out of the park, and he truly made the role his own during his short time on screen.I could go on forever about how good all of the performances were, honourable mentions must go to Daniel Bruhl (Zemo) and Paul Rudd (Ant-Man). Both of them, like Holland, exceeded my expectations. In fact, Ant-Man was dark horse of this movie, and just like Spiderman he provides some of the funniest moments of the movie. The reason I haven't rated it 10/10 is simply because there were some slightly cornier moments (e.g. although of I lover Renner's portrayal of Hawkeye, I felt as though his dialogue was ruining the intensity and the excitement of some scenes).Some may argue that there was too much action, but I thought that there was a perfect amount, the final fight scene will take your breath away. Trust me. I am so excited for both Infinity War and Spiderman: Homecoming that it is unreal. Marvel have put DC to shame with Civil War, and they should be extremely proud of themselves. I am very proud to call myself a Marvel fan after this truly incredible movie; it is a modern day masterpiece. Captain America: Civil War earns a very impressive 9/10.

one of if not the best,"One problem that Marvel will start to face is not one to be easily solved, more and more characters and egos. Sometimes it gets hard to track every character but indeed civil war does it extraordinarily in amazing 'Marvel' fashion. Characters had quite balanced screen times and input to the overall story and the action scenes of this movie is just stunning, the airport fight scene is the best movie fight scene ever which has really proved me wrong. After seeing the trailer and what little bits we got of that scene I assumed that Marvel's attempt to transfer a comic book splash page to live action looks ridiculous since there are only what 10 people charging at each other while in the comic books we get like 100 give or take 10 people. This has actually always been my concern since the movie was first announced I honestly never thought they would be able to pull off this comic book classic this early on in the development of the cinematic universe. But, am I glad that they did. I am very interested in finding out what the repercussions of this event would be on the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"Everything you want from a superhero movie, and more.","Once in a while there comes a movie that fits everything just right, it boasts lofty expectations and delivers it in every aspects, ""Civil War"" is undoubtedly such movie. With such large pool of characters and subplots, it's impressive that these larger-than-life characters are presented with great narrative and the right amount of spotlight as well as humor for all.The story revolves around Sokovia Accord, a treaty to handle Avengers as they are causing too much collateral damage on their missions. The main strong point of this movie is how it manages to gather these dozen of characters and give each of them an engaging narrative, even the newcomers. It mainly plays with the clash of Iron-Man and Captain America, but none of the other superheroes feel left out, they all find their respective place.The struggle feels approachable as the movie shifts between the heavier tone for Winter Soldier or Scarlet Witch, yet it allows space for new members to establish themselves. The addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man are refreshing, they fit like gloves to the already large cast, and Black Panther even takes on a quite large portion of the narration as he asserts his presence incredibly well.It also benefits from good twists, this time it's not an alien force or robot invasion, but a real rift between the members, a more depth than previously done. Eventually they end up in small and large skirmishes alike. There's ample choreography to enhance the fights, the ones who rely on their fists are treated with amazing intense scuffle, while the others are done with good deal of CG.The two elements work wonderfully together, shifting between them with ease and fluid transition. Each character has their own style, their signature which translates well into the humor, they trade punches and banters with equal measure. The movie has reached the balanced between cracking jokes and presenting a riveting story.""Civil War"" is everything you want from a superhero movie, and more. It's a display of excellence on all fronts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Great Responsibility,"Eight years into Marvel Studios' multi-property film franchise and its increasingly convoluted continuity, a movie as good as ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) is truly and delightfully surprising. While I doubt it could stand alone, and is guilty of a few shoe- horned cameos and more than a few plot contrivances, the second instalment from Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of the previous and similarly impressive Captain America: The Winter Solider {2014}) is a success. As an action spectacle it is above par; as a springboard for future franchise films it is reinvigorating; and as a meditation on the problem of superheroes' power and sovereignty it is the best since Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (2009). We are not likely to see critical reception that puts it in league with Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), rather condescendingly hailed by non- superhero fans as something ""more than a comic book movie"" (Roger Ebert). But ""Civil War"" is every bit as engaged with themes of authority and morality as Nolan's seminal work, and borrows much credence from the Marvel Cinematic Universe's well-established lore and cast of characters. It is as close to the true, transcendent experience of comic book fandom as we have yet to see on the big screen.Following the events of the sadly inferior ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), Steve Rogers as Captain America (Chris Evans) leads a new team of superheroes in pursuit of a minor villain leftover from ""The Winter Soldier"", only to sustain a large number of civilian casualties. It's the final straw for the governments of the world, says long-absent Marvel player General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, last seen in 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk""). Now a superhero registration act is in order, rendering all enhanced individuals legally beholden to the United Nations and impotent to act without democratic approval. Humbled by the weight of failure from previous films, Tony Stark as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is in favour of the proposal. Rogers, ruffled by his intimate experience of governmental corruption from previous films, is suspicious, but might have agreed to compromise if not for the involvement of his life-long friend turned Soviet sleeper assassin, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Staan - the aforementioned Winter Soldier). Barnes has been framed for a terrorist bombing in South Africa and Rogers is alone in defending his innocence. With the help of a mystery malefactor (Daniel Bruhl), the rift between heroes grows into civil war...The basic premise of this film was adapted from a cross-over Marvel comics event of the same name (published 2006-7), and represented a major paradigm shift in post-9/11 superhero narratives. This arose from the undeniable fact that it was becoming impossible to appreciate large-scale urban destruction without qualms, and that superheroes have always left large-scale urban destruction in their wake. It is something that has been addressed in previous films, particularly ""The Avengers"" (2012) and ""Age of Ultron"", in which writer-director Joss Whedon made a point of conflict containment and showed Rogers doing everything possible to clear the battleground of bystanders ‚Äì maybe that way we could cathartically enjoy New York's decimation again. But the Avengers are making one hell of an omelette here. ""You try to save as many people as you can,"" Rogers confesses. ""Sometimes that doesn't mean everyone"".This is Captain America's polite way of using the phrase ""collateral damage"", a theme that has wormed its way into the heart of superhero culture over the last ten years, and to great effect. That ""Civil War"" takes an issue like collateral damage so seriously is its finest quality: we have here a film that does adhere to a fairly formulaic script wherein a villain turns the heroes against each other (seen in both Avengers movies), but not one that lets the heroes off that easily. While much of the story is somewhat contrived - utilizing the classic trope of villain-as-impossibly- prescient-mastermind-who-knows-what-every-character-will-do-every- step-of-the-way - the conflict at its heart is not. It is a very real ideological difference that exists between Rogers and Stark, and not a misunderstanding used to justify a series of fight scenes. ""You're wrong, you think you're right, and that makes you dangerous,"" claims the film's most exciting cameo character. It doesn't matter who he's talking to.At the same time, the movie remains a solid melodrama, such that we feel the personal stakes which all stories require to function at an emotional level. Stark and Rogers take their sides on principle that is not abstract, but informed by personal tragedy. Bolstered by thematic ties to the story's two main antagonists, ""Civil War"" works as drama as well as dissertation. This is all especially impressive given the studio mandates which must have been weighing upon it, to consolidate the plots and characters of Marvel's eleven preceding films and set up the seven films slated for release by 2019. This is a juggling act of economic, thematic and storytelling responsibility that is rarely executed with such aplomb in the arena of Hollywood blockbusters. It will make money and please fans, an increasingly difficult double threat for superhero cinema. And while it requires a baseline of fandom to operate as a good film, it does do it. It is a story about power; it is a story about people. After all, every story is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Ultimate Marvel Movie Experience,"Everything in the MCU has been leading to the production of this masterfully made film. Marvel has yet to make a dud of a film and they seem to have been developing their style, choice in filmmakers and talent involved.All of Marvel's efforts over the first two phases of the MCU has yielded Captain America: Civil War. This movie is action packed, a political thriller, a chase film, a character piece with a human heart. Critics and public opinion dismissing the movies produced by Marvel Studios as mere 'superhero' films have either not watched enough of these movies or they need to watch this one.The cast has proved by now that they work well together as an ensemble and the main trio at the heart of the story Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr and Sebastian Stan deliver human, vulnerable and heartbreaking performances.Superhero comic books and as a consequence their films have since their inception been adapting and mirroring real life issues and struggles of the real world at the period of their issue. This film is no exception. Dealing with themes such as power, loss, family, friendship and forming basic human connections. The movie marks the strongest addition to the Marvel slate and beyond initial enthusiasm may rank as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, if not the greatest.Character development has not suffered at the expense of the presence of the variety of superheroes sharing the screen. The story is well crafted and the ideology spurring the civil war convincing.The new additions to the cast, the long awaited younger version of Spiderman and the ever intriguing Black Panther of Wakanda have worked well within the storyline and provided each of the aforementioned superheroes with a very satisfying origin story to make the transition to their own feature length films smoother.An absolute achievement from the Russo brothers with the only desire left being at least a mild reference to the TV Show world which would undoubtedly be influenced by the events in the film.

This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did!,"'CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in Marvel Studios' 'CAPTAIN America' film franchise. The sequel also features many other superhero characters from the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' (especially the 'AVENGERS' films), and the story deals with Captain America taking on Iron Man; in order to protect his friend Bucky Barnes. The movie stars Chris Evans (reprising the title role) and it costars Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man), Sebastian Stan (as Bucky, AKA The Winter Soldier), Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Bruhl, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Emily Van Camp, William Hurt, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Marisa Tomei and Martin Freeman. The film also introduces the classic comic book characters Spider-Man and Black Panther (Holland and Boseman), in their Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film debuts. Anthony and Joe Russo returned to direct the movie (they also helmed 'CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER') and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returned to write the script (they also wrote 'WINTER SOLDIER' and co-wrote 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD'). It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's (of course) a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well.Due to the large number of civilian deaths, as a result of The Avengers' battles with various super-villains (over the years), the United Nations wants to form an international governing body, to control the superheroes' actions. Captain America (Evans) is against it, since he thinks they have better judgment than corrupt government officials, whereas Iron Man (Downey Jr.) supports the supervision (due to guilt over creating Ultron, and other tragedies he's responsible for). Other Avengers divide in the conflict, forming two different factions. At the same time Bucky Barnes (Stan) is framed for a bombing in Vienna (which kills a Wakanda King). Captain America wants to protect his friend, while government officials want to kill him. A civil war between the superheroes erupts.This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did (one of my other favorite movies this year); it's very dark, dramatic and full of rich character development (all things 'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON' got wrong). The plot is involving and the action actually serves the story; rather than vice versa! The action scenes are also really cleverly done, and exciting; something increasingly hard to pull off, in modern blockbusters. Downey Jr. actually gives a really good performance again (and he doesn't deliver any horrible jokes, for a change). It's also interesting to see his character as the antagonist; I know he was more of a villain in the comic book, but I think it was smarter for the filmmakers to make the drama (in the film) more nuanced. The movie's politics are also timely and complex. It's just a grade A film all around; I think it's my second favorite Marvel Studios film (after 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY'). It's one flaw is that they got Spider- Man wrong though; they made some major changes to the source material, that any fan should be mad about. I think his character is the worst of the three movie adaptations (and he deserves his own freaking movie to debut in, he's not second banana to 'THE AVENGERS')! Overall the film is fantastic though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Characters we've seen bonding over several movies, been through almost 326 apocalypses and were ready to die for each other 47 times suddenly hate each other. Why? Because politicians divide them. Or something, I'm still not quite sure.Then popcorn time starts. Special effects splatter the screen in a fantastic manner, the colors in this movie are simply awesome. We gaze at superheroes clashing it out and it simply looks extremely good. Black Panther does some awesome stuff, some talking, more fighting. Fighting. Fighting. And eventually it ends. The movie is 3,5 hours, but feels a solid 5.If you forget the story (which is easily done) this is a visually stunning movie. Too bad that's all it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun superhero action adventure goes out with a bang,"It's that time of the year again when the theaters flood with the mega-budget summer blockbusters that scale the mountain at the box office, and Marvel superhero flicks are no strangers to this. After the successful but disappointment of DC's 'Batman Vs Superman' early this spring, many fans were hoping to see a comeback in the superhero genre, this third installment of the highly successful Captain America franchise pays off not only defying expectations but even improving upon its predecessor. With Joe and Anthony Russo turning to the directors' chairs, this superhero action flick sees Chris Evans reprising the role of the titular character along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie as Falcon, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as Vision. Taking the place after the events of 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron', the team has fallen under massive political scrutiny by the government for all the damage resulted in their battles against the threats. In response, the government passes a bill that puts limits on the superheroes actions requiring them to work under government surveillance. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and the team agree with bill and sign it, Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the other hand disapproves of it and chooses to go outside the law. When Steve Rogers refuses to turn in Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) who is wanted by the government, this leads an all-out conflict between the team. Newcomers joining the cast include Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther.The film bears strong similarities to Batman Vs Superman in terms of plot as deals with the tension between two heroes, only Civil War manages to execute the plot more effectively and cohesive. As the plot sets in, the heroes come face-to-face with government officials who give an disheartening inside look of all the damage caused by their actions and the lives lost in result of the battles. In many superhero flicks, mass destruction of a city has become a gimmick in the genre. But the first time in the genre, this gimmick is actually acknowledged by our heroes who grow genuine sympathy for the damage that costs. From there on, the story dives deep into the politics of managing the team and the debate that ensues when Captain America develops a cold shoulder against the government's decisions and the team's agreement. In the end, whether you agree with the government's plan to impose the limit on the superheros' action or Captain America's disapproval for the plan becomes the question. Thanks to our brilliant writers, the story does a great job at balancing the dispute between the heroes and the inference of the political actions to the point where many will find it easy to see both sides of the argument. Furthermore, the film strives some incredible, prolonged action sequences while leaving enough room to flesh out most of the characters. The humanity in the characters is put on the spot, and made to be believable. Yes, this film is a bit crowded in its roster of characters but with it's smart screenplay it manages to work.When comes a superhero actioner comes some of exciting, pulse-pounding action sequences sparkled with not only tense special effects and CGI but powerfully choreographed stunt work. As viewers come expectations, the action scenes are fun to play watch, and serve as the biggest eye-catchers. And no one should the forget the incredible special effects or even the outstanding fight choreography featured in a scene with Black Widow in one scene at the beginning. No one can argue the stunt doubles' amazing talent in some of the fight scenes. Arguably the best scene in the film takes place at an airport where all our heroes engage in an all-out battle filled outstanding FX and some hilarious dialogue thrown out by the characters, particularly Spider-Man who is given much more comedic portrayal than in the previous Spiderman entries. The actors are quite clever in their roles as ever, and do almost nothing to disappoint. Tom Holland is surprisingly good as Spider-Man considering the roles in his last filmography. Whether his portrayal is better than Andrew Garfield's or Tobey Maguire's is debatable. Nonetheless, he nails it.Captain America: Civil War is a fun and outstanding start to this summer of big-budget blockbusters, and another astounding achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is destined to reach massive numbers at the box office, even by those who may not be grown fans of the Marvel superheroes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Captain America: Civil War"" is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","Marvel sure has things figured out (which is a statement likely made in recent years by many a Movie Fan ‚Äì and the folks at DC ‚Äì with a few expletives thrown in for emphasis)! If there were any lingering doubt, it has certainly been erased by ""Captain America: Civil War"" (PG-13, 2:26). While the DC Extended Universe has had moderate success with their early films featuring and bringing together their stable of comic book characters, the Marvel Cinematic Universe began Phase Three of its grand plan with ""Civil War"" (the 13th MCU movie) and is making money almost faster than the government can print it. While the first two ""Avengers"" movies sit comfortably in the top 10 on the list of all-time box office champs worldwide, DC's ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" doesn't even make the top 40. ""Civil War"" made over $250 million worldwide before its first full day in U.S. theaters ‚Äì and even before opening in huge countries like China and India! The film's opening week receipts in several countries is second all-time only to ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", and its trailer is second only to ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" in online views. But¬Ö does this Captain America film deserve such attention and success? ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third (and planned to be the final) Captain America feature, but also feels a lot like a third Avenger's movie, with its many characters ‚Äì and its plot, which continues story lines from the most recent installment of each of those film series. This film picks up about a year after the Avengers defeated a populicidal sentient computer program which Tony Stark accidentally unleashed in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are in Lagos, Nigeria trying to stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing and making off with a dangerous biological weapon. In the ensuing melee, one of the Avengers, trying to save the life of one of the others, accidentally causes the deaths of several foreign aid workers.After all the death and destruction inadvertently caused the last time that the Avengers were out saving the world (from Ultron), Lagos proves to be the proverbial last straw for worried world leaders, and their planned remedy bitterly divides the Avengers. The U.S. Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), presents the group with an ultimatum ‚Äì sign the newly-negotiated ""Sokovia Accords"", putting the Avengers under the control of the United Nations ‚Äì or retire. As they discuss their options, this disparate group of superheroes quickly divides into opposing camps. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) speaks for Lieutenant Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and others who believe they should submit themselves to this international oversight. Cap speaks for Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and those who believe that they can only effectively protect people when they can operate unfettered. So, the battle lines are drawn.Almost 200 nations (and some of the Avengers) sign the agreement, but it's quickly put to the test when a bombing compels some of the Avengers to act. The accused terrorist is none other than Cap's old (very old) friend, Bucky Barnes, aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Cap wants to bring Bucky in safely before any of Bucky's trigger-happy pursuers catch up to him. Cap gets just enough help to accomplish his goal, but it turns out that Bucky is merely a pawn in a much larger game run by Baron Zemo (Daniel Br√ºhl). As the plot unfolds, the Avengers duke it out with both old friends and new ones joining the fray.""Captain America: Civil War"" is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has plenty of high-stakes, globe-trotting, hero-on-hero action, and it also has a lot of heart. If you think back to the first individual MCU films with Iron Man and Captain America, it may seem counterintuitive for Stark to support restrictions on the Avengers while Cap refuses to ""be a good soldier"" and get with the program, but we see that each of them have very clear and very personal motivations for taking the positions that they take. The same is true for the other frenemy combatants, some of which elicited cheers from the audience when they first appeared on screen. Of course, if you paid attention to the film's ubiquitous trailers and/or took a good look at its posters, you know which Avengers are present, which are missing and which are new, but just in case you don't know¬Ö I won't spoil it. All I'll say is that Marvel has cast and established all of these characters exceptionally well.The action, acting and directing are all top notch, but this film's main strength is its smart script. The characters' personalities, powers and previous activities are remarkably consistent in their presentation and are seamlessly blended in a big, but simple story which makes sense and gives each character his or her due. The dialog is a great combination of insightful, fun and funny. The movie seems to borrow from the ""Bourne"" movies, certain revenge flicks, and ""Escape Plan"", while the story is similar to DC's 2016 hero-against-hero film ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"", but ""Captain America: Civil War"" does it better and has a dynamic and tone all its own. It'll entertain fanboys and average Movie Fans alike.

"Words can't describe my love for this film so, in one word, just like Spider-Man: Amazing!","8 years ago, some of the greatest characters in comic history had a whole new world opened up to them thanks to 2008's Iron Man. Nobody thought the film would have the impact it did, including me. Now we are in 2016 and we have reached Captain America: Civil War. It boasts the most characters in a Marvel film, the best film in the entire Marvel franchise and also the greatest action scene in any superhero movie ever, but we will get onto that later.So the film serves as not only a new Avengers story but also a solid sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It would be easy to make a film with so many characters sideline the Captain America story, but this film really is at it's core a Captain America film. Sure there is a lot to cram in but it is done so well and fits in so well as part of a trilogy. I saw this film as a midnight screening and saw it along with the other two films beforehand. It really is a good idea to watch both Captain America films before and notice the detail put in to incorporate these stories. Cap is my all time favourite Avenger and seeing the development all three of these films has give him really is amazing.The basic plot without spoilers involves the Avengers causing a huge disaster on a mission in Lagos which results in the government devising the Sokovia accords which they must sign in order to operate under them. Tony Stark feels guilty about the casualties and destruction but Steve Rogers wants to keep operating freely and saving the world. This results in a divide between them and the other Avengers are forced to decide who's side they are on. Whilst this is happening Cap and Falcon are still on the hunt for Bucky Barnes which does play in to the start of the Civil War but i will leave it at that. So already there is a lot going on and we also get the introduction of Spider-Man and Black Panther as well as Daniel Brul as villain Baron Zemo. It would be easy to make this film a complete mess like Batman v Superman but it was not. It is hard not to compare the films because they are quite similar, involving destruction etc. But this film does it so much better.The airport scene in this film where the two teams fight for the first time is perfect. Tom Holland's introduction as Spider-Man happens just before this and his personality even when fighting is perfectly nailed. Black Panther also feels the same way, just the way these characters are on the big screen is a dream come true. Seeing Ant Man (who is awesome by the way) interact with Vision and Spiderman interact with Ant Man and Black Panther interact with Captain America etc. It is perfect. I also have seen the film and still don't know which side i am on. You want to be with both Steve and Tony on this because they are both right and have valid points. But seeing the personalities of every character clash and play in to every scene they are in is just brilliant. The villain of the film, Zemo, is average at best though which is the only small gripe. Crossbones as well barely has any screen time, but Zemo's plan almost seems like something that the teams could have fought over themselves.At 2 hours 20 mins there is a lot to cram in but in the end as a Marvel film this one is the best by far. It is emotional, hilarious and most importantly awesome. I cannot recommend the film enough. I have seen it twice already and that won't be the last time. Films don't get much better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvellous,"The most awaited films of the year brings a big broad smile on the MCU fans. Directed by ANTHONY RUSSO & JOE RUSSO a.k.a. RUSSO BROTHERS presents a beautifully crafted film with all the action, emotional, and drama. Obviously the film doesn't have a bulk of superheroes alike actual comic but believe me it has everything you expect from the film. The core story of rivalries between team cap and team iron man is breathtaking. Addition of new charming characters such as black panther and spider-man gives a great upgrade to avengers. Costumes - Perfect Action Sequences - Fascinating Story - Impressive. Tom Holland as spider-man is the exact spider-man we need - Young, Strong and Blabber mouth. Chadwick Bosemen - You sir deserve a medal for your performance. As per me villains weren't given enough part, could use Zemo and Crossbones in better way.

"Good narrative base, which produces good action but doesn't have the heft it suggests it wants","I was not overly taken with the previous Avengers film, but I have enjoyed the Captain America series ‚Äì although, being honest, if I watched them unaware of the title, I would not be able to tell one over the other with much success. This one in particular feels like an ensemble piece (as they all do) although the return of the Winter Soldier and the focus on Captain America does make it fit. The plot as themes of vigilantism, of revenge, of anger, all of which spin around each other with an air that suggests the film is trying to blur moral lines between the characters.In theory it does this reasonably well ‚Äì or at least to describe it out loud it sounds like it must work. In the film though it doesn't seem to push for this aspect so much as just use it. So the film is driven by this, and all the characters have equal validity and tragedy to their motivations; however this is not the same as it being done with a lot of brain and heart. In this regard it doesn't deliver, although it does provide a more interesting base than the usual 'global threat from beyond' that some of the other films have had. On this it builds good action; for sure they are often large and with plenty going on, but many have good fluidity of movement and dramatic delivery ‚Äì the action has some weight to it, rather than feeling like watching someone play a video game.The performances are all well-judged, with good mix of humor and dramatic presence. For sure it is not a film where the actors will bother the awards season too much, but they sell their characters and their threads well. There are perhaps too many characters for them to really do them all justice (Spiderman for instance feels rushed into the film, and more about making another film I think); by contrast a cameo for Antman was enjoyable. Mostly the focus is kept reasonably tight on the main few, and the new characters generally add to the themes (Black Panther).It isn't brilliant but it is an enjoyable blockbuster with an interesting narrative base, enjoyable plotting, and action which does more than just wiggle its CGI in your face.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Up for the title of ""Greatest Comic Book Movie Of All Time""","This movie gave me everything I wanted and more. It contains the greatest action fight scene in any superhero movie without a doubt (Airport scene). All the heroes had a time to shine, with Spiderman, Antman, and Black Panther stealing the show in my opinion. The plot was complex and deep, with Zemo being a pretty good villain, despite not being anything like his comic counterpart. The comedy hit hard when it needed to, but this movie contains the most heart and deep conflict compared to any MCU movie. The acting was phenomenal from the spectacular cast. Chadwick Boseman played an amazing Black Panther, but it was Tom Holland aka THE GREATEST SPIDERMAN OF ALL TIME that took my breath away with his performance. This was the film we had all been waiting for and it exceeded my expectations, becoming my favorite comic book movie of all time, which previously was the Winter Soldier and the Dark Knight. I give all the props to the Russo brothers and completely trust them for Infinity War.I give this movie a 10/10 and I can't wait to watch it a couple more times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel fails where it lacks experience: behaving as adults,"Marvel has had no problem bringing in wacky heroes and making them feel real, yet when they need to behave like actual people, it all fizzles. Civil War depicts so many characters that it is difficult to bring in a believable villain or to develop any of them, especially with the mandatory action scenes thrown in. In the end you have a two hour and a half mess that shows grown men and women rather punch their way than talk about a common goal.That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, just average and somewhat disappointing. While introducing Zemo, Black Panther and bringing in Spider-Man and Ant-Man, the movie feels more like one of those Mortal Kombat games than a real story. I wanted to shed tears, to understand and empathize with deep character feelings. Instead I got CGI robots fighting CGI captains.Bottom line: more a stepping stone for the MCU than a movie with its own story and soul, it is marginally entertaining, but ultimately teaching nothing and bringing nothing new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Cap deserves his own movie, not Avengers 3","I will say this, ""Civil War"" is certainly a step up from ""Ultron"". It's still the same sort of bloated showroom floor for next year's big Marvel movies, and I never liked the central warring factions plot line, but it does at least have more enjoyable bells and whistles. I wasn't expecting to like the big fight at the airport. It's a noisy mess, but it's also where the movie seems to come to life, with Ant Man and Spider-Man especially. Their humor is what makes this tick, and the sad part is that it's so short-lived. It's the little things like this that get lost in the big showdowns and Marvel movie infrastructure.But the Civil War idea is so damn stupid, and really only exists to thoroughly divide our heroes along ideological lines. I dunno, Stark just seems too insubordinate to fall in with the UN, and his motivations (not to mention the big reveal about is SPOILERS) just seem unbelievably contrived.That said, it does end pretty well, an unlikely ray of hope manages to break through. But the question of where these characters go from here is left a mystery.

Should have been named Captain America : Little Dispute,"The movie was decent. It was too funny. It shouldn't have been. Too many jokes during the fight distracted me the hell out the movie. Cheesy and lame jokes. This movie is so overrated. It deserves 5/10 at the least, but for me its a 1/10. There many similarities between BvS and Civil War. Everybody acted nicely, the pacing was decent too. The introduction of Spiderman was rushed and felt badly written. There are many continuity errors in certain scene. The actual 'Civil War' battle was too short. Like 6-7 minutes of the fight. The story is really boring with some action scenes added to it. The action scenes were bad. It had too many cuts. Lots of cuts for an action scene, it felt weird. And so much shaky cams. Couldn't see what was happening. Then there is another movie that was released few weeks ago named BvS which was so much better than this. This is one of the many disasters of Marvel.

I never thought Marvel Studios could set the bar this high.,"I never thought Marvel Studios could set the bar this high. Captain America Civil War is a total package. Entertaining, action- packed, humorous and an emotional ride. It's just a bonus if you've invested your time starting from the first Iron Man up to now to get attached to the characters, but it's not necessary.The airport battle royal between our favorite super heroes is the crowning moment of the film. The action sequences in that particular scene, plus the surprises, is one of the best I've seen in a comic book movie. Although every action sequence throughout the movie is nearly on par, if not on the same level. It's just that seeing a lot of characters going at each other is much more enjoyable.Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man were also highlights of the film, but everyone did an amazing job and had their deserved screen time. Some will definitely disagree with me on this one but as for Zemo, his role manipulating and working behind the scenes worked for me.For others saying this is Avengers 2.5, I didn't feel that way. I still felt this was a true sequel to Captain America The Winter Soldier (only partly, AoU). The conflicting ideologies of our two main heroes is still the focus of the whole movie and everything was balanced perfectly.To sum it up, this is arguably Marvel's best movie to date, and one of the best CBMs of all time. I can't wait for the solo outing of Black Panther and Spider-Man, and how the world of the MCU progresses from here.P.S.

"Fun, movie but not as great as people are making it seem","I'm not bias. I like DC and Marvel. I honestly like BVS better than this movie, and thought Winter Soldier was way better too. This movie felt so lazy honestly. I think people are just obsessed with Marvel, and their cheesy/corny one liners in every scene. The villain in this movie sucks, and it's all about making them split up or whatever his goal is, due to his loss. I watch every superhero movie, regardless if it's DC or Marvel, and like I said BvS is way better than this movie, and had me more interested in the story and plot. Winter Soldier had the same effect on me. I think the majority of obsessed Marvel fans are just liking this movie because it's Marvel and the characters, but if you take the time to look deep in the movie, you will notice at the very end, what the heck was the point of all this. Black Panther was the only character I was interested in seeing, and he barely got any screen action. The movie should have been called Team Iron Man or Team Cap. A. Some of the fight scenes also look so cartoonish, I don't know what that was about. The conflict between all of them seems very stupid to me, since there has been all sort of cities destruction, and killing in every movie, and now they want to address the same bs again in this one, by showing what someone can do when they take someone they love from them due to war.Other than that, if you're just looking for the same ol' Marvel cheesy/corny one liners, and action go see it.

The the best superhero movie that is the most mature out of all the marvel films,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is an action/adventure movie directed by the Russo brothers and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, and Paul Rudd. The Story centers the Avengers whose worlds are turned upside down when a Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.This Movie is not only the best Marvel movie ever, but it is also the best Superhero movie ever made. It's very thought-provoking, emotional, action-packed, and very Mature. right off the bat you get the impression that this movie is going to be a very serious film with dark images, and very shocking scenes in terms of an emotional drama. this movie throws an argument in the story that is very relevant to the plot and crucial to not only this movie but to past marvel films as well. it isn't very one sided and you do see both sides of the argument coming from both Captain America and Iron Man. that is only a piece to the brilliant movie that has a very realistic and gritty tone.Visually it's spectacular. the CGI does very well at blending two things together and making the fight scenes more believable. Speaking of fight scenes, The action segments in the movie are amazing to look at especially the airport fight scene which is filled with moments of awesomeness.The characters are very well developed here just as they were in the comics. Two characters that steal the entire show are Black Panther and Spider-Man. Black panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) does a very great job at playing a character that feels like he lost everything and is looking for vengeance. he did a great job and will probably get awarded someday for such a talent. the real winner is Tom Holland as The Amazing Spider-Man. He shines in this role and not only brings something new to the character but he brings plenty of old and nostalgic parts to his character as well, such as the costume. the actor did a great job at portraying a teen which is what Peter Parker is supposed to be. The rest of the Avengers all have a moment to shine especially Scarlett Witch (who is much better developed here than in Avengers: Age of Ultron). Iron Man and Captain America are very well developed and directed when the emotional moments kick into high- gear. The villain, while very relate-able is pretty forgettable.Overall this movie is amazing and is very incredible. I highly recommend it if you want to watch a great film. Watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: Civil War - Movie Review,"Even friends can be your biggest enemies.Captain America: Civil War is behind ""Iron Man"", ""Winter Soldier"", and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" of being the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Or MCU for short). The movie has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. I don't know about you, but the Captain America series are the only movies in the MCU that actually get better with it's squeals. The action, the effect's, the humor, the characters, and it's stunt work has improved from the first movie.What this movie dose so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes Sony studios look lousy. He was excellent in the role and I would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than Maguire and Garfield (In my opinion). I can't wait to see more of him in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" that's out next year.Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was pretty damn awesome as Black Panther. Boseman can basically play anything and I'm not kidding you when I say that, as he played Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and now Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman has some crazy talent and him as Black Panther was spot on casting. I'm looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018.If you thought the stunt work in ""Winter Soldier"" was outstanding, then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie, as it was just....INCREDIBLE! All the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for this for doing the impossible.Now for the problems: Daniel Br√ºhl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was pretty forgettable. That came across a bit too harsh didn't it? It really sucks for me to say that, because Daniel Br√ºhl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie that's either good or bad. He wasn't awful or anything like that, it's just that I didn't find him treating at all.Martin Freeman is a great actor and I'm glad he's getting more meaty roles, but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes, I know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie. At times the movie itself completely forgets about him, so every time he popped back up on screen I was like ""Oh, Martin Freeman is in this movie, I totally forgot about that"". But that's just me.The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to- hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.Overall: ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on it's own. Marvel is having a great track record thus far- with the box office success, great reviews, and many upcoming spin offs. Civil War is most likely going to win every fan boys heart and it's not hard to see why.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Captain America: Civil ÕèWaÕèr is the first Marvel superhero film of 2016 (second if you count Deadpool). Last year, I said that Avengers: Age of Ultron was the darkest and best Marvel film so far, however, after seeing Civil War, I think we have a new contender. It represents a dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.After the Avengers fail to stop a terrorist plot in Nigeria, a superhero regulation act is set up by the United Nations that restricts the heroes from taking matters into their own hands. The team is divided over whether or not they should go along with this act or protest its restrictions. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is strongly against it while Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) strongly supports it. This causes a major rift in the team and could possibly bring an end to the Avengers initiative altogether.So far, this is the darkest, most emotional and best acted film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I feel that it covered a lot more ground than Avengers: Age of UItron and gave the heroes a more solid reason to fight one another, unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Despite its darker tone, there were still some hilarious scenes of comic relief throughout the film, mainly from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. The new heroes were all great as well; Chadwick Boseman was bad-ass as T'Challa/Black Panther and newcomer Tom Holland was youthful and witty as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.I rate it 8.5/10. Just like with most other Marvel films, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
SuperHero Movie with Heart,"I like the what the makers of the Marvel movies have done with the Captain America series. ¬†While most of the other movies in the ""Marvel Universe"" are big, expansive, special effects driven explosion- fests, the Captain America movies have been a bit more character-driven. ¬†Make no mistake, there is still plenty of special effects and explosions, but these movies takes their time to delve into characters and this is what sets them apart.Such is the case with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. ¬†This could easily have been called AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR for it follows a rift in the Avengers over the freedom to do what they need to do as they see fit with no oversight. ¬†And while the movie inevitably leads to a battle between the two factions, as big a part of this film is the human cost of these battles and the internal battles some of these heroes wage over the cost of keeping the planet safe.And, for the most part, this film succeeds in telling both tales - the smaller ""personal"" film wrapped inside a big, special-effects laden summer blockbuster.At the core of this film is the conflict between Chris Evans' Captain America and Robert Downey, Jr's. Iron Man. ¬†Consequently, this film will fail or succeed on the performance of these performers and the tone that they need to set. ¬†Fortunately for us, both Evans and Downey know these characters and the tone very well so it was like watching two veteran boxers duking it out in the ring. ¬†It was fun to see them put back on the costumes and go at it.It was also VERY fun to see almost the entire gang back on screen, if it is on opposite sides. ¬†Black Widow (Scarlett Johannsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackey), War Machine (Don Cheadle) Vision (Paul Bettany) and even Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are all back at it. ¬†They are ably joined by newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spiderman (Tom Holland) and the scenes where all of these are together was liking watching a great jam when the band got back together. ¬†There is going to be standalone Black Panther, Black Widow and Spiderman films and I am looking forward to each of them. ¬†Of course, I'd be up for a Hawkeye stand alone film, so I guess that makes me a fan.Is it a perfect movie? ¬†Well...no.The plot, as is often the case in these types of films, is paperthin. ¬†The franchise, rightfully, takes Thor and Hulk out of the picture (they will be together in the next THOR movie) for if either of those characters were around (especially THOR), then you would have a strong 3rd party to break the tie.But they aren't and the Civil War raged on. ¬†I liked that there were consequences to the actions (one SuperHero ends up with life changing injuries) and the central dispute remains somewhat unresolved at the end. ¬†It would have felt false for it to be tied up in one nice, neat bow.I do have a few quibbles. ¬†William Hurt's Secretary of State is too heavily written and acted and the first hour (of this 2 1/2 hour epic) drags in spot. ¬†But in the end, the movie does it's¬†¬†job and is very entertaining with parts action, parts human emotions and parts FUN (hear that BATMAN vs. SUPERMAN?) and that makes it well worth seeing, if you like these sorts of film.And, I do.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Action Packed, Exciting and Visually Stunning,","Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. Just one year after Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel manage to deliver another movie that is just as big and just as bold. As we see the Avengers split sides, no one is an antagonist, we get to see both sides and determine who we think is right for ourselves, but neither are portrayed as villains, you can understand both, which I really liked, it was well written politics.The only thing I felt the film was lacking in was suspense. The last twenty minutes are very intense and somewhat traumatic, and I wish there were more moments like that. Though I love Marvel's sense of humour, there were certain scenes that I felt should have been handled in a more serious manner. I also found the Vision and Scarlet Witch underused, they are introduced in Ultron and I was looking forward to seeing them in action even more. However, their unique powers are never properly showcased, although they clearly have plans for them for future films, which is exciting.The cast shines, delivering the goods as always. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. face off after much friction since the first Avengers, their chemistry as foes is irresistible, its very personal, like two brothers fighting. They are joined by long time members Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie, recent additions Sebastian Stan, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and newcomers Paul Rudd, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland, all shining in their roles. There may be a lot of characters and a lot to get out of the way, such as the main story and setting up future movies, but the film never manages to feel overstuffed, all thanks to the talented Russo Brothers, who will hopefully do just as well with the Infinity War. All characters have an established arch.Action packed, funny, engaging, filled with likeable characters and a fast paced story, Captain America: Civil War is one of the must see movies this summer, I would recommend it to Marvel fans and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.Captain America and Iron Man end up splitting sides between the Avengers after a superhero initiative comes in, putting all superheroes in control of the government.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a thrilling treat for ALL film fans!,"This movie is honestly as good as any adventure film that I've ever seen. This isn't just a treat for Marvel fans or comic book fans, this is a treat for ALL film fans.I'm glad to see the response to Captain America Civil War has been very positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Sure Cap stays close to the spirit of its root origins but the fact that people are judging it as a film first is great to see. Whatever the reason, it seems everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. Visually it is a sight to behold and that goes for the special effects but also for the cinematography and grit of the film itself. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on action or the developmental down time.Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best friend or foe marvel movie ever,"I was so excited to see civil war ever since I saw the trailer. At first when I saw the trailer, I thought it was just captain trying to protect The winter soldier,but a lot more came than unexpected and I was very impressed. When I saw the trailer,I thought it was just explaining that captain is a dangerous man and that he should surrender to the government and that he finds Buck and then,out of nowhere,Iron man comes along,but he is involved with the government and he tries to turn both of them in. Then I saw the end of the trailer and my god cap and buck against iron man. When I saw that I was like I thought they were friends and now they're ganging up against him. That last part was intense. Now that was the trailer. When I saw the movie,it was explaining that the avengers are dangerous and that they should surrender to the government,but cap and a few of his friends didn't agree. Those who didn't agree went against iron man and his team. And the rest contains spoilers but when I saw it I was thrilled when isaw new avenger members such as spiderman antman and black panther. What an amazing movie and number 1 of marvel forever",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Disassemble,"Now at the start of ""Phase 3"" Marvel has decided to open it up with one of its biggest films yet, putting together almost its entire roster of heroes in to one movie and taking on one of the biggest game changing conflicts within the entire history of Marvel. Whilst the film is at times clustered, the Russo brothers successfully create a blockbuster driven by a very personal conflict whilst still delivering some of the greatest action sequences of the franchise so far.After a mission goes wrong and several civilians end up being killed, a proposal is put forward to place the Avengers and all its heroes under government control which divides the Avengers in to two factions. On the one side is Captain America (Chris Evans), who after the events of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is distrusting of government interference and believes the Avengers are most effective working independently. On the other side Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who after feeling responsible for destruction caused by Ultron believes that even the Avengers need to be kept in check. But during all this a villain named Zemo (Daneil Br√ºhl, playing another Marvel villain who could have been very interesting but unfortunately goes completely underdeveloped throughout the film) hatches a plan involving Cap's former friend Bucky (AKA Winter Soldier) to further this divide between the Avengers.This causes all the Marvel heroes to choose their respective sides, with each having their own personal motives and reasons for who they side with, all colliding against one another in an all-out brawl. To the films credit, the inclusion of all these superheroes never detracts from the core conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, with their emotional conflict always remaining the centrepiece of the film. But at the same time, every cast member gets their own moment in the spotlight. Whether you want to see scenes exploring the relationships between characters like Captain America and Black Widow further explored or just fun moments like seeing Ant-man being shot off one of Hawkeye's arrows, this film will have something for any fan of the Marvel Universe to enjoy.Although out of the films massive cast the biggest standout of the film is Tom Holland as Spiderman. Whilst he only has around 10-15 minutes screen time, Tom Holland has the potential to be the best Spiderman yet. He's able to pull off both the awkward but charming Peter Parker and the fun quick witted web swinger better than either Maguire or Garfield were ever able to. Plus Holland works incredibly well off all the other heroes, particularly with Robert Downey Jr. as he and Holland appear to share a very natural chemistry with one another. The only drawback of Spiderman in the film is that at times the CGI appears very unnatural, looking a lot more like a video game character than he does an actual person. Nonetheless it was a great re-introduction to the character, without relying on the already familiar origin story, to be another great addition to the MCU.However just like too many superhero movies lately, by having so many different characters to juggle the movie does feel clustered at times, with some plot lines not getting the attention that they deserved and being incredibly underdeveloped. Probably the worse effect of this is the Black Panther's origin story. It's an interesting story about honour and revenge which on its own would have been enough to fill an entire film, but doesn't get the time it needs here and thus his origin story ends up feeling wasted. It's a shame too since it's the first time the characters been introduced in any film and it could have been a great backstory if the film had the opportunity to properly develop it. Plus Chadwick Bosman gives a great performance in the short time that he's actually given a chance to. Hopefully his standalone film should give a better opportunity to give the character the attention he deserves.Whilst there are a few problems with some of the films action sequences, with some scenes suffering from the overuse of fast paced editing techniques, for the most part the fight scenes have the same exciting tone and focus on practical effects that the Russo brothers demonstrated in Captain America: Winter Soldier. However the one scene in the film is the airport sequence, which sees both sides of the conflict and all the heroes collide together in an all-out brawl. I won't say anything specific about what happens in the fight, since it does have a lot of great surprises that shouldn't be spoiled, but it does just about everything that you'd want to see from these characters fighting and is probably one of the crowning achievements of the MCU so far. The only downside is that this scene is so incredible that afterwards the rest of the film ends up feeling fairly underwhelming in comparison.Also the film does shy away from some of the darker aspects of the original Civil War storyline from the comics and the movie doesn't do anything that we haven't seen from other Marvel movies before. Whilst the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man is interesting, the snappy back and forth between both sides whilst fun and enjoyable leads the clear impression that neither side will be willing to take the fight too far, thus reducing the stakes of the film.Saying this, Captain America: Civil War does just about everything that audiences expect from and want from the MCU. It's funny, it's exciting and it continues to explore the characters that have remained at the core of the Marvel Universe since its inception. On top of this the Russo brothers have once again proved themselves ready for the task of taking on the next Avengers movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As Good As It Gets,"Saw an advanced screening last night and what a treat it was! Once again the writers for Marvel do it right. The Avengers was done so well and then Age of Ultron was a bit bogged down trying to squeeze characters in but Marvel learned from it and wrote a fantastic film that was able to include so many old and new characters but didn't give that ""crowded"" vibe.My favorite scene has to be the scene that is teased in the trailer were our heroes are split into two factions and are forced to come to blows. You had fun banter between the characters and of course cool fight scenes, my only noticeable omission in this scene was the lack of Vision activity. For being as powerful as he is he doesn't really do much of anything positive during the battle.The final scene between Iron Man, Cap and Bucky (which again is teased in the trailer) is such an emotional roller coaster cause at that point you had decided which side you were on BUT a plot twist puts you all out of whack and you just see three characters you genuinely like having to fight each other, but it was another well choreographed scene and very cool!Do yourself a favor, be sure and watch Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron as a refresher before going and you'll love it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A great movie, which annoyed the hell out of me","Many may consider this the best Marvel movie to date, and I can see why. It does a good job of adding an additional layer of depth to the current avengers, as well as introducing a few new ones. It also does a good job of capturing some of the political mess which a group such as the Avengers might cause.Still, I can't help finding myself annoyed with how some of the main characters are portrayed. Tony Stark, who I would label as a narcissistic anti-authoritarian, is suddenly portrayed as quite easily collared. Still slightly narcissistic, but still, it doesn't fit him. Sure, this is a Captian America flick - not 'The Glorious return of the Wonderous Tony Stark', so a few oddities about the other Avengers are to be expected. But still. These oddities are enough to have me annoyed through what could and should have been an amazing film.And, come on, Tony Stark is way cooler than Captain America. They should have made it about him. Really.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not really a Civil War, but a great Superhero-Fight nonetheless!","By a civil war, I understand a brutal conflict between several parties in an urban surrounding over a longer period of time, and this was rather a street fight between a bunch of superhero-friends, who once confronted with the political and moral consequences of their actions, realized that they disagree on certain basic issues and therefore argued it out using their fists and abilities, which was so much fun to watch that I will condone the misleading tag-line.Especially for a martial arts fan like me, the fantastically choreographed fist fights were the highlight of the movie and the reason why I would like to watch it again on Blu Ray as I found that the 3D technology wasn't developed enough to capture the fast velocity of their movements making them appear slightly jittery. The action scenes were really amazing and didn't seem overlong or bloated.What I liked about the story is that although it dealt with a lot of characters who all by themselves aspired to be in the spotlight as most of them would ultimately get their own movies like Black Panther for instance, it nevertheless kept a very good balance and followed a clear central theme so that it never felt over-fraught with unnecessary sidelines or was embarrassingly chaotic like ""The Amazon Spider-Man 2"" for instance which was a catastrophe. So I will excuse certain weaknesses that all Marvel movies seem to have which I will describe as a certain immaturity and incompleteness of the plot without giving away any spoilers. After watching it I always feel like I should read the comics in order to get the full picture. With the very popular German actor Daniel Br√ºhl they also introduced a rather unusual villain who brought a new kind of stereotype into the genre, a very quiet manipulator with a tragic human side. It's also interesting to compare the many parallels of the story to the recent ""Batman v. Superman"" movie sharing some main ideas concerning the public control of superheroes placing them under the command of a specific political authority which is all inspired by A. Moore's legendary ""Watchmen"" and in retrospect I find ""Captain America 3"" executed this ideas far better than Singer managed to do with ""Batman v. Superman"".Another great plus are definitely the new recruits of the Avengers team starting with Spiderman and Antman, who are just marvelous and also the Black Panther and The Vision and Scarletwitch are superb and a rather personal compliment goes to - hot, hotter, - Scarlett Johansson who as Black Widow demonstrated her best performance so far.All in All I find ""The First Avenger: Civil War"" surpassed it's prequels and also marked a new great highlight of the Marvel cinematic universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain America: Civil War (2016) Review - 9/10,"Captain America: Civil War is in my top five MCU films. This is a movie that I'd show to a person whenever they make fun of me for watching superhero movies. There's action, storytelling, amazing performances by all of the cast, and the Russo brothers in the director's seat. This film has just got it all. And the final fight is also one of the best, and emotional, in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The franchise is alive and well,"Which side are you on? Are there sides at all? Do you support the ideology of freedom and individual responsibility or the one of security and obedience to a collective? Is either of those two polar opposites attainable in the first place or are they just illusions?This film couldn't have been more topical if it wanted to. Wait a minute - it's the Election year in the US... it DID want to be topical. Nothing occupies minds of citizens of the Western hemisphere more than these issues nowadays and ""Captain America: Civil War"" addresses them with zest. Of course, it does so in Marvel style: punch up first, ask questions later, but it does address them with some unexpected insight and self-awareness.Personally I found the premise a little ludicrous. If I was someone with superpowers and a proved record of integrity and reliability I'd be hard pressed to allow sneaky bureaucrats who elbowed their way to UN to ""supervise"" me; or to wait for months on end for them to reach an agreement on what to tell me to do. If I was an unreliable and/or immoral superhero, they'd see even less of me. So it's a no-brainer as to what side should any of the characters really take. I also found ironic that the thing ""the Avengers"" were accused of by their political opponents - routinely ignoring sovereignty of national states and acting as the World police - is what the US military does on a regular basis. But hey, the setup needed to happen and the screenwriters have put in enough effort to make it look as plausible and as realistic as possible.The result is a very tense and well paced film that balances serious and fun bits pretty easily. All the characters of old as well as some new additions have found their place in it. Perhaps the most anticipated addition, the one of Spiderman, is the one most effective (and hilarious). Given how colorful that superhero bunch is, the fight scenes are naturally spectacular and very imaginative. I found the ending kind of anti-climactic and unfairly vague in resolution. Obviously a major Disney investment isn't allowed to really take sides and risk repelling some of the audience, and that warrants taking the rating down a notch or two. Still, overall it's a very satisfactory film.Of course, comparison with another major conflict in a competing comic-book franchise is inevitable and kind of obligatory. So, as far as that's concerned, I'd say I find both films on equal footing. Both are overall impeccably produced and directed, both are marred with similar implausibilities in terms of main premises, and both can be forgiven for that because they're so damn well made. The only difference is ""Captain America: Civil War"" is more fun and ""Batman v. Superman"" has a more poignant ending.But comparisons don't really matter to me - I like both franchises and I like to see them both alive and well because I've grown tired of TV-series. You see, ever since the early days of television the cinematographers are fighting to bring the audience back to theaters. A relatively easy task at first, it became harder and harder over the decades, as both TV-series and TV-sets kept getting more and more cinema-like. The 3D technology was the latest gimmick but it also ended up in living rooms. And now the film industry started copying television. Just as TV has series, cinema has ""franchises"". A couple of ongoing and very expensive sagas are set to entertain majority of the film-goers during the next decade or so. The companies can ill- afford any flukes and I root for all of them to succeed as far as possible. If they retain the quality of this year's entrances, it could be a long fun ride.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Love it, but...","I'm a fan of the Marvel movies, looking forward to the climax. This is a good movie, I highly recommend you watch it, but it felt like a filler. All the other movies had a great united sense about them(the movie), the characters and story was coherent if cut a bit short for theaters. This movie was jumping all over from one character to another as the story needed. Felt like poor planing the whole time, like they just had to get it out fast so they can move on. If your a fan of the Avengers you have to see this movie, like all Marvel movies it is part of a massive story that is not yet done. I just wanted more, more of this, more of that, why are we leaving, no go back, oh come on are all things I was saying to myself. Also the ability to predict what will happen was high in this one, even if you're not up to date with other media of the franchise. Whenever you can predict what will happen, you know that's a bad sign. If this was a 6+ hour movie it would be a epic tale, as is, it's just good.

Best Super Hero Movie Ever,"Smart, emotional film. This one takes a look at the heroes from the layman's perspective and it's not a pretty view. This isn't a film with a traditional threat or single villain that needs to be overcome. This is a story about guys who passionately disagree with one another and their inability to agree on the response to certain issues leads to conflict and war. I love the way this movie managed to introduce and setup future Marvel films without seeming like too much of a distraction to the overall film. I love Spider-Man's quips and comments while meeting the other heroes. I love the way Black Panther does not have time for anyone and refuses to quip! He's a man on a mission and carries himself in a cool, calm, regal, and charming way that makes a stark contrast to characters we've seen in the past. The most interesting character in the movie are Spider Man, Black-Panther, and the Awesome RDJ AKA Iron Man. Sure this is a captain America movie , but the role of Iron Man was something else you can't forget. And at some point in the movie you sure wants to kill BUCK and CAP!This movie starts at full speed throwing the audience into the surprisingly intricate story without any warning. What I mean by this is that Civil War opens without any credit sequence, Marvel logo, or fun soundtrack to ease you into the chaos that unfolds. Instead this movie throws you right in and trusts that you'll stay afloat from the onset. Once the credits actually roll we're treated to a scene that both made me wonder how they stuck a young Ferris Bueller in my Marvel film and what sort of devilish deal was bartered to get RDJ seem so young. Like, seriously, this moment was utterly shocking!The plot of this movie is similar to other super hero movies but this movie finds a way to set itself apart with the attention and care of the characters themselves. The less you know about the plot the better but the conclusion of this movie ensures that the heroes in this movie don't walk away from this film with relationships unscathed. There are ramifications to the relationships that will likely carry on in future films. Civil War initially gave me some bad Age of Ultron vibes with The Avengers encroaching a mission without any backstory. Those concerns began to wash away when the film took it upon itself to remind me that this is the Russo's we're talking about and their concept of action is a lot more grounded and brutal than what we see in other Marvel films. This is a deliberate introduction that has a purpose that you'll understand as the movie progresses. The movie may begin with action but the action sequences are so good that they seem like they were lifted directly from a great Jason Bourne movie and Marvel has no business having sequences this well thought out or fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too Much CG Spioils An Otherwise Good Film,"Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.I see some people calling this the best Marvel film yet, and right now it sits at a 7.9 on IMDb. I would have to respectfully disagree with these champions of the film. While I do think it is a decent plot, and does a fine job of showing the philosophical differences between Iron Man and Captain America, it has two big issues for me.One, it is far too dependent on CGI. I would rather see more physical effects, even if they might be less ""spectacular"". Frankly, I am not impressed by the CGI because any time something happens action-wise, it becomes very obvious the characters are drawn in and not played by actors. I understand that action is important to a superhero movie, but why must it be the worst-looking part? And two, while the plot does do something for character development, it really has very little to offer as far as a story. The characters seem to have very little growth. My impression is the whole point of the film was merely to set up Spider-Man and Black Panther for their own films.

Who Are All These Guys?,"My son informed me tonight that the reason I was confused by this film is that a missed a previous Avengers movie. I try to enjoy these comic book movies and am always astonished how personally people take them. In this one, we are treated to so many characters with different skills and agendas that it is hard to know who to pull for, who is lugging around guilt, and who some of them even are. I was told there is character development. I don't see it. The milieu into which these persons are thrust seems to be so tilted that they really need to keep working. Lets face it. If there are casualties when they ply their individual trades, imagine the carnage without them. Of course, I had all I could do to figure out which side they are on. I guess ""Civil War"" means that they are fighting among themselves in their own universe. What are the motivations? My son also informed me that there are at least a dozen or more superhero films coming out in the next two years. Good God!

"Funny, Smart, and Great Character Development","Captain America: Civil War is in my opinion the best Marvel Studios film to date, I do not say that lightly. I loved Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Avengers, but Civil War does everything that Marvel has needed to do for a while. Civil War is perfectly written, crafted with care and heart, and feature brilliant character development. All things considered Civil War is a feat, because it finally shows that Marvel is willing to take some risks, all the while remaining true to what has made their films so enjoyable.When looking at Civil War, in specific the story, it's almost perfect. The story serves as a culmination of all the events that have occurred in the ever expanding marvel cinematic universe. The great thing about this film is it's the first comic book film to intelligently address the issue of how do people respond to the seemingly endless carnage created by the main characters. Such a simple idea is perfectly applied create a thought provoking movie where every action has a repercussion.The brilliance of this film can't be understated, because the politics within the film are fictional, but feel realistic, and are dominated by shades of grey. The film finds a way to be more brave than any of the previous marvel films by taking risks and attacking deep issues, but keeps the iconic sense of humor marvel has become known for. It should be noted that the film's not dark or anything, but it does attack complex themes, and conveys a surprising amount of emotional depth for a summer blockbuster. When you consider the density of the story and the amount of characters featured it's amazing that the film worked as well as it did.That brings me to what I consider the most impressive element of the entire film, the character development. It's difficult to have a film with as many characters as this film has, and make every character feel well developed, but this film does that, more so it makes you feel for characters who are brawling with each other. The acting was one reason the characters feel so well developed as the actors brought small nuances that sold the characters that much more, and while Chris Evans is great in this film the real superstar is Robert Downey Jr., who brings so many emotions to his performance in this film. This is in my opinion the best portrayal of Iron Man since his original film, but the irony is that the show stealer is Spider-Man who marvel nailed.For those who enjoy films that are funny, touching, action-packed, or just good stories this film won't disappoint. This film is what Batman v. Superman should have been, however is even more impressive because the film finds a way to juggle so many different tasks, and does it well. Captain America: Civil War is one of those great films that everybody can watch and enjoy for different reasons. If you like movies of this genre, check Civil War out because it's one of the best in recent memory.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely worth a viewing or two,"Although did slow down a bit at times but for good reason and seemed like 2 movies within itself which is an appropriate way to define it. Civil War is partially an introduction to both minor and major recognizable marvel super heroes, although handled extremely well, one character in particular did seem a bit shoe horned but due to his immense contribution to the film in what little scenes he was in, it is completely forgiven. The threads Marvel has been sewing within the years have finally met their resolution in this film and by god it is amazing, a fight truly fueled within the years through build up has finally erupted and it is magnificent to see. This movie can be considered crowded but is a perfect example of how to handle all aspects in a way that looks seamless. Civil War was every thing I expected a sequel to Winter Soldier to be.

"Deep, Emotional yet Thrilling (NO SPOILER)","At first before you walked into the cinema all you could think about is whom you'll support. Captain America or Iron Man.That's what happened to me too.But once you sit there in front of the screen and let the storyline flow as you let yourself into it, you slowly changed your mind. Now all your concern is not about who will win between the two team, or who is wrong who is right.This is the movie where you can see those superheroes are also 'human' and has their ego, which is also relatable to our daily life where every big problems come from persistency and selfishness.In this case, you couldn't hate Steve because you know he's just trying to do what is right, you can't either hate Tony, because you realize he is just trying to keep the team away from problem, and just feel emotional of things that happened.Absolutely the BEST marvel movie so far, which all you see is not superheroes kicking bad guy ass, but that sometimes even the mightiest force on earth can also have the emotional tension between them.This movie is so thrilling, exciting, yet emotional. The Russos has done an incredible job bringing the other team member featuring the movie yet it still taste as Captain America's movie just like how the title said.Standing Applause.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stay until the end of the credits!,"This film tells the story of The Avengers who have to be regulated in view of the mass devastation they cause during their missions. However, they are divided on this issue, and neither side is unwilling to back down.It is interesting to see a ""Captain America"" film becoming an ensemble film, moving from a film about a character to a film like ""The Avengers"". I am slightly disappointed by this, because I like Captain Rogers. However, the resultant story is full of adventure and marvel, exactly because there are many characters involved. The film brings in Ant Man, and even Spiderman, making the film rich with personalities and magical powers (meaning great special effects).Marvel certainly knows how to make an entertaining superhero action film, with a good balance of adrenaline and comedy. And there are two bonus scenes, remember to stay until the end of the credits.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Russos Brothers are Amazing,"Like many, I was excited for this movie. After twelve films, I kind of know what Marvel is giving me and that's why I keep coming back. But, despite my excitement, I was getting anxious to find out if the quality met the hype. It exceeded every expectation. From beginning to end, the movie is very engaging and I think I was more invested because I've seen every movie so I have seen everything unfold to this point.This is definitely a Captain America film because it's all connected to him but it also feels like a mini-Avengers film and even duals as a Iron Man 4 film, simply because everyone has a time to shine. No one is really in there just to fill space.I am Team Cap all the way but part of me definitely understood Team Iron Man. You really flip flop because you understand each side's motivation.Black Panther is the star of this though. He was handled perfectly. People who aren't familiar with him are only getting the surface level amount of what he's capable of in this movie, but he;s relentless, regal and steals every scene he is in. Spider-Man comes in second. He is the Spider-Man I have always wanted. I was a fan of Andrew Garfield's portrayal but Tom Holland is definitely superior in this and his abilities are dope. Ant-Man will surprised many people. I thought Team Iron Man was the superior team but Ant-Man is definitely someone you want on your team.Overall, the Russo Brother know exactly how to handle a superhero film. They know how to balance every element needed to make it solid and re-watchable. Many have an issue with the villain, but I didn't. Underused but still drove the plot forward.Airport scene is the best superhero action sequence I have ever witness. The overkill with TV spots and clips don't even do it justice.

"One of the Better Marvel movies, yet still didn't break the "" it's awesome"" line.","Alright, I see many reviews are biased from Marvel fan boys and say BvS was sht compared to this one. So I will try to give an honest review and try to avoid all this DC vs Marvel fight.First off THE PLOT. At least from my perspective, the first half was a bit rushed, new characters didn't get proper introduction. The movie seemed during this first part like it was trying to be serious but wasn't sure, then switched back to the old marvel style of jokes and hollow dialogs. I hoped that Captain America will truly fight for justice, which I turned out to be wrong. Don't want to spoil anything about his development throughout the movie. Then after hour and half of boredom, sparked with few jokes and mediocre/good fighting scenes (yes even the one with black panther, for reasons I will write later) came the reason why people call this movie awesome. Fighting scene on the airport. As far as the ""choreography"" and fights go, it was a well made part of the movie. Superheroes coordinated well with each other. The final battle was in my opinion the best part of the movie, (seen in trailers) especially when Bucky and Cap go both at Iron Man.I personally didn't like in the story, new characters were introduced very fast and some of them even immediately revealed their identity (I guess new rule for Marvel superheroes).THE CHARACTERS: we all know the good old marvel superheroes from previous movies, so I'm not going to talk about them. I will focus on two new guys Spidey and Black Panther. While Black Panther's development and introduction was good, new mysterious guy appears and is very angry, it was ruined a little bit with immediate reveal of his secret identity. Although I must say this was made up with excellent fighting with very few flaws. And Spidey? It feels like Marvel got rights back for Spiderman from Sony in the middle of the movie shooting, and they didn't fully think it through how to properly implement and introduce him into the movie. It went more or less (spoiler? wanna join? yeah why not). Other than that he was the funniest character and was in the lead of bringing the fun back from the first boring half. Sadly as far as his character goes, that's it. It felt like the only lines he had were jokes.THE CINEMATOGRAPHY. Here is where I have to give Marvel a big minus. First off the fights. Often you could see characters 4-5 meters away from their enemies, and in next shot right next to them beating their asses and yes I am mainly looking at you Black Widow. Some of the scenes mainly from first half felt inconsistent. Second one and which bugged me during the entire movie. CGI. I expected much more, and to be honest it looked like work of 2nd grade college students or visibly fake internet videos. Some scene's CGI was so cringe worthy, they looked like they weren't made in Hollywood but Bollywood. And it seems like Spidey got what Deadpool was afraid of. ""Don't make my costume green, or animated."" And last but not least the physics. You know you have terrible physics in your movie, when even the movie itself has to make fun of it. The objects and people were flying around like in ""goat simulator"". There isn't excuse like they are super heroes. It was sloppy. Nothing had it's weight, and it was very visible during the fights (for example the panther fight as mentioned above). And one note to the producer. If someone is mortal and will fall from height bigger than 15 m, they will die or at least end up in coma with almost every broken bone. Again some scenes felt because of it almost Bollywood like.OVERALL This movie did break the mediocre line of Marvel movies, yet still wasn't awesome. Marvel has yet to surprise me with a very good movie. Other than 2 good fighting scenes and few jokes I didn't take anything else from this movie. Maybe bad memories horrible cgi.LAST WORDS: As you can (maybe) see from my review I like a little deeper movies. Marvel movies from my perspective are mediocre, and keep their standard of an easy ""popcorn movie"". Good to watch once, but not many times after. I tried to stay objective and point out the very good or very bad things about the movie. I myself was and still am a big fan of Marvel comics, but don't like Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Iron Man, yet in this movie, he improved my opinion of his role as he wasn't a complete douche. And people should really stop comparing Marvel and DC movies. They are clearly made for different demographic and are taken in two different ways. The only thing they have in common are people/aliens with super powers.This movie deserves max 7.5/10, definitely not more than 8 if you compare it with other similarly rated great movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So cool... !,I am quite a fan of marvel. Well this movie was very intriguing. Mainly captain America has my respect. Avengers 2 was not so great movie. This movie really kicks off Avengers. All the characters are well shown in this movie. Action scenes were great. new character black panther is cool. hope they will do movie on that character. and captain America character is really amazing. story line is good. Screenplay is well written. Lot of fun and comedy with spiderman and antman. scarlet Johanson action scenes are good. can observer her effort and dedication in that.

boring movie,"This movie is so boring the most exciting thing that happened during this time was when the two attractive girls stood up next to me, almost 30mins in, and never returned.The movie is a long winded emo dialogue with a few weak action scene's and bad attempts towards humor. While all other movies seem to sort of get back to a higher standard... This one must be one of the bottom movies. I honestly could've without wasting my time sitting through this garbage.There is truthfully nothing interesting going on all the time.

A Brilliant script with ups and downs in the rhythm,"Besides The First ""The Avengers"" movie, the first two Captain America films have been the only Marvel movies that I really fully enjoyed, I also liked the Iron Man trilogy, but always left me the feeling that they could have been much better. Civil War is probably the most ambitious project in the Marvel Universe reuniting many of the best characters of the comic books in one film ,adapting one of the most interesting comic sagas of the last years. Civil War has many virtues but also many defects, its greatest virtue is its very good and intelligent script that has a surprising final twist at the end that resolves the plot perfectly, but I did't enjoy the narrative structure in which the script was executed, with abrupt changes of rhythm that decreases the pace of the story. The three acts of the film feels like if they were three different movies and the action sequences in the first act of the film were awfully shot, with crazy camera movements that don't allow to see what is happening on the screen and even they made me feel dizzy but fortunately in the second and third act this seems to get better and luckily the battle between the Main Characters was shot in a more decent way . The tone of the film in the first act and the third are different than in second, the first act and the third have a very serious tone but the second act changes drastically, with more humour and adding many of the lame jokes that marvel use to put in their productions that luckily were funnier than in other movies. The film also introduces new characters of the Marvel universe, Black Panther, looks amazing, although that with all those stupid camera movements in the action scenes you can't distinguish between a punch or a kick or whatever they are doing during the fights Emoticono tongue and also introduces to the new Spiderman, who as Spiderman looks pretty good but as Peter Parker I think they choose an extremely young actor and Marisa Tomei (an actress that I love) playing a hot an extremely young Aunt May did't convince me neither . Awful action sequences,, very fun and enjoyable battle between the heroes of the Marvel universe, Awesome Black Panther, Downey Jr being awesome, Spiderkid and the hottest Aunt May that you could ever imagine Emoticono tongue and an excellent script with ups and downs in the rhythm of the story but above all, one of the most enjoyable films in the Marvel cinematic universe",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Have you seen that old movie, The Empire Strikes Back?""","What are 'stakes' when it comes to super-heroes? How do they function when it comes to protecting people over the world and saving us from the enemies? What if there's destruction? How can people be trusted? Or, more philosophically, can the heroes trust themselves if they have to live with the deaths at their hands (or can they)? So many questions are at the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the sort of sequel-cum-culmination of a lot of plot threads and emotional stakes that have been set up since Iron Man 1 in 2008. It feels earned, and it's hard to not think of the immediate comparison of the other big super-hero beat-down of this year, Batman v Superman. Those comparisons could last all day, but I think it's also apt, even more-so, to think of this as a criticism of X-Men Last Stand, which was another film that had super-hero ""registration"" as far as being under control and the different factions that pop up and sides taken as far as who is right and wrong and the grey areas.But where that film felt too cluttered by characters, Civil War is not. It very easily could've been, and it's easy to see it as not only are characters from the Iron Man and Captain America series here (Pepper Potts is out and Peggy Carter passes on early in this film, but that's fine, less potential clutter). But there are also additional characters from other movies (Ant-Man) and even a new character, a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens (you know him if you saw any images in the past month for even a nano-second, it's not as if the internet does a good job of keeping things on the low-down, it's Spider-Man), and yet everyone has a purpose, every character of some significance is given time to have a conversation and to talk about things so we know where they're coming from (i.e. Scarlet Witch and the Vision even do, which is a great couple of scenes), and so on.The Russo brothers do a fantastic job of keeping things emotionally speaking with Rogers and Stark clear and yet complicated; we know that the deaths of so many in an explosion at the start of the film weighs down on Rogers (though perhaps we don't see it as much), while for Stark it's thrown in his face every other moment of every day, and the turmoil is there on his face all the time (though Downey Jr is such a gifted actor as to show it just enough and to modulate the turmoil so that it comes at striking times, all of it in the eyes, it's really one of his best performances of his career). So as this goes on the plot keeps going as well, with Daniel Bruhl playing a variation on a character in the comics (who I'm not familiar with but it doesn't matter) named Zemo.This is an interesting villain and one of the better ones in the series (not Loki or Ultron level great but close), as he is *just a guy*. He's not some ultra criminal mastermind - though he certainly knows how to set up a mass explosion - but he is also someone who is another person who has the vast well of grief and vengeance from people he's lost (family but also just, as he says, ""everyone"") from his home in Slovakia. It's a good performance from Bruhl too, not too over the top (close to it but more realistic), and it's a play on past conflicts from other MCU movies. Yet here it makes its mark more because, well, this time it's more about how to tear up the super-heroes by doing it from the inside, which itself is reflective of SHIELD being taken down by Hydra in Winter Soldier and the seeds of doubt already there in 'Ultron'. It's a pretty strong creation for this particular movie.This is a very operatic type of movie - The Empire Strikes Back gets name-checked and it almost feels like a bold statement, like 'really, did you just make that even in a jesting manner in this big bad-a** action sequence at this airport - but damn if it doesn't try and possibly does live up to that standard of blockbuster excellence. It's a lot of fun though, there's lightness and quips and jokes and moments visually, filmmaking wise, that makes this something that will entertain you if you're only looking for surface thrills. And at the same time I found a lot underneath, and what it all leads up to makes things devastating for the characters. It's not perfect - I have parts I can pick at as far as a particular character's fate following the battle, and a speech given at a funeral scene is so on the nose that there's barely a nose left to see - but it's about as good as mainstream action spectacle gets.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hard hitting, mature filmmaking crossed with action-packed, hilarious fun.","The greatest superhero movie ever made? Perhaps not. It's a judgement, I personally can only make after seeing this movie more than once.What I can say is this: If it were an average affair, the flaws and faults in the structure may have derailed this beast of a movie. But this is no average affair. Too put it simply, this is the best Marvel movie yet. Should there be anything better in the future, this franchise may very well stand as one of the greatest to have ever existed.We'll start with the flaws as I want them out of the way and they are more niggles than hard errors. The pace is fierce but patchy (what Marvel movie isn't). the beginning especially, is in a big hurry to get through, what is, a great deal of set up. The central conflict of this movie relies heavily on everything that comes before it however and here, character motivations are a little rushed. The ending, also, suffers in the same kind of way.You could also call a lot of the big moments an unfortunate case of 'I already know what's about to happen'...itis...HOWEVER!This is the full blockbuster ingredients list, cooked to near-perfection: Emotionally charged, intelligent, bold, hilarious, action-packed and so much fun. It's a proper grown up affair with a superhero stamp on it. It's engaging, it's interesting, all points on all sides are relevant and understandable and perhaps most importantly, this is firmly, a Captain America movie. Iron Man is there and he's a major player, but he is not the star of the show.All other players are integral and exciting to watch, especially that very special new player! His intro is hilarious. Even better, every character has a run in with each other at one point or another and most of them ooze amazing and often surprising chemistry with each other. The best of which get the least amount of screen time together, but leave the most satisfying mark.The overall story is very well thought out. It's spread over several different plot lines, but they all come together as one big, beast of a movie. Like I said, it's patchy, but Civil War makes the absolute most of it's run time to get in what's needed for the story and what is, all but demanded, from the viewer. The Russo brothers have done a very good job here. Infinity War only looks to be more promising with each new movie.Finally, the emotional heft. It's everywhere in this movie. This isn't a grim affair, but it is dark one. Many punches are inflicted on our heroes and if you love them as much as I do, it can be a hard watch. But it's real and at times, quite heart wrenching. This is a character story at it's core and despite the success of everything else, this, they absolutely needed to make work. And they do. It's not perfect, but it's the best Marvel has done so far to put that lump in your throat. Shed that tear. Make you wish everyone could just get along. But in the end, when the result is a movie this good, you may not actually want them too.As for sides: There are no easy choices, there are no easy results. There is only first class, grown up filmmaking.Highlight: The airport tussle. Trust me, the trailer spoils nothing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Russo Bros do it again!,"Well, what can I say? If you haven't watched this film, get up and watch it! In my opinion this is one of the best Marvel films since The Avengers. Clever dialogue and good old fashion story telling is what makes this movie so fantastic. First of all I would like to say how pleasantly surprised I was by the introduction of Spider Man into the Marvel Cinematic universe. It was a beautiful transition and I particularly like how Tony Stark fills the mentor role in Spidey's life.Another awesome intro was Black Panther. The character is well portrayed by Chadwick Boseman and I greatly look forward to watching the Panther stand alone movie next year. Chadwick adds new depth to the film, a depth the movie used to its advantage.Daniel Br√ºhl's portrayal of Baron Zemo (or Zemo) is understated which enhances the movie greatly. Br√ºhl's performance is not the copy and paste villain who seems to populate a lot of Marvel movies. Instead he is credible and, unusually, the audience can sympathise with him.The Russo brothers didn't disappoint at all. Their inspired direction really brings the film to life. The added aspect of Stark's origin ties the bow perfectly for me personally. Every frame feels painstakingly analysed which is the trademark of a good director (or should I say directors).Overall, the performances are spectacular and the structure of the story is very well organised. However, I do feel like this is more of an Iron Man/Avengers movie than a Captain American one. This isn't a problem though, as every character is developed just enough. I would give Captain America: Civil War 8 out of 10 because this is everything a comic book movie should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
for dedicated fans it should be a blast,"Despite all of their heroic deeds, the Avengers have left an extensive trail of collateral damage causing politicians to view them as vigilantes who've operated outside the boundaries. When the 'Accords' are passed to regulate superhuman activity, tensions mount and definitive lines are drawn between moralistic Steve Rogers‚Äîwho sees regulation as an infringement upon their right to choose, and repentant Tony Stark‚Äîwho believes they should be put in check for any catastrophes they've caused. With new and very personal threats emerging, Earth's mightiest heroes suddenly find themselves engaged in conflict with their former comrades-in-arms. Not so much a Captain America solo adventure as it is an Avengers free-for-all, this is a unique and exciting blend of comic book adaptation and political thriller, with compelling themes of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, not to mention the sheer joy of seeing so many superheroes engaged in a smackdown of epic proportions. There are too many characters to do all of them justice, but with great lines, spectacular action scenes/effects, and laugh-out loud humor, this is still a comic book geek's dream that only heightens anticipation for the future of the MCU. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favorite marvel movie (sorry Guardians of the Galaxy),"This is probably my favorite superhero movie since the dark knight. Wow, I didn't expect this movie to be very good at all, and for once I fell like the fanboys are right and my expectations were wrong. I mean it's got well shot action, it's got Spider-Man, it's got decent character development, it's got Spider-Man, and did I mention it's got Spider-Man? I mean first off this movie does the little things correctly (for the most part), it has action scenes that you can tell what's going on (except for when they have to hide Scar-Joe's body double with shaky cam when doing some of her fight scenes), Chris Hemsworth seems to do most of his own stunts, and overall the fight scenes are very creative and action-packed. The superhero scene with every hero coming together for their big showdown is freaking amazing. Like besides the fact vision doesn't seem to do much of anything and doesn't even chase down Captain America once he starts to escape, every hero seems to be constantly doing something off-screen as well as using their powers in new and interesting ways on screen. The score for this movie is very well done, maybe not original but it's there when it needs to be, accentuates moments that it needs to, and shuts up when it shouldn't be there. The humor is toned down but still there, and besides some missed jokes from ant-man (and some from Spidey sadly) this movie still manages to be hilarious and the comedy is actually well timed for once. Overall the story and the writing for this movie are well above average. I loved black panther and spider man and their respective introductions. I thought the villains motivations were actually really unique, which made for one of the best superhero movie twists since watchmen. Yeah Iron Man is an asshole, and Captain America is pretty obviously right after you get into about an hour through the movie, but so what. The characters seem to stay true to themselves and I appreciate that. Overall this is the second Marvel movie I can say I love, and the only real movie I love so far this year (unless you count the Witch as a 2016 movie). I think anybody, even none comic book superhero fans like myself, to check this out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect example of how to make a great super hero film!,"I'm not usually keen on giving such high scores, just look at my other reviews.But at the same time, this film had a lot of expectations and a lot to make up for. Avengers 2 was pretty boring, not funny and not very entertaining movie. Plus with Batman v Superman getting released before this, Captain America: Civil war had it tough. This movie probably doesn't deserve a solid 9, but it does deserve to stand out from other comic book movies, because it should be an example of how to correctly make a super hero movie. Captain America, had more Avengers then first two Avengers film put together. It showcased new characters and gave more back story to; Black Panther, Ant-man, Vision, Scarlet Witch and Spider-man. That is a lot of new super heroes to give screen time, considering you still have the big players like Captain America, Iron-man, War Machine, Black Widow, Hawk-eye, Winter Soldier and Falcon. This film does an excellent job at handling so many heroes, not the same thing can be said for Avengers 2 or Batman V Superman, which failed to keep you balanced between 3 heroes and 2 villains.The Marketing on the film was great, i was really going in expecting to see a full civil war between Cap and Iron-man, but the way the did it in the film was pretty good, the whole build up of the two sides was really good, and the fight between all heroes was much awesome! Yes, it really was Awesome! with many heroes using their techniques and new skills or fight scenes.Spider-man in this film was brilliant. I really hope Sony doesn't screw it up and continue to make him work at being a better franchise. He really did a great job at being the comic relief.The story had few hiccups, but nothing to major, as it was overlooked by the bigger picture. Moments in the film, where you would go as a critic and say ""That character would not make that decision, or he is to smart to think like that"" but even that wasn't as bad as seeing Ultron lose to Avengers 2 or Batman being played the whole film in Batman v Superman.Like i said, this film might not deserve a 9/10, but it gets from me because it does deliver what so many heroes film have failed to do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Take your toys, divide in half and let loose the dogs of toys.","To sum up this movie, it's like if you take a kid and all his toys and separated the toys in half and have them go at each other to see which side one...that would be this movie. Two sides, one that wants super heroes to be responsible and have government oversight and one that doesn't want that. So it splits the avengers and they start recruiting like a ton of characters to both sides, like jam pack it full of heroes. So many that they have to have them briefly appear or it will cost hundreds of millions to produce this show...oh wait it did cost like 275 million to make. It was a mess but a fun mess to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel has been Cemented as the Super Hero Studio!!,"You can not get a better Super Hero movie then this!! First of, let me be clear. I was looked forward to Batman V Superman more then i was to this. Avengers 2 killed the excitement i had for this. but after seeing it on the opening night I can clearly appreciate everything Marvel does.This film focuses on balancing the act between all of its Super Heroes, which is a far greater number then DC has, and it does it perfectly. You never feel that one character has more screen time then another, even though you see Captain America all the time, you still feel the presence of other super heroes. It's not like they appear out of no where and you go ""Hmm, wonder where they were for the whole film?""The story is pretty great too, the whole situations is similar to what was portrayed in BvS but just done with much better style.The fight scenes never got boring for me. This is really important, because as a critic and a movie fan I feel that sometimes feel can take the easy route and that is once they come up with 3 or 4 cool fight scenes they will just re use them, but just shoot them with different angles. It was all different here.This film works on every level. Spider-man does a perfect job of being the comic relief as does Ant-man and even Falcon has more then a few catchy remarks to other heroes. Iron-man is as always brilliantly sarcastic and full of himself.The drama that Captain America creates is felt through the whole film and is quite good. Black Widow and Black Panther add more tension and help the drama play out through the entirety of the film, which is brilliant as it gives the film it's heart.Like i wrote in the beginning. This is what films should strive to be. Especially DC movies, if they want any chance of catching up to Marvel Universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The old formula we are tired,"Good points: The battle, spidey and Antman.Anything else it can be considered as a copy & paste of a formula that it's becoming boring. Even the starting is slow and characters look plain. The villain is hardly to believe and share his goal. Too many jokes again even in the critical scenes that don't let the movie be transformed in adult movie.Downey Jr looks tired of his role as Ironman and his acting has disappointed me. The conflict is not deeper at all. It caused expectation that disappears as soon as spidey is out of the movie.Sorry, but I really don't like this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow. Comics over Movies . . . Until now.,"Okay, as a massive comic book fan I have always found the Marvel, DC movies a bitter pill to swallow mostly because I thought the comics where better . . . Well, not in this case.Sure, Civil War is really not like the comic, certain characters aren't there and the teams are different, but OMFG, this movie is amazing, from beginning to end, it's just a bomb of great dialog and amazing fight scenes!!Steve Rogers! Tony Stark! Both amazing as per usual, I walked in there as Team Ironman, then when i saw the difference in the story I actually was emotionally torn between them! It was a hard thing to watch and that alone proves to me the depth in this movie!Their fight scene in the airport is potentially one of the best fight scenes I have EVER seen, some of my favorite comic heroes, Ironman, spiderman, black panther and scarlet witch all just throwing down! MY GOD! . . .Only ""downside"" if I had to pick at something, was some of the fight scenes had so freaking much going on it got a little hard to follow with the shaky cams! OH and I wish they had made a better fight scene with Widow and Sharon Carter VS the Winder solider, that would have been bad ass!But this movie borderlines perfect for me and they 100% deserve the 10/10.

Delightful,"NON-SPOILERS REVIEWThis is absolutely the best movie in the MCU and maybe one of the greatest superhero movies I've seen, it was absolutely brilliant. Russo brothers did it again. The tone was serious but at the same time it had the jokes and the fun, the script was organized, they show you the character motivations and let you choose side and I have to say that this is was I was expecting in BvS, the tension built and the subplots were correctly approached and the fight scenes were SPECTACULAR, the airport scene was the best action scene I've seen in my life. The acting was brilliant, special mention to Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff). The introductions to the new characters were good executed and they didn't feel forced at all, and talking about that I have to say: Spiderman was awesome in the 2 or 3 scenes he shows up, Black Panther was incredible and I can't wait to see his solo movie. I don't have anything to complain about this movie, perhaps the villain felt unnecessary but the rest of the movie was brilliant. Look, I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I wanted BvS to be a 10/10 but sadly it wasn't and some of the reasons were that they seemed forced to introduce new characters and the script had some flaws, and this is how it has to be executed, the script was brilliant because the simple fact that they show you correctly the characters motivations and build the conflict to let you choose which side do you agree more and the way that they introduce Spiderman and Black panther was intelligent and accord with the movie's development.Everything said, if you love comic book characters go to see this movie, if you love action go to see this movie, if you love thrillers go to see this movie, if you love good movies go to see this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superhero movie done right,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown and matured in all the right the ways throughout the years. Establishing a shared universe with rich characters is no easy task, let alone succeeding, without compromising the quality and ethics in such a grand undertaking. Before watching Captain America - Civil War I was very skeptical about how anyone would be able to properly handle this amount of characters and high quality actors in a balanced and meaningful way. My expectations were sky high, having genuine respect for the creative handling of century old comic book characters that has been done so far is truly formidable. From start to end the movie gives you a thrill ride of untold proportions. Never was there a moment through the movie that i found useless or not helping the plot. Best Marvel movie to date, without a doubt!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Would watch again,"It's a decent superhero movie, and one with a good premise. I liked this particular mix of character even tho some of them come straight from the left field. I could have way less of Vision, he's the least compelling character in MCU in my opinion. Ant Man is an inherently goofy character, but this was a very solid use of Ant Man. Otherwise, a pleasing roster.There's some subversion of expectations. Usually so reckless Tony Stark is playing politics while Captain Rogers goes AWOL. End fight was also not quite what I expected. The one before that - brawl at an airport - was great.The movie feels every bit of that 2.5h runtime, as in the cut could use some improvement. Some middle parts feel very, very slow. There's clever parts of visual storytelling in some of the character introductions and backstories. Maybe it's just bit of a chore to have all this material to go through - and still some characters just appear out of nowhere, like Ant Man mentioned above. Dialogue is nothing to write home about, but feels quite natural. Altho there's a bit of repetition on motives on some characters.Good film for the genre, I'd happily watch this again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Blast of fun with a difference,"Was looking forward to watching this for a while, and enjoyed nearly every last minute of it. The film does very well to set the tone, coming from comical-comedy-action to very serious drama/thriller. The acting is portrayed greatly, although I feel there may have been too many characters for each to fully contribute to the film. Some great action sequences, as well as convincing passionate battles. Also does a great job at delving into moral issues that divide us. The writing was very convincing, great dialogue all-round. Effects were magical, done very well. Great film overall, not my favourite Marvel addition but certainly brings a harsher change to a fun-filled franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good,"This movie uses the theme of collateral damage/accountability in order to pit superheroes against each other. And it mostly succeeds. It creates the divide in a better way. And it was light and used a lot of humour effectively. With so many characters thrown together in the same film, and new ones introduced, it would be so easy to lose track of some of the characters' story development. The writers deserve some praise in this case because they succeeded in keeping all the characters' own storylines going throughout around the main plot. All the avengers are there, apart from Thor and The Hulk - off on their own adventures. As usual the quality of acting is good from the usual suspects. Though it's the couple of new additions that I enjoyed the most. Black Panther was really cool. Spiderman was also refreshing adding some hilarious lines. Ant-Man in the support role comes up with some funny lines. The visuals were very enjoyable. The various action and fight scenes in particular were awesome. They were exciting without becoming cheesy or predictable.The movie isn't perfect tho. A big problem was its length. At 147 minutes it was probably half an hour too long. There are a few of the scenes that dragged on a little too far. I also have a problem with the title. Having seen all the previous Marvel films, I don't think that this had the feel of a Captain America movie. It was much more suited to being an Avengers movie and I can only imagine the lack of Thor and The Hulk is the only reason it wasn't called 'Avengers: Civil War'. During the main fight scene between all the major characters reference was made to people pulling their punches and still being friends. These people are friends and superhero colleagues. They have future movies to make together. At no point did I feel they were ever going to actually kill each other; which slightly takes away from the tension.Overall, CW does very well as a stand-alone movie and also helps set up future movies for various characters. It is a bit too long but there's enough to keep you entertained and keep you guessing about where the story is going. If you enjoy the Marvel universe I'm sure you'll enjoy this instalment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Waste of time,"Downside: I wanted to leave the cinema after 1 hr to go study in the lobby (at 00:00)Upside: I've learnt a great deal from this movie and it hasn't even ended yet( since i am writing this from the theater and the film is still on, they're fighting-what a surprise). I've learnt that culture isn't always positive. American culture with all its heroes, all its need to save innocent lives is just a hypocrisy trying to mask the atrocities US has committed through history. At least I thought it is going to be enjoyable, you can never really hate every single part of the movie. I learnt the contrary too. Idiotic screen writing, I could guess what they were about to say. Not even the actors could save this piece of excrement. I tried to sleep through it at some point thinking the pain will go away. My boyfriend is a fan and though I could hear his unsatisfied, thirsty, clenched anger, he wanted to see what happens so I had to stay. The reason I couldn't sleep is the fact that my anger started kicking in more and more every time I heard someone talk. People actually laughed once for like 3 seconds at this very idiotic joke. Now i might have some anger issues but this movie made me go full animal. Also very long. I wish IMDb had the ""attach photo"" option so i could immortalize my face's disgusted look and share it with the world.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What an absolute joy,"Awesome! My new favourite, so far at least.What an absolute joy 'Captain America: Civil War' is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less. Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won't spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.It gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.Sebastian Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn't love that character in his preceding appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Br√ºhl plays his role very nicely. Elsewhere, Paul Rudd's inclusion is amusing.The whole film, as is normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made. As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I guess there's no hiding who my standout avenger is, eh?The only 'but' I have for this is the title. It's practically an avengers film. I'm not saying it's an ill-fitting title, I get it's the titular character's arc, but I feel like it does the film a slight disservice - it's impacts much more than Captain America.That's not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Russo Brothers handle an ensemble excellently in another Marvel blockbuster but it wasn't without problems.,"Captain America: Civil War has been called ""Avengers 3"" by some people because of the amount of Avengers that star in the film and it's a valid observation...until you see the movie. Somehow the Russo Brothers, with this huge ensemble cast, dealing with the Avengers themselves, adapting an infamous comic book actually make it still feel like a Captain America movie - which is great! I mean don't get me wrong, you see a lot of other characters and I loved seeing a lot of other characters but it really worked well continuing Cap's story that was left off in The Winter Soldier, which I really enjoyed because Bucky Barnes was one of the most interesting things about that movie and I enjoyed seeing him progress here.And talking of characters, there were quite a few to juggle about but the Russo's once again did an excellent job of not making it confusing or crowded. I'll just go through a few of them real quick. Captain America and Iron Man were great as always, Iron Man was not always his one-liner quip guy in this, he has a lot of stuff to deal with so it was interesting to see him in that light; now I went into this movie on the side of a particular team but boy if you don't start questioning your loyalties during this movie then something's wrong; there were points being made that actually made me see the other guy's side so I was happy to see both sides presented equally, after all it is a Civil War. Black Panther gets his movie debut here and what an introduction it was, he is a fantastic character who I cannot wait to see again, his motives were solid and clear and his third-party angle to the war made it really intriguing to watch, definitely looking forward to seeing Chadwick Boseman in his own Black Panther film. The two sidekicks, as it were, Falcon and War Machine were great to see again and do a lot more plot-wise I think so it was nice to see everyone used really well. Vision and Wanda were fine in their roles again, I think I preferred them in Age of Ultron for some reason, they just seemed more interesting then whereas here, although they were great to see again, I didn't feel as invested in their characters as I was others. Ant-Man was fun to see too and boy do we see him, I'm obviously not going to spoil anything here but he was definitely one of my favorite parts of the movie.Now during all this Civil Waring there is actually a villain in the movie and for me, he was one of the best villains Marvel have done in their Cinematic Universe; I felt his motives were valid, his intelligence was shown very well and his scenes were just really interesting to me.Just before I get into what I wasn't such a fan of I'll mention Spider-Man. Tom Holland is a great actor and does a great job in this, it was really cool to see Spider-Man interact with the Avengers and see him do his stuff. That being said, this Spider-Man was not quite what I was expecting; I don't read the comics so from just a movie-going viewer with the past five Spidey movies to go on, this incarnation was quite different in the way of how they handled him. I've been told it was the most comic-accurate Spider-Man and the best version they've seen of him on screen so I have no place to complain but for me it was a little jarring to see such a change from what I was used too. But I did of course enjoy seeing him on screen and really look forward to seeing him again.Now some things I wasn't so struck on. The first action piece; a battle near the very start of the movie just seemed off for some reason. I don't know what it was but it just didn't flow for me, I didn't enjoy who they were fighting and although it does set up something important a lot of it felt unnecessary. The first quarter of the film I'd say was very much a going from set-up to set-up sort of thing and was a little shaky script wise but the plot eventually straightened and it was great. Another negative I have was that once or twice the CGI was quite noticeable, in some of the action scenes and particularly Vision sometimes it wasn't great. And then something that wasn't necessarily wrong with the film but those darn trailers again. We'd go to one location and I'd instantly recognise it from the trailer so I knew what was going to happen, and that occurred nearly every time they went somewhere else; not all the time mind you, but quite a lot I was already knowing what scene this was leading up to.In the end Marvel roll out another blockbuster with one of the best ensemble casts and an investing, emotional story. For me it wasn't the best film they've done but a real strong shot from the Russo Brothers and set's up a lot of cool characters for the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Meh, not what I hoped for","Captain America appears once again in a movie with his name as the banner. Strangely however, a legion of other stories and superheroes weave through this film and it watches more like the next Avengers film. Cap has a backseat purpose.Comic books are fun, but they're hard to get and I mean that on two levels. A good comic book tells a story in 2 dimensions. A good movie made from a comic book, transfers that ""good stuff,"" for example the story and superheroes, and translates that into a movie experience.Because I read a lot of reviews, I can see there is an either/or in comic book movies: some say they stayed true to the comic and the movie excelled as a result. The other one is when a comic book connoisseur slashes and trashes the director for taking too much license in the making o the movie. I don't know comic books well, which might explain why I didn't like this film as much as the critics as large. Maybe I should read more comics?My first question was: ""Why so many superheroes when this is a movie called ""Captain America?""""I binge watched the two prequels to Civil War before seeing it at the cinema, as did my wife. I can tell you the first two really held my attention and Cap (as he is called in all of them) is the focal hero of the movies. That made it a lot easier to follow and get on board with. Civil War has too many superheroes exhibiting their individual strengths and weaknesses.All the while there is a ploy by politicians to gain control of the Avengers due to their reckless modus operandi. Cap's reins from the other two movies is named ""Bucky"" and I don't want to give any spoilers but there is so much back story and attention given to him you might as well have named it ""Bucky: Civil War."" Still, he has some interesting abilities and his interplay with Cap is somewhat interesting. I'd call that part of the story ""just above a snore.""We do get to see some action. There is an almost unforgivable about of people having dialog and no action. This to me was a crime. All I can imagine is that it would make more sense if I only read the comics. Because I felt the movie did not live up to its name ""Captain America"" and should have been named ""Avengers,"" and because of some laboriously long dialog with no action, it lost two stars with me. I have to say, enough comic book aficionados will go see this no matter what I say but to all the others I cannot recommend this film. I have high hopes for the next one though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Arguably the best movie of 2016,"""Wow"" - This one word would describe the movie aptly. After the disappointment of BvS (shame on you DC), the Avengers sequel checks all the boxes for a well made movie. Great acting, Amazing story, jaw-dropping action, well written humor, and great characters.Unlike the previous Avengers, (still a little confused as to where Ultron and Vision came from), this edition has a solid ( i mean rock solid) story line. The intro of all new characters into the Avengers fold is very well done.As the trailers have shown, Cap and Iron-man go at each other, and this is probably one of the best parts of the already awesome movie. Superb action, superb acting and great humor thrown in between. With all these, you could not possibly go wrong!!!!One peeve though, I feel the movie name should have been Avengers - Civil War and not Captain America - Civil War.

Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it.,"""Why do we need a war to solve a problem"". The question that will pop up in your while watching the Avengers follow-up. Captain America:Civil War was entertaining with high-class 3D effects and stunning CGI along with riveting performances which turned out to be a solid follow-up to the Avenger series.As the new Superhero Registration Act is proposed by the United Nations which lays out the plans to deploy Super-heroes only when required. This political interference by the government causes the rift between two good friends ‚Äì Captain America, who believes that Super-hero should be have freedom to act and ""not obey order"", and Iron Man who believes that Super-heroes should be answerable to a neutral body based on their actions.It would have been really challenging for Russo brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, directors of Captain America : Winter Soldier to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise they did a fantastic job and turned the comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path- breaking action sequences. The opening fight scene with Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow is pretty impressive, the introduction of each super- hero character has laid out accurately and fight scenes will keep you engaged. Second half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella.Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Captain America and Iron man, the new characters like Black Panther and Ant-Man are highly likable. But the most impressive is the introduction of Spider-man which is played by a Tom Holland. Climax fighting scene is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects.On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially. Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. The supremely talented actor goes deep inside a broken super-hero character who is left by his girlfriend. Chris Evans emotes better compared to the previous series of Captain America as if it is tailor-made for him. Scarlette Johanson does what she is best at ‚Äì kick some ass. Paul Rudd will surprise you as Ant- Man.Overall, Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it.

"Amazing. Full of incredible dialogue, emotion, and suspenseful action","The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest action extravaganza proves once again that the MCU can create a masterpiece of superhero cinema. Much courage and loyalty is put into this film by the writers and directors, and it shows. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's decision to delve deeper and darker into the plot, thus exploring thought-provoking themes like revenge, friendship, and betrayal, work wonderfully. Also the work of the directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, provide for large amounts of emotion in the dialogue and intensely gratifying fight scenes filmed at the right angle. This is not your typical superhero flick with action and an interesting plot, it is a movie that pits incredible set-pieces and choreography against life-changing choices, while throwing superheroes into the mix. At its core this film acts as three movies combined: a sequel to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" a semi part three Avengers movie, and the introductions of popular characters Black Panther and Spider-Man. This film is guaranteed to satisfy casual movie goers, Marvel fan boys, and the toughest critics to please.Marvel has once again changed the way superhero movies are to be filmed. With their superior and supremely creative executive producer Kevin Feige at the helm, also a large array of visionary directors and writers, and a more-than capable cast, Marvel seems to have a record of this. Starting with their original movie ""Iron Man"" which kick-started the universe, to their excellently crafted team up ""The Avengers,"" and others such as political thrillers and space sagas like ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" the MCU has always enticed audiences. This is certainly the case with ""Captain America: Civil War"" as they continue this trend of newly crafted and original films. Not only does Kevin Feige bring something new to the MCU table, but he also considers the repercussions of the Avenger's actions while delivering a psychological thriller dealing with political interference, which splits the sides of the Avengers in two. Another superhero film at Warner Bros. Studios attempted a plot similar to this (""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"") but ultimately failed. It seems like Marvel has observed and payed attention to their rivals at DC and took some notes as to the right film-making strategy. All joking aside, Marvel Studios has clearly made a spectacular film that constantly keeps your brain moving, whether it be the incredible action scenes or the perceptions and viewpoints of every hero.There are many examples in ""Captain America: Civil War"" that signifies that Marvel Studios has a firm grasp on their heroes and plot. The first instance is the phenomenal action sequences in this film. From Black Panther versus Bucky to the New Avengers Team versus Crossbones to the titular and praiseworthy airport battle, the choreography in this film is definitely spectacular. The second example is the mind blowing ideals of all the heroes. Every superhero in this film gets valid screen time to demonstrate their views on the matter, and in this way there is really no main villain. This movie creates so much emotion within their characters and conflicts that affects the audience in turn. The third and last case are the ambitious entries of beloved Marvel heroes Spider-Man and Black Panther. The way that these two characters fit almost flawlessly into the plot instead of being shoehorned in is quite a fete. Black Panther definitely has the advantage over Spider-Man in the way that his character is more involved and better introduced in the plot, but Marvel still successfully pulls it off. Laying the groundwork for further hero's solo outings is a strategy that Marvel has done in the past. While most times it works pretty well, in this film it works terrifically. Even at the beginning of the year, it can be said that ""Captain America: Civil War"" will be one of the best films of the year, and that Marvel Studios has pulled off a rather gutsy and ambitious move.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Why did I go and see this film?,"I was torn between going to see this film and Angry Birds, I saw the IMDb + Rotten Tomatoes ratings and decided this might be an exception to the rule of terrible recent superhero films. Now I deeply regret my choice. No matter how bad Angry Birds was, it can't have been this bad...The action seemed oriented towards (and possibly directed by) 4 year olds mashing plastic dolls together. You never really feel that any of the characters are in any danger (with one exception later on), because they're all, well, superheroes, except that one guy with a bow and arrow, who might have been a superhero in the middle ages but seems hopelessly out of place in this futuristic battlefield.The portrayal of Africa was just stereotyped and ignorant, as expected, while the portrayal of America as selflessly struggling with the burden of protecting the rest of the world with the best possible intentions was contemptible.There were some fairly amusing parts, usually involving Captain America's biceps, but most of the jokes fell flat. There were a few attempts at emotional depth, which, for me at least, failed miserably.The action felt boring and repetitive, and lost its appeal within about 20 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The antagonist was completely underdeveloped; rather than the usual lack of backstory, this guy just suffered from having no particular skills that would allow him to stage a major plot against the omnipotent avengers.Now, I know I'm not the intended audience for this film (i.e over 10 years old, enjoy films with a bit of depth), but I enjoyed the (Bale) Batman trilogy and was maybe hoping that this film was in that kind of vein. Sadly, it wasn't. However, younger kids with a violent temperament, CGI fans and real Marvel obsessives might enjoy it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

AVENGERS PART 3! What BVSS should have been ..but failed to do.,"Captain American 2 was a great movie, one of my favorites in the Marvel world. The fist Avengers film was a fantastic one as well.. .this one surpasses both in a way that defies convention.The plot is different in that it is adult and strong in theme. The characters are established and so we are invested in what happens to them. Usually a 3rd outing of a film is weak and disappointing, so imagine my surprise when i see this EPIC ACTION film better than the last 2 captain America movies. Which is a rare thing to do in the cinematic world.I don't want to give spoilers away, but SPIDERMAN steals the show, and BLACK PANTHER or whoever Mr. Catwoman is lol is pretty cool. At the core of the film, the theme is friendship and loyalty. Watching Iron Man VS. Captain America fight, its inevitable to not compare to that other little film that came out this year where 2 male superheroes were pinned against each other.. and one can see this IS WHAT that other film should have been.The action sequences looked incredible, the special effects fantastic and the dual loyalty we have between both teams is an excellent psychological sell for it makes us root for both teams, understand both teams and ultimately cry for both teams (no I did not cry lol) but man was i ENTERTAINED !As the final entry in the CAP AME. trilogy, this is going out with a damm BANG!This is the definition of a blockbuster film.

A decisive Superhero vs. Superhero extravaganza!,"Captain America: Civil War is essentially like a battle royale between superheroes like one has never seen before. And that too, in a way that doesn't bludgeon your senses into numb submission, like some other superhero films we've seen of late!It's full of sensational action packed scenes which prove to be an eye treat for action and the comic lovers! Iron Man and Captain America's showdown is just one of the many that will keep you absorbed in the movie. This fast-paced, intimate film is full of happy surprises; Tom Holland's Spider-Man is one.The scenes with Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther are some of the best in the film. They lead up to their individual movies and prove Marvel's true superpower is its casting.

The first film I walked out of..,"I kinda liked MCU when it was in the phase of Iron Man - Avengers 1. Those were just good films with somewhat decent humour and sick new fighting scenes, all caked up with stunning visuals and, of course, superb acting (as in, RDJ, Mark Ruffalo and Sam Jakcson ONLY!, others were just watchable). Those films were truly good, I enjoyed them for what the were, mostly because of the fact that they didn't take themselves very seriously (note: does not mean they were dumb). That is until recently, when thing got fuc*ed up royally..MCU is just not meant to be serious. Stick to what you are good at: fun family film - making with gloriously dumb one-liners. Let all the seriousness and darkness of the real world to the Zack Snyder's et al. DCEU vision. BvS, for all the hate and so- called, the worst plot- holes and editing bashing it received, in my eyes, handled its very idea - being dark (thus realistic) reflection of the Real world - very, very satisfyingly. It is not the best comic-book film, no (Justice League is meant to be that :D), but out of the CW and Batman v Superman, I must go with Dawn of Justice. That film is simply superior to Civil War in any aspect, especially fight scenes (airport - ehm - ""fighting"" was really a downer for me).Finally, I do not think that the title Civil War is appropriate, when the highest number of assailants appearing on the screen in the same time is...12 or something. That-Is-Not-A-War, let alone civil.And, yeah,..I will forever remember this film, for it made me leave my IMAX seat and walk out of a screening for the very first time in my life. If it is of an interest to you, I decided to pack my things right after the utterly shitty airport drunk brawl.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Again I applaud Marvel,"4 May 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Captain America - Civil War. Imagine a really really bad Marvel Film and you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Another great instalment and yet again, possibly one of the best. This film had so much going on it kept your attention one hundred percent of the time. It's another story where superheroes are being pitted against each other and when I saw this in the trailers my heart sank, but I must say go with it, see where the story takes you, it's a Marvel!!!!! All our old favourites get airtime, and even a mention for those not joining us on this outing, and a couple of new ones join the mix, A great performance from Tom Holland.....Billy Elliott turns on his spidey senses. This was quite a serious film but there were still moments of frivolity, and people.....don't get up and walk out before the credits.......it is a Marvel production after all....just saying!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very entertaining,"First of all, this movie is directed brilliantly, the Russo brothers do a fantastic job and translating the comic into a very entertaining movie. The writing is fantastic, and the actors, with Downey being the highlight, and the movie makes you switch between both sides, and makes it difficult to decide on which team to stand with.Now Tom as Spider-Man, is the best choice the Marvel Movies have made since Downey as Stark. He is fantastic here, despite his limited screen time. He really shines as the web-slinger, and his comedic performance does not seem forced, and it ends making you hungry to see more of him. The other characters are also very entertaining to see, and there is not one dull moment with them, and their chemistry is fantastic, one of the major things that keep this movie on its feet.The best thing about Civil War, is the action, this is some of the best action I have seen in a movie in a long time. There is some shaky cam in some parts, however it can make some of it hard to make out, but also very effective.Now for the bad stuff, first, the runtime. It can seem very long at times, with some scenes added feel shoehorned in there, to make the movie a little longer. But the worst aspect is by far the CGI. I know - all the other marvel movies have had decent special effects, but this one, not so much. Some scenes look OK at best, but other times, specifically the Black Panther, you can tell how fake he is. The leaping, the explosions, and even some of the powers look so bad. Robert's CGI head is also very noticeable on his Iron Man suit without his helmet, and it distracts every time you see him like this. The green screen effects are also very bad, and you can see it's fake from a mile off.Other than that, there is nothing else bad about this movie. It is better than most Marvel movies, behind only Guardians of the Galaxy.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Highlights just how bad BvS was,"Civil war shows how an ensemble comic book hero movie SHOULD be done. The CGI in this movie didn't look like CGI - the airport scene - shows how a superhero movie with multiple main characters SHOULD be done! No doubt you've read all the critics reviews, and by and large they are RIGHT!But CGI alone cannot carry a film (again one of the major flaws in BvS). The story itself is compelling. You can watch this film and enjoy it without watching any other Marvel movie, but it is SO more satisfying to get all the backstory!Words wont do this movie justice - WATCH IT - ENJOY IT - you won't be disappointed!It gets 9/10 because NO film can ever be perfect!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING MCU FILMS,"I really think this is one of the best and exciting MCU films ever. The action scenes and emotional leverage the scenes have were flawless.

Boring!,"I have to be honest: I am in general no big fan of superhero movies, but there are some exceptions. This movie, however, was not such an exception.The movie seems to want to impress by pouring cans of superheroes at you and make them fight. Wow, I have never seen that before.There was some sort of story line, but the basic premise is that you can't trust the UN, because superheroes themselves know better what's good for the world. Oh, the arrogance!Because of the surplus of superheroes, I couldn't figure out which one(s) I was supposed to sympathize with. That they were all as thin as cardboard characters didn't help much either.Perhaps if you're a comic book fan this movie contains some references to ""canon"" material (?), but for the otherwise uninformed viewer, there is not much entertainment value in it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A superhero film to enjoy, not endure","Unlike a certain other superhero film recently released, 'Captain America: Civil War' is unlikely to polarize opinion. It's a Marvel film, you see, and despite being the relative newcomers to the 'film your own characters' school, they're rapidly risen to top of the class, knocking out hit after hit by simply understanding what their fans want. Civil War is no exception, and is unsurprisingly much more than a 'who would win in a fight between...' punch fest.Although Cap gets title billing here, Civil War is basically Avengers 3, following directly on from Age Of Ultron. We open with The Avengers kicking are as usual, but again as usual it's impossible to avoid civilian casualties when there's guns and bombs all over the place. One explosion later and the team are basically ordered to become an official task force, answerable to that most despicable of things: a committee. Tony Stark sees the sense in this, whilst Cap doesn't trust people to not have self interest and also to allow them to react quick enough. There's only one way to settle this...So the scene is set, as The Avengers split into pro and anti factions. To actually get fists flying, however, you need a reason. Enter The Winter Soldier, last seen disappearing after saving Cap in The Winter Soldier movie. With Bucky seemingly to blame for a terrible international incident, Cap decides to grab him before the officials can, setting him squarely against Iron Man, now firmly doing what he's told. Cue stand off...As I said earlier, this is much more than a simple series of hero on hero scraps, although the main one is a doozy. Not only do we get our usual Marvel suspects, but there's also the introduction of The Black Panther and a certain kid in a red and blue onesie. Both are handled exceptionally well, and you will be gagging for the Black Panther movie by the end, not to mention 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' in 2017. Add to this a nice return to the screen for Paul Rudd's Ant Man and the two and a half hours (yes, really) will fly by.Much like the last Captain America film, Civil War gives a damn about plot, and a decent amount of time is spent actually having one and talking about it. The Winter Soldier is once again the device that gives the plot momentum, and poor old Bucky looks like he'll never escape his Hydra brainwashing. Whilst it's a Captain America film, Tony Stark and Iron Man are given plenty of screen time as Stark's demons are fully explored, pushing him towards an inevitable showdown. Again, it's a pretty serious film, but unlike a certain other film it finds time to make you smile as well. I mean, who'd make a two and a half hour superhero film without any light moments at all? Oh yeah....Bold, bright, brash and brilliant, 'Captain America: Civil War' stand up alongside Marvel's other movies, and whilst some have said it's the best yet, I'd say it depends on what you're looking for. The joy of the Marvel movies is that they each tend to have something different, and to compare this to, say, 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' is pretty daft. Suffice to say it's faults are few and far between, it maintains a large cast without short changing anyone, and it's not full of plot holes. Chris Evans remains as perhaps the best piece of casting in the superhero genre, with new Spidey Tom Holland and Black Panther Chad Boseman each owning the screen as nervy kid and moody warrior respectively. Once again, when asked what kind of comic based films work best, the answer is 'make Mine Marvel'. Excelsior!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Marvelous time with exciting new characters and the fan favorites,"The Marvel Universe is based on fun and fighting with an interesting story tucked in there. Captain America Civil War definitely delivers on these parts!While the story is a continuation of the previous Captain America movie Winter Soldier, the scope is far more than that. You could say it's an Avengers movie, but the stories of the Captain's past and where he believes his future lies are what gives this movie some interesting depth.But who are we kidding? The intersecting story of all Marvel heroes is great, but the fighting, one-liners and hilarious scenes are why I come back. if you're the same, well you'll have a Marvelous time.The new characters and some minor known characters are allowed to claim the spotlight, putting others in their shadow for once (watch the movie and you'll get it)I can't wait for the upcoming Infinity War movies, a lot has to happen to screw those up with this cast, these directors and the Vision of the MCU. But who knows, maybe Thor Ragnarok will bring an ironic end to the good times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nailed it.,"Captain America: Civil War is directed by Anthony & Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downy Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Br√ºl and last but definitely not least, Tom Holland.After another incident involving destruction, chaos and death, the Avengers are required to sign a contract with a governing body to ensure they are only called upon when absolutely vital. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers become enemies due to a disagreement and the other Avengers are caught in the crossfire.Firstly I'd like to state that I'm not overly keen on how 70% of movies these days are centred around superheroes or their respective universes. I've always enjoyed the instalments Marvel have been releasing in the MCU canon and this is no different... But yet it is.Anthony and Joe Russo so skilfully directed 'The Winter Soldier' that I had no doubts for 'Civil War' and I had a deep feeling it would be perfect. I was right. This is how you direct a superhero movie. Take note Zach Snyder and DC Comics, because this is entertainment.The action sequences are so brilliantly directed and shot that it's impossible to keep your eyes off the screen. It's fast-paced, rapid, clean and smart. If you've seen their work before then you know how beautiful their direction is. And not just in the action sequences; the real conflict and deceit between these heroes is written extremely well and shows you both sides to the story. It's really hard to decide who you side with as a viewer, and that's what is truly wonderful and unique about this movie. It has you rooting for both sides of the argument, regardless of who your favourite characters are.Along with the usual team of Avengers we have some newcomers; Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman did a terrific job as Panther and settles conveniently into the story. I look forward to seeing more of this character in future instalments. Tom Holland as Spidey. Perfect. He has an incredible balance between the web-slinger and teenager Peter Parker. He was introduced into the MCU nicely and was actually involved a lot more than I had expected, which was a great surprise. He handles the comedy with absolute ease and had the entire theatre laughing in all of his scenes. I am stunned and cannot wait to see more of him!Music by Henry Jackman is just as tense and gritty as it was in 'The Winter Soldier' and as the screenplay evolves, the new 'Civil War' theme gravitates to the foreground. Instead of a mash of motifs, Jackman decided that it would be easier to have one overall theme. I appreciate this decision.My verdict; Captain America: Civil War had major potential to be a disappointment. But luckily the Russo brothers came through just as they did before with a complete masterpiece. This is now my favourite MCU instalment by far. Go and see this movie.Captain America: Civil War, 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Some have called it Avengers 2.5. Make no mistake, this is without doubt Captain America 3.","Some have called it Avengers 2.5. Make no mistake, this is without doubt Captain America 3.After the last Captain America film (The Winter Soldier), expectations were sky high for the next instalment. The Winter Soldier was an extremely high quality film that introduced the titular character to us in a compelling way as well as cementing the relationship between Cap and Bucky. Then we moved on to the destruction of Sokovia, brought about because of Tony Stark. We explored the increasing divide amongst members of the Avengers team during Age of Ultron.This is effectively where we pick up in Civil War. Team Cap vs. Team Iron Man. One team is all for an overseeing body of people to keep the Avengers in check; this is the Iron Man camp. While the other team if absolutely against the idea; this is the Captain's camp. Cap has already put his trust in a governing body in the shape of S.H.I.E.L.D. only to be betrayed and find out it was Hydra all along. After watching all the promos, you may has chosen a side. But you will constantly be changing your mind while watching this film.You may also have worried about how high could the stakes be. The promos may have not convinced you, but you have nothing to worry about. I genuinely feared that we may lose one or two characters. Whether we do or not is for you to find out.I only have one negative so I'll get that out of the way. It is an ongoing struggle with the majority of Marvel movies; the token 'bad guy'. Maybe it is just me, but the villain's agenda seemed a little convoluted. He didn't really have much to do. In the end, it serves the plot so not too big of an issue overall. After some thought, I may even go as far as to say that there could have been other ways to further the story making this villain unnecessary. It just means there is more time to focus on the struggle between Team Cap and Team Iron Man. I appreciate that neither of those camps were portrayed as right or wrong - it goes back and forth making it a constant struggle.The performances are outstanding. To think that some of these actors are playing their respective characters fifth or sixth time and yet bring their A game every single time and add a layer of nuance every time is fascinating to me. It just goes to show how well these actors now know their characters, how comfortable they are with each other and how much fun they must have making these movies to continue to improve film after film. The newcomers are very impressive too; so was their introduction into the story itself. It all felt organic to the story. Chadwick Boseman brings a sense of gravitas to Black Panther which makes me very excited for his solo film. And then there's Spider-Man. The one people have been most excited to see. I won't say much at all except that he is one of the highlights of the entire film.The other highlight...an absolutely phenomenal action set piece at the airport. You haven't even seen a tenth of it in the promos. I was filled with a pure sense of wonder and cinematic joy while watching it. You will see things you've never seen before. Quite possibly the best action scene I have seen in a comic book film.I could continue to wax lyrical about this film. But in short, although it is still fresh in my mind, Captain America: Civil War is tied with Avengers Assemble as my favourite Marvel film so far. They nailed the drama, they nailed the action, they nailed the humour and most importantly they balanced all of that while giving all the characters their due. The Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a masterful job. This is the 13th outing from Marvel in their cinematic universe and they have absolutely knocked it out of the park; surely this is unprecedented.

Seemed as if minds of superheroes were toggled.,"It's strange how we were introduced to the characters of Iron man and captain America in earlier versions of Avenger movies. It never seemed like Iron man could go for the version which accepts rules to fight by getting in accordance with UN. Furthermore, it would be Captain America to oppose such a bond laid down by UN. Well this was something my mind could not accept in some way so I rated it less. Well if that is something that does not come to your mind you will definitely find movie to be great.I don't know why the movies with single superheroes pleases me more than multiples ones. If you are a marvel fan you would definitely like this so go for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"As a massive fan of the MCU, I have been eagerly awaiting Captain America Civil War for months. I had such high hopes and expectations and the film does not disappoint. In fact, it exceeds my expectations. I personally really liked age of ultron (AOU) however this film juggles all of the characters perfectly and has learned from the negatives raised from that installment. It gives each character their moment and does them all justice.This film is a sequel to AOU and equally a sequel to the Winter Soldier, yet each previous MCU installment is touched upon in this movie. The building blocks previously set up in previous movies helps for the politics of the film to be relatable, interesting and entertaining, an aspect which is often done so poorly in other movies (look at the Star Wars prequels!!) This allows for a patient yet gripping film from the onset and doesn't rely on constant action and fight scenes. The reasons each hero chooses a particular side is justified and understandable. Iron mans decision to stand against cap is also justified and paints the character in a new light in my opinion. You genuinely feel for both characters. The action is brilliant and is arguably the best of any superhero movie. The film has some genuinely upsetting and emotional moments yet manages to then flip it to moments of laughter and humour. The timing is sublime.Overall Civil War is a mature movie that raises the bar for the genre. It surpasses the winter soldier which I believe was the best superhero movie to date and leaves the MCU in such an interesting and exciting position. I can't wait to see more.

"Avengers: UN mandated, or in violation of the prohibition of enhanced force","An American fantasy action film; A story about a superhuman soldier who is propelled into conflict with his Avengers teammate, Iron Man, over a system of government control over their actions. Collateral damage comes home to roost for the Avengers superhero adventurers this time around. The broad topical element of the story makes it more substantive and mature compared to the previous films in the series, and the fighting sequences have a little more purpose. Showcasing the dynamics of their abilities is also interesting. The set pieces go on too long, but they are impressive in their construction. Tension reduces because the story doesn't explain why the allies are opposing each other with lethal intent. But, all in all, this was an exhilarating adventure. As an aside, what the producers gain by satisfying the demands for a bigger ensemble of superhero characters from their committed, fanatical Marvel Universe audience, they lose in credibility with the majority audience, who will feel the films have become overstuffed with characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers: Civil War,"For the past eight years, and a combined total of thirteen movies, Marvel has been doing everything right for when it came to CBM's. Even their less than stellar films (Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron) still managed to bring the fun, because in the end that's what we want: something fun and memorable.I loved the new Captain America movie; however, I don't think the title is fitting. I think it should have been Avengers: Civil War, because honestly that's what it was. With Captain America in the title he should have the dominating presence of the whole film. Instead, each character has equal shared screen time.One thing that this movie does well is it brings on the emotions, and hard. As a friend of mine said once we were done watching the movie, ""I never expected to cry this much during a Marvel movie."" That's one of the biggest driving factors the movie has. You feel for every single character for different reasons. It's not only emotional for the characters on screen, it's also emotional for the viewers watching, maybe even more so because we're connecting with them all.The action and fight choreography is amazing. Watching Black Panther fight was like watching a ballet. Winter Soldier is an all-around badass. Everything he does (the good and the bad) leaves your mouth open in awe.Finally, we have a great villain. This man isn't just evil for the sake of being evil. He has a backstory that justifies what he's doing. He has a motive, and his motive is actually pretty rational, even though it's not right. Plus, he actually pulled it off. When you start sympathizing with the enemy, the filmmakers are doing something right.I had my reservations about the new Spiderman at first, but after watching him in action I can sigh with relief. Black Panther is hands down my favorite part of the movie. His character is strong- willed, he knows what he wants, and he sets out to do it no matter what. He's also very calm and rational in what he does. He's respectable, as he should be. Both Ant-man and Spiderman offer up some great comic relief.The way this movie was made is how all movies should be made, not just CBM's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Despite its duration it can entertain despite inconsistencies,"The Russo brothers had the enormous task of preparing a film with too many protagonists. Hence, the duration is exaggerated which obviously forces you to consume for sure in theaters. The drama is that there are moments where the movie is exhausting until suddenly fights between old friends ensue; the latter is the only thing that saves the film. We see that there is space for showing off for everyone and we must understand that this film is not a work of art but a machine that must generate money. From that point of view it works. From the artistic, dramatic or humorous point of view, an attempt was made to express the idea of redemption, struggle with the past, loss of family members, and choose between what is right and what is necessary. But still this film lacked enough to be memorable. There are dazzling parts but that quality doesn't last throughout the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel's finest to date,"'Superhero fatigue' is a phrase commonly batted around amongst critics and forum lurkers whenever a new caped crusader is unleashed into cinemas. Cries of Hollywood running out of ideas are often heard too. Despite all of this, the likes of Spider-Man, Batman and the Avengers crew have Hulk-smashed the box office for years. Most impressively, Marvel's ever-increasing 'Cinematic Universe' has been building now for 8 years and 13 films, films that occasionally claw in over a billion at the box-office. This is not down to audiences simply flocking to the promise of CGI explosions and wise-cracks, but Marvel's insistence on keeping the formula fresh.After a few years churning out average to above-average (and one excellent in 2008's Iron Man) origin stories for the individuals that would, in 2012, reluctantly team up to become The Avengers, producer Kevin Fiege was obviously wary of wavering interests. Marvel's work since 2014, since the mediocre Thor: The Dark World in 2013, has been exceptional, placing their heroes and villains in a variety of cinematic genres. Captain America: The Winter Soldier played out like a 70's spy thriller, casting Robert Redford to reinforce the tone, Guardians of the Galaxy often felt like bizarre B-movie with a bigger budget and a more talented cast, and Ant-Man, a movie many predicted to be a disaster, was a full-on comedy, bolstered by the presence of an effortlessly charming Paul Rudd.The latest - and by far the best - is the third and possibly final entry into the stand-alone Captain America series. Retaining The Winter Soldier's directors Anthony and Joe Russo and also much of the same tone, Civil War pits its second most popular superhero against its first, Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man. Also along for the ride is almost every other hero on the roster, along with a couple of new ones. But what makes Civil War very much a Captain America film and not The Avengers 3 is the Russo's remarkable grasp of their characters. With Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) back on the scene as a very wanted man, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself torn between his loyalty to an old friend and being held accountable for his superhero actions. It is the friendship between the two that remains at the heart of the film.When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) accidentally causes mass destruction in Lagos on a mission led by Captain America, the Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that the United Nations are passing a bill known as the Sokovia Accords, which will see them under the control of a UN panel. Full of guilt over his balls-up with creating Ultron, Tony Stark backs the bill, as do War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Vision (Paul Bettany). With little confidence in the government, Steve opposes the bill, and is followed by Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant- Man. Tensions are raised higher when The Winter Soldier is accused of bombing the UN conference in Vienna and becomes a wanted man all over the world.What makes Civil War such a gripping film is its refusal to offer any easy answers. Depending on your own political and personal views, Captain America could be the antagonist of his own movie, causing a war between friends over his blind loyalty to a friend he knows is a mass-murderer, albeit a brain-washed super soldier experiment. On the flip-side, the character Downey Jr. has now immortalised and the hero to always receive top billing could become a knee-bending traitor seeking accountability for his own irresponsible actions during the events of Age of Ultron. More likely, and more interestingly, you will come to realise that there is simply no right answer.So it all comes down to who wins the fight. And what a fight it is. One of biggest flaws of Batman v Superman was its failure to come up with a believable scenario that would cause the good guys to beat on each other only to come to realise they are on the same side. Not only does the brawl feel organic, taking place at Leipzig airport with each character allowed more than one moment to shine, but it also refuses to offer any easy solution or a big bad for the team to unite against. The motivation and plan of the film's villain, Helmut Zemo, played with a remarkable subtlety by Daniel Bruhl, is kept a mystery until near towards the end. And just when you think you finally know where it's all heading, it side-steps you and goes in a completely different direction.The film's biggest flaw is the introduction of Spider-Man, who is finally back in the hands of Marvel after Sony's failure to re-boot the franchise with Andrew Garfield. Played by Tom Holland, who is the best Peter Parker yet, his entry into the fold feels shoe-horned and slightly awkward. But when he is let loose during the airport fight, he damn near steals it until Ant-Man shows his new friends just what he can do. The other newbie, Black Panther aka the Wakandan T'Challa (a gravelly Chadwick Boseman), plays a bigger role than you might expect, still learning and developing into the king he will become. Above all else, Civil War is simply a blast. With such care taken with its army of characters, each getting their own arc, its easy to become emotionally invested. So when Cap and Iron Man really get down to business, it becomes unbearable to think that one of them may not walk away. Bravo, Marvel and the Russo's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Winter Soldier is so rad,"Often the discussion comes up about what's been the best Comic Book movie? My vote is these 2 Winter Soldier movies, then the Thors, then Xmen First class and Future past. Civil War was as fun as any comic I've ever read. Great direction, the action wasn't too drawn out. There were parts in the last 2 Avengers movies that I just went to bathroom for because they were boring and felt unnecessary. Not a lot of boring filler, family, stuff here. Some. I wanted to see Wanda showcase her Scarlet Witch powers more, and did. The cameos are terrific. A lot of fun despite the severity of the tone. And that brings me to the main thing I liked about it: there wasn't some world ending, galaxy shattering, sci-fi, global domination plot. I think a lot of people prefer grounded, gritty, spy/action stuff. I loved the Thor movies but I'd take submarines and fighter jets over rainbow roads and elves. I'll take robot arms and heroes from Queens over Vikings and games of thrones. Winter Soldier is just my style",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The film certainly interesting,"The film certainly interesting but super heroes too much and often removed about a super exchange, human spider.

Each film Marvel falls bag reviews like ""OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST superhero movie, it such an original, with such a plot, such characters and unrealistic twist, THIS ten out of ten."" And in fact it turns clowning with jokes through word fights, which destroyed the city in which no one dies.

The most cinematic Marvel film yet!,"Captain America isn't just one of the best superhero films, it is an outstanding film outside of the genre. There is so much going on in Civil War that you'd think the film would never be able to keep with all of it. New characters, huge set pieces and multiple plot lines coming to a head. However the direction and writing handles everything with a resounding respect and pace that makes this film spectacular.Old characters like Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow are given new nuances and interactions that keep there characters from becoming stale with Robert Downey Jr. delivering his best performance as Iron Man yet. Newer characters like Winter Solider, Ant-Man and Vision are also given great moments that don't distract from what's important and Spider-Man and Black Panther are excellent new additions to the formula.What is most effective about Civil War is that it combines the political intrigue and believability with the fun and large scale of The Avengers together seamlessly making this the most realistic and enjoyable looks into the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) yet. If I had one criticism of the film, it would be about the villain who seems very pointless and confusing until his motivations are revealed at the end of the film. Once this happens your perspective on the character changes into something quite unexpected that fits perfectly into the films tone and messaging.Good - Fantastic Action Sequences - Multi-layered characters and storytelling - Well paced comedy and realism - A film with suspense and consequencesBad - Villains motivations are unclear and jarring to begin with.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Infuriating blame game of which was not even founded on a sane premise.,"No spoilers:From a scene in the first fifteen minutes of the movie:
Few movies have made me hateful. However the blaming of a character for the death of ten people when that very action saved a hundred people...w...t....F! Not to mention the complete disregard for the fact that the character had not intended for anyone to die at all......Sooo much in the movie revolves around this event ...and so...just...grrrrrr.I have loved almost every MCU movie. Civil War and Age of Ultron are two blemishes on the stretch of great movies for me though. I liked all three Thors, all of Cap's, both of GOTG, both Ant-mans, all of the Spider-mans including Far From Home, and I even enjoyed all of the Iron Mans. I know lots of people disliked Iron Man two and three, a lot disliked Thor Dark World, and a lot disliked GOTG 2. I liked them all myself. However the bickering and blame game drama of Civil War and Ultron just contaminated those two movies for me a bit too much.I detested the dumbing down of the governments. You see this in lots of hollywood movies. At least in Transformers Bumblebee the dumbing down was done in a humorous manner that sort of made fun of itself. This one just treated people who work in the gov't like selfish corrupt idiots.I saw this way back when it was in theaters. I remember how I was just annoyed how they dumbed down the characters just to make them argue. It just infuriated me that they were all just bickering with each other and being idiots. Not the heroes I wanted to see. A bunch of blame game out-of-character nonsense. What is worse is that the arguments weren't even rational. It is like they just needed to create some fake drama filler as if this were a stupid reality tv show.There WERE lots of GOOD things in this movie, but I'm keeping it at just six out of ten because these negatives really weighed on my mind throughout the movie. For the plot itself to be compromised...dang it really bummed me out. I do advise watching it if you are going to watch Infinity War or Endgame. There are some good things in these Ultron and Civil War that I am glad I didn't miss out on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I can't Take This Anymore...,"Yet another unoriginal bland superhero movie packed full of clich√©s blah blah blah blah.I'll start off by saying that I'm aware that these movies are supposed to be fun and not taken all too seriously, but I'm sorry, that is not a sufficient excuse for such an effortless straight up boring script and narrative throughout many recent (and particularly this) Marvel films that have come about, aside from maybe Ant-Man and Deadpool it seems like these movies are just carbon copies of each other each more unoriginal and irrelevant than the last, and yet critics eat up this uninspired drivel over and over.There is almost nothing unique about this film, and this is coming from someone that is relatively familiar with the civil-war comic books, this film lacks any of the depth, complexities or tension that was contained in the source material. Characters are completely one dimensional and never get seriously hurt, knowing they will never die takes any suspense away from the drawn out CGI fight-scenes completely. The narrative and dialogue is just poorly written and beyond all entirely dull, there aren't even character arks, its just damn bland badly written story with no outstanding qualities at all. I find it extremely difficult to care about any of these characters really especially given the comically black and white nonsensical positions that start this very anti-climactic ""Civil War"" to begin with.There isn't really more to say, if you like ultimately uninteresting mindless action films I suppose you might like this, but thats all that can really be said for it.There are many characters that aren't even one-dimensional and they borderline on figures to fill the screen and plot-devices *cough cough* Falcon and Hawkeye *cough cough*The brand new spiderman is somehow manages to be even worse than Garfield's even with his very limited and completely unnecessary addition to the movie, his costume is Green-Lantern level bad, anyone who says differently is lying to themselves.Thats my take, truthfully I hated this movie, and this is coming from someone who, for the most part enjoyed the last Avengers movie for what it was, but the fact that these glaring flaws continue to be ignored by moviegoers and critics alike is nothing short of maddening.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
this can be considered as the classic of the comic action film!,"Well well well , Marvel have done it again ! What an amazing movie that was. excellently Written movie , from the start to the end this movie was so brilliant. Weeks before this movie was released I was wondering how they would fit every characters role on screen but I was excelled at how good it was. Each character had an perfect amount of screen time. The movie was very well paced so it kept me extremely interested throughout the whole movie. Also the story line was brilliantly produced that I could not have imagined. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland played Black Panther and Spiderman beautifully which was a relief. All in all Captain America Civil War Was a great movie and broke a lot of expectations !

Another amazing addition to the MCU!,"I was optimistic but cautious going into this movie. Marvel has been on such an amazing run recently that I thought that they have to slip up at some point... right? And with so many superheroes in 1 movie without Whedon at the helm, I was concerned.Needless to say I was worried for nothing! The story was set-up brilliantly and continued going strong for the remainder of the film. The Avengers have had their problems here and there in the past, but things finally reached boiling point after a mission turned south and more innocent people died.Our 2 new characters were great, Black Panther and Spiderman both had great introductions and both felt like they actually had something to do rather than just be there for the sake of the plot. Speaking of Spiderman, Tom Holland did a great job! When cast people thought he didn't look the part and that he looked too young, whether you still think that or not you can't deny he played the part really well and I for one am really looking forward to 'Homecoming' and seeing what more Tom has too offer.Overall brilliantly crafted movie, the Marvel juggernaut continues to keep moving forward without a hitch.

Accountability of superheroes and precarious conflicts,"Ultron was Tony Stark's innovation that was meant to withstand future onslaughts from the threats of the Universe. However, due to the maligned nature of Loki's sceptre, the Age of Ultron wreaked havoc on Sokovia, while the Avengers scrambled to prevent collateral damage as the city was raised to the skies and yet, not everyone could be saved. Nations become suspicious of the unchecked powers of Earth's mightiest heroes and those who lost their families due to their actions, seek to avenge them. Thus, 'Civil War' is partly an aftermath of 'Age of Ultron' and partly a follow-up to 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' mainly due to Bucky's presence. The Russo brothers enter the 3rd phase of MCU and stick to the formula that has worked wonders for Disney/Marvel in keeping with a brighter, entertaining tone.We start in 1991, with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) being sent on a mission to retrieve a serum from a car. The driver of the car isn't revealed quite yet but that proves to be quite a twist at the very end. Current day in Nigeria, a group of Avengers disrupt Brock Rumlow's (Frank Grillo) attempt to steal a bio weapon. Their encounter leads to Rumlow detonating an explosive under his vest and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) directing its effects away from the busy marketplace. Unfortunately, it leads to the death of several humanitarian workers from Wakanda who were in the building nearby. Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reveals his impressive sample of future technologies to M.I.T. students and generously offers to fund all of their research projects. There, he meets a grieving mother who lost her son in Sokovia, reminding Stark of the failures and uncontrolled powers of the superheroes.Too much damage has been done even with their best intentions and efforts. Accountability was thus proposed by a United Nations panel through the Sokovia Accords that would control their actions. US Secretary of State, Ross convinces them of no other way but to sign in its favor. Tony agrees due to his bad decisions and experiences, Captain (Chris Evans) disagrees because of his suspicion of those who rule with agendas. One prefers accountability by external authority while the other prefers the freedom to act as he assumes that the safest hands are still their own.The Accords themselves weren't much to quarrel over since the scenario was inevitable but it's the explosion at the UN Conference in Vienna that really tears them apart. The Wakandan King, who was a strong proponent of the Accords, perishes in the attack and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is determined to bring the suspect to justice. The suspect being the Winter Soldier. Automatically, Cap saves his bro-friend Bucky on every attack from the government, Ironman and T'Challa's mysterious form of Black Panther. This exciting introduction of a powerful warrior expands the might of the Avengers in general with his formidable abilities and skills. Thereafter, it was upon Stark and Cap Rogers to recruit new members and convince existing ones to take a moral stance in their favor. To make things even, we have Spiderman on team Ironman and Ant- Man on team Cap. Their action sequences are immense fun and Tom Holland's teenage Spider-boy is nimble, agile although quite talkative like his character in the comics. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man takes up some surprising form and plays a big role in the airport fight. This seemingly half hour-ish sequence at a German airport is certainly the film's highlight and showdown of the two teams that is regarded as Civil War.The plot drags on further as Stark investigates the actual events that transpired before Cap's escape with the Winter Soldier and his findings reveal a deeper ploy by Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) to divide them even further. His revelation of the 1991 incident involving the Winter Soldier opens up traumatic wounds for Stark and it leads them into a more serious combat that breaks the trust between Cap and Ironman. The heaviness of a divided team of superheroes only bears down on us thereafter and it took the Russo brothers over 2 hours 20 minutes to convince us. The motivations for many of the characters remain a bit casual for them to really take sides and stand against their fellow Avengers. Scarlett deserves a Black Widow movie but she's losing the grip on her audience as Natasha doesn't have much influence over others. Black Panther's only reason for joining Ironman is to take down Bucky and Boseman is a brilliant T'Challa. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is just inconvenienced with all this while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) gets adventurous in his second outing with the Cap. War Machine (Cheadle) represents the Government's interests and is close enough to Stark to influence his decisions. Vision (Paul Bettany) spends the entire airport sequence trying to keep Wanda away from harming anyone and without his superhero suit, looks quite weird adorning a sweater. Spider-Man is just stoked to be called upon by Mr. Stark and Tom Holland portrays the excitement to showcase his powers and the fear of Aunt May discovering them, quite naturally. Ant-Man is just happy to be among his heroes and Paul Rudd brings the credibility of a common guy honored to be working with his heroes. But again, this theme has worked well for Marvel and shall continue to do so because the general audience prefers the levity with the action.'Civil War' does less to lead up to the upcoming Infinity Wars and more to introduce new characters and reboots. In the absence of Thor, who is busy with far greater threats, the stakes aren't high enough for the Avengers right now but they do need to keep themselves in check, even if through an international panel and they must resolve their unsettled differences if they want to be the Earth's mightiest heroes.8.588 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Probably the greatest superhero movie so far,"The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is amazing, although a few too many shaky cams so not top grades. The acting is absolutely amazing and the chemistry between the characters is great. Spiderman is fantastic and Elizabeth Olsen is great, and Robert Downey Jr. is one of the best actors alive today. Only the Vision that I am not so sure off, I was not sure after AoU and not sure now... I hope he is one of the characters that dies in Infinity wars.The story/plot is also very good. You will buy the premise and the stakes are very high. The setup at the end is just brilliant, and although this is a superhero movie, it has more in-common with Winter Soldier and spy thrillers then the Avengers.The villain is one of the best ever. His motivation, plot and execution of said plot is brilliant. A villain that actually succeeds and ""wins"" in a superhero movie, how is that for a twist?Entertainment-wise this might be the best ever made. There is always something going on, usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. The airport fight scene alone is the best entertainment you will ever see, but personally I believe the last fight is the best of all time. Let me repeat; once you are over the fight at the airport and you go wow and think you will never see anything better, you do.... A perfect score! If you are in it for action and entertainment, you will love this movie!In total a 9 within the genre, perhaps an 8 otherwise. Personally I believe this, all things considered, to be the best superhero movie ever made.Captain America civil war is a must see and if you only have money for one movie this year, this is where you pay up.

An embarrassment to the genre,"I found myself observing this film with a feeling of mild amusement, pondering over how the hell this franchise has gained so much traction and popularity. Smash, punch, abominable one-liner, rinse, repeat.The traditional elements of a superhero movie have been totally removed, replaced by unrelatable shiny suits and often totally unexplained superpowers. Personal growth, strength in the face of adversity, finding you've got something special when you feel ordinary: that's a superhero movie.Give me Deadpool, GOTT or the original Spiderman. Give me some depth, story, even a touch of reality.They might as well have filmed this whole movie in a wrestling ring and saved a few million dollars. I'm sure the kids that bump it up to a shocking 8.5 on IMDb would still be quaking with excitement behind their 3-D specs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An above average Marvel movie,"If Captain America: The Winter Soldier wasn't enough proof that the Russo brothers are some of the most capable superhero movie directors of our time, this is. Captain America: Civil War is possibly one of the best directed superhero movies ever made. The story is very well thought out and does justice to the characters, while simultaneously developing said characters beyond what we've seen of them in previous movies. It's surprising that even though this is the fifth movie starring Chris Evans as Captain America, there still seems to be things we can learn about him. I was never the biggest Captain America fan, and as I went in to the cinema I was decidedly on Iron Man's team, but you cannot help but feel very conflicted between the two from start to finish. The Russos' keep you gripped for the entire movie, and there really isn't a dull moment. Perhaps that's because of the constant flow of action sequence after action sequence, which felt overwhelming at times (pretty much every ten minutes or so another giant fight took place). However in my eyes this was undoubtedly the best action in any superhero movie (the sequence in the airport is nothing short of mesmerising), from The Avengers to The Dark Knight. The story is also surprisingly thought-provoking, as it not only explores themes never before seen in a Marvel movie but also continues to show the Russos' talent for storytelling.What Civil War does particularly well is manage the great cast of characters it has, both new and old. This has often been a problem in previous Marvel movies, for example both Avengers movies always kept some characters sidetracked. However there was none of that here, and each of the many, many characters in this movie had some very memorable moments. Past supporting characters such as Vision and Falcon were given lots of time and energy, although ultimately once again it was Captain America and Iron Man who took the spotlights. This movie is really a sequel to 2014's The Winter Soldier, and was heavily focusing of Sebastian Stan's Bucky, and his relationship with Captain America. The main new editions to the cast, Black Panther and Spiderman, were thoroughly well-written, fantastic characters that by the end you will be very excited for their upcoming movies. Tom Holland did a great job as the most realistic, grounded Peter Parker we have ever seen - suddenly everyone is glad they didn't bring back Andrew Garfield. Although for me, Black Panther was the most interesting and the character I enjoyed watching the most, due to his fantastic place in the story and of course Chadwick Boseman's great portrayal of the character. The only other person really worth mentioning was Daniel Br√ºhl's Zemo - a surprisingly well fleshed-out villain who instantly surpassed any of Marvel's other (usually very forgettable) villains.

Those were 2 and 1/2 hours of my life I'd gladly spare again,"I am not going to spoil anything on this review, because it is best to go and watch this movie without knowing anything. Bear in mind that it's a long movie, but it never lets your interest flow away, not even for a second. Now, for the review:Plot: Not a single complaint. The story catches up from The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and tries to tie up what happened to the Winter Soldier, uncover some things about his past, which weren't shown too much in the previous Captain America movie, and show the devastation that the events in Age of Ultron left behind. Every character has his story and reason behind their final decision to side with either Iron Man or Captain America, and they never deviate from them. Everyone has a part, and the movie ties them all in a splendid, seamless way.Cinematography: You'd think you were in the fights and conversations yourself, right beside the characters. Many different places are used, and they all contribute to the general drama/action feeling of the movie. Every fight is just amazing, more so than the Avengers.Acting: Flawless. From everyone. Especially Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackey, Chadwick Boseman and the ever amazing Robert Downey Jr. I was really glad that the Russo brothers did not use RDJ in a way that would eclipse the other characters. Daniel Bruhl is a chilling Zemo, driven solely by vengeance, and even though he's not the true villain of the movie, he is definitely the catalyst behind the Civil War.Make no mistake; this is a Captain America movie. It revolves around Cap, his relationships and the aftermath of the decisions he takes when it comes to his closest friend. However, it is done in such a way that you are not fed up by him, or any character. This is a humorous, action packed, plot driven movie, that raises the Marvel bar even higher.10/10 is not enough for this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most thematically ambitious and mature of the Marvel films,"Out of all the Marvel movies, this is the one that I want to love the most, but I can't quite do it. There's so much going on that goes so well, that the fact that it doesn't land as well as it should and has a couple of large distractions undermines the affair enough to disappoint me, but not enough to take it from goodness.The Avengers are causing collateral damage. They're doing good work, but they're also hurting people along the way. The governments of the world appreciate the fact that the world isn't being run by Loki, but they feel like a line needs to be drawn and the Avengers need to be reined in. Some Avengers agree, and others do not. This provides the political reason for the split within the Avengers, but the movie doesn't turn it personal early enough, in my opinion. An esoteric fight about the relative limits on Avengers power is a great place to start the conflict of the film, but it hangs on that for too long before it gives us the gut punch change that turns the conflict personal and what drives the final twenty minutes of the film.The Winter Soldier is still on the loose after the events in The Winter Soldier, and it looks like he's bombed a UN complex in Vienna when the Sokovia Accords are being signed that will limit the Avengers' authority. This explosion also kills the King of Wakanda, who is there to sign the Accords. A chase ensues after Cap gets a heads up on where Bucky, the Winter Soldier, is, and he helps him escape temporarily until they end up captured and arrested. It is here that Zemo, the actual antagonist of the film, inserts himself, setting off an EMP that kills power in Berlin and gives the secret command codes to Bucky that turns him into the Winter Soldier. Cap gets Bucky away and finds out where Zemo is going next. In order to get to Siberia, Cap and Bucky need to get an aircraft.It is at the airport that the big battle between the heroes breaks out. It's big, inventive, fun, and ultimately pretty pointless (the physical stakes in these movies have gotten laughably low), leading Cap Bucky to getting an airplane, chased by Iron Man and the Black Panther. In Siberia, two hours into the movie, we finally learn Zemo's plan and have the movie move from an political argument to a personal one. Zemo wants to tear apart the Avengers from the inside, knowing he's not physically strong enough to take them on, so he uses the truth that Bucky, as the Winter Soldier, killed Tony Stark's parents to splinter them completely. It's such a great and brutal fight between three people in an enclosed space.Ultimately, as I said earlier, I wanted to love this movie. It's got strong themes of liberty versus regulation that echo through so much of what's going on. It eventually distills that beginning intellectual conflict into a personal one between two heroes we've grown attached to over the years. It looks really good and the action is better filmed than it was in The Winter Soldier. However, the big airport fight, while fun, is pretty pointless. We do get one injury, but that's it, keeping the stakes of these fights really low. There are too many characters that have their moments that don't feed into the larger narrative (Spider-Man being the most egregious example). And Zemo is underdeveloped. I love the idea of Zemo, but the execution is so relegated to the back end of the film that it ends up losing its impact.I'd love to see this movie with a smaller cast that allows for greater focus on the central conflict between Stark and Rogers. I'd love for Zemo to have a strong narrative presence early, and I'd love for the information on Bucky's involvement with Tony's parent's death to come out earlier and define Tony's motives well before the final act. I can imagine scenes where people confront Tony with his opposition ' to Rogers's side because he's driven by revenge, and he needs to balance his ideals with his personal emotions before ultimately giving in to his emotional side.Still, there's so much that's so good here. It has some of the same issues as Age of Ultron, but it does a better job of holding it all together. It also feels like it gets closer to something special, even if it still falls short. It coulda been great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Against All Odds (So to Speak),"War ‚Äì It's kind of funny (but not really) how the word ""war"" pops up and everyone gets a little on the fidgety side. It's like something is wrong every time when war strikes and all hell breaks loose. That's in our world. That's in our society. But we don't live in the fantasy mind of Stan Lee. We were taught that war or violence, for that matter, solves anything. (Yes, this is how I wanted to start out with this review.) In 2011, we were introduced to a young man who lived in Brooklyn with nothing more than the shirt on his back ‚Äì Steve Rogers. All he wanted to do was to fight the bad guy. He got his shot when he was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to become the first superhuman fighting machine, to bring down a ruthless enemy who was plotting an evil that could break the mold of extinction.In 2014, (just 3 years later), Captain America was synonymous, in the very sense of the word in the hearts and minds of every American. That same evil that he fought as The First Avenger, has now infiltrated the government of the United States of America and corrupting the world system.In 2016, we thought we got rid of Hydra, but we were dead wrong. The very existence of the organization was to wipe out the world so they can take over and plot against the Avengers.

Having taken one for the team with the not so nice ""Batman VS Superman"", this was actually a movie worth watching.The plot was there, the story was captivating and all the elements that someone would look for were present. I adored the fact that all the superheroes were treated as equals (although some may overpower others in ""reality"").

Heroes fighting heroes,"Civil War is basically Avengers 2.5 and Marvel throw everything at the film. Interestingly, this film never hit the heights of the previous Avengers film, just odd when you consider everyone involved. The Marvel films at this stage were very connected and started growing towards Infinity Wars. This at the very core is a Captain America film, and a continuation of the first two films. I've never cared for heroes fighting one another, but Captain beating Iron Man is icing on a cake though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Up there with the best comic book films of all time,"Ill keep this review spoiler free. This is quite simply the second best mcu movie only surpassed by the first avengers and easily up there in the top 4 or 5 comic book movies. I put it up, dare i say, with the dark knight (though obviously not AS good). The fight scenes where exquisitely choreographed, it was funny where it fit well but serious when it needed to be. It had real emotion in parts (namely the final fight) and the acting was stunning.The villain was great and i really enjoyed how he used tactics and smarts to defeat the avengers rather than brute force and in a way he succeeded. Though the movie got a bit messy at parts, jumping between locations and characters, it all came together in act 3 and the plot was all tied up.One thing i would say is having watched the winter soldier as well as age of ultron prior to this movie will make the plot more tidy and easier to follow, making it even more enjoyable to watch.All in all, this is 100% worth a watch and its a superbly directed, well shot, well scripted, exhilarating film that is up there with marvels best as well as this genre of action super hero films best.(Btw i would give this about a 9 but since the overall IMDb rating is unfairly skewed because of haters i gave it a 10 as the overall score)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best super heroes movies of all time...,"Captain America trilogy must be one of the best trilogies ever made. I am not a big fan of sequels, and usually the sequels do not outperform their predecessors, in my humble opinion. There are a few rare exceptions of course, like Captain America: Civil War for instance. After the disastrous Batman vs Superman that left a bitter aftertaste, time had come for something more refreshing and engaging, and I must say that Captain America Civil War delivers the goods. It has everything one would expect from a movie...dynamic superheroes with awesome abilities, story, momentum, and the question we ask as to what happens next, which keeps our attention on the big screen. I watched this in the theater and not a soul stirred during the 2.5 hour duration of the movie. All the characters in this movie played out their roles with precision and realism. The fight scenes are excellent (at times funny) as each superhero is matched up against someone else but the seriousness of the fight scenes builds to a crescendo which leaves us with a very satisfying climax to the movie. I have seen most of the Marvel movies in recent years but this by far is one of the best superhero movies ever. You might want to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier again as this is somewhat of a continuation of where that movie left us off. Overall, I give this movie a deserved 10/10 as this is of the best super hero movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
awesome movie,i loved every bit of it..it was the best of all the marvel movies..i have watched it already two times..and i am still planning of watching it again.. lol i never wrote a review before for any movie..but this..and Chris Evans..he did really awesome in this movie.. after all it was HIS movie lol..i really hope there will be another captain America part..because i love watching Chris Evans a captain America..this role really suits him.. Russo brothers did not disappoint us.. the overall acting by the characters was amazing.. actions O MY GOD!! especially the actions done by scarlet Johanson story was pretty smooth with literally no flaws..actually the best story ever.. they showed the different part of super heroes..in normal superheroes movie it is all about how to fight with the villain..but in this movie there is no villain and you have to fight with your friends:D <3,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interminable,"I found this movie to be quite tedious. Fight scene after fight scene separated by slow parts of dialog. Some parts were funny and well written, but the entire movie is not well written. I have seen most of the Avenger movies, but still did not recognize all the characters or know their back story. This is the typical action movie where the government is stepping in to shut down the action figures. Just like in Bourne, Bond, and Mission Impossible. Must be written by Republicans who think all government is evil. Can't we have a different threat or bogey man? The real bogeyman here is not that interesting and has capabilities way beyond a his stature in life. And, how many superhero movies do we have to sit through where superhero fights superhero. Hey they are indestructible so why keep fighting? The scenes just take up space on the screen and add to the CGI budget. The fights don't advance the story at all. There was four adults who saw this movie in my group, and all of us could hardly wait till it was over.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"They did well, but i'm not feeling excited anymore","I still remember my first Marvel movie, the iron man I released in 2008 when I'm still in high school.(Spiderman doesn't count) I've never heard iron man before neither marvel universe, I went because I happened to have to one coupon and it was the only action movie at that time. My big-boy personality was brought up by all the cool armor stuff. And since then I watched every marvel superhero movies in the cinema. 8 years after it. I'm still sitting in the cinema watching Captain America III. The whole scene is even better than the avengers, gathering new team members and enhance the old. Even Spiderman get re-made. The scene at the airport is awesome and clearly they have way more budgets than dead pool. But I'm not getting excited any more; all they do are just hunting villains saving the world and people are still stupid enough to live in the super crowded cities waiting something bad happens. Maybe the only one who changes is Tony; he used to be a typical playboy and gradually grown up into someone thinks of the society. 8 years later, Tony's boyhood is over and so do I.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horrible,"This movie didn't know what it wanted to be, it was like this amorphous blob that was trying to be 12 things at once and it failed at all of them.The movie pacing is terrible, it will slow down and speed up just to get the next scene and the character running around shouting plot.Some of actors really phone in their performance and it shows.Finally it seems that black widow can never get hurt, ever.I like female heroes, (Xena, Alice from resident evil, captain Janeway, Scully, lora croft, )but when a female hero like Black widow is shoehorned in for the sake of some pseudo-faux feminism then its garbage which is exactly what it was.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfection in movie form,"I wrote a glowing review on here for Age of Ultron, and I watched it again recently and it wasn't as good as I remember. So I wanted Civil War to be better, and it's better in every single aspect, from the plotting to the action scenes. The plot is that collateral damage from an event divides the Avengers, and it ends with civil war. That is a very broad summary but I don't want to spoil it. The plot is considered, well planned and intriguing with many elements pulling together to make a thrilling plot with surprises along the way. Unlike Avengers 2, the story isn't messy and it's more interesting as it doesn't hinge on huge action scenes. So a perfect story. The new characters are very nicely introduced, such as Black Panther who is important in the story and isn't crowded out by the other members of the team. The fact that all the characters feel more connected and he makes a valuable addition to the Marvel Universe. The only thing missing is a comedic connection, but this is made up for with some spectacular action.The action scenes are stunning. The one at the airport is one of the best I've seen, as it's so well directed and it shines with the new additions to the team. The film isn't all action though and some of the more touching, character driven moments really ring true through the fights. The whole film, from the way it's directed, to the action, to characters is all perfectly played and perfectly done. I can' really think of a single fault, the lack of comedy isn't really an issue as the film flies along at a great pace. The film doesn't feel as long as it is, and that is always the sign of a perfect film.Overall, all elements of Civil War are stunning. There is nothing wrong with it and it's certainly the best Marvel film to date and we, as superhero movie fans, couldn't of asked for anything more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"My all time favorite movie, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One of the best superhero movies, of all time.","Captain America: Civil War takes place after the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015) & Ant-Man(2015). When the Avengers cause another international incident, most of the governments of the world, think they should be held accountable for their actions. The United Nations comes up with the Sokovia Accords. According to the Accords, the American government is going to take control of the actions of the Avengers. Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) is against it but, Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) is for it. This causes a major confrontation between the two former allies. The rest of the Avengers, are obligated to choose sides. Meanwhile, Zemo(Daniel Bruhl) has his own nefarious plans.Captain America: Civil War is an outstanding movie. Marvel has hit the jackpot, yet again. Directors Anthony & Joe Russo have made another masterpiece, after Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014). In fact, this film surpasses the previous Captain America solo adventure. The future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in good hands, with the Russo brothers. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. The action is breathtaking. The airport set piece & the climax of the film, are some of its highlights. Before watching this movie, I was worried that Captain America would be sidelined in his own film, due to the presence of almost all the Avengers. I didn't have to bother. This still feels very much like Cap's solo adventure. Don't worry though. The rest of the Avengers like, Iron Man, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier(Sebastian Stan), Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie), Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine(Don Cheadle), Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner), T'Challa/Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), Vision(Paul Bettany), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen), Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd) & Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), still get plenty of time to shine. This superhero showdown truly becomes flawless, due to its power packed performances. Chris Evans is spectacular as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans showcases different layers of emotions, both subtle & not so subtle, with panache. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr.'s supreme acting ability finally comes out, in his sixth portrayal of Iron Man. This is because, Stark showcases various emotions despite his trademark wit & sarcasm, this time around. Scarlett Johansson is superb as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Sebastian Stan is awe-inspiring as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Anthony Mackie is awesome as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Don Cheadle is great as Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Paul Bettany is excellent as Vision. Elizabeth Olsen is good as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Paul Rudd is hysterical as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Tom Holland is amazing in his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I am looking forward to Holland's solo Spidey movie. Daniel Bruhl is mind blowing as Zemo. Apart from Loki, he's the second most memorable Marvel Cinematic Universe villain. Emily VanCamp is great as Sharon Carter. Frank Grillo is effective as Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Kani, John Slattery & Hope Davis are impressive in their small but significant roles as, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Everett K. Ross, May Parker, King T'Chaka, Howard Stark & Maria Stark, respectively. Captain America: Civil War is a must watch, for pretty much everyone.

Perhaps the best MCU-film of all,"#MCUrewatch. Cap 3 is truly a great, great film. Its greatest strength: pitting Captain America against Iron Man. These two man have been opposites right from the first Avengers film. And here they have different opinions regards the Sokovia Treatment. And the great thing is: you can understand both their opinions on this difficult matter. This film doesn't have a simple black and white storyline. It is grey and all the more grown up. By this time, the MCU films were critized for their weak antagonists. This film is brilliant in the fact that is has no clear antagonist. Another criticism it tackled: the predictable climaxes where entire cities get destroyed while our heroes fight uninteresting villains and their emotionless minions. This film ends (after the ultimate superhero showdown that is both spectacular and funny) with an emotional climax and a battle of wills between Cap and Iron Man. They made the criticism of Avengers ruining entire cities the core of the plot...brilliant. And if that isn't enough: the directors also deliver on the action, the pace of the story is perfect and it introduces two new great characters (Black Panther and especially Spider Man). A truly great action film and perhaps the best of the entire MCU franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Fun,"As in other stories, society is concerned with the collateral damage done by superheroes and there is a movement to rein in the Avengers. Specifically, the Avengers would work under the authority and supervision of the United Nations--a concept immediately rejected by Captain America (Chris Evans). This conflict parallels the real-life struggle between globalism and nationalism.Those who align with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) accede to the popular demands, while Captain America heads the group that rejects the proposal, making them outlaws. Tony Stark agrees to apprehend the rogue Avengers, setting up a battle between the two groups of superheroes.A significant development is the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) to the conflict. Marisa Tomei plays Peter Parker's Aunt May, which is a welcome addition.The antagonist in the film appears to be Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), but Captain America has doubts. Is he unduly influenced by his decades-old relationship with Bucky?The story about the dissension in the Avengers team paired with great action scenes makes this a strong entry in the canon of the MCU. There is something very elementary about imagining which superhero can beat another superhero, so the battle between the two factions in this film scratches an itch of all fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Avengers vs Avengers,"If you can't beat them, let them beat themselves.That seems to be the motto of this movie and damn it was cool! I'm so glad that it didn't fully focus on Captain America because I personally find Captain America quite boring, but rather on all Avengers.Political disagreements made the Avengers split apart. I was already skeptical of the Avengers' actions: Whenever they were in a large city fighting monstrocities, there would be so much destruction and so many casualities but it was mostly just put aside since it was done for the greater done. I'm not used to this from many classical animes where the protagonist is always this superbly righteous guy making sure that everyone stays alive - even the enemies.But this issue was thematisized in this movie. Some Avengers themselves feel at fault. What shall it be? Controlled by the UN to try to ensure public safety but not be able to act whenever they deem right?With friendship issues and family issues at hand, a civil war unfolds. Which is freaking cool. Surely many fans were wondering who would win a fight if certain Avengers crashed. We got this in an all-out 5v5 which was incredible! They even got Ant-Man!I was also surprised that this was the introduction of Spider-Man. Quite a funny addition actually.All in all, I'm more than pleasantly surprised, though I'm not sure about the resolution of the enemy's actions. Nonetheless, this was a great movie for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great Film, But Very Underwhelming","Best comic book movie ever? Yeah, right.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a far better film than Captain America: Civil War.Zemo was completely underused in this film. In the comics, he was a very manipulative man, like in the film, but is a very skilled fighter and can go toe-to-toe and hold his own against Captain America. In this, he was basically a terrorist, who was out for revenge. Very original. With Lex Luthor in BvS, he wanted to destroy Superman, both physically and mentally, and he wanted absolute power with it as well. They wasted the potential for Zemo in this film.The story overall was very well done, like it's predecessor, The Winter Soldier, but it could've been so much better. It didn't feel like Civil War, it felt more like a school yard brawl. The action sequences were great though. I loved them, but action doesn't make a film great. They barely touched on the original storyline, and just took the title, ""Civil War"", and slapped it under Captain America. Like Marcel Tim said, ""Should have called this Winter Soldier 2 to be honest."" In BvS, Lex made Superman look more like a threat to Batman. That was better executed than Zemo in this film.It seems Marvel/Disney is coughing up money to the critics and give this film acclaim. What every critic is saying about Civil War are complete exaggerations. I think MCU films are losing steam.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Word I Could Use to Describe this Movie is Idiotic,"Captain America: Civil War follows the Avengers after the events of Age of Ultron. The government wants to control the Avengers because people die whenever they save the world, so they want to be able to try to limit that. Steve Rogers doesn't want to be controlled, but Tony Stark thinks that they should, and so everyone picks a side they start fighting over it.I'll start with what I liked about this movie. The fights were a big improvement over those in The Winter Soldier, which I found to be incredibly fake and boring. In one particular fight I liked what they did with Ant-Man's powers, and Iron Man's new suit looks pretty cool.Now what didn't I like about this movie? Oh, where to start. The characters, I guess. They're terrible. It's not that they aren't well developed (although they aren't), but they're all just incredibly stupid. They weren't dumb in the previous movies most of the time, but it was as if between movies everyone except Steve Rogers developed some mental disability. In the first fifteen minutes a character contains a bomb, then un-contains it and throws it at a building, killing a few people inside. Then she cries about it and everyone tells her that it wasn't her fault and she shouldn't worry. What? That could have easily been avoided if she simply didn't do anything else. Apparently she was even too stupid to not do anything. This is only one example of this, however.The whole movie is just fueled by idiots, and the plot only works because of said idiots. Whenever the Avengers save the world a few people might die instead of, you know, seven billion. Which would you prefer? Seriously, no one in this movie thinks anything over. No one ever points out that they'd rather have a couple people die over the entire human race, either. So are we just supposed to act like this idea doesn't exist? Or is every character actually retarded?I was kind of excited for the new Spider-Man, everyone seems to like him a lot so far. Why, I don't know. Tom Holland plays easily the worst Spider-Man I've ever seen. Sure, his suit is pretty cool, but him as a character? Stupidly annoying. He won't shut his mouth. And it's not like he's saying anything funny or clever, he's just being a waste of space for the sake of being a waste of space. He doesn't capture the funny side of Peter Parker, and he doesn't capture the geeky side of him either. He references Star Wars, and maybe some people think that's geeky, but that's about it. Now I don't really care about the source material for movies, but everyone says that he does these things when he really doesn't. I just thought he was obnoxious. And his character didn't even need to exist. Without him the movie would have been the exact same, only Tony Stark's team would briefly have had five people while Steve Rogers had six. ""We need to make it fair, so let's force in a character simply for the sake of getting people excited for another pointless solo movie!"" quote Marvel. Yeah, great idea.I liked Black Panther better. As in I liked his costume and the way he fought. His character was about as flat as everyone else. At least he had a believable and more interesting reason for being where he was. His introduction was a lot better than Spider-Man's, who was pretty forced.By the time the parking lot fight scene ended I was done. But there was still forty-five minutes left, and they weren't fun or enjoyable at all. The forced conflict with the 'villain' wrapped up, and that was that. Now let's talk about the 'villain'. I put that in quotations because he doesn't do anything really. All the characters act like he's a big deal (and so does he), but he doesn't actually do anything. He gets unimportant characters who normally wouldn't have been involved involved in the fight, and that's it. You'd think his motivation would be deeper or bigger than it is in the end, but it isn't.Finally, when I reached the after-credits scene I was pretty disappointed. Not because the scene was lame (although it was) but because it had to do with the actual plot instead of just being a tease at the next movie, which is what these scenes are supposed to be considering the fact that not everyone sits around for the after credits scenes or even knows they exist. You wouldn't put the climax of a movie in the after credits scene right? So why put plot in it?Overall Captain America: Civil War is idiotic. The characters are so indescribably stupid, the plot itself is stupid and relies stupid characters, Spider-Man is annoying and pointless, Black Panther is okay, and the 'villain' is just an excuse to make it a longer movie like Batman v. Superman, the other superhero versus superhero movie that came out this year. Don't listen to this review if you don't want to. If you love Marvel you'll love the crap out of this movie because you people eat this garbage up. But if you're like me and able to see flaw in stuff you like then hopefully you at least see where I'm coming from with this. And in the end there is not a shred of any part of me that would recommend this movie. I would if it were shorter (because it's the new big thing and you should see it to form your own opinion), but two and half hours were stolen from me, hours that I could have used to watch something that would have sucked less, so don't watch this movie if you think these things that I have mentioned will bother you.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Without limits,"Thematically this film has similarities to rival DC Comics/Warner Brothers Batman v Superman. Who watches the Watchmen, sorry superheroes.This is the question asked in Civil War after a disastrous incident in Lagos involving Captain America and his team but the powers that be led by General Ross now the US Secretary of State that various incidents involving The Avengers either as a team or individuals has led to collateral damage. In short, innocent people have died.The film sets up a confrontation between Captain America and Iron Man and the various superheroes choose sides with new additions including Ant Man, Black Panther and Spiderman. Iron Man feels that there should be scrutiny or oversight by an external body like the UN. Captain America has concerns, rightly so after all he revealed Shield as being corrupted in the previous film and so nervous about history repeating itself.History does play an important part in the film. The Winter Soldier has history both with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Something just ripe to be manipulated by the film's villain Zemo who is planning the moves to pit the various heroes against each other.What the directors, the Russos get right here is a layered story with action pieces that are well paced. Some of the action sequences in the early part of the film are maybe too fast and frenetic with almost cartoon like action.The new version of Spiderman is introduced here and along with Ant Man they are there to add zippy humour and expand the Avengers universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Lots of Action, Too many sub plots, Great but over-hyped","There are a lot of intense action scenes but they are not as detailed, unique, and intriguing as they are being praised for. To elaborate, the fight scenes seemed to be fairly average hand to hand combat that gave me the impression that I had seen all those sequence of moves done before on the big screen. In other words seen one seen them all. After a few days of processing my thoughts about the movie I came to the conclusion that many characters were not even necessary and could have been omitted all together along with their side story/sub plots. For example, the Vision, Ant-Man, Spider Man, and (dont kill me, hear me out) Black Panther all could have been left out of this movie and we would probably love it the same. Don't get me wrong they were all awesome in their own way yet they were also somewhat insignificant to the main plot that they could of all been introduced right before the main fight scene, like Spidey, to do their dirt really. The business side of this movie was evident that they just wanted more characters to push box office sales. Introducing black panther felt very ""thrown in there"" like. There was no mystery to it, just a ""hey, oh yeah Im now the King of Wakanda and Black Panther everyone."" I think his inaugural debut should have been an origin story seeing as though he is a lesser known hero in the MCU. Vision being in the movie made was a dud. He is far more powerful than he is made out and extremely under utilized when it comes to major threats against his allies, smh, and he misses his target like he isn't an advanced technological superhero. Did Iron Man really need to recruit a 16 year old to help out. Like where was MARK 50-100 right!? I could go on and on about unnecessary characters so back to the story. It was all over the place and you can tell that they picked and pulled from different decades of the original comics to make the story work for the movie, in which there isn't really a super villain....Zemo. It was like the Mandarin all over again in my opinion. That has to be the biggest upset in the story of all.

Billion dollars in the pocket for Marvel...,"Civil war...hold onto your seats people,because this movie is mind blowing.I personally do not watch many super-hero movies.I have a few names to mention when it comes to it,The Dark Knight trilogy still remains the best super-hero series for me.Now,I know I seriously should not be comparing DC Comic and Marvel universe,but this is exactly the case here.This movie has totally lived up to its expectation.The release of the teasers and trailers did not reveal much of a plot,but it was really well edited and subsequently became a back bone to the success of the film.The story of the film is simple and it stays simple to the very end.There are less elements of suspense throughout the movie which isn't necessarily a bad thing.For this movie,an expectation is panned out in every scene,but the director has given much more than we expect.The director has completely won in every department to capture the audience attention.The highlights of this film is the action scenes.There are three major action scenes in this film.My particular best is the fight scene at the beginning of the movie.Scarlett Johansen has rocked in some action sequences more than the others.The screenplay of the film is brilliant,I honestly did not feel time passing by while watching this 150 minute long film,in fact quite puzzled on short it was.The compelling scenes in the film makes it more interesting along the way.The music was magnificent.Kudos to the music director for understanding the script and composing great epic music.All technical aspects were well handled.Amazing cinematography and perfect VFX made this a greater level of visual experience.Final say,I watched a DC Comic movie this year,and I was totally unimpressed,now I have watched this,and it has become one of the best super-hero movies of all time,in my books.Don't go for a war,go home and watch Civil War...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What Batman v Superman should have been,"Captain America: Civil War is the third Captain America movie with a similar theme to the more hyped up Batman v Superman. While Batman v Superman was an enjoyable movie it failed to live up to the hype. So it was up to Captain America: Civil War to redeem the theme of superheroes facing off against each other, and I'm glad to say it did that.It has a better storyline and it delivers it much more systematically unlike Batman v Superman where it was very slow. It was also able to utilise other Marvel superheroes in a much better way than Batman v Superman. We also get a bit more background behind the characters portrayed in the movie. And the action is a lot better compared to your typical superhero movie.I really enjoyed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and thought it was the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But Civil War manages to just about match it. The Russo brothers have once again managed to do a fantastic movie. The good news is that they will also be directing Avengers: Infinity Wars Parts 1 and 2 so I'm really hoping that the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be better from here on. As for DC, standards seem to have slipped since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Either they need to get Nolan more involved or take a leaf out of Marvel's book if they want Justice League to be successful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvelous Triumph,"Just came back from a screening... I am trying so hard to think about ways to nitpick my way out of it. but this movie is one of those rare achievements that can juggle between being so gleefully exiting, serious, tense and foreboding yet remain so cohesive and committed to it's narrative. I had high expectations, the Russo's didn't even care about my comparatively lowly expectations, because they had their own.this movie is the overachiever of the MCU, it brings you the goods, and THAN SOME. everyone has their glory moments, but at the heart it's an epic dispute between friends, idealists and pragmatists. what's amazing is that it's not only a struggle between Cap and Iron Man (and also Bucky) it's their own internal struggles, and that echoes in all the characters.it's actually the newcomer who come on top of it all, and that is Black Panther who is easily one of the most well put together heroes I've ever seen come through such a short introduction. he along with Winter Soldier get to make choices you wouldn't assume a comic book character would, choices that get into resolutions through unconventional means.Spiderman is a glorified cameo, I gotta admit he is, but good god Marvel is in so much swagger they can get away with it! Tom Holland finally nails it and you know why? because he doesn't try so hard to be a silver age impossible nerd ala Maguire or the market approved ""millennial"" Garfield Spider-Man. you just look at him, and he totally naturally IS that nerd, you believe he is Peter Parker from Queens and you believe he is Spider-Man.the beginning of the movie sets the precedence for everyone incredibly well and it's all just a natural progression that gets into the airport. now the airport fight was so amazingly choreographed, everyone gets to do something absolutely amazing and it had so many moments straight out of... yeah, I know it's been chewed out that line ""straight out of a comic book page"". I've heard that said before, and I think it's arguably true- this might just be THE best or at least the most grandiose fight ever to put on film between superheroes.Civil War even beat Batman V Superman in what BVS set it's goal to be- CW is way darker at the heart of it's conflict, it touches dark violent history behind some characters and thematically it approaches dark material with incredible maturity, a maturity BVS's infantile teenage like angst attitude couldn't approach. the climax is tense, it holds no reservation about how violent the clash between our heroes can escalate into and it makes us understand everyone, even our villain do what they do.Civil War is a triumph, it shows us just how far Comic Book movies can reach when they put their A game into it. it also shows that absurdity and nuance are not oil and water. we should all celebrate this triumph, we earned it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies.","""I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart."" After another attempt to save the world ends in destruction Steve (Evans) and Tony (Downey Jr.) are on opposite sides of what to do in the future. Tony feels that the superhero's should not be given free reign, while Steve feels that they should be able to act as they see fit. When an old enemy surfaces allegiances are put to the test, and the end of the Avengers could be near. This is a movie that is basically review proof but I'll do one anyway. First of all, I'll say this is a good movie full of action, comedy and excitement, like all of the other Avengers movies. The big problem I have with this movie, like I have stated with all of the other movies in this series, is that it lacks real drama. By that I mean, because there is already the announcement of 2 more Avenger movies means that you know how it will end going in, this one had a chance to go dark and really change the game for this series, but once again, it got wrapped in a bow and left me feeling like this is just another in the line of movies made in order to make money and not offer drama. I liked Batman v Superman because of the drama. That movie did have major flaws, but because it ended with the death of a major character. Even though they are coming back for the next movie it set a precedent that makes you go into the next one wondering who won't make it out alive. I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, but the ones I do like are dark, gritty, and makes you wonder what is going to happen. To me the Marvel movies don't. As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies. Overall, another in the line of the Avengers movies that people will love, I don't.

Marvelously Majestic,"Captain America: Civil War (spoiler free) reviewDirector(s): Anthony and Joe RussoDistributor: DisneyCast: 2 time Academy Award NomineeRobert Downey Jr.*, Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlett Johansson,Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle with 2 time Academy Award Nominee Jeremy Renner** and Chadwick Boseman.Plot: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.Director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo return with the sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). This film is action packed from start to finish and with a story to hold it all together. Another amazing entry to Marvel Cinematic Universe.After the Avengers fell apart in last years Avengers: Age of Ultron with that Captain America and Iron Man form their own team to fight for justice, although Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be seen.Here are the reasons why this is a must see:Blistering Action: Theaction scenes are very spectacular throughout with new moves from each of the heroes. The action is very fast paced and and loud which is to be expected. Which all leads up to the outstanding final fight.No Disney feel: Although this film is Disney because it is part of their MCU franchise this is more serious than the other ones, it still has the funny dialogue.This film is the start of phase 3 of the MCU and it is a wonderful start. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Crossbones (Frank Grillo) all make their first appearance but they don't go amiss because they make a massive impact.The dialogue is kind of slow but it is very intellectual but it's all worth it because the final battle is just extremely fun and makes the whole film worthwhile.Does this final film in the Captain America trilogy end winningly? ABSOLUTELY With blistering and mind boggling special effects this truly is a film that cannot be missed.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is I hate to say this but there nothing to this. This truly is a Marvelous spectacle to behold. 10/10 excellent not to be missed.Verdict: Definitely worth the wait and and excellent start to MCU's phase 3. Action packed from start to finish.*Best Actor in a leading role, Chaplin(1993), Best Actor in a supporting role, Tropic Thunder (2008) **Best Actor in a leading role The Hurt Locker (2008) Best Actor in a supporting role, The Town (2010)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's More than Meets the Eye,"It's happened: our heroes have turned against one another. Just the image above proves what the Avengers have come to: turning on one another in a state of civil war over their limit to government control. No more fun and games‚Äîit's time to really challenge what they stand for.I'll admit that I don't care too much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They're fun to sit through in a theater full of other excited fans, but nothing about them resonates too deeply. But now, Captain America: Civil War has become one of the better of the movies within the trope. It's packed with the excitement, twists, fun, and laughter that we all expect from Marvel at this point. While it isn't worth multiple viewings, it is worthwhile for the teens, as there's more under that shiny armor than what meets the eye.Based on the 2007 Civil War comic books, this third addition to Captain America's misadventures turns him into a criminal that the nation has lost its hope in. It's similar to Batman v. Superman, except done right. The Avengers now find themselves in a public media predicament after a mishap in a Lagos chemical heist ends with several people dying thanks to them. Now, the government decides to let the United Nations Panel instruct the super team. Looks like Captain America now has to clear his name not only with the politicians, but his own close friends and teammates.Minus Hulk and Thor, all the heroes you know and love are back in action: Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Mass Destruction, Hawkeye, Falcon, and Ant-Man, plus some new faces as well: the smoothly cunning Black Panther and your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man. Now let me tell you, it's the webslinger's third reboot within a decade, and at last they got the character right! Within the first 10 seconds, you will instantly say to yourself, ""Yes! Tom Holland was born to be Peter Parker! And Spider-Man!"" His backstory is also smartly left out. After all, we already know it as this point, right? The rest of the heroes also have their share of some great laughs, Vision in particular, and they always seem to have tons of fun with each other on set. But I have one complaint though: it's the same old shtick we've always seen. We've got a super talented cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, and they're doing the same thing we've always seen them do. It's not them that's the problem, it's the two directors, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo. They just don't know how to stage actors while getting worthwhile performances.There are some cool decision that these two make in continuing the series, and some not so cool. With the action scenes, it's impossible to tell whether if they're awesome or pathetic.But first, the good stuff: a garbage truck breaks down the arch in front of a medical center, Johansson totally rocks in combat action, there's a tunnel chase, Captain America holds down an entire helicopter by himself, the Avengers fight one another in one of the best moments of the entire movie series, and one hero has a big surprise that I cannot mention out of fear of spoiling anything.Now, the bad stuff: It's hard to see the action because of the sped up footage and shaky camera (you know what I'm talking about), the editing is monstrous, characters who needed backstories didn't get one, the VFX looks fake a lot of the time, Black Panther appears out of nowhere and at an unbelievably convenient time, and there is too much talking that takes away the tension.So therefore, the action is neither awesome nor pathetic. It's awesomely pathetic. Or is that pathetically awesome? Nah, I'll go with the first option.What I love right now about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how every hero has his own story to tell. What makes it better is how this series makes that concept work so well, almost like it's the narrative of television marrying the narrative of film! I also like how it points out the issue of heroes creating mass destruction and putting the people in danger, possibly out of reaction towards Man of Steel. Although I probably could've done with a shorter film and a clearer plot, it's neat to see how all the subplots come together in the end.It's always a ton of fun to anticipate and sit through these movies on a big screen with hundreds of other excited fans. But you know what else? We can learn a lot about ourselves from the Avengers. It's already clear that we're a divided nation when it comes to things like whether trans-gendered people should use public restrooms of their choosing. It's just incredible how Marvel can take these abstract conditions of our country and simplify them. The Marvel Cinematic Universe may not produce all around perfect films, but it knows how to get the youth of the country out of our state of civil war. ‚Äã Overall Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a really good movie,"I need to be honest, this movie will make you change your mind all the time. Is Steve right? Do we need to have a record of all the super- humans in existence in this planet? Most of the time I had to remember he reasons that made me choose the side I was supporting, but since the movie is VERY different that the comic it was hard for me to take a desicion based only in the movie(s). The conflict is real, I felt that whatever they decide it was going to directly affect me. The only bad thing about the movie was the unnesesary villain, that actually helped to have a bigger issue than super-heroes out-of-control but his part was awfully shown.

It is a good movie with quite some flaws at the first half.,"There's many flaws that added up during the first half of the movie, but the second half really made up for it. Adding more several new main characters in a sequel can be a hard thing, and there's quite a lot of plot-armor for the main characters and a few plot holes. However the second half wasn't flawless, but it was an incredible experience to watch that part. If i could rate the first half and second half individually i would rate the first 3/10 and second 8/10, but overall it was a nice experience that could arguably be 6/10.

Bad.,"Only watched it because I just watched Doctor Strange and that film was ok.
Well, this one is pretty bad. Not a single fight in this makes sense. I honestly have no idea why this movie was even produced. Was really boring, too.
But damn, the fights... People are switching sides the entire time, extremely confusing especially because there was no reason to fight. And then, when they fought, it just felt like a showcase of special moves. 
Some of the avengers don't want to be avengers anymore because they've caused too much destruction? Sure, let's fight the rest of the avengers who don't agree with us and cause a ton of destruction.
Wasn't even fun, but not dark either, just confusing and pretty ludicrous.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"No matter how much good you've heard about this movie, you cannot ""oversell it""","Captain America; Civil War demonstrated,.. The best superhero action any generation has ever viewed. If you are are true Captain fan, and your concerned about him sharing screen time, I assure you, there is more Captain tear-downs than in any of his other movies. That being said, the movie also showcases the very best sequences from many other formerly introduced Marvel characters. The new characters as well, got better treatment than some may have felt about ""Age of Ultron"", (for me personally), where I felt I got just a taste of Vision and Scarlet Witch, and a very dead Quicksilver.The most emotion we have seen from any Marvel movie, and very delicately handled. If you have any feelings for the characters that have been build up over the years, you will probably shed a tear or two. Vision and Scarlet become more solidified which was very satisfying. I went into Civil War with Black Panther very low on my excited about list, but I must say, he was impeccably cast, and added a great deal of heart, (as well as major action) to the movie. An absolute ""win"" for his introduction, and I actually look forward to his 2018 solo film.The most diverse and well played superhero interaction we've seen to date.

Starting to be a bit too onerous...,"I was quite underwhelmed by CA:CW.

the formula works,"In Lagos, Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch stop Brock Rumlow but cause collateral damage killing some Wakandans.

King T'Chaka of Wakanda is killed in a bombing during the signing by apparently Bucky Barnes. Prince T'Challa intends to kill Bucky while Captain America intends to capture him alive. The situation spirals out of control to split the Avengers apart.The MCU has become a long running serial show. The brilliance is that it works so well. They are fun. There is value in their connectivity. Sometimes, comic book movies have comic book motivations which often annoy me. The trick for this movie is that everybody's motivations work. The exception is yet another flawed MCU villain, Helmut Zemo. Taking him aside, the heroes have realistic motivations and actions. There is a great introduction of Spider-Man. Tom Holland is terrific and that franchise looks well on its way. His humor is a bit of fresh air. It didn't occur to me before but MCU humor has been mostly sarcastic cynicism. There is no cynicism in this Peter Parker and it's great youthful exuberance. Black Panther is also well-introduced and Ant-Man adds some great humor on top of Spider-Man. The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America is well developed. The romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision is intriguing. On the other hand, Cap's romance is questionable. The airport scene is something else. It may be the best comic book fight ever. This is what Marvel does and they do it well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: Small Internal Struggle,"First of all, it's a given that this is no piece of art, being a Marvel movie. There won't be deep thinking or any thinking at all for that matter. You're expected to see action, explosions, awesome shiny creatures flying around and more explosions. My vote of 7/10 is after taking the genre into consideration.Why 7? Let's start with a perfect score and move down from there.I usually disconnect, unplug and turn off my education when I watch these movies, because I want to be a child again and enjoy them. However, sometimes my inner child decides to be smart and a little ""why?"" or ""how?"" slips out and ruins the movie a bit. Here's how it lost 3 points: Civil War is an adaptation from the comic books, but the title didn't keep the meaning. Marvel has been taking end-of-the- world super interesting scenarios and reducing the scale a lot. See Age of Ultron, for example, instead of a machine that could control most of the modern world and use it to give dawn to a new age, an age where humanity has been brought to its knees (*gasp* Age of Ultron...), we get James Spader making jokes and failing at being moderately menacing. It was barely the week of Ultron. Similarly, Civil War was a war that put humanity versus humanity and invoked a real moral dilemma that reached to everyone, turning family members and lovers against each other. It was a matter of people's own nature being possibly harmful to others. It had meaning. It reached you. The first main difference from the comic to the movie, in my opinion, is that the number of affected people is very different. Instead of millions of people that you and I can relate to, there's a dozen characters. The second one is the nature of what makes these characters special. In the comic, it was their powers, something that was part of them. There was no option to quit. They had to sign, and have their identities and powers made public, or fight. In the movie, most of the characters have no powers, just equipment. They have the option to pass it to someone, which also makes the act of signing an agreement kinda futile.This was a story where the Hulk would have mattered and he wasn't there. Marvel moved the Earth trying to get Spider-man because he was crucial to the plot, but in the end he was there just for the action scenes. No impact at all. Thor's perspective (not human) would have been important, but he wasn't there.So, it failed at being a Civil War movie.On the other hand, there are so many characters that you forget who the main character is. It definitely did not feel like a Captain America movie (ok by me, more explosions).In the end, we could have had another Captain America movie and/or we could have had an awesome Civil War movie. In my opinion, it failed, because it tried to be both. It succeeded in being something... different (who cares? explosions) I think minus 3 points for the disappointment is fair enough. It only disappointed, because there was an expectation. If you refrain from comparing to the comic or to previous Cap movies (or to anything that makes sense), it can be an entertaining movie. Again, explosions and jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A fun experience,  but not a great film.","It is by no means a great film. It's just solid, good fun. The fantastic action sequences were well shot, but other than that the cinematography was lacking. At times, I felt the framing and color palette made the film look like something that was made for television.The score for the film is lacking as well, especially for a film of this magnitude. It would have been nice to stray away from the generic, somewhat flat score, and instead have something more befitting of the films scale. The score at times undercut the epicness of what was transpiring on screen, which was quite jarring for me.The acting was fantastic. Robert Downey Jr. in particular gives his best performance as Stark to date. And the writing for his character is quite fantastic as well. I think it's fair to say I'm Team Iron Man.It's impossible to hate this film or call it terrible. I would gladly recommend this film to anyone, though I'd tell them to keep their expectations in check. Ultimately, I think this is a film that won't age too well, in the same way as The Avengers (2012). That film was hailed as one of the best films ever when it was released, rated above 9 on IMDb and with a very good Rotten Tomatoes rating. But as time went on, and people judged it for it's cinematic elements rather than the gimmick of seeing those characters on screen for the first time, the perception of the film changed. I think the same should happen with Civil War, because it's more reliant on the spectacle rather than it's cinematic quality.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

You will not be bored for one second all throughout this film, never a dull moment. That is the duty of a hero movie after all, is to entertain with action, and to create good characters with depth. Civil War did all of those things very well, it wasn't perfection, but it came pretty damn close. The different characters come together so well, and their chemistry is spot on.

The story pretty much follows how the Avengers experience conflict and a rift is formed between Captain America and Iron Man.We all know that the cast would bring their A game to this movie since we've seen them as these characters so many times by now, but I feel they brought their A+ game to Civil War. About the new characters, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is awesome. He is a very interesting guy and he is so entertaining during the action. Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman is very likable. The thing I liked about this Peter Parker is that you do feel sympathetic for him because you really see that he is just a kid in high school fighting among grown men. This Spiderman is terrific.The story moves at a very fast pace and is both thrilling and vastly entertaining. Despite all that happens here, the movie is really at its core about the relationship and conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The whole promotional things are about the teams but the movie focuses in depth on these two, and that is great writing. The teams don't really matter anymore because you will be able to see that both Captain and Stark have clear motivations for what they're doing and that they're both correct in certain ways. There really are clear motivations and reasons for why Captain America and Iron Man have to fight. As for everyone else, you also understand why they choose a certain side. The movie is so emotional because it feels as if the MCU has been building up to this.The action in this film is phenomenal. There is so much action and it is all done so well. That airport scene from the trailers is AWESOME. The chases and fights are so exhilarating and I was just gripping the seat handles not knowing what would happen next. All the battles between Captain America and Iron Man are gritty and bloody. These guys are really fighting to kill here. I have to say my favorite action scenes were the ones with Black Panther and Spiderman.A lot of people are complaining about the villain Zemo and saying he is ""shoehorned in."" I understand why they'd say that but I definitely think he was a necessary part of this plot and just like with the others, his motivations are clear. Daniel Br√ºhl does a fairly good job in the film.Captain America: Civil War takes everything that worked best in the previous MCU movies and builds on them. I do think this one is the best MCU film so far and the Russo brothers have proved for a second time that they know how to direct these movies effectively. I can't wait to see what they do with Infinity War. In my opinion, Captain America: Civil War is the best superhero movie besides The Dark Knight.Captain America: Civil War gets an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Batman V Superman's inverse opposite,"Ever since IRON MAN came out, I always ponder on whether or not the MCU's ""shared universe"" experiment would pay off. Amongst the Phase 1 movies barely reaching above average and the obnoxious references to other movies within movies (to which AGE OF ULTRON became the worst example of), a small part of me wonders if any of it matters to the big picture, or if I actually stick around for said big picture. However, after seeing other superhero franchises executing this concept SO. FRICKEN. HORRIBLY, my doubts simmered while Marvels biggest secret became clear. They take their time in developing their wacky, comic-book universe while virtually blending it with the modern real universe, They care about these characters and their struggles so much as to have us care about them as well. They explore concepts and opportunities within these heroes and expands their meaning and what they represent to those that wrote them in the first place.And now with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, when the film might tread on the ""dark and moody"" vibe instead of the campy escapist fare that they represent, they smartly delve into the morals of these already-established characters and their reasons for going off against each other, all while never being shy of occasional fun. The result, even considering a few missteps, blooms into the most grounded yet thrilling superhero movie since THE DARK KNIGHT; a shining example of Marvels status as engaging character- driven action romps with poignant philosophies about what we believe is the right course of action.The most glaring thing to consider about this film is that it doesn't really feel much like a Captain America movie as it is just another Avengers movie. Rather than the actual character taking front and center of his movies, his ideals, the way he solves issues, and how said ideals are being conflicted instead reflects on the other characters, with some of them opposing the Act because they feel they can do things right again. The biggest variation, though, is that none of their sides ultimately become the WRONG choice nor the RIGHT one. With Iron Man switching towards responsibility to contrast the irresponsible behavior prior and Steve Rodgers justified do-gooder turned independent vigilante, neither side trumps the other; sometimes it's good that the world is saved with a few casualties, but sometimes said casualties wind up too unbearable to cope with.All of this is due to the films willingness to implement ""breathing room"". All of this is due to the Russo Brothers character-driven television backgrounds, which allows them to set the story back a few times to properly flesh out these characters. I mean, c'mon! The idea of shoving in Spider Man and the Black Panther while simultaneously developing Scarlet Witch and Visions friendship, AND shifting focus on Captain America saving Bucky would sound like another AGE OF ULTRON disaster, but it pulls together this time! While some hiccups are inevitable in this gamble, the willingness to take its time, plus some actual stakes by the actual team and not just another army invasion, gives this story its lasting weight. And yes before you mention it, boy do I feel lucky to be alive seeing the best Spider Man and the best Black Panther! Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther both succeed in adapting these characters in a script that impressively establishes them without treading on their back story for too long. Even keeping the abundance of solid action scenes in mind, the introduction of Black Panther and Starks small talk with Parker might be two of the best scenes in this movie. But make no mistake, this film would never be worthwhile had it not been for the Russo Brothers surprisingly solid action. Seriously, this might be the best Marvel ensemble fight scenes ever! Explaining these would ruin the fun, but let's just say that the airport scene¬Ö HOLY CRAP!Judging solely on the action scenes pairing with the conflicting ethics of regulation would instantly make a masterful film, but sadly it is not. Once that big fight gets out of the way, the film feels like it should conclude from there, only to shift into another fight scene due to one's own vendetta. No matter how bold of a move that is, to have this whole fight derive from a smaller but more personal struggle, but it took me out of the film to have yet another fight scene just a few minutes after another. You also might gloss over the ""villain"" in this movie that brings up a worthwhile twist in the end, but I pay no mind to itNow I am sure there is quite a lot of discussion that my praise for this film strictly lies on my ""bias towards Marvel"" after recently bashing DCs shameless aping of this shared universe. Trust me guys, I strained to stick with my doubts on this one. I desperately find anything wrong with this movie despite the ratio of reception of film and BATMAN V SUPERMAN telling me otherwise. Sadly, I stand with my statement. This is not only miles better than DAWN OF JUSTICE, but I am right on board on the ever-so redundant but inevitable discussion that this is an opposite inverse of that in quality terms. Smart and funny writing instead of stupid and self-important trailer fuel; struggles based on character-based ideals instead of dumb manipulation; dark tone for meaning and weight instead of mindless aesthetic mimicking. Even that notwithstanding, this makes a confident, everlasting, and fun superhero movie properly made better by the eight years of world-building that has finally payed off. I would say watch it and judge for yourselves, but I believe my stand is as follows: SEE THIS ONE INSTEAD!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Avengers never seem to find a peaceful way out of trouble,"This movie helps one realize how much better the real world is compared to the courier guy's fictional world of superheroes. How much better the world is without heroes and their struggle towards proving themselves. It also makes one think about the kind of friends that a person keeps and his commitment towards his relationship with them. How vulnerability to hypnosis renders a person totally helpless and doing things that he doesn't want to do. Ideas like the dark force of vengeance, the power of forgiveness, the internal conflict between these two emotions that a hero has to face makes it interesting to watch. This might also help us realize how lucky it is to be ordinary and alone, rather than having super powers and being with a group of super people.Ultimate freedom comes from not having to choose between two sides.

"Should've been called: ""Avengers: The Argument""","After the entertaining second Captain America installment ""Winter Soldier"", three other Marvel Universe movies (Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy) we kick off the third phase of the Marvel flicks with Captain America: Civil War. Starring almost the complete cast of the previous marvel movies and introducing new members, will it still be a Captain America centered movie?The movie opens in Lagos, Nigeria, where four members of the remaining Avengers (Scarlett Witch, Black Widow, Falcon and Captain America) are trying to stop Hydra from stealing dangerous bio weapons form a medical research center. While they are successful, they cause huge damage and hundreds of civilian causalities. This is the final nail in the coffin for the United Nations who come with a set of rules that should prevent the Avengers from acting on their own, but form now on will fall under supervision. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and half of the Avengers agree that hey should sign the Accords but Captain America and the other half do not. When Captain America's old friend, Bucky, is accused of bombing the UN, he rushes into action (supported by half of the Avengers) to keep Bucky from falling into government hands, while the other Avengers (led by Iron Man) tries to stop him.Civil War is certainly entertaining. The action looks great, the special effects are off the charts (apart from some cgi effects looking less impressive) and there are hardly dull moments in the movie. I enjoyed the story, but it feels a bit forced and only act as a device to let the Avengers face off against each other. Why did the UN take four years to come with this action? I mean they destroyed half of Manhattan but when they cause damage in Africa they suddenly come into action? That feels a bit strange. The villain in this movie also didn't feel menacing at all and I hardly noticed that there was a villain in the first place.My main issue with this movie is that there are way to many characters in this movie. It would have worked way better if they just focused on the conflict between Captain America (it's his movie right?) and Iron Man, with Bucky, Black Widow and War Machine as supporting characters. It's all so bloated now that it doesn't feel like a Captain America movie at all. It is just another Avengers movie used to show as many superheroes as possible. In the middle of the movie there is a big fight between (almost) all the Avengers which is highly praised by many people. For me that fight looked like a boring commercial which advertises super hero action figures. The fight did nothing to bring the story forward, nothing to develop the characters and you know that they all survive so what's the bloody point? And yes I know it's not a realistic movie but if I remember correctly, most of the Avengers are just human right? So how do they all shake off massive damage like falling 5 stories and getting punched in the face by a man dressed in Iron or with super human strength?While the final act of the movie was entertaining and brought back the focus to Captain America, I must say that this was not a Captain America movie. If you love the Avengers movie and can't get enough of all the superheroes, you will certainly like this movie. For the rest of us it is an entertaining movie but not without flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stupid,This is a waste of my time. Also it should not be the first thing to show up when your look up the Civil War it is completely disrespectful to the people who fought and who died. What is wrong with society these days. People can be so selfish. And sorry if I offend anyone in some way but I'm just stating my opinion. I just think that this is not fair to our history I mean first of all they put the name Civil War in it and that's just mocking the actual war and second of all this is not at all important or useful. I'm not saying they should like remove this movie completely just don't make it the first thing to show when your researching the Civil War. And by the way I have watch this movie and I definitely was not a fan I just don't really get the point of making a movie like this. And once again I apologize for anyone who I might have offended.

All You Need To Make Your Day!,"Hi, This is my first Movie Review. I had a lot of hopes of this movie cause after all its a Marvel movie and moreover starring Robert Downey Jr. in it. And I am glad to say all my expectations are met. I am truly satisfied. The movie's highlight was supposed to be Chris Evans but Robert Downey Jr. steals the show.The suspense is heartbreaking yet its worth it. The story takes a surprising turn towards the end. Sebastian Stan was a total game changer.This is the movie where all your prediction goes wrong. Tom Holland Makes a type of Guest appearance. Chadwick Boseman is a surprising package. Martin Freeman has a short yet dominating role.Paul Rudd has a big surprise of everyone. The end is so thrilling and suspenseful that waiting for the next movie is like waiting for the next season of Game Of Thrones. The teaser at the end blows away everything you thought. At Last the movie is worth your money and is better than any previous Captain America movie. Thanks Folks, I hope this review was helpful,ADIOS!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel steps up their game with Captain America: Civil War.,"Captain America: Civil War is the 13th feature film from Marvel studios and their universe. It is a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, directed by the Russo Brothers, and is once again back to helm this one. It basically stars all of the Avengers, so this is a stack cast for a Captain America movie. It is written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, whom of which wrote the first Captain America movie & The Winter Soldier as well.So let me start by saying that I LOVED this film. I've seen it twice and it honestly got better the second time around. Is it a masterpiece? No. But it was near. The Russo Brothers NAILED IT once again. I consider Captain America: The Winter Soldier the best MCU film, and they managed to top it. The way they handled the characters, the story & the action was so well-done. Each scene of this film has a sense of effort and execution, and all that credit goes to the Russo Brothers. They've done a MARVELOUS job.The story is very complex and has a lot of elements into it. These elements of which are interconnected in order for the movie to move along. The story also touches into many different themes/subject matters and I really liked that. For a film like this, that has a lot plot points and themes, an individual could easily be confused. I wasn't. Though to be honest, the first time I watched it, I was lost a few times, but all that are resolved when I watched again. The film does get busy because of it's story, but it doesn't get out of control. It's not messy. It's not tight and cohesive as THE WINTER SOLDIER, but the film still is structured well. What I loved about the story is that it's very personal. It's a character study between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. They're the centerpiece of this movie. This has been building up from the start, and to see it pay off here was an absolute blast.All of the performances are GREAT. The original cast are better than ever, which is not a surprise. So let's talk about the new ones. BLACK PANTHER is MAGNIFICENT. Chadwick Boseman did a good job as this newly introduced character. Looking forward for his standalone film. SPIDER-MAN is AWESOME. He was so handled well. I didn't feel he was just shoehorned in. Pretty damn excited for his new movie. Tom Holland IS Spider-Man. Paul Rudd as ANT-MAN is just so perfect. From his standalone film, I was really excited to see him interact with the other Avengers and it didn't disappoint. Robert Downey Jr. as IRON MAN gave such a powerful performance here, so powerful. Basically everyone was in their A-game.I was BLOWN AWAY by the action, it has the best action pieces in an MCU movie yet. The action was gripping, powerful, & emotional. Speaking of those things, the film was poignant but at the same time funny as well. The film was very well BALANCED. Whether it's balancing the tone, balancing the story, all of it which are balanced.I didn't mind the villain. I understood his character. He had motives into why he was doing all his actions. Although his not a very fleshed out character. He was just there for the sake of the story. He was basically a functional villain that was used to move the story. He's not the worst, but he's certainly not one of the great things about the movie. The character was clever and low-key, and I liked that, I just needed to know more about him. Daniel Bruhl's performance was fine. I dug the soundtrack of The Winter Soldier, but this one just disappointed me. It's not TERRIBLE, but I was just expecting MORE from Henry Jackman.Final say: With breathtaking action, complex and balanced story, CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is a superhero film that's ABSOLUTELY entertaining, and at the same time has the gravitas and depth to the story and it's characters. You understand certain motives, you understand the conflicts, you understand both sides. This is not only a GREAT TIME of a movie, it has qualities that is pretty rare in these kind of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Beginning for Phase 3!,"Hey everyone Connor here once again with the review of one of the biggest films of 2016, Captain America: Civil WarAfter the scenarios of New York, Washington, Sokovia, and newly Logos, the U.N. wants to put all super powered beings into check. Cap doesn't exactly like that and so many of our favorite heroes choose which side they represent, and so comes the arguing, then the fists go flying. So there you have the central plot.One of the things that I loved about this film was how perfect the fight was, not in just physical form, but mentally as well. I found myself neutral throughout the entire movie. That is how tough it is to pick a side, both have even pros and cons against the others beliefs. Therefore job well done to marvel again for that part.As for the characters, they are the same misfits we all have come to know and love over the years. Except for a few new faces. Ladies and Gentlemen we finally have in the marvel film universe Black Panther and welcoming home in amazing fashion, Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa aka Black Panther who we see a lot in Civil War and I must say I now am sold and cannot wait to see his stand alone film when it releases next year. As for everyones favorite web swinging hero Spider-Man is home with marvel and debuts in Civil War. Tom Holland in my opinion is already in my opinion a scene stealer and easily my favorite part of Civil War, mark my words by next year when his solo film Spider-Man: Homecoming is released i truly believe everyone will say he is the best Spidey ever! The way he looks and cracks jokes constantly is perfect and I cannot wait to see him return soon.The film from the trailers point don't show much humor but I promise you Civil War will at many points have fans laughing away as it brings a whole lot of humor to a film with hurtful truths as well.Overall I loved Captain America: Civil War and would see it again. I Connor approve this film and love where Marvel starts us out in Phase 3!Hope you enjoyed the review and as always have fun and enjoy the show!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Didn't expect much, got a masterpiece!","I gotta admit, I wasn't hyped for this movie as much as I was for past MCU movies like The Avengers and so on, and since I hate spoilers, I haven't watched or read anything about the movie after the very first trailer. But, boy, was I pleasantly surprised!!How great you're asking this movie was? I was literally shivering at one point in the movie. The actual ""civil war"" fight, that was shown partially in the trailer. I've been to a lot of movies, but none of them has made me shiver with excitement like this one, and that's saying something.There wasn't a weak point in this movies. Now, I'm not very pretentious about movies and have liked films that are hated by the majority of moviegoers, but even I admit the flaws of movies that bother others. Well, this movies has none! NONE! You literally have to nitpick to find it bad. The action scenes were good, the storytelling was good and characters felt fleshed out.Speaking of characters, I cannot not point out the villain in this one. So, yeah- Marvel makes great comic book movies, but the villains have always been a weak link. Well, I'm glad to tell you that this is not the case in Captain America: Civil War! Finally another good villain has joined Loki in the rogues' gallery :) Zemo is not your clich√©d villain that seeks world domination, he's motives are good, he has a certain charisma to his character. You'll like 'im, trust me ;) And of course, much thanks to Daniel Br√ºhl for his performance.To sum up, if you're into comics- go watch it! It's a must! A really well made CBM. And since the same directors are going to make Infinity War 1 & 2, we're in good hands :) And if you're just a casual movie enthusiast- go watch it. It has a lot to offer to you as well, even though you won't get most of the references.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
When Two Vibes Go to War,"Actually... not great. Seeing it centuries after the hype has died down allows you to see it in context. Really the airport centrepiece carries the whole film and a lot of the rest of it is perfunctory, really silly and now largely overshadowed by all that comes after. Much like the far ropier Secret Invasion, this kind of watered down MCU version of the comic event Civil War is really foolish and makes Cap (who feels like a guest in his own film) look legitimately really stupid. Bucky, as always, remains rather undercooked and a lot of the supporting cast don't get room to breathe. At the time this must have been quite a spectacle but now it feels a bit of a slog.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"When someone tells you to move, tell them ""No. You move!""","This is the best Marvel movie yet! Even if you're not a superhero fan, I still highly recommend this, because it doesn't feel like a superhero movie. Much like ""Winter Soldier"" it's more of a political thriller. It makes you think, and debate about accountability and other important issues, which is very unusual for a superhero film. It's not just mindless action. The action sequences, by the way, are some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie, Marvel or otherwise. They're choreographed so well. There's a lot that goes on, yet you never feel lost or overwhelmed during them. Up until this point, Andrew Garfield was my favorite actor to portray Spider-Man. Move over, Andrew Garfield. Newcomer Tom Holland has taken your spot. I was a bit skeptical when he showed up in the trailers because I thought he sounded way too young. But when he started throwing around one-liners in true Spider-Man fashion, all that doubt instantly went away. Fun fact: Tom Holland starred alongside Chris Hemsworth in ""In The Heart of the Sea,"" and it's because of Hemsworth's recommendation of Holland for the role of Spider-Man to Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios that Holland was cast in the role. Great choice, Chris Hemsworth! I'm excited to see what this young man has in store for the future. This was everything I wanted, and more. Every time I think ""Marvel can't possibly top this,"" they prove me wrong. But that's my worry. I'm worried that every Marvel film will try to outdo the predecessors by being bigger and better every time, until the MCU is eventually crushed by its own unattainable expectations. But until that day, I'll enjoy what the MCU has to offer. I expect great things from the next one: Doctor Strange. Great things, indeed. #TEAMCAP

"Good morning, Soldier...","While I am not overly a fan of the superhero genre, then I will still watch these movies when I have a chance, because they tend to be entertaining enough and usually be a visual treat in special effects.And that was true also with the 2016 ""Captain America: Civil War"" movie. Sure, the whole superhero thing is starting to wear thin in my book, but it should be said that there is enough action and impressive effects in this movie to make it worthwhile watching.For fans of the superhero movies, then I think that ""Captain America: Civil War"" would be like a mother of all movies, because there are so many different superheroes together, with myriads of backgrounds and powers.The story in the movie was adequate, albeit a bit simplistic. But it was easy to follow and it doesn't really require much thinking from the audience. Just sit back and enjoy the action, the fighting and the sparkling special effects.Personally I like Ant Man the best, because he is played by Paul Rudd and also because he is the one with the funniest and weirdest of all powers.I can't really say whether or not this movie is extraordinary compared to the other ones in the same Marvel universe, because to me they are essentially all the same, just with different characters.

"Striking the balance between a good story-line and all-out ""chaos""","With 2016 bearing the year of face-offs, as it seems, Captain America: Civil War promised to be good competition for Batman vs. Superman.Personally, Civil War had potential to be the perfect face-off-film, but there were just too many characters and side-story lines that it got complicated. The essential premise of the conflict is easy - one side is pro Super Heroes Registration, one side is pro-vigilante justice, the old fashioned way. But so many characters get thrown in, and besides the gush of seeing so many super heroes all in one movie fighting off against each other, Marvel is veering more so on the mayhem side than on the character and plot development side.I don't see much development in Civil War. I see a rift happen for the sake of a rift happening, characters being introduced just for the heck of it. Yes, maybe this is the way it goes in the comic, but it doesn't make much for a story for me.I'm not saying Civil War was terrible by any means, no. But it was just meh. Another superhero movie.

The Best Captain America Movie Ever!,"I'm not a big fan of Captain America movies, the second one was good and the first one was average but my god! This one? The BEST!One of the characteristics of an excellent movie is having multiple subplots, balanced well together.Civil War has amazing characters that ain't just another superheroes, but humans from inside. It has multiple subplots, involving all those characters and nothing seems out of beat.Maybe, because it's a mini-Avenger movie or, whatever, it's way too interesting and emotionally intense.Cap had his reasons and Tony had his reasons. The plot has been excellently put in a way where we can't choose a single side because both the sides were right in their own ways, even though I support Tony a bit more.The main motive of this movie was to make us feel the Avengers tearing apart, and it succeeds in doing so. The climax fight scene between cap and tony coupled with the background music got me emotionally charged!Another thing is I love how so many characters are well balanced in this movie, I think the russo brothers ace in that.In short, you can't miss this!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worst movie i would say,"This is the worst possible movie marvel can take after batman vs superman..

This movie is all about vengeance, don't wanna put any spoilers of course, and lastly they spoke about friendship, which means the climax should have been unnecessary if they really took friendship into consideration.

Almost Avengers Light,"Not as superb as the directing Russo Brothers first one ""The Winter Soldier"", due to a complexion of being almost an ""Avengers"" movie; ""Civil War"" builds up to a kind of thrilling potential in the final confrontation between Steve Rogers vs. Tony Stark.Production Design and musical score are behind expectations in this super-high budget Marvel movie. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. play the hell out of doctored script preserving the enormous as delivered spectacle in ""Infinity War"".

"Like all Wars, Civil War is a Tragic Waste","You might as well shoot your bow & arrow off at Godzilla than disparage a film that made a billion dollars in its first ten days, but here goes. Anyone, I guess, can make up an IMDb Trivia entry, but this one has the ring of truth:""Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's original idea for Captain America 3 was a vastly different and much smaller film without the other Avengers, but Kevin Feige suggested they adapt Civil War instead.""Shame on you, Kevin Feige. Markus and McFeeley, of course, are the writing duo who did such near-genius work on the first two Captain America films: ""The First Avenger,"" with its rich period feeling, its great rationale for Steve Rogers donning his ridiculous name and suit, and its characterization of a superhero who ultimately, just wants to be a normal guy in a world where everyone gets a fair shake. ""The Winter Soldier"" took Captain America to a whole new level, in a modern day USA where the strongest, nicest, handsomest, most fair- minded guy in its dystopic Washington, DC, is fated to be a perennial outsider that the system will do its best to destroy. These are the two superhero movies to recommend to people who don't like superhero movies, and given the chance to make the kind of ""vastly different and much smaller film"" that Markus & McFeely could have done so well, it's a pity that Captain America: Civil War, instead of letting the writers do what they wanted, warps and inflates the narrative in order to repeat the worst mistakes of the latest Avenger movie.Where the first Avengers film contrasted its characters with a world of normal humans, and put them head to head with an alien invasion ‚Äì exactly the sorts of things superheroes do best ‚Äì in Age of Ultron, everyone was a superhero. In the film, the Avengers' penultimate task was not to tackle some malign and hideous Other, but to evacuate a city, putting the Hulk and the God of Thunder to work making sure everyone fastened their seatbelts.Civil War makes similar mistakes. With everyone a superhero, the differences between the characters become simply a matter of degree, and genuine conflict is submerged under an endless series of fanboy mixes-and-matches: golly, who's fighting who in the next scene? Certain episodes emphasize a legitimate central conflict ‚Äì now that he knows that the Winter Soldier is his long-lost best friend, Steve Rogers will do anything to protect him, while both Iron Man and the Black Panther want to take him out. In these segments, a worthwhile sequel to the first two films peeks out of a script overstuffed with superpowered and technically augmented humans.A welcome addition is the return of Brock Rumlow, the corrupt Shield agent from The Winter Soldier: near death at the end of that last movie, he returns as the hydraulically augmented Crossbones. Thirsting for revenge against the good guys, Crossbones is a scary and highly motivated villain who - Spoiler Alert ‚Äì doesn't even make it through the first act, when ‚Äì played as ferociously as before by Frank Grillo - he could have sustained an entire film (admittedly, the character is under-used less egregiously than Paul Giamatti's Rhino in Amazing Spider-Man 2).Similarly, the plot reveals that a coven of unbeatable bio-engineered super- villains has been waiting for decades to wreak havoc on the world, but when our heroes track them to their arctic retreat, instead of the fight of their lives, they find ¬Ö oh, that there's no menace after all, leaving the good guys only to battle each other. So, having engaged us with these characters in the first Iron Man, Captain America, and Avengers films, Marvel now buries them in a mass of superhero overproduction, with a dangling story line that we know won't be continued until the next Avengers movie. Markus and McFeely are writing that; if they're allowed to follow their instincts, maybe they'll be able to redeem themselves. But that's a good two years down the line. With the comic books, you only had to wait a month.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
#Movie Review,Captain America: Civil War (2016) rocks! It's a movie that manages to combine : a deep meaningful message + cool action scenes and let's not forget about the funny moments. At first you might get the sensation that something is wrong but as the story unfolds you can relate more and more and actually understand each character's motivation.The things that bothered me : I don't like the way some scenes were managed but since the movie has so many good parts it can be overlooked also I am not sure what was Marvel's vision regarding the villain but I was expecting him to have a bigger presence. It's not that he is a bad villain it's just that there are so many super-heroes in this movie raising the bar thus when the villain shows up he kind of spoils the fun.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Well, my kid really liked it","Kind of interesting, we're just off Batman vs. Superman so we've seen two takes recently on the superhero vs superhero deal. As with most else, the DC movie was the less sophisticated of the two, I would have trouble telling you why Batman and Superman were fighting each other, there wasn't much that made sense in that one. I have two (no, three) problems with this one: 1) the fight CGI (UNLIKE The Avengers) was way too fast to follow, it just looks too hokey; 2) the movie was about 20 minutes too long, there's a fair amount of chaff to get through before the civil war; and 3) the plot was just a little too complicated. Oh, and 4) Vision is too powerful to be in this mix. On the plus side Spidey was done very well, the circumstances that lead to superhero vs. superhero were believable (if a tad complicated), and as usual Marvel is spot on in their casting of the new roles. So while I wasn't wildly cheering at the end as some in the audience were it was a pleasant if a little too lengthy watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Avengers 2.5,"Captain America: Civil War is a terrific final installment of the Captain America trilogy. It wraps up Cap's story nicely with his quest to save Bucky and question his role as a tool for the US government. Honestly, I felt like it was a better Avengers sequel than Age of Ultron, with this being the culmination of the ideological clashes between Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, and the rest of the Avengers. The cameos from Black Panther and Spiderman are icing on the cake of this exciting clash of superheroes. The action scenes are a lot of fun, especially the creatively epic fight sequence from the airport scene. While I do have issues with Captain America's anti-accountability stance and Tony Stark's hypocrisy with projecting his own past of irresponsible actions that got people killed, there is still enough interesting discourse between the two philosophies that creates an engaging ethical cash between the two heroes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers in Civil War: Superheroes Finally Beating Each Other Up!,"Alright, when Tony Stark and Steve Rogers play nice, it's fine. But now it's The Clash. Tony's ready to bow to government rules like a well-dressed lapdog, while Cap wants to keep doing his own thing, beating up bad guys without caring about politicians. We get a showdown as epic as a bar fight, only here it's in tights, and it's happening at the airport.Marvel realized it needed to add some depth to the mix. Gone is the all-out humor; now we're dealing with real stakes. The characters feel the blows, and this time, there's no going back. Stark isn't just the arrogant guy in armor anymore; he's stressed, he's thinking things through, and it pulls us out of the usual Marvel where everything's solved with a Thor smile or a Rocket joke. Here, it's personal, and it's heavy.The iconic scene with all the heroes throwing down in the departure zone is pure spectacle - even Spidey shows up to say hi. The choreography is as tight as clockwork, every hit lands, and all you want is for it to keep going. If Marvel keeps delivering scenes like this, they'll have us going through mountains of popcorn.This Spider-Man feels like he's come straight from the comic pages. Gone is the 30-year-old playing a teen; this Spidey is young, quick, and devours his lines like he's starving. Tom Holland gives us a Peter Parker who perfectly balances the naive teenager with the guy you don't want to mess with. In a few scenes, he steals the show and makes us hope his solo film will be a knockout.Then there's Black Panther, straight from Wakanda, clawing his way in. Charismatic, classy, he brings that mysterious vibe with a touch of vengeance. You can tell he's not joking around, and it's a pleasure to see a new hero step in without cheesy humor or fanfare. Welcome to the club, T'Challa!This is the Marvel we were waiting for: broken alliances, epic fights, weighty decisions, and a real fracture within the Avengers. If you were already a fan, you're going to love this. If Marvel keeps up this more mature vibe, we're all in for another ten years!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest MCU Film of All Time.,"Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt, the greatest movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. You read that correctly. The story is incredibly compelling and very deep for a superhero movie, the acting is outstanding (per usual when it comes to these) and the action scenes are intense, to say the very least. The Russo Brothers have once again hit it out of the park with Civil War, and it's just as great as The Winter Soldier.As usual, Chris Evans was incredible as Steve Rodgers/Captain America. He has such a likability to him that you just cannot ignore. As you know, Robert Downey Jr. owns the role of Tony Stark. If for whatever reason another actor gets the chance to play Stark, it's likely they won't come close to playing the character as well as RDJ. The biggest surprise to me was Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, AKA The Winter Soldier. He plays a much bigger role in this film compared to the previous Captain America films, and Stan managed to pull off an extremely interesting and captivating performance. You don't know if you should root for him or be against him. Scarlett Johansson gives a noteworthy performance as Black Widow yet again, and Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner, as well as Paul Bettany are all pretty great in their roles as Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Vision respectively.Also, the new additions to the MCU are Black Panther and (finally!) Spider-Man. I do not want to say much about them because I would rather you see them for yourself, but I will say Panther may be the most interesting and mysterious hero yet, and personally, Tom Holland is my favorite Spider-Man ever, and I never thought I would say that. The climatic fight scene in the airport is the most entertaining fight I may have seen in film. I don't want to spoil, but Ant-Man steals the show in this scene. And the fight between Cap and Iron Man is so intense it will literally bring you to the edge of your seat.This movie is what every single Marvel fan has been waiting for. It is a complete rebound after Age of Ultron, which disappointed me completely. Phase Three is off to a very hot start, and we may be in for the best phase yet.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good movie, just not sure if its a good superhero movie.","OK, let me start by saying i actually really liked this movie, is an awesome flick. Having said that it falls short of being the epic, awesome, mind-blowing movie i thought it would be, and in know the reason, the Russos didn't try that hard to make this a great superhero movie, they just wanted to make a great movie, and I'm not sure if it works.First, and what is actually my biggest complaint is the cinematography, the sometimes overused shaky cam along with the super dull color grading made this for a totally awful to look at movie. And it wasn't dark in a way it looked cool and let the primaries pop, it was just dull, and come on, this is a superhero movie, you can't just take the color way from it. Just look at Age of Ultron, the cinematography in that movie felt grand and epic, as the dark though not dull color palette allowed to the super colorful suits of our heroes to shine. The only scene i thought did look decent was the airport battle, and even that didn't look as mind-blowing as it should have. Im actually concerned for Infinity war, since the context of that movie would totally need epic cinematography along with super colorful grade.OK, second, and just as concerning is the soundtrack... dude i had never heard such a forgettable soundtrack in a mare movie. i would only be able do describe it with the same word of the cinematography... dull.Another big problem i had, and probably is an effect of the last two points is how short of epic the movie felt as a whole. The avengers never felt so small as in this movie. Even tho we had a bunch of locations you still felt like everything was happening in the same block. That bothered me as hell.Having said all of that, don't misunderstand me. If this wasn't the SUPERHERO movie had been waiting for like my whole life i would have probably liked it better. I mean the acting is fantastic, the plot is cool, and it has a lot of emotional weight. Is also has a lot of enjoyable moments and some pretty good humor, especially in ant-man and falcon moments. The characters are super interesting and the new ones are fantastic and I'm looking so forward this characters. Seeing spider man for the first time in the MCU was an almost religious experience and black panther is one of the most bad ass, cool characters in the MCU. Dialog is amazing and is amazingly deep. And the final battle was stunning. I'll say it again, it is an awesome movie, just not an awesome superhero movie, not even close to the awesomeness of the Avengers.Finally i would like to ask the Russos to try harder for Infinity war, and especially in the production aspects of the film, try as hard as you can to make it feel as epic as the conclusion of all the MCU deserves.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie but really more of the same.,"I enjoyed Batman versus Superman so much more than this movie.This movie just felt terribly unoriginal, boring, and the same old stuff I've seen over and over again.Nothing interesting about the plot. More of a showcase of all the characters, leaving the dialogue absent of anything intriguing.Great special effects, it's also fun to see all the new characters interacting. Had a good take on Spider-Man.Out of all the Marvel movies, this was one of the weaker ones. Better than Ant-Man.But no where near as interesting as Batman versus Superman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My perfect movie,This film is the story from avenger age of Ultron because after that scene almost hero that fight to the monster and effect to the building which cause to the people in the city become died. The president of the USA call the congress to talk about that issue and define the new lawsuit to protect their country.It control the power of marvel superhero this make Steve Roger angry because his friend will become illegal. But this law was written by Tony Stark who is the opposite team. In this film it separate into 2 group of hero which the first team has Captain America as a leader. The other team has Ironman. In my will i think this film tell us about the love and equality between friend and some argument that cause to the relationship of the family when it has a benefit it can broke the friendship but when you have a harmonium in your group it will help your relation and the lass I think the charm of MCU movie is the plot that is difficult to predict and it has so many surprises from the director. In the part of the actor Robert Downy Jr and Chris Evan was smart and powerful. Finally if you never watch the marvel comics universe film you should watch it ! It's very cool so i give it 10 star.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Crouching Spider Hidden Panther,"In short, this is an American Wuxia movie. Superheroes are similar to those martial art warriors in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon genre, who can leap over building, have superhuman strength, bend physical law etc. Each has his/her unique fighting style and weapons. And just like a wuxia movie, the plot is about love, friendship, revenge and betrayal.Even you can relate some action scenes to Asia's martial arts movie, like when Cap is gunned down and fall from building to the ground, Jacky Chan's stunt has done that 'fall' before. The way Black Widow/Romanoff doing 'parkour' in the market, just like Donnie Yen did in ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" and so on. The Russo's brothers seem to be a martial art fans and it's good, they made the action scenes awesome by combining the grace of Asia/Hongkong's martial art and the explosive/spectacular of Hollywood's CGI and special effects.However, I always see Captain America as the one who obeys the laws while Iron Man always breaks them, so throughout the movie I couldn't get rid the feeling that their roles in the story are mismatched. Another thing, while it's a superb action movie, it somehow lacks of emotional depth. Their motives are just rational. Therefore, Spiderman and Black Panther are able to steal the show, hence I put them on my title review. Really looking forward for their own films.Perhaps for the next installment, the Russo's should also add spices of Korean drama to the mix :).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A collective good like no other!,"Blessed with a star-studded cast, this sequel makes sure that each of the bold-faced names gets his or her moment in the sun, resulting in a film that's sure to satisfy Marvel fanatics. And director Joss Whedon makes sure the action is as big as its stars: Androids do battle in breathtaking scenes, worlds literally fall apart, and superheroes rescue and do good from one breathless moment to the next. The dialogue moves pretty quickly, too, inflected with humor.But this many important characters makes for a crowded movie, with little time to allow a complicated story line actual room to unfurl. But, there's definitely enough here to please fans of the movies and the original comic books.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Since when did 12 people fighting become a civil war, marvel should have waited until more characters were introduced so it could actually be a civil war. Crossbones was definitely not the villain, and Baron Zemo was just annoying. Civil war was dark.. some of the episodes on Arrow are darker than Civil War. OK Civil War was pretty dark but they didn't do it right, like they immediately made the tone dark just because a lot of people lost their family.CA: Civil War was the movie where all the people's family dies so there could actually be a plot.

Same-Old Same-Old,"Captain America: Civil War is a fine entry in the MCU. I use the word 'fine', because this definitely is not a game-changer. First the good stuff: The character motivations are well drawn (it is actually hard to pick a side), the overall story is tight, the performances are generally good and there are some truly emotional moments. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are awesome. However, when you look at the number of superheroes involved in this film, you expect to find something extraordinary. Unfortunately, this isn't the case, except for a couple of bright spots.This film turned out to be exactly the kind of film I didn't want it to be. It's inconsequential, however much it may try making you believe otherwise. Also, this movie follows the same formula both Avengers movies have followed till now: Bad guys fight good guys, good guys fight among themselves, good guys fight bad guys again. The villain is again weak. The action too, which felt fresh in The Avengers and The Winter Soldier, feels a lot been-there-done-that (except the airport scene). Black Panther felt somewhat shoehorned in the film. It's fun, but not as much as The Avengers. It's engaging, but not as much as The Winter Soldier. You know, in a movie with almost a dozen superheroes, when you come out remembering only the scenes which featured two of them in cameos, there is certainly something wrong with the movie.People hate on BvS a lot and are comparing it unfavourably to this film. While BvS surely had its own flaws, the good moments in it were absolutely breathtaking. And it dared to be different. This one, not so much, inspite of a more serious tone than other Marvel movies.PS: Spider-Man: Homecoming is the most I'm excited for a Marvel movie now, besides Doctor Strange.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A wall-to-wall fight in the parking lot,"It doesn't seem like such a difficult task in 2+ hours to have time to show a drama with the parents of one character and sign all these contracts for the control of supermen.However, a pack of new characters and storylines from previous installments are being added to this. So it turns out to be a mess with confusion in places.But this is the main battle at the airport, which is more like an arrow behind garages between 7th grade students. Well, it's just ridiculous.But when the super soldiers beat the metal one at the very end of the movie, it's really cool. Everything seems to be the same as at the airport, but it doesn't make you laugh. The drama of the metal still managed to be revealed. It turns out.It's worse than the last part, but there are so many heroes at once that everything is excusable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The cracks started to show,"This is in no way my first viewing of this of this movie and I think the more I watch it, the more the score goes a bit down. My opinions change so much primarily because the initial coolness of the movie is gone, and I¬¥m left analysing the movie more and more and this is not a movie that needs that. This is a reptile brain movie, it think it¬¥s a deep movie but it¬¥s plot stays at the surface level all throw-out having a hard time balancing it¬¥s 2 plotlines. While the action is so well done, it has some directorial and storyline problems I just can¬¥t ignore anymore.As Scarlet Witch ends up destroying a building, creating collateral damage that makes the government want to take a stand against the Avengers, a mysteries person is trying to take over The Winter Soldier.Let¬¥s give the movie some praise. The action here is fenarimol. From the opening that is my favourite, to the chase, to the infamous airport scene. This movie is full of great action set pieces that all highlights the different characters so well. Everyone feels and fights differently with different levels of experience and that is handled beautifully in this movie. Together with an incredible sound design that I first noticed on this watch. The punches and hits sounds and looks super human, especially in the beginning and I feel as the movie went on, the edge was taken of a bit in the sound design category but this isn¬¥t that important just a great detail.The overall idea of this movie, lifted from the comics of course is great. The taken down of the Avengers and the idea of having them govern is incredible. The 2 front figures makes sense as Tony decently has more lives on his continues vs the boy scout Captain America. The in fighting is great and the different people joining the different sides makes sense, it¬¥s a good moral dilemma that you understand. The problem is balancing this with the other plotline that has a good villain that ties into the overall idea of the movie, but in the end fails to balance this correctly. This movie should have went one or the others way. Having 2 plots with more or less the same goal cancels earthmother out, and the villains plot makes no sense the more you think about it. Really think about the steps the villain takes to execute his plan and tell me how many coincidences that needs to be in order for the plan to make sense. This is the weakest part of the movie, the story, and that takes it down a huge part for me.The acting is pretty okay here. There are some good performances but nothing that really sticks out to me. But everyone is doing a fine job overall.This leads to me not really having many notes to the movie as it uses it¬¥s plot to just go from action set pieces to action set pieces without much focus on the story. This is a reptile brain movie to me, turn of your brain and enjoy the good superhero action, but that makes further weaving the more frustrating as the amazing band aid is off and you start to see the many cracks here. This is an action movie and not much more, but it could be so much more if the creators really sad down and focused on the story as well as the character moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Avengers:Civil War,"Debatably the smartest and most unique mcu film. From the beginning of the film it picks off instantly and sets the tone for the film really well. I love how the avengers are faced to realise the aftermath and damage that they have caused and how it creates a strong divide and a conflict between friends, allies. What is so gripping about it is that both sides have strong arguments which makes the audience jump between sides and look at the teams views from a separate angle. There is some confusion amongst all the politics like how captain America didn't tell tony that Bucky was framed, I can't understand that but it makes no difference. The action is probably the best out of any mcu film, the choreography is amazing, the camera angles even better. The soundtrack...omg the soundtrack is excellent especially when they clash at the airport, I got goosebumps. The movie has quite a strong emotional tole as well, mainly towards the end, just watching these characters beat the hell out of each other after such long development and friendships built up between one another. The villain is really strong aswell, I'm not saying he's unique but it was bold for a marvel movie to use a villain with no real physical attributes that are superior to the heroes. I cannot praise this movie enough and frankly it is a bit underrated against the other marvel movies. 9/10 Solid stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I loved Captain America: Civil War,"For me, this movie is the epitome of what made the MCU so great in its prime. At its core, it is a Captain America film-told from his perspective, centered around his arc, and built on major revelations about him. It's a story about Steve's loyalty to Bucky and his determination to save and redeem his friend.At the same time, it serves as a culmination of everything that had happened in the MCU up to that point. The events of previous films matter here. We see all these different characters, each shaped by their past journeys. We understand their values, their perspectives, and why they take their respective stances when the Sokovia Accords are introduced. The film makes it clear why the government would push for them and why each hero would fall on a particular side-even when their choices might seem surprising.But the conflict isn't just about the Sokovia Accords. The movie also tells a deeply personal story-Steve fighting for Bucky, Tony struggling with his trauma over his parents' deaths, and his impulsive nature driving his decisions. The film delivers large-scale spectacle while simultaneously exploring themes of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal. It's big and action-packed, yet intimate and emotional. That, to me, is what makes this movie the essence of the MCU. It connects to so many past stories, feels massive in scope, yet remains grounded in personal stakes-with consequences that ripple into the future. The Avengers' split ultimately leads to Thanos's victory.Beyond that, the film seamlessly introduces Black Panther and Spider-Man while featuring the now-iconic airport battle-a sequence that is both thrilling and meaningful, carrying lasting consequences. That balance is what I love about the MCU.More importantly, the conflict in Civil War feels earned. It's the result of years of storytelling and character development, leading to a divide that still sparks debate nearly a decade later. Fans continue to argue: Was Steve right? Was Tony? Could the conflict have been resolved differently? I love that this film presents a nuanced, thought-provoking clash while also setting up future stories.This is something special. It stands as one of the absolute best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe-and the best Captain America movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best from Marvel since Guardians,"The third addition to the 'Captain America' films is here. This time our favorite hero's are pitted against each other after disagreeing when the government tries to limit their free rein. Needless to say, tensions get high and a fight between them breaks out. Or that's at least what we were pitched through the trailers. This is not what happens in the film. Surprisingly enough, It is very similar to 'Dawn of Justice'. This film offers far better editing and the stakes feel higher but that seems to be the only major differences. That was actually pretty disappointing to see. You all know my stance on 'Dawn of Justice' so I won't go into it.But seeing these two very similar movies come out pretty close together made this one kinda boring. The entire time I couldn't help thinking I had seen a version of this already. That being said, this film is not much better than 'Dawn of Justice'. My biggest gripes are unfortunately directed right at the films biggest selling point.The fact that these hero's are fighting each other. I liked the idea that there was repercussions to the mindless violence of the previous films. It made for an interesting bit of conflict early on in the movie. But it was handled very poorly. Surprisingly enough this was in direct correlation with the characters motives.Which were incredibly stupid. Caps motives are simple, I'm not taking sides with the government because they are to restrictive. Iron Mans are not so simple. At first his arguments make sense. Regardless of the people we saved there are still thousands lost. And we have to be accountable for that.But what spurred this disagreement? The film opens with a fight taking place between Cap with some others and a couple of bad guys. One guy tries blowing himself up to kill Cap but Witch lady contains the blast and throws him into the air. Right into the only building around them. It kills some people and other people get upset.So you mean to tell me that this entire film could've been avoided if she, I don't know, threw him into the open space directly above her? Or just smashed him down into the ground? Right away the entire film feels delegitimized. They seriously could not have come up with a better excuse than, Oh a lot of people died because that witch lady can't aim worth crap?Or the fact that the only reason Iron Man wants to side with the government is because some random lady got mad at him. Like, he walked out of a presentation and a random lady was just standing there starring at the wall. Was her whole plan to just stand there and wait for him so she could shove her son all over him? What if he went off a different way? What if he didn't care at all? Would this entire film not have happen if he just didn't care?With in thirty minutes the only two characters that matter are given the stupidest motives ever. What about Black Panthers motives? Why didn't the blast that killed his father also kill him? He looked actually closer to it than his dad. Oh I get it, someone had to be mad at the Winter Soldier for this film to work in the slightest. All of this is at the very beginning of the film. By the end there was a mind boggling amount of plot holes and pretend risks being taking. ‚Äã So much so that I could spend hours talking about them, but I won't. Why? Because this film isn't that bad. All the performances were pretty great. As were the fight sequences. Especially the climatic fight scene. I won't go into why it made no sense but, logic aside, it was the only part of the film that was actually involving.The film does a lot right. The action is gritty, the music is great, and the acting is pretty great across the board. But it's difficult to ignore the holes all over the script. It's plagued with lapses in logic, character motives, and it lacks the great story and villain it tries desperately hard to have. In the end this is worth seeing if only to watch your favorite characters throw down. Even if you'll have to wade through a lot of poor writing to get there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm not that impressed,"To be honest I expected more, but Marvel does what Marvel does. Before going to cinema I read lots of reviews that the movie is awesome, that it's far better than BvS, because here you can finally see a great Super-hero versus clash unlike BvS and so on. But in fact I didn't see anything that great. Sure, the movie was fine, but it was nothing more compared to the rest of the Marvel products. They just continue the trend. Nothing new, nothing extraordinary. The scenario is not that great, it's kinda predictable, it has flaws, the fightings are in the typical unrealistic Marvel style, the CGI is crappy at some points, etc etc. Don't get me wrong. The movie is good, but I'm pointing some of the flaws, similar flaws that have been pointed for the BvS movie, but here no one dares to criticise. Before calling me a DC fanboy I'd say that I'm trying to be objective here - the movie is not perfect, in fact it's not even great, because there's nothing that can impress you unless you're 14-16 years old. Sure, it might entertain you a bit, but it won't impress you, definitely.My score is 6/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Civil War: Best of Marvel,"Well its finally here! Many people have waited for this film. Me included. This film seems to have everything. The humour in this film hit spot on! I laughed every time. I have had enough of DC fans saying that if it's funny it can't be dramatic. Thats all bullshit. This film goes from hilarious, to (Mostly in the final act) extremely dramatic and heartfelt. Even though I am a Marvel fan boy, and I would have seen this film anyway, the main reason I had to see it so early was Spiderman. I am a massive spidey fan and to see him in the MCU was fantastic. So obviously spidey was my favorite part of the film. I think Tom Holland got the perfect balance between dorky as Peter and confident as spidey. The one thing that took me off slightly was the slight overuse of cgi for spidey. I can overlook this though and I had a great time with him. Cap again is great, but Downey showed us a whole new side of Tony which was fantastic too see. He was so dramatic and at times angry. It was new and exciting. It seems that the one problem everyone had with the film was the villain and how he was wasted. Because people had said this I was expecting some random villain to show up in the final act like Doomsday for BvS, but that wasn't the case at all. His plan was interesting and well worked and we really got a good insight of the character. For me this was one of Marvels best villains put to screen yet. And the airport scene... well what can I say. Again spidey stole the show for that too. If you thing you have seen the airport scene through the trailers, you are so mistaken. You've seen nothing yet. Black panther for some reason I thought I wouldn't like, but I really did. They some how got me to love him. The characters all got a good amount of screen time and they all got a good story arc. The action is just so much more enticing because we have motivation behind it and a good story. Overall this is my second favorite comic book film (1 being dark knight. There is just no beating that) and defiantly my favorite Marvel film yet. This is a film I could watch 1000 times and never be bored. This isn't just a fantastic comic book film. It's a fantastic film. Period.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Civil war is fantastic , a new classic of Marvel Studios","12 movies that your model of cinematic universe, Marvel Studios is showing a coherence logic and narrative to teach in many sequences and movie universes that are being planned, all culminating in Captain America: Civil War, a film that is both long a fanciful sequence Captain America: Winter Soldier, ""a sequence"" Avengers: Age of Ultron, an introduction of two characters pivotal to the house of the ideas that are the Black Panther and his All Star, Spiderman, how to this in a movie with so quality? The Russians Brothers could not only that, but made the best film of Marvel and say more, is by the Dark Knight as one of the most important works of the genre, with fantastic action scenes (especially one that takes place in an airport, where each character can make a more epic thing to another, using fine powers) the downtrodden whole script in vigilantism, almost post Snowden references, Robert Downey Jr justifies its very high salary and his best performance as Iron Man, a performance as magnetic as charismatic, Chris Evans creates a Cap full of nuances and layers, we feel how their decisions weigh on his journey, the new additions of the Avengers are spectacular, Tom Holland simply creates the best Spider-Man the big screen, Bosseman embodies the Black Panther with all power and majesty that the character deserves and Scott Lang Paul Rudd with his comic taken almost always well- aimed. Although sin in your villain not giving developing the character deserved and some small mistakes and lack of courage here and there, the stage is Captain America and Iron Man, with his motivations, views and his power of influence, this makes the movie relevant and opens a new range to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 9.6 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good action, but overrated","People were hyping the crap out of tho movie, so I figured I'd go see it today. Long story short, this was the first time I actually got bored at the theater. The 3D was good, the action sequences were pretty cool, and the camera-work includes some neat shots. Where Civil War falls short is an extremely boring first half. The payoff is good towards the second half with spiderman and more action, but the story gets derailed and all over the place. Not only is the story confusing and all over the place, the many slow parts of the movie just made things boring. I mean REALLY slow parts. The villain is a Russian guy apparently and not at all important to the movie, only appearing for about 10 minutes and not showing any real significance. Speaking of which, no characters showed any significance besides iron man, despite being called captain America. Had this just been Avengers 3, it might have made more sense. Captain America was there, but most of the focus was on iron man and every other character felt like cameos besides bucky and captain America. I had to give this a 6 though, because even though there are some seriously slow parts and plot holes abundant, plus an odd choice of casting (why is aunt may like 35 years old?), the film has good action and I really liked spiderman and black panthers appearances, as they really added some weight to the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain America:Civil War its just another success by the Russo Brothers,"Ater so many movies from the Marvel franchise, Civil War was one of many films that every fan was expecting to watch, and finally its here, but the question is....Captain America:Civil War its good? No.Captain America:Civil War its great!This movie its great, its a perfect example of how a Superhero movie should be, its funny but at the same time, emotional and intense with a good story.I'm not going to spoil anything so i'll be quick(...as possible)The introduction of characters like Black Panther its great, the characters are great,everyone have scenes where are show interesting and i never felt boring at all,that's because everyone have something to do in this movie( or at least most of the characters) or have an arc,specially Steve and Bucky. Almost every performance in this movie its good but the best for me its RDJ, i never saw so much emotions of Tony in just one movie and this isn't an Iron-Man movie.The story is good, Zemo is fine, i have some relative problems with him but his plan its great and at least makes sense. The soundtrack its good and the choreography its great, better than The Winter Soldier in my opinion.Even if its great, its not a perfect movie, it has some problems, Spider-Man is awesome but the use of Spider-Man was forced,almost every joke its great in this film, but suddenly there are more serious or mature scenes and then those scenes are interrupted by a joke scene, even in the War scene, and in some scenes that doesn't fit in the movie, other minor concerns are those annoying white text of the location or the final fight.

"Better than the recent crop of superhero films, Captain America; Civil War looks at dilemmas many heroes face.","Captain America: Civil WarI saw this because it was 100+ degrees out,there was nothing else to see in town, and it got good review. So, a short review is in order.Pros: No Pepper Pots, No Hulk, No space aliens, (Head) Human villain played by Daniel Bruhl. No Thor. Spider man's acrobatics. Antman was cool, shockingly, Plot had some surprises, Trailer for Dr. Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Panther kicks ass! Captain America is actually not a rule following, annoying, frat boy, kiss ass in this one.Cons: Rhodes in an Ironman suit. What a self-righteous prick. Spiderman's dialogue and childishness, Hawkeye is a waste of time, Wanda the Witch is misused, Vision was NOT a sight to behold, No one died in all the fighting, The plot has big holes, if you care to look, a dearth of decent female superheroes, a weak origin story for Black Panther, Set up had flaws like the fact that no one admitted that without the Avengers, things would be worse.Push: Wanda still a cool character even if out of place, Black Widow also seemed out of place here, Special affects sometimes special, other times, not so much. Rogers is still Captain America.Rating: Matin√©eThere was enough entertainment and an actual plot to bring out the characters. The final battle was not overblown, and while the middle battle was, it was still fun. An actual moral dilemma present in a superhero action film is refreshing even if it is too simply presented.Now, can we have Spiderman and Black Panther join up for a movie without all those other clowns? Call it, 'Good Friends Defeat Umbrella Corp', or some such thing.Peace, Tex Shelters",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yay! It's better than the mindless garbage that was Age of Ultron!,"*Real Rating: 7.5/10*My title says it all. Yes, I was not the biggest fan of Age of Ultron. I thought it was very average and as the months went on, my opinions split from my review: I thought it was worse than it originally was.Civil War is a breath of fresh air but I'll have to start off with the negatives first.1. The plot structure is a bit messy: I feel like Civil War has a bit of an identity crisis. Is it about terrorism? Is it about Bucky? Is it about Captain America? It is about Cap vs Iron Man? Is it about this new team of Avengers? Is it this? Is it that? I feel like there are too many plot elements and unfortunately the strings were not pulled tight enough. One moment the movie was about Cap vs Iron Man. Next moment it was about some terrorist.. All these elements together made it a bit confusing. Yes, things tied up at the end, but it still felt... sloppy. Just a little.2. Bucky: I feel like Bucky is just a little moron who needs to leave these movies ASAP. No questions about it. Just GET OUT! One moment, Bucky is EVIL! SO EVIL! *GASP!* Next moment, he's supposed to be.. good..? It all feels very forced, very unnecessary. I definitely see why he is very useful to this movie and further installments, but I just don't see why he is so important. In this movie, he is literally nothing. Just imagine air. He's there, but we can't see him. Nothing to him. He is just plain air. Now imagine plain air is SUPER, SUPER IMPORTANT to the plot for some reason. He is really annoying and I don't see how I can ever like his character EVER after this movie.3. Crossbones: what was that all about? If he were actually the villain in this movie, this movie would have been better. Is it even a spoiler to say that he is irrelevant?4. Underused characters: Vision? Scarlet Witch? Ant-Man? Oh, you mean those characters who didn't get to show off their powers as much as I had hoped?5. Editing in action sequences: sometimes it was good. Seconds later, I found myself aimlessly staring at the screen as the cuts were too quick and the use of (dare I say it) SHAKY CAM was annoying.---Time for the good stuff.1. The airport scene: YES!!!! JUST YES!!!! That scene was almost perfect. What would have made it perfect for me is if I got to see Scarlet's powers more and Black Widow use some of those amazing moves we see in earlier scenes.2. Black Widow: yes, she gets her own section. She's just so good! There's something so satisfying about this character. The choreography of her literally crawling like a widow up her enemies and tackling them down was AMAZING.3. Visuals: once or twice, there was an odd visual that didn't blend in right, but overall they were beautiful.4. Action Scenes: they were AMAZING! Editing on them could have been better and they could have used some wider, slower shots, but I loved them. My favorite has to be Black Panther's introduction. It was truly beautiful to see this dark creature looming over his prey with the sun glaring behind him. It was beautiful. The scraping of the claws against the walls... His introduction was very well done.5. Directing: overall, the Russo brothers should be very proud. This movie was very well made.---So that's my review I guess.. A well-made movie. Some glaring issues for me that simply cannot be disguised by the positives, but at least the positives are able to balance them out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Brilliantly Refreshing Place to Take the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Now that is how you make a superhero film. After 12 films, it seemed unlikely the Marvel universe could create something so refreshing and new, but Civil War does just that. It's impeccably paced, exhilarating, heartbreaking, and just outright fun. Captain America Civil War is one of the greatest superhero films to be put to the big screen.Civil War sees the return of most of the usual suspects from the Marvel films, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, and sets the universe in a new direction while also honoring what came before it. The Captain America 'trilogy' should be considered the most unique trilogy of all time. Although, for all intents and purposes, this film is essentially Avengers 3. Yes, the story is always focused on Cap and Bucky, but it is just as much a Marvel Universe film as a story about two best friends from Brooklyn.The Russo Brothers are thankfully back after Winter Soldier and they pulled off the impossible with Civil War. There are so many characters, plot-lines, and things that need to be set up, and it's handled wonderfully. But they also direct action maybe better than anyone in Hollywood right now. Much like Winter Soldier, the action in Civil War always hits at just the right time. The airport scene will go down as one of the greatest superhero fight sequences of all time.Newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man were brought along and implanted seamlessly. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland play the two characters brilliantly and instantly get me excited to see their solo films within the next few years.Each character gets their time to shine. Scarlet Witch is fully realized and Ant-Man, Falcon, and Vision bring the witty Marvel one- liners that they have become known for. As much as this film is deeply rooted in psychological emotion and tough character choices, it still retains the humor that keeps the film from ever reaching grim areas. It really puts to question, how much better can superhero films get?I haven't even mention Hawkeye, Black Widow, or Bucky/Winter Soldier who all get incredible moments. Does anybody not have confidence that the Russo brothers can balance 60 something characters in Infinity War in a few years? Overall, the Marvel Universe and superhero films in general, have a new level of greatness to live up to. Perhaps more time will give me perspective, but for now, Civil War is my new favorite Marvel film.+You understand both sides of the coin+That Airport scene+Builds on what came before, and sends the universe in a refreshing direction+Still a focus on Cap and Bucky+Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show+Maintains the fun tone amidst an immensely emotion film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Marvel Movie,"The character conflict in this movie is built up so well. It takes it time and lights a fuse, making not so great Marvel Movies relevant and demonstrating that there were consequences in those films while also having thrilling action and a story that you can really get invested in because of how well-realised the characters are in this film. Forget Avengers. This is the pay-off to those stand-alone movies that ranged in quality that we sat through. We have twists, broken people and relationships, enthralling action and an amazing well-done emotional undercurrent. The action choreography is so well-done and instead of having standard fight choreography like in Winter Soldier the settings combined with the great idea to make a legitimate action sequence instead of some bloated CG fest prevent any action sequence from being repetitive and dull and all of them are quite phenomenal and the character conflict make it more meaningful.And the motivation behind characters is so understandable because of their past experiences and that clash of belief ends in a dark, emotionally intense finale. Though it is still entertaining. There is humour and this movie has most fun character ensemble in a Marvel film ever and just gives out so much fan service while still feeling tangible and Civil War is throughout always entertaining. There are some flaws, most noticeably a scene at the start of the film that gave me deja vu of the most terrible parts of AOU though luckily that was one scene. There was also a bit of a lull and slow-pacing during one point in the film that affected the building intensity this film had ever so slightly and took me out of the film a little bit and there is one funeral scene that was a bit executed ever so cheesily but that is just a nit-pick. All up this film has tiny flaws and is definitely the best Marvel Movie. I love this movie and I'm pretty sure it is an 8/10 but I will have to view one more time to solidify that rating so for now I am giving it a 7.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
why why why,"Superheroes pitted against each other in a quest for righteousness this seems to be the trend this year. First it was superman versus batman and now its captain America .

And then there is the secretary of state baying for the avengers blood that they come strictly under the purview of the state for causing mindless loss of lives and property during their heroic quests.Mindless no doubt. Roped in is some sovokian guy who wants to eliminate the avengers by deliberately causing confusions amongst the avengers because his family was accidentally killed by them. and suddenly we have two avengers groups; the upright headed by Captain America and the politically correct headed by the Iron man.More surprises,the group manages to rope in The teenage spiderman and the Ant man, The picture becomes clear now.

Captain America VS Iron man right VS wrong.,"CAPTAIN America :CIVIL WAR Is a great movie. fine acting all around. and a solid story. People are going to think this is a retelling of the Cap Vs Iron man comic book event civil war. It is not. there are similarities in the comics The Super heroes are forced to a Registration cat that forces anyone that has powers to become a government agent if you refuse they go to jail. This is done after a hero VS Bad guy conflict goes wrong and destroys a city. Cap refused to sign and Tony headed it up. Both sides did not see the wrong in their actions. The Comics took a matter of three years to resolve the aftermath of the civil war. In a series a great to less then great story arcs. This movie does not have that privilege. The story here in the movie is more or less Civil War MCU style. and it raises a lot of interesting questions.After a mission in which the Avengers are trying to stop the last of Hydra wrong. a building gets destroyed And The Scarlet witch is blamed. The Nations of the world unite to bring an accord against the Avengers the accord makes them a body under the control of the UN. Captain America disagrees. He likes having a free hand. And he does admit the actions of the Avengers has resulted in destruction of cities and loss of lives but the alternate would have been worse. ""The safest hands are still our own"" Cap declares. but Tony and General Thunderbolt Ross disagree. Ross tells Cap the world owes them a huge unpayable debt but their is a percentage of the population is scared of them. they need to be reined in. Cap is scared of being turned into a weapon and being sent to places they might not want to go instead of going to places that they might need to go. then Bucky Barnes as the winter soldier reappears and complicates matter for Captain America. And once again Cap chooses right over wrong after the Avengers are ordered to being him in, But Cap finds out there is more to this then even Tony and his Avengers even knew. And it doesn't always come down to right or wrong but in loyalties and the courage of your convictions.The film is a great entry in the Captain America series but not as good as winter soldier. In looking at the movie in terms of right VS wrong for a movie that tries to show us the areas of gray. It tends to force the point. I found the villain Baron Zemo uninspired in comparing him to his comic book counter part. Zemo is simply wasted. As the Mandarin is in Iron Man III. A lot of potential ruined by a script that should have been so much more. but in what we were given the movie is more then enough. Spider-man in his first Marvel movie makes it special. tom Holland claims the role in such a way that Garfield and Mcguire never did.Of course the film ends on a sour note and in such a matter that you know it is going to be resolved in AVENGERS :INFINITY WAR or whatever the Russo's are going to call it.Civil war isn't perfect. but it delivers the goods .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A solid production of an already solid cinematic universe,"Civil War certainly presents a conflict, and it presents it in a MARVELous way.The third entry in the Captain America trilogy, Civil War gives the audience what they hope to see in an already known universe. It definitely is a worthy sequel, and it is bound to engage the audience throughout the majority of its duration.Taking on a more mature tone than what the MCU is known for, Civil War delivers an intriguing story that is told coherently and lets almost nothing escape its grasp. It tackles the criticism people have come to raise for the MCU and does not disappoint in that sense: a more adult-like narrative leaving out unnecessary humor.As it is to be expected from the name, there is a fight, a conflict, and a clash of ideals that set in motion a series of action sequences that could arguably be the best in the franchise so far, though it does seem to overuse some camera techniques that have become popular in the last decade; can you guess what I am talking about? You probably can. Other than that, the action is nothing short of awesome.The story is one of the highlight of the films, making you question whether there is a right or wrong answer in the characters' decisions, which is something fans of the franchise can appreciate. It is well told and the editing is distinguishable. However, I must say that some of the characters' motivations felt seriously forced, which makes me think that a few more minutes of running time and some adjusting in the writing could have been a boost on an already great production. Some of the dialogue could have had some tweaking as well.Although the action sequences are also a highlight of the film, especially the airport scene which I believe no one can deny was great, I feel the excessive use of the shaky-cam also makes them seem artificial, but overall, I would assert they are a step up from previous films of the MCU. The CGI could have received some polish, but it was decent even it its worst parts, and the musical score was forgettable, standing perhaps as one of the worst parts of the film. The pace of the film is also admirable, leaving almost no moment untouched by its robust storytelling.Acting was a mixed bag; Downey Jr. does a wonderful job as Tony Stark as always, as do some of the new additions to the MCU, but the rest of the cast did not really stand out, and in fact, some of the characters' accents sounded a little too fake to not notice.Despite some of its flaws, Civil War stands out as one of the best of the MCU. It just is.Recommendable? Go watch it now!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Russo Brothers strike gold again,"Straight off the bat Captain America Civil War is worth the hype,it's dark,grounded,action packed,emotional and very fun.First off the Russo brothers,these guys have to be praised because of they way how they handled each and every character in this film no matter how much of a big or small role they had everyone fit perfectly,because not only was this a Captain America sequel but this felt like an Avengers sequel as well,and the film is just handled perfectly.So this movie starts off there winter soldier and Age of ultron picks off with the Avengers team still being intact and doing their missions then as the movie goes by you start to see that the Avengers aren't so perfect as events from the first Avengers movie,Age of Ultron,Winter Soldier and Civil War it's self,reveal that people have died during these Avenger encounters and it was really never touched upon in past movies as they made it seem the Avengers saved everything and everyone with no added consequences and this is one of the things the movie does well in exploring what has happened in the past to determine everyones motivation in the film and thus the world starts to question the Avengers' methods and the civil war between the Avengers begins.What really impressed me was how solid everyones reason for being on either team Captain America(against the government) or team Iron Man(with the government) was,and what I found amazing was how no team was villainized as both sides remained neutral and the decision was really left to the audience as both sides were correct and again the points and reasoning for each side is spot on(well done again Russo Brothers).Now there are some new characters in the movie namely Black Panther and Spiderman.Chadwick Boseman nails it as T'Challa/Black Panther as he has his own agenda in the film and he is just epic as you follow him and his story throughout the movie as he is one of the best things in the movie because he was so different from any other superhero we've met before.Spiderman,man Tom Holland's performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman is just amazing and you enjoy seeing him for every minute in the movie from start to finish and I definitely can't wait to see more of Spiderman in the future.Baron Zemo is the villain in Civil War,before I saw this movie I questioned whether this film needed a villain,but Baron proved to be a good villain with good motivations.What I also found surprising is how grounded the villain was as he wasn't overblown or overcomplicated,he was just a regular guy who was against the Avengers for a justifiable reason.The Action in this movie is wonderful as Captain America:Winter Soldier had some of the best Action sequences in the MCU and I proudly say that Civil War has better,more epic and bigger action than any other comic book movie.The Airport fight scene is just incredible it's fun and heavily entertaining and it's not that one fight scene alone that's done so well as Civil War has great balance with action sequences and character interactions and with all the Avengers including Antman,Black Panther and Spiderman,Civil War is a great visual feast.The Balance of tone is near perfection as the movie is dark and grounded in some scenes,then just shifts to a light and fun tone with some humor as you laugh multiple times in the film and when the movie needed to be emotional and dramatic the Russo brothers made it that way.Since this is a Captain America film,the focus always goes back to Steve and his journey after Winter Soldier and his relationship with Bucky/Winter Soldier.Their relationship is also one of the strong points in this movie as Captain America never gives up of his friend Bucky and their relationship is tested in many ways in the movie.Sharon from Winter Soldier is back and plays as Steve Rogers' love interest which was a welcome surprise too and Sharon also has something to do other than being a love interest too.Now the movie isn't perfect(but it's really close),the Ironman introduction into Civil War at the beginning of the movie was a bit sluggish and although Baron Zemo was a good villain,but his end game at the near end of the film is a bit lacking and somewhat plot-device- ish as he makes the Avengers come into quarrel and you just find Zemo's methods questionable in order to move the movie along.So at it Captain America Civil War is a film about friendship and family which comes with the struggles of it,one thing I have to point out without giving too much away is that the friendship message is wonderful crafted in the third act and in my opinion that's were the ""Civil War"" begins as the tag lines suggested in the posters and trailers ""United We Stand,Divided We Fall"", and this message is conveyed beautiful in the movie along with some epic action,fun moments combined with some emotional moments too.A great movie and definitely one of the best Comic book movies ever made.Can't wait for Avengers Infinity War.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers 3.0,"We are in an era when MCU (Marvel Comic Universe) productions become a tentpole staple one finds rather too big to ignore on the radar, once or twice a year, there is impending danger of being ad nauseam. Re-reading my extolling review of CAPTAIN American: THE WINTER SOLIDER (2014), I am trying to figure out why the thrill has faded quite a lot this time.There is no shame to admit that the action-packed superheroes scuffle set pieces are the highlight, as in two THE AVENGERS, in fact the movie should be renamed as THE AVENGERS 3, which could take a more impartial stand in the internecine war. Maybe one shouldn't call it war, there is disagreement, but not so serious, which makes the two teams' group fighting look more than a grandstanding drill, every and each one is too valuable to kill off (since they have an entire future universe to plan), even the sidekicks, War Machine is the closest one to be dispatched, right, Don Cheadle still needs the big cheque to finance his personal projects like MILES AHEAD (2015), his director debut biography about Miles Davis. This ""play house"" frivolity becomes the hot-bed for bathos (Vision is unfortunately underused for his puissance, in order not to cause casualties, he even has to accidentally undermine his own teammate), that's why by comparison DC's BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE (2016), self-serious as it is, still eclipses this one in its narrative coherence and dialectics. If the script could reveal the key twist earlier, which would give a perfect personal excuse for a more substantial battle pathos (Bucky Barnes could be a ruthless killing machine, right?), which only fleetingly takes place in the small-scale finale, so, this is Marvel's tenor, (notably antagonises DC Comic's darkness and solemnity) - why so serious?Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Holland's young Spidey are competent comic relief, the former's low self-esteem can be perpetually milked to induce laughters and the latter's garrulousness as a rookie superhero can only be matched by the rogue iconoclast DEALPOOL (2016). Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is introduced to ensure a more politically correct leaning (the first one born in Africa), so what's next? Asian or Latin American? Or an LGBT addition couldn't be more exigent.Action scenes are sleek, often in close-range which causes some hand-held ricketiness, the indelible ones are Bucky's motorcycle hijacking stunt and Captain America's bulging biceps when holding a helicopter single-handedly. The ordinary human background of Zemo (Br√ºhl) gives his motivation a more visceral arc, but as most villains in the franchise, the chance to consummate their scheme is largely stacked with random happenings other than meticulous plotting (why on earth the script would allow an imposer of an interrogator infiltrates the faculty so easily, as if no one there has ever met the original interrogator?).A lethargy has been officially reached after this chapter, for me, at least, one needs more time to overcome it, sadly there is no stopping of it, next instalment is THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), which might explain to us the reason of Thor and Hulk's jarring absence in the fracas on earth, where is apparently too small and crowded for super-humans, deities and monsters, preparing for the next round!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expecting something different? Prepare for a treat!,"Captain America: Civil War is probably Marvel Studios' finest movie to date. The superhero registration act resembles that of the comics great, but halfway through the movie you can realize that the plot device is moved out of the focus, which you can either love or hate, depending on what you want to see. There's a lot of characters, and I really mean characters because of their distinct personalities and traits (Unless you haven't seen the other Marvel movies, in that case they are kinda good at best.) The characters developed a LOT in this movie (which is something to say since the other Marvel movies basically followed a formula.) So you will definitely see them changed to a certain degree in the next movies. One thought that crossed my mind in the cinema was: Was there too much going on? I'll admit, there was slightly too much going on in the movie, but what was in the film, they got the best out of. Another thing I personally thought was great about the movie is the change of tone. You get to see The Avengers in a different situation than before, and I think it's refreshing to see a very serious film. I'm also impressed that they pulled it off, since all of the other movies have always been light-hearted. Over-all this movie is incredible for any fan, and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen the other MCU films then you won't like as much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DC vs. Marvel: Surprisingly DC won,"Contains spoilers -This is my first review and since I am German, forgive me any grammatical mistakes.However my verdict is no mistake.It seems to be Zeitgeist, that heroes fight against heroes.In Cap3 we see Cap and Iron-Man fight against each other because Tony Stark feels bad about people getting killed (actually nobody meant for anybody to die, but Wanda's decision was not the brightest). In my opinion the suicide-bomber version in the Civil- War-Comics was a better one, than the ""colleteral damage-version"" in the movie. But that was not enough for Tony Stark to get mad as a douche-bag. Bucky killed his parents (don't remember that from any comic I've read). Don't you think, that's overkill? In my opinion it would have been the wiser choice, that Captain America doubts his action, since he was more involved in the deaths than Iron-Man. Wanda should have chosen an SM-outfit (remember Speedball in the comics), because she was involved in the deaths of many. Why does Tony Stark suffer more than Cap, when a mother gives him a photo of her son who died in the Age of Ultron-movie? My verdict: The comic on which the movie is based convinced me much more of the conflict. In the comic-books Peter Parker chose to reveal his secret identity, because that was what the government demanded so that heroes were no loose canons.DC's Batman vs. Superman wasn't as funny as Cap3 was, but: The fight between Supe and Bat was orchestrated more convincingly. The end of the fight was a humane shift of Bat's opinion, which stirred a lot of emotions in me.Cap3 let me laugh out loud in some scenes, but did not move me emotionally.If you like Cap3 and haven't watched Batman vs. Superman, please give it a try.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Thankfully, not a let-down","Captain America Civil War is the Marvel movie I've been looking forward to for a while. I've lost interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after several forgettable films post the first Avengers movie, but this partially restores my faith. It's not a masterpiece like everyone's saying it is. I think people are just so relieved it didn't turn out like Batman Vs. Superman they're giving it ludicrously high ratings. It takes a little while to get going and the political themes are handled with the simplicity of a primary school politics lesson, but the emotional stuff is handled very well. The collapse in the Avengers alliance is believable and sad, the humour is still there, the action scenes are awesome and the Russo Brothers once again prove themselves fine directors. The performances are all-around excellent, with Robert Downey Jr. giving possibly his best MCU performance to date. I have a bad feeling that once the dust settles people will look upon this less favourably, but this is a very good blockbuster, and tells the story of a small-scale superhero conflict (In the comics the civil war seems to have been far bigger) with intelligence, humour and glorious pyrotechnics.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Russo Brothers Do It Again,"Whenever Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are behind the camera for these Marvel films; I get extra excited to go to the theater and check it out. There should be no surprise that they were given the reins to direct Infinity Wars. Civil War doesn't disappoint at all as it brings the same level of tension and comedy as The Winter Soldier. Both movies tell powerful stories compared to the rest of the Marvel Universe that leave you on the edge of your seat.What made Age of Ultron just an okay movie was the lack of a strong villain and the constant running gags that can take the viewer out of the moment. The jokes really felt forced in Ultron and had me cringing all the way through. Civil War was more subtle with the comedy which I enjoy way more. Civil War goes away from the typical bad guy and makes the viewer think who is in the right. Do heroes need to be controlled by the government or should the heroes be able to be heroes?So I believe the story was top notch for a Marvel film and they were able to blend in all the characters without it being forced. It seemed like all the ""minor characters"" got equal amount of screen time which was a surprise too me. The airport scene was a little long and silly at times but it was fine. I am a little disappointed by how much the trailers gave away in the airport scene. There are still a couple of cool moments but a lot of the fighting moments were in the trailers.A Break Down of the pluses/minuses+++ StoryVillainsHow they incorporated the new charactersFighting Scenes--- Couldn't think of any glaring issues with the film just small issues that I will not spoilIf I were to rank it with the other films I would rank it fourth, behind Iron Man, Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

"Very fun, but very flawed","OK... I saw this movie like half an hour ago, so this review is as fresh as your neighbours mowed lawn on a Saturday morning. Please keep in mind that i did not read the comics, and don't know a ton about the characters backstory, so i'll only review this based on the movies. A movie should be able to stand on its own.As is custom with my reviews: good sides first.It has proper acting: This is basically a no-brainer. Marvel always has good casting choices so even the new comer Spiderman (Tom Holland) did a pretty good job as a jolly kind of Spiderman. All of the characters do their jobs and give you a feeling like time is not even passing. Thumbs up.Proper CGI: It is a Marvel movie so there will be tons of CGI, and it payed off quite nicely. Remember the third Hobbit movie? That moment when you saw the Elven army? HOLY CGI! That is not the case here. It all looks good, so i got nothing else to say here:) Thumbs up.The Story is also nice: The movie has a nicely developed story-line, and with a few twists and turns along the way, made it very entertaining to watch. Again; thumbs up.Now for the bad parts, cause the movie does have them.The story is weirdly developing: I know i said that the story is nice, yet there are also moments that are weird. Characters jump into the action without any previous knowledge about said characters, and they seem to change their opinions about each other very quickly. There is little consistency in a bunch of characters when looking at their opinions.Plots seem to disappear: There are several plot moments that just seem to vanish in the background because other stuff is happening. Someone stole a deadly virus, and we'll never hear from it again after 10 minutes.... What? What happened there? (Also, very quickly, there are more references to The Avengers movies. Like Marvel really needs to remind us about those movies that were already shoved down our throats)Characters jump in suddenly: We get to see a new character: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), but where did he come from? Honestly he just shows up and everyone is like; ""Ok... new character. Welcome to the club."" Who is this guy? What do we know of him? What are his powers? Does he have powers? I want to know Marvel! Don't keep me in the dark here!No consistency: We have seen how Cap' can hold his own against Iron Man, but in this movie he gets tossed around by characters who (as far as we know) have no special powers. There is also this moment when he runs past cars on a freeway, so like 50ish mph. But that happens only once. Later, when speed is needed, he just runs like a normal person... He couldn't run any faster? Whas there a speed limit now?These and more moments make the movie very flawed, but i'll never say it wasn't entertaining. But i guess that is what Marvel does. It is always very entertaining, but when you search for the logic, you can just keep searching...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
one of the best by marvel!,"I never expected this movie to be this good , great job! I loved the action scenes they were amazing.

If you ask me I liked black panther more than captain America. Tony stark as amazing as always .

Surprisingly good for Marvel,"Marvel have a history of promoting hyper aggressive female characters and this movie is no exception. For the first time though, they've extended that hyper aggression to most of the cast (male and female). It used to be reserved for the Hulk and Black Widow. In order to create the illusion of extreme feats of strength, the first 20 minutes of the movie was almost unwatchable as they cut and chopped fight scenes frantically. Later scenes did not suffer from this fragmentation.Then, there was the ridiculous speech by Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) telling us that the only people who face adversity were women and that no woman ever went anywhere before the 1950s. Maybe, the writers and VanCAmp should study people like Frances Kelsey and Srinivasa Ramanujan. This speech was just plain insulting. But, it's consistent with Marvel, so, everyone should be used to these propaganda statements by now.However, if you can look past revisionist history by the writers and VanCamp, the story was otherwise almost flawless. There was, surprisingly, a lot of heart to this movie. Thankfully, the writers and directors spent a lot less time on hyper-violence than past efforts. However, they are still obsessed with ninja warriors. They've now added another over the top ninja to the cast.Surprise performance of the movie was Jeremy Renner as Arrow Guy. It's the first movie where he hasn't been lame. Elizabeth Olsen also demonstrated some solid acting chops.Visual effects were surprisingly inconsistent for a Marvel movie. There is a scene with a truck and some fire which looked particularly fake.However, this movie was most the most enjoyable of the Marvel Universe for me. Some heart to the characters, good acting from most of the performers, believable conflict and a toned down Robert Downey Jr. Win, win, win.If you didn't like the Avengers movies, you may like this one. It's got enough heart that you actually care about the characters this time around. However, it's still got its share of hyper-violence, although, for the first time, most of the characters get their moment of hyper-violence, not just Black Widow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Felt like a mid season finale... A REALLY GOOD MID SEASON FINALE,"This film served as a ""mid season finale"" to both the Avengers films, the Captain America Trilogy and the Iron Man trilogy.First and foremost, this is a sequel to Captain America: Winter Soldier. We see a clear impact of the events of the previous film on Cap and influencing very important decisions he makes throughout the course of the film. We also see character arcs coming full circle in the film. Cap's interaction with Bucky, Sam (Falcon), Natasha and the Carter girls really highlights and builds upon the relationships that had been established in the earlier movies.Secondly, this was a sequel to the Iron Man films, as well as to the Avengers flicks. We see Tony's character in a much different state of mind than he was when he was first introduced to us in 2008. We see how each of his actions, in the events in the films that led to this one, have taken a toll on him and made him more somber. We also see some form of resolution and expansion to the relationships he had at the end of Iron Man 3.Scarlet Witch and Vision really helped tie in the Avengers films' story into the story. I felt the interplay between the two was done really well, and the film just established Wanda as powerhouse. She was intimidating and just flat out overpowered. I LOVED every moment she was on screen. One of the best characters in the film. Furthermore, the film also ties in the catastrophic events that occurred during both the Avengers flicks.In my opinion, you need to watch all the Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man films in order to enjoy this film to its fullest and to be invested in the character motivations in the film. But even on it's own, this film rocks. Spider-Man's role in the film was so beautifully handled with love and care. He was the star whenever he was on screen. Spider-Man is essentially Marvel, and Marvel is Spider-Man. Ant-Man had some fantastic scenes. Black Panther / T'Challa just had a presence about him. Chadwick Boseman really highlighted the character's regal decent as well as the warrior aspect. Definitely another epic addition to the MCU. Black Widow was great as always, and by now has solidified herself as a legitimate badass.Overall, this film was brilliant. It had the perfect balance of emotions, humor, grit, and action. The action in this movie was so meticulously crafted, so well handled, I feel that this film is, hands down, one of the greatest action movies ever made. What really elevated the action, were the emotional beats as well as the humor that was peppered throughout the film. It never felt like it dragged on. One slight nitpick, that I do have, is the fact that the ending of the film felt slightly abrupt. I would've liked them to have lingered at some shots, to really let the moment sink in at the end. The villain served a purpose. He was functional for the film.I'd give this film a 9.7/10 You're in for a treat .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie","Captain America: Civil War is quite entertaining, but empty superhero movie. Somehow I don't understand, why they have named it to Captain America movie? Iron Man is as least as predictable in this movie, that it could be Iron Man movie as well. It is better to call it Avengers movie. Movie is quite long (2,5 hours). It has inflate to almost too big. Somehow it feels, that it won't take too long when audience starts to get bored to these superhero movies. It has too many characters to tell well enough any of them story. It feels like presentation of all Marvel's superheros more than a decent movie. The story won't actually start and end nowhere. It is very entertaining thou and you easily spend 2,5 hours with it if you have enough candies, popcorn and soda to flush it all down. Movie has filmed in 3D format, but they won't get almost anything out of it which is quite surprisingly with this kind of digital effect movie. Primary movie leaves quite empty feeling, even it has a lot of action. Lee Falk's cameo is nice surprise at the end of the movie. At least it is his legacy to Marvel.

so finally we get to see the civil war,So I watched the movie today with a lot of expectations and really had a great time watching it.It was again the Russo brothers who brought a uniqueness to this story like the other parts as well and did a great job. Acting wise the performance of each and everyone is top class.It was great to watch team cap and team iron man battle up against each other but the only thing I felt from the first half that what would be the conclusion.So the movie went on with a smooth pace until we got to see the epic fight.Finally at the end I thought the Russo brothers might have missed a bit of essence in it which would have really made it an innovative movie. I just felt from the beginning the movie was very logical and realistic but the conclusion part somehow lost its logical focus.On the whole this was a nice end to the trilogy and will be eagerly waiting for infinity war.So for all the comic book fans this will be a refreshing comic book adaptation.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another killer movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"This is a spoiler free review so please read for information regarding if its okay for kids to watch and if its a good movie(WHICH IT IS). Alright hi, Where do i start? This is a another amazing super hero movie which is totally different from an average super hero movie. This movie is like Avengers 2.5 and I would rather have this be the Avengers movie from last year which was Age of Ultron which was disappointing. Age of Ultron was setting up way too many future movies coming out like the third Thor movie. Age of Ultron was going in a million directions and you would be clueless and ask questions like Why is he in the movie if he isn't related in any way to the story line? However this movie was on topic and had a great story and by the end of the movie you would be like that all made sense. Now lets dive in and see what made this movie amazing. After the events of Captain America The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, we see our hero Captain America doing his job which is saving people. Captain America alongside with the other Avengers: Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlett Witch and the last two have become Avengers now, are on a mission when suddenly something bad happens and a building blows up with people in it. 170 countries unite and create the Sokovia Accords which states that any super hero must sign this and register their information just in case something bad happens and you don't get the blame for it. Captain America thinks its a bad idea (which I will not spoil why). While Iron Man thinks its a great idea( Which I will also not spoil). Then it becomes small argument which then becomes a ""war' when a bombing happens and Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier gets the blame for it. Captain America knows it wasn't him and goes against the law to protect his best friend. This movie introduce two major characters who I already started loving right when they got on screen. Spider Man who I thought was like the best character of the movie right next to Captain America and Black Panther who was a bad-ass. Both just fit in the movie and made everything perfect. Spider Man was hilarious and when he came in the movie and enchanted his stuff, I was like he is what made this movie one of the best. Black Panther was a bad-ass. When they introduced him in the movie, he was being fired at by a helicopter and bullets bounced right off his suit and I was just blown away. Im not going to spoil anything else so please go watch this movie. Sadly there was one flaw of the movie, the villain. Yeah there was a small villain who didn't have a costume but in the comics he's amazing! In the movie he isn't :(. Im talking about Baron Zemo who wasn't appealing at all and has a terrible backstory but is a really good mastermind! You will see why in the end of the movie. The action in this movie blew my mind away, the airport scene was one of the best action scene I have scene in my whole life, it was beautiful, well choreographed action and each character got their own solo part which told us why we grew up loving them. So please I cannot stretch it enough to go watch this movie. IS IT OKAY FOR THE KIDS? Yes its perfectly fine just like a couple of uses of S--T which you barely hear so its fine and there was this one quick kiss that wasn't teasing any kind of sexual interaction, just a sweet kiss and was funny, you will know when you see it. This movie also has great positive messages from Captain America like you don't leave anyone behind. Chris Evans has done it again as Captain America and told me why Cap is my favorite superhero. So please go watch this movie and have a great day!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie but not great,"Captain America civil war was good not great i loved the characters and how they brought in the new one, the air port scene was fantastic but the fight between Iron man captain America and barns was epic, the only things i didn't like was how vision hardly used any of his powers during the movie, unlike age of ultron there wasn't as much action as i would have liked in this movie,and this movie was supposed to a little emotional but i didn't see any emotional spots during the movie,and the boss Baron Zemo was very weak i didn't care for him at all the only other thing that bugged me is that the only time you see antman and spiderman is only when there at the airport, i kinda wish they had a bigger part in the movie,",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A rare third chapter that's solid.,"Kevin Feige, the Russos' and the MCU crew really get Cap. The Captain America trilogy is the best trilogy the MCU has provided so far. I don't think the last two Iron Man films are any good, and Thor is quite mediocre. I'd go so far as to say it's the best superhero trilogy out there as of now(Yes I did not like The Dark Knight Rises, calm down people, just my opinion).There was no bias or favoritism involved despite it being a Captain America film. The entire time everyone's reasoning to joining a certain side is completely justified and as an audience member you absolutely see their points, making it very difficult to see who is wrong and who is right.Tony Stark has a point. This is what the world wants, some form of accountability. Superheroes should not get a free pass. Are you gonna let a superhero get a free pass if someone close to you died during some random battle? It's tough to deal with, and it's so easy to root for Cap, but realistically, if this were the real world, you would want accountability, lets not kid ourselves. Would it actually work, maybe, maybe not, but the idea of it puts everyone into a more safer and secure mindset. He knows for a fact he needs to be put in check after the events of Ultron.However, in Cap's point of view, given what happened in Cap 2, how HYDRA took over and the how untrusting the government can be, I think we can all agree the safest is in his own hands. The government may say that they care about the safety of the people, and even if that were true, they're also as interested in fighting in wars and guaranteeing their interests. If superheroes were to fall into their full control, the government would just use them for that purpose.All these ideologies and view points are present and the film does a beautiful job presenting that, it's not just superheroes fighting for the sake of fighting. Give credit to writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.The Russos' also deliver fantastic action sequences throughout. I'm not given to hyperbole, but the second act may be the best action sequence in a comic-book film ever. You'll have to see it for yourself to understand what I mean.This film is also wonderfully acted, it's the best acted MCU film to date. Scarlett Johnasson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Emily VanCamp, Don Cheadle, and William Hurt deliver the goods.Standouts to me were Sebastian Stan. He brings more to Bucky than ever. The bromance element between Bucky and Steve never felt overdone, but enough to give you the feels and make you care. He is quite a tragic character and it's very fleshed out. Chadwick Boesman delivers an effective T'challa/Black Panther. You understand his place within all this chaos. Elizabeth Olsen has a much more impactful role as Wanda Maximoff this time.I'd like to mention the bug heroes absolutely steal the show in that airport sequence. Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is basically the audience as he displays his inner fanboy. He has a big moment in the film that will surely be memorable. In a short amount of time, Tom Holland, the Russos', Kevin Feige, and the creative team at Marvel do what Sony failed to do in the past ten years or so. I'm now more excited than ever to see the next Spider-Man feature. Holland combines the best of Maguire and Garfield in his performance. Spider-Man is not just shoe- horned in, he's got a substantial role and it's just fabulous.For film's two leads, the heart and soul of this movie is Chris Evans as Captain America. One would think this is like an Avengers film, and Cap would get the short end of the stick, but to be honest, it really isn't just an Avengers film. Captain America is very much the lead character. He really is the heart of the MCU at this point. His morality is his greatest strength and there's an inspirational quality to his character. Downey Jr. this time around portrays a more disturbed and depressed Tony Stark. He's a bit more bleak and it's fascinating to see Tony at this state. Without any spoilers, Evans and Downey Jr. display their finest performances as these characters with an very intense and gut wrenching third act.The only nitpick I have is Zemo played by Daniel Bruhl. Although I loved his portrayal and found to understand what his motivations were, it seemed as if his execution heavily relied on coincidences a little too much. It seemed very far fetched for all the things to unravel at point of the film, but it didn't take away from the impact it had. Honestly they didn't need Zemo at all, if you took him out of the equation then I would contend that this is a near perfect superhero epic.With all that being said, it's still a wonderfully crafted film that did not disappoint. Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them. In my opinion Captain America: Civil War breaks the curse of every superhero threequel being either bad or disappointing. Civil War is another knock out and entertains relentlessly. It's an impressive opening to Phase 3 and nudges out The Winter Soldier for me by a hair. The Russo Brothers have a very good hold of this franchise now. They knew when to be serious and when to be humorous, balancing out the tone of the film extremely well. Not to mention juggling every character as much as they can. I think Infinity War is in very good hands.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain America: Civil War (2016),"The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier.Although Thor, the Hulk and other recurring characters have gone missing this time (with somewhat vague explanations for their absence), nobody's going to mistake ""Civil War"" for a chamber piece. Trailers sold this installment as a tale of intra Avengers warfare, set off by the government's demand that Captain America (Chris Evans) allow the arrest of his old friend The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), an assassin whose moral compass has been scrambled by brainwashing, so that he can be punished for his presumed role.There are more than a dozen major characters and another dozen minor ones, including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), all running, flying, stomping and blasting through a long, lumpy story inspired by the 2006 Civil War graphic novel arc. Thematically, it's potluck. Like ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" ""Civil War"" is simultaneously about the ramifications of US intervention in a post-9/11 world; the responsibility of private military contractors (which is basically what the Avengers are here) to defer to their government and the United Nations; the question of whether civilian casualties negate the righteousness of a noble mission; the allure and price of vengeance; and individuals' ongoing, never-finished struggles to understand how their pasts drive their present-tense actions. (Several characters confess that they act from compulsion and then find ways to rationalize it.)There's a fair bit of ""The Dark Knight"" logic, or ""logic,"" to the storytelling. Characters do things to other characters because they know it'll set off a chain reaction that'll eventually lead to a very specific moment at the end; luckily for them, each step goes according to plan, because if it didn't there would be no movie. And, as in the inferior yet thematically similar ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the hero-versus-hero slug-fest only seems to spring from real and deep philosophical differences. It turns out that the real problem is that these characters don't talk to each other when they should.All that said, this is a satisfying film that takes its characters but not itself seriously, and mixes sequences of wonder, visual wit and pathos in with the world-building and dramatic housekeeping. Reuniting the Cap creative team of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, ""Civil War"" gets better as it goes along, both as an action movie and a sprawling ensemble. I've seen reviews complaining that no character gets enough screen time, but to me the distribution felt just about right. We know a lot about the established characters by now. There's not much this film needs to say about Peter Parker except that he's a lovable wise-ass spider-teen who lives with his Aunt May (51-year old Marisa Tomei, looking more like Aunt February) and has only been slinging web for six months. Nor does this story require much more of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) but that he act starstruck by Tony and Cap and the gang and try too hard. Black Panther, aka T'Challa‚Äî subject of an upcoming Ryan Coogler solo movie‚Äîis defined by his righteous anger over an injustice perpetrated against his family and his nation, and that's exactly where the character needs to be for this film.The action is solid, sometimes inspired. The best set piece in ""Winter Soldier,"" Cap taking out a bunch of would-be assassins in an elevator, had a frenzied smallness that was much more exciting than watching heli carriers crash and monuments crumble; it seems to have inspired the better action scenes here‚Äînot just a stairwell punch- fest that finds Bucky swinging from a torn-up stretch of railing like Tarzan on a vine, but in a bigger, louder, wilder clash between Avengers (including emergency ringers Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther) on an airport runway. Although the clich√©d hand-held, whipsaw-crazy action still lacks beauty and personality (a problem throughout Marvel's filmography, which has an assembly line quality) it's clean and exact, it makes clever use of the various heroes' powers, it's more comedic than vicious (Buster Keaton and Steven Spielberg are clear influences), and it leaves no doubt about the characters' angles and methods of attack, where they are in relation to one another, and what's at stake.The script never convincingly squares this film's vision of Cap as a guy who's willing to go it alone against government forces (led by William Hurt's Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross) who want to regulate super-heroic interventions with the Captain America of ""The Winter Soldier,"" who decided he'd rather go against his own government than allow one of its highest ranking military officials to order extrajudicial assassinations. ""We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,"" Cap tells Tony, a sentiment that could easily have been placed in the mouth of Robert Redford's ""Winter Soldier"" character Alexander Pierce. It's as if Cap is a hypocrite who thinks vigilantism is OK as long as he's the vigilante‚Äîwhich would be a solid point if anyone in this movie raised it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Brilliantly Emotional Superhero Movie...With Politics,"Combining political intrigue with superhero action is a daring, risky move...but ""Captain America: Civil War"" couldn't be in better hands. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo prove once again to be the best directors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, turning Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus's brilliant screenplay into a work of art. No other Marvel movie has yet delivered such a fluid combination of intelligence, symbolism, and heartbreaking opposition as the Russo brothers' latest entry into the already amazing Captain America series.Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America) reminds audiences why his hero has always been the most likable as he embodies the valiantly flawless titular hero in a way only he can. Robert Downey Jr. introduces a new side of his smarmy Tony Stark/Iron Man, which will either make you love him all the more or repel you, depending on who's side you take. And that's one of the many beauties of ""Civil War"": the viewer has to determine hero's side he's on, as both have their own opinion of the ""Sokovia Accords"", a document that will put the United Nations in charge of all super-powered individuals.As both heroes recruit others of their kind to fight for (or against) the ""Sokovia Accords"", a scheming puppeteer manipulates them, practically unseen, both Captain America and Iron Man mistakenly believing the other to be the true enemy. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo, the man most determined to accomplish his agenda, is the most moving, emotional performance in the whole movie. Helmut Zemo is at once terrifying and enigmatic, in a way no other Marvel villain has been before, and he accomplishes this without any superpowers, bringing to mind Heath Ledger's Joker. As he stares blankly into space listening to a voice recording on his phone, his motionless face says more than any other actor in the whole film. And that's saying a lot, because most of what fuels ""Civil War"" is dynamic, passionate acting from almost all of the actors.During its worst moments, the film is thought-provoking, conflicting, and emotionally immersive, and when an action scene obligatorily comes along, it doesn't forget the inherent tragedy of the circumstances. The many lighthearted, chuckle-inducing moments (many courtesy of Ant-Man) don't distract from the plot, but remind us that the dueling heroes are still friends, despite their differences. The third installment of the Captain America series--and hopefully not the last--is sure to excite superhero fans, and also entice those harder to please.Synopsis: ""Civil War"" is an instant classic that transcends typical superhero movie expectations with powerful acting, an artistic vision, and a story that will incite discussions and arguments many years from now.Official Rating: 103.7/100* *Anything over 100 indicates a Great Movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not groundbreaking but a lot of fun,"Nothing lasts forever, a sentiment that extends to the now overstuffed and far to frequent superhero films of the modern day and where adventures like Spider-Man or the team up of The Avengers once felt like a true event, superhero films whether they be of Marvel or DC variety in today's climate feel increasingly uninspired and forgettable, which makes the enjoyment levels found in Captain America's third outing Civil War that much more surprising.While it neither reinvents or rejigs the comic book staple that has become so stale over recent years and while it sometimes takes itself far too seriously for its own good, Winter Solider helmers Anthony and Joe Russo successfully balance a large roster of beloved characters and a couple of new ones in the form of a fresh faced Spider-Man and Black Panther to make Civil War's slightly overlong run time an enjoyable and likable event.Delving into the idea of an inwardly warring Avengers group with larger than life personalities like Tony Stark clashing with the well-meaning and old school like Steve Rodgers, Civil War presents us with a collection of superheroes and super soldiers that aren't all lovey-dovey, rather at the point of blows within a world that no longer wants to give these creations free reign around the globe, themes that were prevalent in the recent Batman v Superman but explored far more enjoyably here in this more fun focused ride.With its fair share of dialogue heavy situations and scenarios, the Russo's infuse Civil War with a collection of highly entertaining action set pieces filled with great moments (many that involve a teenage Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's endearing interpretation of Ant Man) and humorous quips by its now seasoned cast members that make its weaknesses like a largely forgettable baddie in the form of Daniel Bruhl's Zemo and terrible payoff of bad guy motivation and plans far more tolerable and new cast members Tom Holland as Peter Parker and 42s Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther seem like positive additions to an ever expanding roster of players.Hard to hate and easy to enjoy, Civil War doesn't exactly make one feel as though the superhero blockbuster is 100% assured heading into the distant and not too distant future but it certainly enough to makes a now cynic like me feel far more willingly to be a part of the crowd pleasers for the next little while as long as they are as well played and constructed as this energetic adventure.3 1/2 Vision cooked dinners out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm a massive Marvel fan so you can trust me when i say this is really cool.One of the best team up movie's I've seen in a long long time, i did watch this when it came out but i felt a review is in order.

Real Life Without Being Real Live,"I'm not a big comics guy nor do I really follow all of the ""super hero"" type movies that seem to be coming out every couple of months or so... at least before the China virus super villain invaded Hollyweird and the rest of humanity. But I really like the Captain America series for its generally pro-America/Liberty/Freedom stance and its ability to tell great stories related to the times we are in without flinching and with only names and fancy uniforms to stand in for the real-world entities they mirror.""Civil War"" is a magnificent embodiment and reflection on our divided political views and the sometimes harsh realities that come with being ""free"" and defeating tyranny: Do we play nice and appease the evil forces in the world for the sake of avoiding potential collateral damage in confronting them now before they get too strong to defeat? Or do we look the other way and pretend the forces of evil aren't there and continuing to grow as we paper over the reality with formal systems of appeasement such as the UN in an attempt to lend credibility to our cowardice? Do we face ridicule and punishment for standing up to evil now even though the inevitable costs of doing so will be high? Or do we keep our mouths shut and hope for the best while knowing that eventually, everything we hold dear will be destroyed if we ignore our consciences? Or do we do the right thing anyway and accept our roles as outcasts and scapegoats in the eyes of the very society we save from itself?This is a pretty serious film about a very serious time in the history of our world which is now. Bravo to the studio and all involved for making such an unflinching piece of ""fiction.""The only reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10 is because I believe that the use of CGI is excessive and distracting. I think a lot of the scenes could have done without it or used some other ""real"" methods to get the same effect. At some point you have to ask if the film is live action or a cartoon. And while it is a mix of both, it relies a little too much on the later. Obviously some scenes could not be done without CGI but many could have been done without it... as with fight scenes between two or more characters which could have been done live action but CGI characters were used instead. This to me is just distracting and it pulls me out of the film. Plus there were some other things that bothered me such as the under-explained absence of The Hulk and this new character ""Cross-Bones"" that, while I know his background, just seems unnecessary, underdeveloped and gets lost in a sea of other much more important and interesting characters.Also, the witty banter, tough-guy (gal) one-liners and super-stylized poses and moves starts wearing thin really quick. It's just too much. Much of the dialog, I'm sure, is designed to inject comic relief but it winds up feeling forced and inappropriate much of the time... like when ""friends"" are fighting and practically trying to kill each other they like to quip back and forth with jokes or comments of admiration on their fighting styles or their snazzy outfits. Just not very appropriate and is in juxtaposition to the serious nature of the situations. Sort of like your oncologist telling you a ""bald guy"" joke while you are dying of cancer. Again, pulls me right out of the film.If they can stop going overboard with the CGI and constant cringe-worthy attempts at tough one-liners and failed comic relief, they will have a great formula for future films. Overall a great movie and well worth the viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good for one time watch, don't expect too much","Its good enough for a one time watch but its not that great. Too many characters make it look crowded.

Rest of the characters like spidy, ant man, hawk eye appear for one fight scene which was shown in the trailers. Action scenes are well directed which has become a hallmark for Marvel. The movie over all despite its aww and pomph movie lacks the usual Marvel punch. The ending of the movie is very emotional and creates an upset in the Avengers story line.

Good but could be better.,"First of all, i'll like to say that the movie in it self is a good movie, although it may lack of a more objective point of views.I'll start with spiderman, his better than expected, and provided the movie with a little freshness, therefore plus to spiderman, but not not to the CGI-suit that is horribly done. Antman on the other hand isn't that good, he's boring just like the Antman- movie.Now to the actual problem; Ironman vs Captain America. Both sides have equally good counter argument for whether or not to sine this Sokovia peace document. But it does not really show what it means to side with the Cap, to put it more directly, The Cap's actions for doing the right things doesn't cost enough casualties and the Ironman side doesn't sacrifice as much freedom as they where afraid of. to sum it up, this movie doesn't make it clear, that the problem is about the document, and not the kindergarten-hunt for Bucky. This movie, focuses too much on Ironman, and is leaving a feeling that you have to take his side.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing you haven't already seen one million times..,"Seriously rating 8.3? This is meant to be one of the best movies of all times? I was really bored to death! Endless fighting scenes with nothing that we haven't already seen a zillion times: PIM-PUM-PAM superhero falls but then stands up and fights back PIM-PUM-PAM and the other superhero falls down. There are no fresh ideas, not even the slight effort to show something a minimum original or new. The plot is all but credible, full of ridiculous dialogues and impossible to believe behaviors. And when you don't have ideas you have to fill the void with a lot of superheroes - so many that you will lose yourself and ask why FART-MAN didn't turn up for a go! From a technical point the fighting scenes are also of very poor quality - it looks like many frames are missing from the shooting and these scenes do not come out smooth and are quite disturbing for the eye (looks like a 1970's camera was used).",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Marvel (not just MCU) Movie For Now,"For a while, many fans were worrying about how this movie will compare against a particular movie which the title I forgot maybe because it's awful, something that rhymes with ""Blackman"" I think.Well,no need to worry anymore, because this is by far the Best MCU Movie to date (for me). No spoilers here,just want to say how awesome this movie is. We have the best action scene, the best story, and also the best Spiderman that Marvel movies have given us till now. The Airport battle, as you hope for, amazing, absolutely amazing. The characters have so much complexity and depth that you can see a big change among them especially Tony and Cap.

The MCU has grown up and is tackling mature themes,"This is by far the MCU's darkest and mature film. The action has become more gritty, realistic and violent. The acting has gotten more serious with some humour thrown in for comic relief. Themes are no longer childish and involves terrorism, death, betrayal, politics and vengeance. The writing no longer panders to children, but to all demographics. Overall, the quality has improved drastically from previous MCU entries in writing, acting, direction and technical aspects. However, the film isn't dark and serious like Nolan's Batman because it sticks to its comic book roots and is able to distinguish itself, and not become generic.

"good film, not great","I went to a first showing at my local Imax, and as with all first showings the atmosphere was good as always. Thing is with all Marvel movies now is that there isn't very much you haven't seen before. Unlike batman vs Superman this movie introduces new characters in a easily accessible way to non fans. That being said there is very little else i can say that hasn't been done in every other Marvel film to date. Except in the last 2 minutes of the final battle i felt no character was in any danger at all. Its like WWE, you know everything will be OK in the end. Both leads are brilliant as always the supporting cast was brilliant and the new comers were very good. I cant seem to shake this feeling of I've seen it all before and the knowledge that Disney is hyping this into a masterpiece when its just a rehash of a rehash. To avoid spoilers its limiting me to what i can say all i can say is its standard Marvel, forgettable villain,lots of mid fight quips and no sense of danger at all.

A Grand Slam,"Captain America:Civil War was everything BvS wanted to be but Warner Brothers didn't have the patience to let it become.It's tight with a coherent narrative, serious themes and real stakes. It's not concerned with world building because the world has already been built. When heroes come into conflict, we understand the ideological and sometimes personal reasons. Nothing is easily or even completely resolved. More importantly, though, is the fact that we've been with these characters for 13 films now, mostly with the same actors. This heightens the emotional investment. Watching these guys come to blows actually matters because of their long relationship with each other and with us.As far as the core conflict, one of the flaws in the original comics was that there was really only one side you could be on because too many crossover comics had Stark crossing the moral event horizon and basically becoming a villain. In this, you can at least see reason in both arguments, neither side is a bad guy. While Zemo is the ultimate villain of the film, he's really just the catalyst that forces the issues that have been brewing to the surface. This makes the fights that much more poignant. That said, I personally remain firmly Team Cap.For those who have read the original comics version, they've fixed the other problems that plagued it and included some awesome homage moments.Now for some of the fun stuff. Black Panther was excellent, the fights were epic, Spider-man was just right and showed he belonged on the same stage with the rest of these guys. I'm stoked for both their upcoming solo films, and damn Ant-Man is seriously cool in this movie.The Russo brothers have shown that they can handle a large ensemble cast of unique characters with a sprawling story and tell it in a serious tone with just the right amount of comic relief. They have my full confidence for Infinity Wars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Assembled Super Hero Movie Yet,"After the disappointment of Age of Ultron and Batman v Superman, Civil War stood up and taught us why a great script is the stepping stone that every big superhero movie should be based on. It showed how every character must be treated and why their development is important.The characters were all well done. Spidey inclusion made the movie fun and more lighthearted, Black Panther was interesting and important to the story, and both had some cool action scenes. Captain America and almost everyone else were well presented, they had their time to shine and a coherent and understandable reason to choose a side in the story (except maybe for a rushed Vision). However, Iron man was the most complex one and Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of him was perfect, it was very pleasant to see in a character with so many changes of mind that all those changes were rationally and emotionally well motivated.The villain was one of the best of the MCU, he had the most rational plan of all MCU villains (with also a cool twist plot), Bruhl was great and made the most ""normal"" villain the most harmful one.It was a normal movie technically-wise (same aesthetics in every MCU movie) but had remarkable action scenes.The mayor issue I encountered was the pacing in the beginning, it was quite rushed, and the movie seemed destabilized and messy until it found its way.It's easily one of the best MCU movies and I'm glad to see the Russo brothers will be directing Avengers 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It was not that good,THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSCaptain America Civil War didn't blow me away. It was a pity since I'd been so hyped up for it for nearly a year and... I don't know it just fell flat to me.See the thing with these kinds of superhero vs superhero films is that the point of conflict has to be a gray area where no party is in the write or wrong. It draws in the viewer and keeps them invested. Though I really love captain America I just really found myself not really getting where he was coming from. I just felt like what iron man was doing reasonable and couldn't fathom why people even took cap's side.And Wanda literally just set fire to an entire building and injured hundreds; why is everyone not regarding her as dangerous? And Bucky is dangerous!Trying to get them on their side was the worst idea ever.The only saving grace for this movie was Black Panther and Spiderman. This film could be summed up in one sentence: Tony gets angry because Steve considers Bucky a better friend.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Civil war gives you exactly what you expect, and my fears of the film being to clustered did not come true. The russo bros managed to give you ample time with each character and each of them bring something unique, ant-man had a BIG role in parts of this and it was just perfect, black panther is probably the show stealer, his demeanor and everything is just nasty!

I need to see it again just to catch all the small details that i know are stuffed in the 2 and a half hours, but for the most part you can grasp and stay along for the ride fairly easily, not a lot of slow parts, and if there is...you are definitely engaged.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Strange conflict,"I found the fundamental conflict here very confusing. It's about whether the Avengers should be bound to international legislation. The international community has already voted yes. If Avengers say no, they are in breach of international law. If they say yes, they are not. Obviously they should say yes, because if the international community asked them to do something they didn't want to do, they could still refuse and breach the law. The question is just should we decide right now to breach the law, or wait until a problem comes up?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Captain America: Civil War is Marvel at its best - refreshing, bold and innovative","Captain America: Civil War is bold, innovative and altogether refreshing. Impressively switching between character-driven dialogue development, all-to-the-wall action scenes and a depth to a war and conflict that others could only dream of (looking at you, Batman vs Superman), Civil War is impressive because of what is at stake and what we know lies ahead. It wins by building to this point thirteen episodes into its Universe run and offering more for the audience to invest themselves in - there is no winners, or losers, or good people or bad people as such, just individuals with different approaches, opinions and emotions and Civil War wins by accepting each of these and exploring them in thought provoking and progressive ways. I genuinely do not know where this Avengers unit is going next and as long as Marvel do not hit the reset and send everything back to being peachy keen, they will have myself and many others beside them for the journey.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/LsfQzS",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Age of Marvel,"Despite the rather similar line up, it has obviously been decided that Captain America films would involve a little more of the adult world, leaving the Avengers movies for pure SMASH. Hence the Age of Ultron was a bit of a mess, but the Cap is ahead of the curve. Another clue is the leaving out of the ultra cartoons Hulk and Thor.One of the advantages of Captain America is precisely his lack of charisma. That throws the laugh lines to everyone else - even the Vision gets to clown about. And it's the humour, interjected in the action and intrigue that is handing these films a massive boost. The Black Panther is mainly given space to be Noble (joking aside, he is the one actually enhanced black guy, not mere sidekick). And Spider Man, take 3, is probably the best man / boy for the job.Once you get used to the sudden switches of city (usually with the name written across the entire screen) the frenetic pace doesn't trip the film up. There are still a number of plot holes and lacunae, but these are forgotten about because we got to see gems like Tony Stark sitting in Peter Parker's student room, chatting up Aunt May.The plot is certainly one we've seen before, but is a better way to house this type of titanic film than 'beat the super villain.. GO"" or battle for the super thing-my. One of the strongest lines is given to the injured War Machine (or Iron Patriot. Or War Hammer) - who expresses his support for the hardline position right to the death - giving the film a palette of grey that allows for a serious review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A masterfully done superhero movie!,"REVIEW (Non-Spoiler):Captain America: Civil War is an extra-ordinary feature film that consistently balances all the characters in the film. Every character has a shining moment and the right amount of screen-time. The actors have done a splendid job but few of them had outstanding performances like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron-Man/ Tony Stark, Tom Holland as Spider-Man/ Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther/ T'Challa. The directors (Russo brothers) have delivered a thriller/drama superhero movie with such an intricate and well- written story, the introduction of new characters has been handled smoothly and doesn't feel forced.Marvel has always been prominent for it's action sequences and it delivers again with Civil War in both the second act and third act fight. The airport fight sequence is one of the best choreographed battle I've seen on a cinema screen and the third act fight is simply outstanding. It is justified, raw, emotional and full of wow moments. This movie doesn't have black and white characters, the audience gets to see both sides and also faces a tremendous difficulty in choosing a side. Both Captain America and Iron Man have logically sound reasons and the right motivation to fight each other.The villains of the MCU have been generally regarded as weak, Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo is no exception. The character's development could've been better, there were few areas that could be explored for this character but nevertheless he does a good job. The visual effects are well done but weak in certain scenes. These are some of the minor flaws in this movie. There are incredible twists and turns in this film. On a final note, this film has consistent story- telling, right doses of action and neatly placed humor. It is arguably one of the best Marvel movies and gets better with every viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel films are usually pretty good. This gets only a 6 from me.,"I always loved Marvel films with all of the comic book characters coming to life. The action and special effects are always great and they are here too. Tough to beat what they had in Deadpool though. This is is little too long and had silly cross stories to fulfill the Civil War prerequisite. They want to fight each other and it gets a little silly through most of the film. If you are into explosions and such, this is fine. But to work your mind and follow what is happening, not so much. I guess I need to write more so I will to get his review in. I really don't have that much to day about the film since none of really sticks to my brain. Great films do that. This one didn't The great part of all these Marvel films is the cameo role of Stan Lee in every film. This one is very late in the film. Also, there is great info about a new Spiderman movie coming in the future with Marissa Tomei as his aunt. She has more lines in the but after al the credits roll than in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A real compromise between ......,"Don't think I am going to talk about a compromise between the Iron Man and Captain America. But the compromise by each of the viewers of this movie to its director, camera man and script writer, for testing the patience with their not at all promising job.Script.. New style scripting makes sure that, 90% of the viewers will never understand what's going on the screen. Direction... I don't think the director has taken this movie seriously with some proper home work, except a few graphic works here and there and dragging scenes.Camera Man - Its pretty clear in the scenes that, the camera man was over excited about the action scenes, or he him self was cutting vegetables keeping camera in one hand. Camera movement was faster than the speed at which the cars in the scenes move around... viewers needs to strain the eyes to understand what is going on.. Poor camera handling at all.After all, those who want to loose money in big screen and those who wants to sleep in theater, its a nice choice.I am wondering, how come this movie has a big rating of 8.5 in IMDb? Bogus !!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cap does it again,"After seeing Captain America Civil War I realize the Captain America trilogy is one of the best trilogies that there have ever been. The first avenger wasn't completely loved by everyone, but I enjoyed it very much and it was a great setup movie. Winter Soldier was a unique superhero movie that I thought was outstanding. Now... with Civil War it has done it again as this is emotional and powerful. The action scenes in this movie are jaw dropping. The thing I am most excited for after this movie is the fact that the Russo brothers are doing Infinity War. The focus on all the characters in this movie is done very well, even though there are characters I wanted to see more of, it was still the perfect way to focus on them. Overall, this movie had me on the edge of my seat as there is great focus and exhilarating fight scenes. Every character is this movie is either introduced well (Black Panther, Spider-Man) or has their character built in positive ways. It was hard for me to pick a side, because the arguments were valid and although contrary to many reviews I enjoyed the main villain. There isn't a superhero movie like this one... highly recommended!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel's Best Movie Yet | Review of 'Captain America: Civil War',"This film is without a doubt Marvel's best film yet. First, let's applaud the writers here because they took a story and adapted it as best as they could to tie it into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they were able to do that without tarnishing the story. That right there is fantastic writing. That is spectacular writing and something Warner Bros. and DC could take a page from. This is one of the reason's Marvel movies are so popular because they bring to life a story and characters while keeping both of those faithful to the original creation. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. were perfect for their roles. Everyone was perfect for their roles. This is cast who not only understands their characters, but they also understand the character dynamics not just in the story but also regarding each other, and they are friends. Everyone here is friends with someone else, and it is believable not just because they are friends in real like but also because they have such great chemistry with one another. The foundation of the film is solid, and that is the key to a successful movie.The story is a little convoluted but only because Zemo (played by Daniel Br√ºhl), the villain, goes through very elaborate means to bring the Avengers to their knees. He makes them turn on one another, and it's very strategic, easy to follow, especially when all the elements are laid out for the audience by the end, but, again, it does come off just a little contrived. Despite that though it was still thought out. This evil plan was without any holes, it flows and kept the underlining tension afloat. Of course, the relationship between Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and Captain (Chris Evans) did that all by itself.As mention above, the casting is fantastic. Civil War is full of talented actors who know the characters and how to bring them alive. However, Stan and Evans, their characters have such a long history and a remarkable brotherhood here, it's not just a bromance, they are family. These two characters, they capture that love, that intensity, and that friendship so powerfully, and for the trilogy, this element is what made this film spectacular. All the characters are intense, and as the tension rises, these friendships are put to the test. They are each fighting for what they believe in, and that is putting them all at odds. It's heartbreaking because the actors make it so. Yes, the writers did that in the screenplay, and yes, the director wanted that as well, but these actors were able to bring it all to life.This is all great and perfect to make an incredible film, but Marvel is magnificent at incorporating comedy with seriousness. This isn't just another superhero action movie, but it's also not just a drama like some movies *cough* BvS *cough*. No, this film has perfectly woven exceptionally clever comedic into it that just make everything so entertaining. Paul Rudd and Tom Holland, in particular, were such great additions to the movie because they brought out the light moments within all the seriousness. Yes, so did the other characters, but these two were phenomenal.Captain America: Civil War is the best Marvel movie (live-action) to date. Not only does it have an amazing story full of heart, but it also has great directors, great actors, and those two screenwriters, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, deserve some massive praise here because they adapted it to perfection.Check out more reviews at https://cynsworkshop.wordpress.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Age of Ultron! Has enough characters to be another Avengers!,"This movies plays out the many who would win between ____ & ____? It was fun to see certain heroes combos fighting each other, and the introduction of newer characters was done smoothly. Spiderman, Ant man and Black Panther solid in their performances. The fight between all the heroes in Berlin was easily the best part of the whole movie. Even watching it a second time I was waiting eagerly to see this scene again.Captain America and his story seemed to play second fiddle to the over arching civil war. His romance was a bit a of a waste time, especially in the fact that his love story has hardly any return in the next few MCU movies. His bromance with Bucky was interesting enought to keep watching over the length of two movies.The humour was relatively absent from any scenes including Captain America. The only laughs to be had were when other characters were in the scene.Ironman almost gets more character development than Captain America through learning to submit and not be so proud. How does Captain America change as a result of this movie? He has asserted himself as a capable leader and a sacrifical friend. But I had hoped for a bit more. Although this movie is a much better Avengers movie than Age of Ultron. A better story and a much more relatable enemy, and even the enemy within your own heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There are better Marvel flicks,"I find it hard to care about this film. It's a direct sequel to Age of Ultron, the worst Avengers movie, and whilst this movie is definitely better than AOU but it's premise is odd to me, like how would the government enforce their regulations on super humans? Do they answer this question? I don't remember because I got bored, and usually Marvel movies are at least entertaining. I also thought that the conflict between the avengers was kind of dumb.

A mad tour-de-force.,"This is a quite an intense superhero movie, where a UN interference attempting to rein in the Avengers' unlimited powers ends up pitting them against one another, with Iron Man going along with the UN and Captain America going against. Caught in the middle is the Winter Soldier, who was alleged to be a responsible for a host of crimes, but contends that he only committed them because he was brainwashed by Hydra.This movie takes off almost immediately, with action and suspense leading to the two opposing teams of superheroes quarreling with one another. Differing from past Marvel films, the plot does not rely too heavily on crazy CGI and explosive action; rather, it highlights the intrigue and tension between Captain American and Iron Man, along with those on their respective groups, and the unpredictable consequences it leads to.The introduction of Spider-Man in movie was a great treat (Tom Holland did a nice job in portraying the enthusiastic superhero), and the incorporation of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) just adds on to the fun. It is a tour-de-force seeing so many of the Marvel characters all in one movie, duking it out with each other in spectacular special effects fashion.***spoiler ahead*** It's too bad, though, that the film was rather anti-climatic, leaving much loose threads toward the end. ***spoiler ends***And, with so many Marvel characters featured, the movie could have used a bit more screen time for them, especially Ant-Man and Spider-Man. Too much emphasis was placed in Captain America, the Winter Soldier, and Iron Man in the latter half of the movie. I thought there was also a little too much drama placed on the characters trying to explain their position as to why they support or not support the UN accords.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Most Impressive Entry in MCU,"From the first introductory to the second dark political thriller, the Russo brothers has surprised the audiences by transforming the entire tone of the series into a psychology based superhero film. It's a mini Avengers reunion but more centralise on the conflicts between Captain America, Winter Soldier as well as Iron Man and with more grounds to cover, both Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who have written the first two installments managed to ensure the well-pacing of the story without losing its sense of intentions. Continuing the epic traditional fighting sequences from previous episode, the 13th outing of this MCU adventure offers a wide variety range of action scenes and it is evenly distributed among all the superheroes through efficient cinematography of switching without focusing much on gunshots, smashing and explosions. All characters are engaging thanks to the compelling character developments; Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. and Sebastian Stan deliver well as their roles respectively in term of resolving the challenge of their friendship test, the other Avengers perform outstanding too especially the brought in of Spider-Man, Back Panther and Ant-Man have added more fun and joy which is entirely absent in DC's Dawn of Justice. It is emotional, inspiring and perfectly crafted, implying that the actions chosen between the two main characters are not anything about right or wrong, but more on perceptions and the outcomes. While the Captain America trilogy is not up to The Dark Knight trilogy masterpiece, the decision to explore thought- provoking themes have made it one of the most impressive series in MCU.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Civil War: Cap's Galore.,"This movie is incredible. For those of you who were left disappointed or underwhelmed by Age of Ultron, or if you liked the movie all the same, Captain America: Civil War opens up the flood gates and doesn't hold back with exploring The Avengers in greater detail than before. Civil War succeeds in direction and writing where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ultimately failed to live up to.Marvel keeps outdoing themselves with churning out these movies on a regular basis, but this film might stand out as being cream-of-the- crop against all the other Marvel Cinematic Universe installments made thus far. The movie is not completely perfect for me: there were some pacing issues pertaining to Black Panther's introduction, but aside from that little problem Civil War destroys all the stops and goes forward into ridiculously ambitious territory that these types of movies should achieve.Captain America: Civil War actually stands out as its own thing as well. Sure it's another chapter in the Marvel Universe essentially, but you get that these characters have emotions, values and ideologies that aren't entirely dependent on sequel-knowledge. I'm happy that a Marvel movie has made me feel the same way The Dark Knight left me; Civil War can be seen as a single episode of a bigger picture, or you can just dive right in here if you really want to.Civil War, Cap's Galore, Will Not Bore, Want Some More, Roger's Lore, Marvel's All. 5/5 stars.P.S. Spider-Man is in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The only compaint is that the movie is not that deepbut still it has to be the best captain America movie,"The movie is too good, it is not that deep or that close to reality but still I totally enjoyed it. It was great to see the that how a different perspective could lead to bad things. Every time you see the movie you get a different view of the situation, in this movie, no one is correct or I should say that everyone is wrong as well as right in their own way.
It's awesome fights sequences are great but only one complaint, which is, I felt that the final fight could have been better, because in the competition 'DC's Batman Vs Superman: dawn of justice' proved to be an underated master piece and it's final fight between batman and superman was actually something that gives you chills but the one in this movie was not up to the mark.
Again Marvel's VFX team did an awesome job in this movie and also the acting done by the cast was flawless. Talking about directory, this movie is directed in a simple way and is easy to understand.
You can't expect anything in the artistic perspective of this movie, it not an a artistic masterpiece and also the tone of the movie was not constant, in some scenes the tone goes a little dark while in some it becomes very light, and also the unwanted comedy ruins some serious moments.
And another thing that I noticed is that the movie did no justice to some characters, like Spiderman, Hawkeye and war machine.The biggest was Spiderman, even after having a character like him they only gave him a very little screen time and also they introduced him as a sidekick, which totally does not justifies the character of Spiderman.
Overall it is a good movie, must watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe arrives in a slam-dunk fashion, with a great story line and unexpected twists and turns. The cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, code-named the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lend a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far. The idea of having a normal, regular human face off against the Avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers. The end result is films that will leave the viewer wondering how the universe will continue. Since Captain America: The Winter Soldier acted as a turning point in the MCU leading up to Age of Ultron, this film does the same, showing a change in Stark, while also showing Rogers as a new leader. The film ends in such a way with us wondering the directions that the characters will go in and also if Stark will ever be needed anymore, while also showing the lengths that he can go to. The film includes a number of good references to other films in the MCU, while it also acts as a terrific conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, proving that this is the best trilogy within the MCU. In the case of good third chapters in trilogies (Toy Story 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) this film acts a fantastic third chapter to its own trilogy. The film also does the smart move of not revolving around a huge battle, showing the slow build up to the battle and the lengths that characters can go to, in a way showing a war of opinions in political style discussion. The result is a film that is terrific and well-handled, acting as a great comic book film, but also so far as this year's best comic book film.

"I am impressed! Also, I am now a fan of the Winter Soldier!","I'm impressed. Not just with the action and stuff but the political message, too. I am really glad they're keeping Cap true to his character. All the characters seem to be their own selves rather than turning into a background ensemble. I like. Also: I was not really a fan of the Winter Soldier character before, but NOW he reminds me strongly of the protagonist of my Punch series (both the Winter Soldier, who is referred to as Manchurian Candidate at one point in this movie, and the protagonist of my Punch series are based on Cold War era fears about North Korean mind control experiments on American POWs.

Headache Inducing Mess,"Like all too many productions lately, this one is barely a story, loud to the point of being obnoxious but lavish in its CGI production values.We again have people who seem to have super human abilities but no explanation of how that may have happened or what limits they have on their capacities. At least one of them, a flea sized human, sprouts another capacity in the middle of a fight - again no explanation of how this happened or if this is the end of it. Also their capacity to take punishment seems greatly enhanced.Each of the gets thrown around bouncing off of hard surfaces experiencing no trauma, fatigue or even getting dirty. That is until one of them does get terribly injured from suffering an impact no more than he has suffered countless times in the immediate past. Again, no explanation why this acceleration seriously injured him while the previous 500 similar ones did not.The one saving aspect of this movie is the recognition by the crew and public that them performing their feats leave behind a terrific amount of damage which seems to be a plot point usually ignored in these comic book sorts of movies. I was hoping that they'd consider this but in fact, it only turns into another series of fights where they leave behind more damage including destroying a huge airplane just because they can.So the movie starts to take a path more thoughtful than a typical three year old would like but abandons it almost immediately. Meanwhile there is some sort of other faction made up of Russians who are duplicates or something or other and they factor in somehow as well. Oh, then we have some mythical Edenish African Kingdom and the laughably mysterious addition of yet a new super hero just because at this point the whole thing is so utterly idiotic, well why not?Loud, thoughtless, pitched for five year olds at best but gee, great CGI.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An exciting addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Captain America: Civil War is a film that has an engaging conflict, strong characters and thrilling action that creates a fresh and exciting addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film is set in the world of Marvel, an alternate version of Earth that is home to popular heroes such as Iron Man, Hulk, and Spider Man, along with more previously less popular yet beloved personalities like Ant Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Civil War, the third film to center on Captain America, also features a multitude of characters from this universe.After the extreme destruction that the previous films brought, the world's governments have come together to create the ¬®Superhero Registration Act.¬®, which, as the name suggests, requires all superheroes to register before they can operate. Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, believing that it will keep people safe, accepts the new law, while Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America refuses, believing that the Avengers should be able to fight off alien and robot armies without government intervention. Soon, the rest of the heroes take sides, and two and a half hours worth of chaos ensue. Due to its large cast, this may seem like an Avengers film, but the focus is kept on the main characters, even when it goes wide. While wasting no time throwing the audience into the action, Civil War slows down to make the conflict feel personal, showing interactions between the characters that emphasize the ¬®human¬® in ¬®superhuman¬®.But the heroes are still as fantastic as ever. One part that stands out is the airport battle near the end of the movie. It utilizes the formula of special effects, quick humor, and action that Marvel has perfected. Every hero has something to show off, and both sides have tricks up their sleeves. Even though the Earth isn't in peril, the stakes still feel high during this battle.The film manages to close the curtain on the current heroes for the time being and make room for the newer additions to the universe, like Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange, with an ending that is a cliff-hanger yet also satisfying. If Marvel can keep it up for its upcoming films, Captain America: Civil War is only a small glimpse of the studio's potential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, through the eyes of a DC fan","After last year's stupid Ant-man and disappointing Age of Ultron I wasn't going to waste my money on another star studded, cgi action flick that will just build up for Thanos or something. Fortunately my friend had a free ticket. And honestly, this is the best Marvel movie to this date.Of course it still is another star studded, cgi action flick building up the stage for Thanos.

Reaching for a story,Marvel writers seem to run low on creative and now doing damage to the stable of characters.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I guess it helps if you were into the comics,"Nothing really stood out for me while watching Civil War. Of course you have your neat action scenes and some enjoyable actors, but I have no interest in ever seeing it again. Maybe if I were into the comics or had watched the prequels it would have helped me with character development.So if you are content to watch one fun and expensive action scene after another, this is probably a good pick. I must be getting old. This is the first I can ever recall Aunt May being hot. Oh man do I miss the forums on here. Please bring them back!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
