If everyone hates the film and it has a 4.1....why did it make so much money?!,"I never had any intention of watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey""...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now ""Fifty Shades"" is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of ""The Last Airbender"") in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says ""If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week"". In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB.I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Review based on the movie, I haven't read the books","There was absolutely no chemistry between the main actors.The sex is about as sensual as a log of wood thrown on the road.The sets and art direction are excellent and create the perfect ambiance.The music is all right in terms of theme and pacing.She was irritating and there were way too many close-ups of her.

"Yeah, I'm sorry, it is that bad","""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
My god.. this was awful,"I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called ""film"".Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at.

There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama.""The deeds"" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points than this.Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t.on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the best action movies i've seen in a while!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh this film was just DREADFUL!,"Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago.We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said ""Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?"" -- and thank God she replied, ""Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible"".We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card!

Erotic?  Not At All.  Laughable?  Oh Yeah.,"Fifty Shades of Grey (2015)** (out of 4)Rather silly adaptation of the E.L. James best-seller about a shy, timid virgin (Dakota Johnson) who meets the elusive billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Doman) and soon both of their lives change.Writing a plot synopsis of this thing is pretty pointless since I'm sure the target audience is already going to know the story. I guess this is where I should admit that I haven't read the book so this review won't be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didn't do from the book. No, this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me I can't see what all the hype is about. I don't expect everyone laying their money down to be some sort of film buff but the ""shocking"" material on display here has been going on in European movies for four-plus decades so why it's just now reaching American shores is pretty funny in itself but that's off subject I guess.As for the film, there are all sorts of major issues with it but we can start with the laughable screenplay, which would have been rejected by the Lifetime channel and in fact, I'm going to guess that it would have been rejected has a five-year-old written it. The dialogue is without question some of the most laughable I've heard in a very long time. In fact, the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the ""F"" word is used and it's used in a way to where it's supposed to be shocking. Really? It's going to take more than that. The entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really can't buy into any of the melodrama and you've just got to sit back and laugh.The performances are another problem but then again, even the likes of Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor couldn't work with horrid material so I'm not going to be too harsh on Johnson and Doman. With that said, the lackluster direction by Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't help either as there are many times where another take should have happened. The scenes with Johnson playing the shy girl just aren't very believable because the actress can't sell it. The scenes of her explaining she's a virgin are laughably bad. Doman really doesn't get much to work with and especially since he can't crack a smile and has to give off dumb, overly-serious facial expressions throughout. I will say that the actors have a nice chemistry together but that's about it. The supporting players are all equally forgettable.Yet another problem is that the film just isn't erotic. FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT and even something as silly as BODY OF EVIDENCE are just a few recent films that packed a lot more punch than this one. I mean, is sticking an eraser around your lips really erotic anymore? A lot of the lack of erotic-ness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material. Nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited.So, why the two-stars for all the negative stuff? As bad as the film is, thankfully it reaches the level to where you can't help but laugh and be mildly entertained as to what's going to happen next. Again, I haven't read the book so I don't know which one is better but the film is pretty flat from start to finish.",,Anonymous,Romance
Flippity-flop.,"You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and cliché, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's what the book is all about.Also, what's this about rape?

100 Shades of Terrible.,"I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry ""falling"" for each other. ""Falling"" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter.50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I actually love this movie..,"After reading a few reviews, I actually felt bad for loving this movie. I wanted to go and see this movie in the cinema, but all my friends trusted the reviews and just didn't come, so I went by myself. To be honest: I ended up crying for about 2 hours after watching the movie because I was extremely touched by Christian Grey's traumas.I feel like a lot of people don't get the point of this story. This movie is absolutely not about the erotics. It is about 2 people finding each other and falling in love, even though they both have no idea what it's like to have a 'normal' relationship. Anastasia actually sees Christian as a person, while Christian only sees himself as a monster.I do not have an opinion about any film technical aspects, simply because I do not have any knowledge about that.I can highly recommend this movie. But I must say: try to get to know the characters instead of focusing on the sexual action.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Fascinating, Erotic Film Perhaps Better Than We Give It Credit For","Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you're thinking: ""This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen."" No, I don't. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and they can be pure garbage like ""Caligula"". I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it's in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste.First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities.There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it's more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey's lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot.I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota's character has a lot of those ""whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp"" comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control.The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced.It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn't until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey's actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship.One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn't have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally.Who knows? Maybe I'm overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I only know what I saw and felt.My Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This used to be call porn.,"Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to .. Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed.

Two minor pros far outweighed by several massive cons,"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not worth the time,"This movie, and indeed the book, is NOT about BDSM. I'm 25 and have been involved with BDSM since I was 16, and this movie is about nothing but abuse, non-consent, and even has a scene that is nothing but rape.Grey don't listen to his 'sub', ignores her feeling of safety, there is NO AFTERCARE whatsoever in the entire story, not even once in the book, which would make a REAL submissive have a mental breakdown after being treated the way this girl was.Ladies, you've got mental issues if you think this movie is about BDSM. This guy is the exact thing you want to avoid if you don't want to end up in an abusive relationship. A real dominant, a real top, would never behave in the manners of this so called 'man', and a real sub would never accept this kind of treatment. This is abuse. This is non-consent.

"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" explores much more than sex festishes.","Seldom has an R-rated movie arrived in theaters with more pre-release hype, anticipation – and misunderstanding – than ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (R, 2:05). What is billed and understood (at least by those who haven't read British author E. L. James' novel) as simply a story of a young woman being introduced to one man's sexual fetishes is much more – and much deeper – than one might expect. Nevertheless, the nudity, sex, and eroticism are on full display throughout the movie. This film, the book on which it is based, and this review are not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the college newspaper. Anastasia (Ana to her friends, except to Christian, who consistently uses her full first name) gets flustered in the presence of this young, sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. For his part, Christian is quite taken with Ana – and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to ""rescue"" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different – and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance – these two twenty-somethings cannot resist each other.In most love stories, after setting up the situation like I did in that last paragraph, I'd say ""romance blooms"" (or something to that effect), but Christian very clearly states, ""I don't do romance."" That doesn't stop Ana from being drawn to this man and wondering about the ""various physical pursuits"" he says he likes and his ""singular"" tastes, as he describes them. As Ana discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded – both emotionally and physically – by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex.Being the woman in Christian Grey's life means submitting completely – sexually and otherwise – to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually ""f--- hard"", as he describes it) and then shows her his ""playroom."" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Ana is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. She's curious.Christian presents her his thick contract which describes Ana's prospective role as his submissive. He urges her to read the contract, educate herself on being a submissive and ""keep an open mind."" She does all that, while Christian waits impatiently for Ana to make a decision. What follows is a complicated dance in which both parties kid themselves about how it's going. He seems confident that she's warming to the idea of being his sex slave and she is convincing herself that he is becoming boyfriend material. Ana does draw closer to Christian's world in fits and starts and Christian seems to be working harder to draw Ana in than he has probably ever worked before. No spoilers here, but eventually the true nature of each character does come out and the film ends with two words that carry more emotion than any six syllables I can remember hearing in any movie in a very long time.A given audience member's reaction to this movie will likely be influenced by how she or he feels about Christian's lifestyle, but evaluating this film solely on those criteria misses the point. Yes, the nudity and sex are enticing and anyone paying to see this movie for those scenes will be more than satisfied, but you'll get more than eroticism for your money. Much like ""Boogie Nights"", director Paul Thomas Anderson's engrossing 1997 meditation on the 70s porn industry, this film is an examination of human relationships. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a love story, a parable of male and female emotional and sexual roles in the 21st century and an exploration of a lifestyle which many people know very little about, but very few know much. Basically, this is simply an entertaining movie. Casting little-known actors in the main roles is very effective and both show more emotional range than I expected from simply watching the movie's theatrical trailer. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson paces the movie well and she skillfully balances the film's salacious nature with its deeper meanings. ""B+""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Keeping it short,"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt's large collection of ""literature."" She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't see what everyone's problem is,"I don't know what people were expecting. I hadn't read the books before seeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. I enjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say ""this is okay"" and ""woman should do this"". The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could have been better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend it to others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, I have paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really really bad,"One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to advertise such a disgusting movie. I consider myself fairly sophisticated, however this is not entertainment .This is not a sign of being in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting. This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and I use the term loosely is worse than porn ,as it advertises itself as a main stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. This is the worst I've seen, because former sex torture movies, remained with the horror genre ,where they belonged. Disgusted is how I felt about this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 shades of the best marketing ever,"I've never read the book and the marketing around the movie was so good that I had to see it. But the movie is so bad, it is not worth it. The actors are really terrible and the dialogues couldn't even exist in real life. You'll be siting for two hours to watch nothing happening in the movie besides 2 minutes of sex scenes. I can say that I laughed the whole time because it was ridiculous. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack which really matches the whole thing on the screen.50 Shades of Grey is one of the worst movies I've seen and if your girlfriend asks you to take her to watch it, she doesn't love you.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A terrible movie that had to be made.,"Fifty shades is an awful film no doubt, but it had to be made no question, and here is why. Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice. How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this.""We have an option on this book 'Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It's a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don't even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can't fail.It's not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn't looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn't have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don't need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don't even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don't need to budget for a great director either. Let's face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don't even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he'll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like.Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date.Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don't want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends.Seriously guys, we've been handed a gift horse.

About that special place in hell...,"Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they torture Hitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based a movie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember the horror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades of gray.While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather a rape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; that would be an extra nail in the movie's coffin.But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; and the average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might still enjoy it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly enjoyed this movie,"Everyone completely let down this movie. It deserves way more than what people are giving it. I personally will be buying this movie when it is released. Mob psychology hit this movie real hard. Once a few people started dissing it, other people believed them and wouldn't judge it for what it actually was. This kind of story will obviously not appeal to everyone but it did for some so people need to stop ruining others fun.Now, for the real review, I thought the actors were great. They had their awkward phase together because they're starting a new relationship and he has a big secret to tell. NOT because they're awkward actors. Don't tell me that in real life that wouldn't be a little awkward. They played their growing relationship parts perfectly. I actually felt like I could know these actors BECAUSE they acted so well and made it seem like everyday life and not the glitz and glam acting of all the famous actors we've put on pedestals.The cinematography definitely worked for me. They made the movie come alive with the settings, lighting, and angles they used. The different scenes in themselves helped tell the story in a way words couldn't.I LOVE the changes they made from the book. I'll admit that I was not a fan of the books. The story was decent but I couldn't stand the writing. The movie made way more sense and it was easier to fall in love with the characters. I wish this could've just been made a movie from the start so there wouldn't have been so much bad press already out about it.I'll end now by saying I am very pleased with this movie and hope all the negativity won't prevent releases of the rest of the story. I'll be waiting eagerly to see Anastasia and Christian on screen again!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrible,"I viewed this film and my immediate thought was, ""How come this movie has no storyline?"" This was a film comparable to a nickelodeon cartoon series, or quite possibly worse. If I could rate any lower, it would be a -3 out of 10. All this movie is doing is exploiting the emotions of women across the globe, and ts ripping things that started on tumblr, this just makes the cinema that much worse. I saw a movie by Disney and i vomited during the first five minutes of it, and that was better than this film. >Go on a date with girl >Take her to nice restaurant >She orders a shrimp cocktail and several drinks >Ask for the check >The waiter places the check in front of me, not in front of her, not in the middle of the table >Look of horror comes across the girl's face >I reach for the check and place my credit card inside >She begins to tremble >Tears well up in her eyes >I can tell she is paralyzed by fear at the oppression she is experiencing >I chauvinistically place the check with the my credit card on the table in front of me, daring her to do something about it >The power of my oppression of this woman surges through my body as I lean back in my seat and stare directly at her >She is shaking with fright, the oppression strangling her voice away >The waiter returns to take the check away >All is lost to her now >Men at other tables begin to stand up and clap >Women all over the restaurant begin to shriek and cry >I feel my erect penis lift the tablecloth in front of me >I ask my date, ""Did you enjoy your dinner?"" >""Y-yes... thank you"", she says behind a mask of tears >I lean forward, a devious, patriarchical smile spreading across my face >And I tell her, ""It was my privilege.""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
No surprise,"Perhaps appropriately, given its subject matter, Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one, a sensual and stylish romance about a young woman on a path of self-discovery, both in and out of the bedroom – and the other, a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life, better suited for Cinemax's late night library than the multiplex. Unfortunately, the lesser one of the pair ends up on top, no doubt due to the creative stranglehold in which author E.L. James held director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel throughout the adaptation process, meaning that viewers get to be teased and titillated – then totally turned off (not to mention left with a severe case of blue balls, thanks to an anti-climactic ending that calls to mind an arcade game's ""Insert More Quarters"" display). In other words, Fifty Shades of Grey is a victim of behind-the-scenes drama, neither the glossy and intriguingly tragicomic tale of dangerous sexual politics Taylor-Johnson tried to make, nor the thoroughly smutty romance James clearly felt her story worked better as. Instead, tt's the limpest, most colorless hybrid of the two possible. Any true movie lover will detest James for holding a talented director back in her own little, pathetic show of dominance, though it's possible that some fans of the book may have lusted after an adaptation that, on the contrary, existed solely to allow for visualization of the author's most salacious sentences. That's for them to report. The fans already spoke once, back in the summer of 2012, turning James' novel into the fastest-selling paperback of all time, which suggests more readers share her fixation with raw sexuality than would like to admit.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful,"Let me resume it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing...The actors are really the worst pick. For a movie that lives of sexuality they went with actors that have no idea what that means.The writing is just appalling, that is no story, is just more of the same, a page out off that awful vampire franchise, and it even got the same card board actors. But little girls and horny housewife's will love it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus was with aesthetics, no content what so ever.There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not the case... now let's wait for part 2 and 3. I have no doubt it will sell like crazy but not because of it's film merits that is so clear to me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Gratuitous Exploration of Perversion,"Fifty Shades existed as a deranged fan fiction of an already stale and messy series. Eliminating as much plot as possible and replacing it with unnecessary and uncomfortable sexual nonsense, this managed to be both an incredibly boring film and a laughably unsexy porno. While I have no interest in watching a Harvey Weinstein type pervert that takes advantage of his employees and cannot control his child-like impulses, I understand that everyone has their own kinks. This film would've been much better produced at Pornhub where it could find the audience it wanted and be exactly what it wanted to be, a kinky porno with a no-thought plot and actors that are only there to collect a paycheck.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre and boring.,"""Fifty shades of Grey""is the most mediocre and boring film that I saw in my entire life. I was curious why it is the most expected movie of the year, but It was only marketing and It was a waste of time. At some point I even wanted to leave the cinema room. There is no chemistry between characters. It is full of ""cliche"" (the piano, the red car, the computer, the helicopter and more ....). There is also an totally anti-romantic movie, I don't understand why it was launch on Valentines Day. To bad for the director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) ""Nowhere Boy"" was a very good movie, so I was expecting more, but as somebody said with a poor script or poor book no director can do much...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was OK,I thought it was OK. I liked the book better. I also thought that Dakota Johnson did good but that Jamie Dornan was not very convincing as Christian Grey. He did not seem to have the swagger and confidence that the character in the book had. Some of the lines sounded to cheesy. I will still bye the movie though. I really would of loved for maybe Charlie Hunnam or Ian Somerhalder to have played Christian Grey but that did not happen. I also felt that the movie put off kind of a comedy vibe to me. I did not like that. I wanted to get chills and feel like I was part of the movie and I need more from them. I didn't get enough. I hope that they do book two but that it is more.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 shades of another four letter word starting with 'sh',"""Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse"" might be a more fitting title for the unusually explicit bedroom drama.This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which features a modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has a pornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured the imaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikely romance between socially awkward college student Anastasia and intimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such that moviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping these two up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness for whips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes about when Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalism major, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loaded down with dramatic irony.All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver the commencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to this dungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendres are ever so much fun.In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, as Ana tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his total lack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discovers that he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped ""playroom"" full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade to redeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian's perversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentially willing victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left to wonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play in rendering Ana so tractable.While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubled background, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passing acknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intent to stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy' promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the ""person"" (esp women): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute (money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of men anyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't have that option :-)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
All right movie,"The movie itself was okay. If you count out the sex and whatnot you do get a pretty sad romantic movie, and I'd actually like to see the sequel... Plus Jamie Dornan is pretty damn hot.... One of the things that annoyed me surprisingly enough was how skinny Dakota Johnson could look in some scenes. It disturbed me - like I was scared she'd snap in two or something ... Overall a plot that had me interested! I like it. I hope the sequel have the same feel to it, that she changes and challenges him in some way, that was a very nice thing to see. Nicely set and it all seemed pretty normal to me, you know, except for the whole ""Grey's a control sex freak"" thing that I knew from the start was going to happen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

No sweet romance, didn't set up well for another (which I am grateful). If I was the author I would not want my name associated with this film.So many simple small things were missed. Please if you want to see it wait until it is a pay per view...... don't spend the money. They make errors all over in the setting up and they can't even make a hot sex scene.

Not as bad at all,"After viewing the negative comments here I was pretty sure I'm going to watch an other movie which I'm not going to like. So went with low expectations. And to be honest I did like it. I think it was interesting, entertaining. It was not the typical romance movie which I don't like anyways. It was something else, something new, fresh. I did not read the book, and consciously did not do any research or reading about it, other than comments here. My wife though she read the book, she had a story in her mind, also the imagination of the characters, especially the female. Even like how the hair would look like in certain scenes.

Have mercy on your man ladies,"I sit here with my head in my hands, as i now have to relive the two hours of my life that i wasted on watching this 'film'. I don't quite know how i can put across how bad this film is. My most accurate synopsis is that if you've ever watched a porn film, there will usually be (so I'm told ;-)) a terrible ten minute build up containing terrible acting, cheesy lines, and non believable attraction between the characters...imagine that for two hours and you have Fifty Shades of Grey in a nutshell. The whole affair just seems to fade into one long boring series of encounters, with very little substance to the story, and the supposedly 'steamy' scenes are about as arousing as a flash of your school dinner ladies drawers. The lad can act but his American accent is terrible and much like the book, the script is horrendous, he should sack his agent. the female lead is attractive but again i just don't buy that she would be attracted to the male, and if the film is based upon their fascination with each other, then it leaves you wondering why the hell you're sat there...you actually don't care if they get together.Its one of those films that just doesn't grab you from the start and it ultimately fails to pick up throughout, make no mistake, had it been at all possible, i would have left after 10 minutes, but i think my girlfriend (who also found it appalling), would maybe have scowled at wasting the money.Ill sign off with this: WOMEN: wait for the DVD, spend the admission money on a steak for your man, he will appreciate it more.MEN: At any cost, fake illness ,death,self inflicted loss of limb, get yourself out of watching this absolute dross!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very tastefully done,"I have read the books and today saw the movie. I liked it very much. Many reviews have indicated the book/movie is degrading to women. Not so. There are hundreds of movies degrading to women. Just go watch the Wolf of Wall Street if you want to see degrading behavior. This is a romance story with some unusual sexual behavior, but hey they are consenting adults. Christian NEVER does anything Ana does not give him permission or even ask him to do...NEVER. There were a few plot points I would have liked to see in the movie, but overall they did a good job. The sex was tastefully done and not over the top by any means. The two lovers are like rabbits in the books. I was happy to see it pulled back to something more reasonable. Over 100 million books and soon to be over 100 million at the box office.

Fifty shades of boredom,"Please keep in mind, I have read the books.

I thought I'd give them a chance to spruce up the books a bit, but that did not happen. I was bored after about 30 minutes into it and thought of leaving halfway through.The acting was OK, but then again both stars worked with what they were given...which was not a lot of dialogue to start with. I wouldn't hang my hat on either of them. The set design was good for the most part and stayed close to the books as far as colors and layout.

I can't seem to understand why 100 million people got so "" 50 shades of Grey fever"". I would have to say whoever directed and cast the stars in this movie should be unemployed tomorrow. It was that bad. Waiting for something interesting to happen the entire movie. A few good spanks here and there and a lot of seductive kissing doesn't make for a movie. At times it felt like the actors and actresses where rushing through lines. it was like watching people who read three words and forget there lines and rush through the reading of a script.

Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man!Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!!The movie and the books are creepy.

I was greatly surprised to find myself laughing early on--not at the movie itself, but at a particular moment in it that was intended to be funny. It was drawing me in, almost against my will. As it went on, I began liking the character of Anastasia. Christian may have been a little eye-rolling here and there, but I still bought into him. I get why some people are trashing this film--partly because the source material is absolute garbage--but it's actually a pretty interesting character study. I should add that my enjoyment of the film was increased because I watched it in a crowded theater. My wife and I were older than anyone else there.

"Fifty Shades of Gray: Interesting film, interesting reactions.","I'm kind of a movie's shark: sometimes I watch films simply because they are there, without knowing what they are about or who made them I eat them exactly like a shark. In these cases it is only after the end (and only if I got interested) that I go check about the authors, the reviews and so onThe present flick was one of those. And after watching the movie (which I found interesting) I went on IMDb and found that pages and pages in the review section were filled by angry or disgusted people who rated the movie 1! I'm talking about more than 1.000 reviews (no joke) which is without any doubt the reaction of scandalized souls. And this is the first interesting thing.The second is that all the authors were female (E.L. James who wrote the novel, Kelly Marcel who adapted it and Samantha Taylor-Johnson who directed it). And all of them already gave proof to be fine artists (and the present movie was not bad at all in its script, acting or direction). So, much of the criticism should be re-examined with a cooler mind.Finally, although this surely is an unrealistic film with unrealistic characters, it is essentially a love story and characters' unrealism is not significantly different from that of Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavalleri (remember Love Story?).

50 Seats Beside Gorgons,"The version I saw was via a pirate copy marked ""CENSORED"" which probably means most of the explicit shots in the sex scenes have been cut out . . I thought I had to mention this due to covering my back . Apparently a lot of people have been watching this film for the dubious and much hyped reason that this film is supposed to be the greatest aphrodisiac ever recorded in human history . Indeed I almost fell out of my seat reading a report in the Scottish Daily Record that a woman in her thirties had been arrested in a Glasgow cinema for ""pleasuring herself"" ! Hold your horses guys because the paper didn't print a photo of the woman in question due to sub-judicial law so hoping she's going to pop back to the cinema for a repeat performance while she sits beside you is a little bit premature , she could have been a Gorgon for all we know . But I suppose 50 SHADES has something in its favour if audience members are going to risk 5 years on the sex offenders register watching it in public . I do hope the uncensored sex scenes are worth it because if the censored version is anything to go by that woman in the Glasgow cinema might have been pleasuring herself in order to stay awakeThe story itself is very one note . Unconfident virgin undergraduate Ana Steele embarks on a sexual relationship with 27 year old multi-billionaire Christian Grey . There's some strange casting going on here . Dakota Johnson as Ana really overplays the shy innocent virgin routine in the early part of the film and Jamie Doran never convinces as Grey . ""I don't do romance and I'm singular"" states Grey . How about ""I don't do acting and I have a single expression on my face throughout the entire movie"" Jamie ? Maybe if Grey was played by someone like a younger Christian Bale who can do a convincing turn as a manly Byronic anti-hero which is the casting that Grey calls for . The characters as played here just do not convince but to be fair to Johnson and Doran it's every aspect of the entire film that's the problem . It's directed by Sam Taylor Johnson who gives the entire mis en scene the look of a TVM on the Hallmark Channel complete with irritating incidental muzak playing over scenes . The source novel is probably complete garbage and if it is screenwriter Kelly Marcel hasn't improved it . Take this brief snippet of dialogue as Grey is just about introduce Ana to his S&M den""This is my playroom"" states Grey""You have an X-box in there ?"" Ana asks in all seriousnessI know she's supposed to be an innocent virgin but would any young woman be that naïve ? My shopping list has as much chance for being nominated for an Oscar as this film does . Honestly I know sex sells but there's good sex and bad sex and in cinematic terms this really is bad sex and couldn't get much worse unless a self pleasuring Gorgon was sitting in the cinema seat beside you",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty shades of cringe,"How can anyone say this is a sexy film, is behind me. I cringed so hard during the sex scenes and the lines.Let's not forget the lack of knowledge of BDSM during this film.

The girl is uncomfortable with it, but the guy doesn't stop and say: ""Oh, that's alright, we can stop and you can tell me if you feel like you can continue this or not."" No.He pressures her.

I suppose when so many sexually insecure people are buying the stupid not very well written book or reading it, this was bound to happen. This film is lame from start to finish, pathetic script. Why these actors got involved in this is a mystery , as it will not enhance their career one bit. It's a cheap version of 9 1/2 weeks which in itself tells you all you need to know , and all you sexually frustrated people do not waste your money on this rubbish. As I only went to see what all the fuss was about and in my mind it was worst than I expected a lot worst. Funny how people are like lemmings and jump on band wagons with all the hype.

I fail to see how the actors got the parts they did. I don't know where these actors came from, but they had absolutely NO chemistry. The sex scenes were not sexy at all. The movie was literally so bad that I left halfway through. I now have to read the books again to get that horrible film out of my head.

In many ways this is just an ordinary romantic drama with BDSM thrown in,"College student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews young millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). He becomes obsessed with her and she starts falling for him. However he has control issues and is into BDSM. Can she deal with that?Ignore all the controversy about this. In many ways this is just another romantic drama about a couple dealing with issues--those issues just happen to be BDSM and control. It has all the romantic meetings, the nonstop love songs on the soundtrack and some fairly explicit (but tasteful) sex. The BDSM is confined to just two scenes and it's not that bad. There is nudity but almost all of it is from Johnson. Dornan just bares his butt three times and that's it. It seems kind of strange that a movie targeted at women has so little male nudity. It's also well-directed and is more or less interesting. However it goes on for too long and keeps repeating itself. Also the character of Mr. Grey comes across as more than a little creepy. The acting varies. Johnson is very good in her role. Dornan is ridiculously handsome and all pumped up but lacks the charisma that his character should have. All in all a pretty good romantic drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a stupid 'story' makes for a stupid film,"this stupid film has no storyline; it has stupid dialog; it has all the stupid excuses for cold sex, sex, sex, sex that people call it romance??? another word, it is pure plain stupid film; this is Hollywood version of porn being sugar coated as romance so that is can pull in audience; else, it wouldn't make it to the big screen. Never thought there'd be a day when porn made it into Hollywood and the sad thing is, people makes it happened. Twilight was a film about love between the couple that was slowly developed and they didn't have sex until marriage. Whereas Twilight was white, 50 shades was black; the author was inspired by Twilight and copycat it and made it into something ugly that demeans women. We should be ashamed of supporting such trash; how low our culture has gone. We have become a people of low intelligence because we can't distinguish what is good and what is bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why are people so close minded?,"Why are people so close minded. This was not a bad movie. Yeah, there are some parts that can be considered cheesy... but it doesn't deserve a 3.9 out of 10. This movie is about a awkward quirky girl who falls for a tormented billionaire, who hides behind his dark past. When people say this movie condones and glorifies domestic/sexual abuse, that is ridiculous. If you see this movie and think this, then you didn't see the same movie i did. Watching this movie you can totally tell the Christian obviously gets off on what he does to Ana, but you can clearly also see by his looks and his body language, that he feels terrible by what he does as well. Anastasia also enjoyed what he was doing to her (for the most part). Obviously at the end, she craves more of a romantic relationship with Grey rather then continuing with their arrangement, but he just can't give that to her.. well not yet. All in all, this movie deserves a higher rating than a 3.9. This movie at times was cheesy and not always well acted, but overall is was a totally hot and seductive entry of which hopefully becomes the first in a movie trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"While Johnson and Dorman light up the screen, but the film falters behind the scenes.","50 Shades of Grey has now reached classic status among women who marvel over this book and while I don't quite get why, I respect the hell out of EL James and applaud her for her ability to make something so daring and racy. However, now that it has now jumped from the page to the screen it has something to it that keeps you watching but ultimately leaves you befuddled about what it is truly about. Objectification, vanity, feminism, masochistic sexual urges, these are all themes this film plays with but just can't seem to pinpoint an exact one it wants to stick with. The screenplay for this is a muddled piece of writing that lazily skates through its near two hour runtime with looks from Grey to Ana and no real dialog that is clever or even remotely interesting. The performances in this film are what keeps you watching. Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson are electrifying as Christian Grey and Ana, the two of them definitely took their jobs seriously here both physically and mentally and it absolutely pays off as much as it can considering the script they were working with. There's not a false note with their portrayals here but it does seem hard to judge when so much of the film relies on glares and one word answers. While Kelly Marcel tries to make the fans happy, it ends up hurting the film's chances of actually being good because there's just so much to say here regarding the characters and she ends up not saying anything, leaving us craving more of a connection with the characters that just simply wasn't done very well. One thing that is focused on more so than anything else are the sex scenes. They're intense, realistic and very personal and they remain the highlight of the film considering we learn the most about the characters when they're having an orgasm. There's only so much you can put into a movie especially if the source material is as sordid as this but Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't disappoint when showing you the savage sexual nature of the infamous Christian Grey. These sex scenes push the boundaries of its R rating and fans of the book should be happy to hear that they can finally visualize some of the titillating details James seems to love to describe in her book. Despite the sex scenes being very well done and carefully filmed, the rest of the scenes feel lacking. Dorman and Johnson are screaming for a better script, its a real shame that Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel are seemingly asleep behind the wheel. Overall, 50 Shades of Grey is very well done in its look and feel but beneath the surface of it all, there isn't much going on outside its sex scenes.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty Shades of Nope,"I have watched ""The Last Airbender."" It was bad. I have watched ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" It was pretty terrible. I have watched ""The Star Wars Holiday Special."" It was, until now, the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. Congratulations, Fifty Shades, you are actually worse than the worst thing ever. You were based on a book that was so badly written it's hard to believe that English is the author's first language, not to mention a book that didn't contain a lick of research into actual BDSM practices. And I'm not even going to talk about how the third book in the trilogy from hell contains a scene which sexualized an unborn child - something that made me literally throw up in my mouth when I saw it. Now, the film version of the worst book ever written is officially the worst film ever made. We have hit rock bottom, folks.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
About as bad as it gets.,"Mr Grey will see you now.....I imagine the thought of Jamie Dornan seducing a young woman sent chills down the back on many a spine, sadly the actual film, is dire.I walked out of the cinema after about twenty five minutes, I lost a bet and had to sit through it, til the very end.Plotless, badly acted, about as sexy as a floral sofa cover, and so boring, it really is an appalling film. I will give it credit for one thing though, it is actually well produced, it is very well filmed, slick looking, which is a shame, it's almost too well produced.The acting is abysmal, some of the most wooden performances I have ever seen, Dornan's accent is so bad.I did unfortunately read the book, at the time I was in a reading club, and though I hated it, I understood what the appeal was, the fantasy side of the story, the art of seduction, the unobtainable, this dreadful film did not capture any of the essence of the book.Do yourself a favour, if you're a fan of Jamie's, buy a calender, there's nothing to see here.A few stars for the nice production, but otherwise it's awful stuff.2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another movie in a similar vein was ""The Lover"", which was was much better done than this. Sure, ""The Lover"" had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys.

"Mediocre novel, awful film","I've read the book and didn't like it, it wasn't horrible, but it didn't have the enough quality to justify its fame,a lot of people ""consumed"" the movie out of pure curiosity, including me. See, you can really ""despise"" the novel, but, in the end, most of you will go watch this, either because you want to know how could a movie look like based on the book or maybe because you are curious to see if everything you read ended up better in a film. It is pretty difficult to mention something that we all haven't heard before, Surely my review looks the same as every other in every other site. But it is important to mention that this movie already got several sequels and is praised by a lot of young kids that watch it everyday. A lot of schools here in Mexico display it for children aged between 5 and 10 years old. It is a movie for children, so it must be judged that way. And if you look at it from that perspective: Shrek is a good and fun movie, teaching us about the complex and emotional life of an ogre... Ohhh... This is the wrong page.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Honest,"Here is an honest review from someone who couldn't get past the books. I've read a majority of the first book, but couldn't reach the end, since I was too disgusted. To put it simply, I'm not a fan of E.L. James or her writing style.That being said, I did not have high expectations. My mother wanted to see this film, so I decided to treat her, and we went out to go see it in IMAX, no less.Honestly it was convincing. I ended up liking it a lot and this is coming from me, someone who desperately wanted to hate it, because I hated what I had read. It was a pleasant surprise and I'd see it again should the occasion present itself.The sex scenes were tasteful, dialogue bearable, and the storytelling made their relationship feasible.I would be more interested in the books, if the film writer responsible had originally written them, since they had skillfully left out what I deemed as nonsense. Sorry, it's just my opinion.It's easier to hate on something, than to love it. It's easier to be funny by mocking something. It's more interesting to read about someone's hate, than love.Although I'm not a fan, it's unfair to antagonize others for what they enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Romantic Comedy with dark undertones and eroticism. Takes Out All the BS/WTF and Fan Fiction elements from the Book,"For those who may not be aware, Fifty Shades of Grey was once an erotic Twilight fan fiction that was pulled and published, becoming a massive global hit with over 100 million copies sold. As there are many lovers and fans of the book series, there's a great amount of ""haters"" or harsh critics of the books.After the movie ended I was completely stunned, as in my jaw dropped. The reason- I liked this movie, more than I thought I would, a great deal more. I really thought I would dislike it and find so many faults, much like the book. If you're a fan of the Fifty Shades of Grey book, you will eat up this movie and love it, hungry for more. If you haven't read Fifty Shades of Grey, you will enjoy the movie for what it is and will be anxious to see Fifty Shades Darker, the sequel, which was announced as moving forward. Fifty Shades of Grey was very entertaining, with many moments of humor and a romance that should appeal to both men and women. It's a perfect date movie, including one for Valentine's Day. Those who are looking for more spice in their movies, Fifty Shades of Grey is the movie to see. The love scenes are well choreographed and sexy. When the time comes for the BDSM scenes, they are extremely well done and very erotic.Every cheesy WTF moment found in the book with the silly, ridiculous sayings and fan fiction element was erased. The filmmakers made the right decision by taking out the eye rolling trademark phrases and like the ""oh my's"" and ""inner goddess"" Anastasia Steele, the heroine loves to spew. Christian Grey, her hero's trademark line, ""later's baby"" is there, but the delivery of how it was spoken is cute and sweet. Christian's twitchy palms is also in there, and again delivered in a great way. The love scenes and scenes of sexual bondage, torture and foreplay are tasteful and somewhat artistic in tone. The manic, abusive elements Christian portrays in the book are gone. His possessive is toned down enough in the movie that it's believable. His reason he doesn't do romance and needs to be a Dominant, and Ana his submissive isn't far-fetched when it's revealed and explained.The credit for making Fifty Shades of Grey movie a success are because of four people. Screenwriter, Kelly Marcel, and director, Sam Taylor Johnson deserve major kudos for their work. These two brought Fifty Shades of Grey to life in a way I would have never expected and admired. These two are just important as the actors on screen. The focus is on Ana and Christian, the main couple. All the other characters come and go and rarely have much screen time. Kate Kavanagh, Ana's best friend and roommate played by Eloise Mumford made the most with her role. She ate up the screen anytime she appeared. If given more screen time, she would have been a force of nature.There have been many opinions about the casting of Ana and Christian. From the press tour and random scenes shown from the movie of Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, it looks like they're all wrong for the roles. Awkward and bad chemistry comes to mind. I'm a happy to say that Dakota and Jamie's chemistry is alive and well in the movie. Jamie Dornan is the one everyone has concentrated on. He plays the role of Christian more than adequately, but there's still a stiffness and remoteness to his portrayal. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but even though I wasn't as enthralled with him as I should, I will say that when it came to the love scenes and BDSM centric action, he made me believe he was a true Dominant. His delivery, whether it was seducing Ana or blindfolding and tying her up and flogging her was, panty dropping, I need to take a cold shower ASAP. This man let loose and wild, no holds barred sexual takeover in the sex scenes.The one person who deserves more praise than anyone else is Dakota Johnson. Jamie plays second fiddle to her. I had some concerns with her in the beginning. The first twenty minutes are the most problematic. It sets up the story and the introduction of Ana, the college English literature senior, about to graduate, and Christian, the twenty-seven elusive billionaire. Dakota was channeling Kristen Stewart ala Bella Swan from Twilight in the first fifteen minutes, complete with being clumsy and falling to the floor in Christian's office, to the non-stop lip biting. But the lip-biting is a running joke, throughout the movie, but one that fits. The moment I become invested in this movie, and knew it was a winner was the scene where Dakota as Ana gets drunk and drunks dials Christian. That five minute scene shows Dakota's comedic skills, which is throughout the movie. She starts out as this almost fragile, plain and basic young woman, who transforms into a more self-assured saucy, tells it like she means it woman. I would go as far to say she steals some of the scenes away from Jamie. Dakota as Ana keeps her girl next door package, but also brings out her temptress. Simply put, Dakota owns the Ana role and runs with it.Fifty Shades of Grey is a Rom-Com with dark undertones. The first half appears to be a romantic comedy and then slowly becomes more intense and serious. The humor isn't out of place, and when we get to that point where Christian shows Ana his red room of pain, as she calls it, you're invested completely, wanting to stay with Ana and Christian, even during their most private intimate moments, no matter how dark they may seem.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty shades of Boredom !!,"There was quite a huge build up to this movie, a Valentine release based on one of best selling books of 2011, lots of sex and nudity, this movie had everything to entertain, but alas it did not.

It might interest the blonde-haired monkey girls whose favorite movie is ""Twilight"" but surely not to anyone with even a little bit of taste for movies.You can surely give this movie a miss, rather give this movie a miss for your peace of mind.

Fifty Shades of Ney,"If you like good movies, then this is not for you. If you like movies that are so bad they are good, then this is not for you. This movie is bad. Plain and simple. I've never read the book, nor do I have any intention to ever in my life especially after this movie whom some have even said was better than the book, which means the book is horrible. I know fangirls will strongly disagree and praise the movie regardless of how terrible it is though. It's almost like people who love this movie have never had sex and seeing such badly acted love/bondage scenes on-screen makes their ovaries burst. I have seriously seen bad porn with better acting and plot development than this. Seriously. I'm not just bashing this movie to go along with the masses, it truly is an unbelievably horrible movie. The leads were just bad and not even that sexually appealing. The directing was decent, but that doesn't save the movie from its horrible script and terrible delivery. Even Martin Scorsesse couldn't turn such a horrible book into a good movie. Sadly, this movie is critic proof. No matter how horrible and honest the reviews are, the fangirls and tweens will stampede to the theater and turn this into a franchise that will probably mean the final book will get a two part movie. I love sex. I love freaky sex with a freaky sexy woman. I love porn on occasion. Aside from a sexy woman, this movie combines all of those elements in the worst way. I do give kudos to James Dornan not for his horrible acting, but his decision to join the cast. The movie may be horrendous, but you cant deny that he will become a sex symbol because of it. I give it 1 star plus 1 bonus star because one up side is that women will appreciate men in suits a lot more after this. Not that they don't already.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't understand the hate...,"I felt I had to review this movie just to protest against all the hate for it here...I don't understand all the hate for this movie. People are making so many wrong and absurd claims about the content and intentions of this movie, I can only assume most people just don't get it at all. It does not glorify and promote domestic abuse against women, it is not sexist, and does not contain rape. The sex in it was consensual, and it was made very clear over and over again that the female lead could choose to not go along with it and stop whenever she wanted. If people want to explore different forms of sexual practices than what they (and you, the viewer) are used to, who are you to say that they can't do it, that it's wrong, and that it glorifies violence or whatever other nonsense. The BDSM stuff in this was really tame in comparison to what most real life BDSM practitioners are into anyway. And no, on the other end of the spectrum, that does not mean the movie was an insult to BDSM practitioners either. This isn't a porn movie.Now, this movie is about two people who are very different, and who have very different desires and values for what is and isn't normal in a relationship, who are trying to make it work, and fail, because they can't reach a middle-ground, understandingly enough. They are physically attracted to each other, but that's it. They are too different, so it's kind of obvious it's doomed to fail. The male lead, Grey, has a rather traumatic past, and has probably been shaped by this, making him a control freak who is unable to open up, and give into romance and/or his real emotions, thinking he HAS to keep the female lead, Ana, at a distance, and that he HAS to be dominant in everything for it to work, and that he can't enjoy it otherwise. I guess you could say he has a bit of a psychological issue/condition. The plot/script was fine to me.Also, several people here are saying that the acting was bad, but I don't agree. They are also saying the movie wasn't erotic, which I disagree with even more. And as for the women in here who are saying things like that the actor playing Ana was ""irritating, and there were too many close-up shots of her"": You're probably either unable to recognize that Dakota Johnson does in fact have a beautiful body (she does), because you yourself are a woman (which I can't blame you for, it's pretty normal for both guys and girls to often have a hard time seeing what it is the opposite sex finds attractive in people of the same sex as them), or, you're just jealous, and letting that get the better of you. I hope it's the former.Finally, the music and the cinematography were both very good, in my opinion. This seems to be the only points the haters somewhat agree with me on. In closing, I'd like to point out that one person here who didn't like the movie said that the only people who can like this movie or the book are people who are psycho cult fans who live in their parent's basements, and who wouldn't know good literature or a good love story even if it stared them in the face. I find this very funny, considering I am not only not a psycho cult fan, but also actually have a degree in English language and literature. I've even studied abroad, and am quite used to living by myself. So yeah.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre book yields mediocre script.  Imagine that!  Worth it if you're a fan.,"Anyone who read this book can tell you there is better smut and better writing out there. The movie is right there on par with it. There are better sexually based movies with better acting but, I didn't go into this thinking it would be the movie of the year. I'm not understanding a lot of the hate from other reviews. This was never going to be an Oscar worthy film. The book was not a literary gem. I was actually surprised to see that they seemed to give Ana a bit more of a spine which, helped the movie to not just feature her crying from start to finish and, added a little humor at times. They were also able to incorporate lots of little details for the readers that will pick up on the conversations or inner dialog that happened in the book but, just show up as details in the film. Overall, as rumored the film lacks some chemistry but not so much that it is painful. The cheesy dialog was there at times but, it was straight from the cheesy book so no surprises there. If you want to see how they interpreted it on screen I say it's worth it, as long as your expectations are in line with the book this was adapted from.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

If I like the movie enough, then it can cause me to invest the time in reading to get more of the story. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson became Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, bringing them to life on screen and creating believable, fully-formed characters surprised to be falling in love. The cinematography and the grey theme throughout are poignant, and the sex is downright artful. This is a movie for adults, about an adult relationship, and a world far beyond the societal definition of normal. The trailer is an accurate depiction of what's to come, with all the fanciful trimmings expected of a single, sexy billionaire. What may be unexpected is how invested you become in Ana's story, and her quiet strength as she falls in love with this complicated man.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disregard all of the terribly low ratings! It's not that bad.,"Honestly, for every low rating is a person admitting to not wanting to see the movie but saw it anyway OR never even read the books! SO WHY ARE YOU EVEN WRITING A REVIEW! Your opinion is irrelevant. Moving on..For those who read the books like I did, book(s) meaning plural as in all 3 and not just the 1st one, you will have a different opinion on the characters entirely because you understand that it's about more than just bdsm or porn. There's SOO much more to this story. I loved the books but I was hesitant about the movie because let's face it, they never live up to the books, you never feel the same way watching it played out. And that's what happened here. The director and El pretty much touched on key points in the book but rushed through it, never giving the audience a chance to connect with the characters and their back stories like you could while reading. READ THE BOOKS PEOPLE- get past the over described sexual encounters and discover much more that is there within the pages! There are worse books/movies out there I promise lolSo my advice to someone who hasn't read the books and are curious, don't see it. Read the bookS first so you have some sort of idea about WHATS going on. the ending and the characters.

glamorising sexual and emotional abuse,"There has been a lot of fascination of the 50 shades series amongst women. I have never read the books but wanted to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing the film last night I am utterly repulsed that this film was even allowed to be shown. We have come so far giving women equal rights and there is a constant fight to allow women to be given equal opportunities however this film goes against all of this. Grey is allowed to control, manipulate whilst physically and emotionally abusing Anna. Even allowing to dictate her food and drink consumption. She even has to sign a contract allowing Grey to do anything he was wants to her and if she does not abide by these rules he is allowed to punish her by hitting her. Is this the message we want to be sending to young girls? It gives the green light to allowing someone to control, manipulate and hit you. How is that pleasurable or acceptable on any level. This film glamorises domestic abuse and should never have been allowed to be shown. Not only is the plot ridiculous it is also very low budget as the main bulk of the film is filmed in about 3/4 rooms. The acting is equally as poor. It makes me very sad that women are being 'turned on' by this film and are encouraging this behaviour. Maybe if Mr Grey wasn't a billionaire and wasn't so handsome there would not be this same attraction and acceptance.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Infinite Shades of Beep-Beep,"Back in 2011, after media cogently pressed me, I read Fifty Shades of Grey. Despite its extremely poor prose, I enjoyed the novel. When I finished it, I tried to not be judgmental about it. But now after watching the movie, I have to be. For lay-men and erotica-loving audience, this movie is their ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Clockwork Orange"". For ticket-not-available-for-any-other-movie unfortunate stakeholders, this might work as well. But for critics, dilettantes, and intellectual people, it's mostly a piece of beep-beep.Not just that, even the cast was pathetic. Although Dakota Johnson fills the countenance of my imagery of Anastasia Steele, she didn't do justice to her role. She was overly dramatic, artificial, and didn't fully understand her character's prerequisites. She's pretty and all, and perfectly looks like ""Anastasia"" but doesn't feel like her, except when the main couple is frolicking, but that's not acting, only sensual mingling, is it not? Throughout the movie, she tries to appear foxy and overly-sensual through her dialogues and expressions, but miserably fails. It all seemed made-up; the kind you come across with when you're watching a college-level theater play. When I hadn't seen the movie, only the trailer, I actually thought Dakota would make the best Ana, but to my bad, she was utterly disappointing. Nonetheless, she was bearable, and somewhat likable, as paradoxical as it sounds.And Jamie Dornan, or the pathetic-Christian-Grey as you'd all know him by—I literally laughed seeing him (hiding the urge to scream or express my depression). The guy is not slightly the kind anyone predicted. He doesn't look like a magnate; he looks like a third-class, high-school, and hey-my-name-is-Swag guy. There's billionaire neither on his face nor in his gait, although I'd have to appreciate his vocal chords, but they hardly complement the other drawbacks. Halfway into the movie, he starts gaining momentum and stability in his character. By then, it's too late. The impression has already been delivered. I had two choices in mind when I heard that a movie was being made of the book—Stephen Amell and Matthew Goode. I'm happy that people actually considered these two choices. Stephen, especially, was immensely appropriate. Nobody could do it better than Stephen. His incandescence evidenced in Arrow, where he shows all signs auspicious for Christian Grey. Matthew Goode. He would have been a great choice too, given his gait, his voice, and sophistication, as per his performances up to date. But no, they were stubborn on showing their lack of professionalism throughout. I don't know where the senses and credibility of casting supervisors went that they became so lame during the casting process.I might not have been disappointed had the cast been suitable. The couple devastated the movie in a manner reminiscent of Kristen Stewart devastating ""Twilight"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", you see what I'm saying?Now comes the director. In modern film-making, direction is no longer a separate department with separate responsibilities. Director is practically in charge of everything going on with the movie. Sam-Taylor Johnson, just like her husband, is pretty mundane, and banal, the only difference being the different departments both handle. She's nothing extraordinary. I mean it's not evasive; she doesn't have that in her. Such directors can only finish the project, not gloom it. They stick with the hard-lined facts, and produce in millimeters, never thinking about the immaterial perspective of film-making. But then, how good can you direct a movie that sucks so badly at content?This might be the first time I'm criticizing Universal, which for this movie, wouldn't agree on a NC-17 rating because that would lead to a loss of potential audience. Seriously? Fifty-Shades-of-Grey-fans would have loved it. Even R is explicit enough for parents to stop their children from coming to cinemas. What difference would NC-17 have made? Let me answer this ""rhetorical"" question: it would have allowed the movie to elevate the otherwise below-ordinary script. Screenplay writer Kelly Marcel didn't really have any other option than to use explicitness of the novel in the movie, but everybody rejected it. If they had stuck to the originality of the novel (which by the way sucked too), they'd have been able to pull out something that both entertains mass audience, and gets appreciated, if only a little, by true aesthetes.I would still say that I enjoyed my time watching it. The erotica sure was catchy, and don't be judgmental, everybody gets a turn-on on something that explicit. Also, there's always something sentimental and lovable about romantic movies. The ethereal sexuality was highly complemented by the score and songs. Beyoncé, in particular, nailed it. In fact, the main reason why the movie is ruling the media nowadays is her exquisite performance. The last trailer, for example, exhibiting Haunted, enjoyed a massive fan following, later providing an esteemed platform for the movie itself.In my opinion, screenplay writers should have had the audacity to change the theme, mold it to perfection, make it more sound and logical, and not make something that only shows a guy proving mainstream feminists true. The audience, at least the post-modernist one, does not follow a strict line. It's only looking for the line of best fit. Plus, it wasn't the adaptation of a sci-fi novel that there might have been a chance of all logic and equations gone awry.Fifty Shades of Grey made James's life a heaven; maybe she was good at luck. The book didn't deserve an applause, really. The movie? Well I'd give it something, considering the effort it takes to make a movie with this much and this kind of sex without turning it into porn.Five Shades to Grey; I think that'll suffice.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
An insult to BDSM and cinema,"This film is terrible in every way imaginable. It is a disgusting misrepresentation of BDSM. BDSM is founded on an emotional, romantic connection between partners. There is NO romantic connection between Christian and Anna. Christian is very vocal in how he doesn't want a romantic relationship. He doesn't do romance or dating.The characters are horrible and annoying- Christian Grey is creepy, controlling and possessive and Anna is just whiny and irritating.The dialogue is absolutely awful and made me cringe so many times. ""I don't make love. I f**k hard"" and ""I'm fifty shades of grey"" had me crying tears of laughter.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/bOfnTe",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
These haters should get spanked!!,"The amount of hate this movie is getting is SO RIDICULOUS!!! I just finished watching the movie and had such a good time I had to create an account just to defend this!!!First I'm going to admit that this movie isn't perfect. If you're some movie fanatic and want to watch an Oscar nominated movie, don't buy a ticket. And if you're a horny pervert expecting to see a porn and then come on IMDb and bitch that the movie was too boring, don't buy a ticket. Go online and find a porno. BUT if you just want to enjoy yourself, have a few laughs, maybe get turned on a little, do something a little spicy for the valentines weekend, don't let these haters stop you from seeing this movie!!!The acting was great to me. Both main actors played the role the book made them to be. Ana is shy, quiet, corny as she was meant to be. Mr.Grey is controlling, sadistic, and as charming as the book meant him to be. There is nothing more and nothing less from them. They played there part perfectly!The only reason that I deducted a few stars from my rating was there was some eye roll moments that were meant to be romantic but really just came across as annoying. That was my only problem. But of course, if you're with friends you guys will easily just laugh off those moments.So to sum this up, Don't LET THE HATERS STOP YOU FROM HAVING A GOOD TIME. At the very least you're going to have an interesting experience!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm embarrassed to have friends who liked this,"Couldn't sleep so I watched this at 4am.I expected a bad story, but I didn't expect the bad acting and the bad score. Yes the soundtrack is good, but the way they put the songs in the movie is weird and forced.I can't emphasize enough how bad the acting is. What is going on with Jamie's accent? It's all over the place in this movie! Everyone really just phoned it in. There's no chemistry between any of the characters. They all knew they'd make a bunch of money no matter what because of the popularity of the books (which I haven't read and have zero interest in).There's basically zero dialogue in the movie. Christian and Ana don't actually ever talk about anything. The only conversation they have is about the ""contract"" and what he wants. That's it. And that apparently makes more a sexy love story?As for the sex scenes, really tame. I don't see what the hype was about. The people who wrote this did zero research into BDSM and have no idea what it's supposed to be and what it looks like. The lack of chemistry, the fact the writers and director have no idea what BDSM is, plus how they scored the scenes just all made the sex scenes awkward and boring more than anything else.The worst thing about this movie is how they just casually mention pedophilia. A grown woman began an affair with a 15 year old boy? Jamie says he liked being submissive because it set him free from ""responsibility and making decisions"" really? At 15? That makes no sense.Oh and he's still friends with the woman who raped him.And our society was OK with this because I never heard any outcry when the movie came out.I was hoping to fall asleep to this but I just got angry at how bad this movie is and stayed up to criticize all of it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
People Hate This Film...I Didn't,"I have not read the books, and I won't. I have heard nothing positive about them, and I don't do much reading anyway. I always knew though a film adaptation of this book would end up being a box office juggernaut and I was right. One of the highest grossing films of 2015, Fifty Shades Of Grey was commercially successful but was a critical flop both with audiences and critics. I had to check it out, see what the fuss and critical panning was all about. Here goes..Very well shot, regularly amusing, superbly lit, a top notch soundtrack, well acted and with just enough flirtatious chemistry and banter, Fifty Shades Of Grey took me by surprise. I ignored all the negative buzz and reviews, blocked people out of my head and just sat back and watched it. My main criticism is aimed at the sex. Whilst there's enough of it, it never gets to hot and steamy levels. Those scenes barely register an 18 rating, I think that rating goes towards the inappropriate spanking and hard whipping scenes which must've been awkward to film. The film didn't need to be 120 minutes plus, most scenes are just snogging and a story this thin cannot sustain such an inflated length. What also annoyed me is the fact that one of my favourite singers, Rita Ora, who I have the hots for, was barely in this, she had one line and like 10 seconds of screen time, if that.With that negatives out the way, I thought Dakota Johnson was excellent. This is her most ballsiest, raw and brave performances, taking on a role that could potentially be career poison turned out to be something unforgettable and vulnerable. I liked Jamie Dornan, playing it straight with deadpan delivery and seriousness, I didn't find any campy aspects and I thought he too was taking on a role many wouldn't dare. I think that there's more desire and cravings than there is chemistry between these two, and I appreciated that difference. Although the scene where Ana discusses the contract at a ""business meeting"" with Christian showed chemistry and some sly humour. Supporting performances were fine, but there's no meat there. Actresses like Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden were pretty much wasted, considering their talents it's a criminal waste, as with Max Martini.If there is going to be a sequel, it needs to be more explicit and sexy, to earn that 18 rating. The story needs more meat, stray away from the books and make for an interesting side plots and twists then maybe the film could earn some brownie points. One of the best things about this film is Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"". That says a lot when a song is one of the highlights.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Erotic Visual Spectacle with Disgustingly Thin Storyline,"One of today's most popular YA novels, FIFTY SHADES of GREY assumes new life on the big screen with a promise of dark, savage and erotic romance.The film's backbone traces the sizzling sexual correspondence between young journalism major, Anastasia Steele, and the handsome billionaire, Christian Grey. Their relationship bears perfect resemblance to that of a master and his slave, only that it runs almost entirely through seemingly endless sexual encounters. Other than that, good looking actors, and the utmost loyalty it obviously paid to the book, there is nothing much to expect in this movie.While it offers a jaw-dropping and explosive sexual panorama, the movie's exceedingly horrible and almost empty script ruins everything.You wouldn't blame the actors, really, for they seem perfectly fit for their roles, in fact, you would praise them considering how still well they carry out their characters amid of the disgustingly thin, resource material they work with. Aside from the biting stares and one word exchanges between the leads, it would be head-achingly difficult to squeeze out any meaningful conversations between the two, that it would be as perfectly fine watching the movie in mute. The film's screenwriters obviously intends to be 100% loyal to the book, and make the fans happy, and they're probably successful, but at the expense of pushing the movie's overall quality past being mediocre.On the cover, FIFTY SHADES is blazing, titillating and bold, a cinematic behemoth on the scale of seductive and erotic art, but on the inside, this film hauls almost nothing that could be of any sense or substance. This movie might have satisfied millions with all the excessive amount of skins and waist-down actions it presented, but not me. Lol. I give this film 4/10 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY (Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015) **1/2","Last Friday's theatrical screening of the long-awaited film adaptation of the literary phenomenon that gave rise to the dubious ""Mommy Porn"" subgenre was decidedly the noisiest one I have ever attended: females (who, unsurprisingly, made up the vast majority of the audience) gabbing relentlessly to each other throughout, women talking directly to the screen, another who gagged on her popcorn and a chubby girl who commented out loud that she would not allow anyone to whip her like thatas if any one would ever care to or she would even feel the pain?! I was only vaguely familiar with the novel until mid-2012 when it became a daily topic of conversation among female colleagues at my workplace! Eventually, curiosity got the better of me and I downloaded a .pdf edition of the trilogy (I would not dream of spending money to acquire them legitimately!); the low level of writing on the first book (especially) was even more off-putting than any of its would-be objectionable content turned out to be...but I soldiered on and read through the first and second novel – even if by the time the film version came along three years later, I am still stuck in the initial stages of the third book! Anyhow, learning that several of those same female colleagues had decided to attend a screening of the film and make a ""Girls' Night"" out of the event, I cluelessly decided to join their party uninvited...The millions of fans of the novels worldwide immediately had their own ideas regarding who would be ideal casting for the central roles of disturbed billionaire Christian Grey and plain ingénue Anastasia Steele...but, in the end, these fell into the laps of Irish model-turned-actor Jamie Dornan (handsome, sure – but even more wooden than any of the instruments of pain/pleasure at his disposal in the infamous ""Red Room of Pain"") and the admittedly beguiling Dakota Johnson (the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, no less); tellingly enough, the latter was invited to present at yesterday's Oscar ceremony but Dornan was not. Nepotism, perhaps (after all, the film was similarly breaking box office records worldwide)...but I do not think so. From the rest of the cast, only two names rang a bell for me, incidentally both saddled with the thankless roles of the parents of each respective protagonist, namely Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden and Jennifer Ehle. I do not recall if it was like that in the first book as well but I was surprised to see that the major secondary character of ""Mrs. Robinson"" was only whispered about a couple of times but never actually appeared. Indeed, some people seemed surprised by the abrupt ending expecting the film to be a reductive adaptation of the trilogy...as if Hollywood would ever lose an opportunity to take two more trips to this goldmine in the coming years!While I found nothing all that salacious about the book's copious erotic passages myself (I have been an avid reader of Georges Bataille's novels from 75 years previously after all!), the film's even blander depiction of them is disappointingly tame...so much so that the rumours I had heard that the sex scenes where going to be filmed in silhouette and the fact that it has actually been banned outright in several backward-thinking territories are totally laughable in retrospect. Johnson's small ""mammalian protuberances"" (to steal a phrase from the late great Frank Zappa) get the most mileage but Dornan is not averse to filling up with screen with the occasional close-up of his bare bottom (""a perfect 10"" according to the most adulatory among my female friends – who, nevertheless, also took time out to spot a couple of goofs that escaped me and google a difficult word)! But, then, there are no glimpses of blood at all in the film or, come to that, pubic hair during its 15 minutes of sexual content overall!! Needless to say, this was more of a studio marketing ploy to keep the film from being slapped with a forbidding NC-17 rating rather than a case of artistic cold feet on the film-makers' part. Still, as it is, director Sam Taylor-Johnson will remain most notorious in years to come for having married an actor 23 years her junior (Aaron Johnson, of KICKASS fame) than for having helmed the steamy film version of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY!! What with the film hurrying through the narrative and skimping on the juiciest parts...but, thankfully, Christian's irritating habit of tilting his head and Anastasia's cringe-inducing and somersaulting ""conscience"" have been jettisoned!!It is all the more a pity, therefore, that one learns how director Johnson counts The Velvet Underground's 1967 counter-culture classic debut as one of her favourite albums since what is on display in her own film is worlds apart from the full-blooded BDSM relationship depicted in the shattering ""Venus In Furs"", the song which made me fall in love with this all-time favourite band of mine in the first place! Equally fitting would have been The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" from their own John Cale-produced 1969 debut (incidentally, I got to see Cale live at a London concert in October 2012)...but, at least, we do get The Rolling Stones' 1978 hit ""Beast of Burden"" on the eclectic soundtrack that also features classical pieces and contemporary pop stuff. Just as the literary works did not really break new ground (it just slyly appealed to the lowest common denominator and hit the collective jackpot..or is that G-spot?!), so the film follows in the wake of much older (and much better) films that had tackled the controversial theme of BDSM far more liberally and artistically, among them Mario Bava's THE WHIP AND THE BODY (1963), (my own No. 1 film-maker) Luis Bunuel's BELLE DE JOUR (1967), Henri-Georges Clouzot LA PRISONNIERE (1968), Yasuzo Masumura's BLIND BEAST (1969), Radley Metzger's THE IMAGE (1975), Walerian Borowczyk's LOVE RITES (1988), Roman Polanski's BITTER MOON (1992), etc.!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than I hoped.,"It took about 15 minutes into the movie before I accepted that I was actually watching Ana and Christian, but it works for the most part; especially for Dakota Johnson who really pulled off Ana. In fact, the only complaint I've heard from friends is that they wish Christian had been portrayed by someone else (but reality can never beat our own imagination!). Some of the scenes were combined from the book while others followed the book religiously so it ran smoothly. I was happy to see that the sex scenes were well made without breaking the boundaries of decency. I understand that some people did not enjoy the movie (some never feel that a movie can encompass a book properly), but I don't understand how someone who dislikes a book tremendously can then go see the movie and call it bad!

Spice up your life,"I haven't read the book. And I don't intend to do that. When my wife read those books I literally laughed at her. I went to the movie with her and for her. And I liked it!I wouldn't call this a pornographic movie. I would call it a good erotic movie. An erotic movie for couples. I would also call it a sex manual. But not in a kamasutra way. It explains a bit what women expect, how they react and so on. About the way they think and what they might desire.We (men) always wonder why all those pretty and beautiful women pick strongmen with little IQ, burglars, gang members and sometimes violent men. Maybe some of them really like to be dominated? To feel secure? And being punished is just a side effect...The movie is also a celebration of a women's body. A normal body without fake tits or liposuction. I would recommend this movie to all the guys out there. In each erotic scene I imagined my wife's body and I was thinking about how she might react on those ""perversive"" propositions. I never ever tried to hurt my woman besides a small slap in her ass but the movie made me think about dominant and submissive relations. This kind of relations has been in our world for ages and I ask myself: what's good/bad about that? why do we (people) do that? Would I like it to be a dominant/submissive? My wife? How would that influence our life (not only sex life)? Who would teach me all those rules if I wanted to do that only with my woman? And finally - where would I build my play room?!?!?

I was severely disappointed with the casting and directing. The storyline didn't even make it through the first book. It did not capture the sensuality and rawness. The only actor that came close to matching what was in my head, while reading the books, was Anna. If you've read the books, I highly doubt you will enjoy the movie. My husband had not read the books and he felt the movie was just 'ok.' Of course, he did say there were scenes he enjoyed. Christian's character has no depth and will surely leave people wondering what are the fifty shades, because this film only portrayed two of his fifty shades.

People are commenting on how her hair and clothes were ugly, well YEAH! You've obviously never read the books, she was meant to dress like that! She goes from the ugly duckling to a pretty 'princess'! I thought it was great how they had snips of humor- i think that was one of the ONLY reasons my boyfriend continued to sit in his chair.

I think his accent was very, very sexy! But as for his acting? I'm sure he is a good actor, but for Grey? I didn't think he was at ALL like Grey. Grey is supposed to be obsessive over Ana, and i just didn't feel that. Overall, I liked it. I will be buying it on DVD!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Awful acting, awful script","I'm someone who has the read the books, granted they're not literary genius but I did enjoy them somewhat. However the film was such a disappointment. It felt so rushed through to me and lacked development at the beginning and throughout. I was expecting it to pick up in the middle but no, if anything it got worse. Dornan's take on Christian Grey was extremely boring, lacking all the intensity that the readers love. His words had nothing to them and it was nothing like I imagined in the book. Ana, played by Dakota Johnston was really irritating and painful to watch. It failed to go in to any depth and skimmed briefly through most events in the book. Ray who is described to be slightly awkward character in the book, a man of few words, appeared to be a chatty enthusiastic character. For someone who did enjoy the books, I left the cinema very unimpressed.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it!,"I think this movie has been greatly misunderstood. I absolutely loved this movie! I enjoyed the book, but like many thought it was very badly written and the whole 'inner goddess' think kind of ruined the story. Besides that, I wasn't a fan of Anastasia, but I rarely like the main character in a book. I think the movie is the best possible version of the book. The director did a great job - eliminating all the annoying stuff from the book and turning it into a fantastic love story with just the right amount of sex to spice it up. I believe there is no other movie like this out there and I'm sure I'll watch it many more times in the future. I agree that the acting was bad at times, but I loved Dakota Johnson overall - she actually made me like Anastasia. I was very disappointed at first when I heard Charlie Hunnam was replaced by Jamie Dornan, but I was pleasantly surprised by him. He might be a bit 'goofy' at times, and not dangerous enough to play Christian Grey, but I still think he added just enough 'darkness' to his character - in particular in the final scene which I thought was incredible. Yes - you could argue that the movie is controversial in terms of abuse, although it was consensual,(I disagree completely with rape - Ana was never raped) but it's a work of fiction and if you've read the books, you know the dynamics are going to change.Overall I loved the movie and am disappointed by all the negative reviews. Nevertheless - I will still enjoy watching it over and over again :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It isn't that bad,"Let's be fair. I'm a bloke who took his girlfriend to see this for valentines day. Negatives? Plenty. I didn't in the slightest find Dakota Johnson attractive. Her body is similar to that of a stray cat and for goodness sake Dakota, Smile! You look like you want to cry in every scene. The film its self? Being honest the film had a lot of bore. I don't want to see them talking, and talking, and continue to talk.However. Even though I've never read the book, the film showed me a whole new side to it that I didn't realise. This isn't a sex story which to many people think. It's a story about two people who want a relationship, but they want two different kinds of relationships. She's wanting a boyfriend to sleep next to and have date nights but he's wanting this whole dominance thing. This is a love story! not a porno.Overall, there was a lot of pressure on two upcoming actors and you can not fault them for doing the best they possibly could. I said the film was a bore and it was, but you know what? I'll be back next year watching the sequel because the film had me talking about it after for many days. Thinking about the story and directing it in my head. So don't you worry E.L James.It's not perfect, maybe not even good, but 50 shades is going to be in the head of every man and woman that set foot in that cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
the book sucked and....,"This movie sucked even more. Childish, immature, and not sexy at all. I already expected that. Sad that people ran with the hype and spent money on it as a book and a movie. I would not even bother with the other books that were written after this title.The book read like a 12 yr old wrote it. The acting was the same. Good thing I didn't spend any $ on this movie.I am very sure I could have written a way better,hot and steamy interesting plot. Most of everything has been done before for years and years. I could come up with something people can actually feel and not want to leave their seat when it is over.These days, I do not understand why people are allowed to write crap and sell it.

Fifty Loads of Crap,"OK... let's talk ""Fifty Shades of Grey""... first of all, let me start saying that I did not read the books. Well I did start reading the first one, but when I got to the ""contract"" part, I could not take it anymore. I thought that the book was really bad, poor written skills and very repetitive. So I tossed away. But I just saw the movie and what a load of CRAP. I think the movie might be even worse than the book. As a former student of cinema, I do pay attention in every single detail and I could actually direct this movie better than who did. There was no sensuality, no erotism, not chemistry between the actors, not a drop of sweat, they didn't even kiss with tongue, nobody had an orgasm, nothing, just some slaps on the butt, duh and for calling himself a ""dominant"" in a BDSM world ""Christian Grey"" was way to amateur, practically a virgin himself, there was not a believable scene in this movie, maybe when she was crying, but even then it looked more like a soap opera. Btw... Jamie Dornan disappointed me. I do prefer him as a serial killer in the British series ""The Fall"". I do blame the director for this poor movie, more than I do the actors. The movies ""Secretary"" with Maggie Gyllenhaal and ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger are my favorites on this genre.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

As expected.,"Yes, i have read the book, and i don't like it at all, but at least it has SOME purpose. Women in middle ages that aren't satisfied with their marriage, miss adventures and aren't a type of person for watching porn consider it pretty fun. Totally understandable, it doesn't really have any art value, but its purpose is FUN!But talking about the movie... that was a total failure. Seems like person who wrote scenario and made this movie hasn't even read the book, because the story actually lost that only purpose it had.Wrong selection of actors, first of all. They did awful job, Dakota is so lame in scenes that demand natural reactions, like falling down and being scared, drunk, surprised, etc., and that's the most important part of being Anastasia Steele. And Jamie is nothing but a sissy, which is exactly the opposite of how he should be. It's probably more a fault of director, but he smiles when not supposed to, talks what not supposed to, and that makes Christian Grey in the movie way too different than the one from the book. A lot of important parts from the book are missed, or just changed, the point is lost after first 10 minutes. If there were no good camera work, scenery and so, i'd say that this movie is made by high school kids.The book can be liked by women in middle ages or horny teenagers, but movie can be liked by LOW IQ-ed people that can't recognize the quality and people who masturbate to bdsm, but didn't have a chance to search youjizz, because i still think that it contains better material than this crap.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cartoons have more depth,"It's good to see movies like this - it makes you appreciate other movies, that _try_ harder, more.

There is no script. There is no _story_. There is no depth in the characters in this movie. At all. They might as well have rented robots – the characters are that shallow. It's almost creepy.

Not as bad as everyone is saying,"Fifty Shades of Grey is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, with the screenplay by Kelly Marcel, based on the novel by E.L. James. I haven't read the book, so I have nothing to compare it to. I've seen the book reviews and read the hype and it made me curious. So after seeing the film, I've come on here to find a very low rating and I'm quite surprised. It is definitely better than what many are saying.The film is beautiful to look at. The directing, cinematography, and production design is stylish and polished. I think Sam Taylor-Johnson does an amazing job. Dakota Johnson is wonderful as Anastasia Steele. She is innocent yet sexy, playful but strong. Jamie Dornan is fantastic as the handsome, tormented businessman, Christian Grey. He is serious and intense, and is everything I'd imagined Christian to be. Both actors, besides being ridiculously good looking, do a fine job and play off each other well. They are definite stars of the future.The love story part is realistic and romantic. Anastasia being in love for the first time, is swept off her feet by Christian but also feels emotional and confused about her feelings for him. The sex scenes are tastefully done, but I was actually expecting more explicit scenes from the way some people went on about them.It's disappointing and unfortunate that it's getting such bad reviews, because there's many more films out there that are much worse than this. It's got a little bit of everything. Drama, romance, sex, humour, and a killer soundtrack. What more do you want? And as others have said, go see it with an open mind. It's not an award winning film, and the story itself is pretty clichéd, but overall I really liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprisingly, was not as bad as I anticipated.","Fifty Shades of Grey was a film that was looked down upon very heavily by movie critics and journals all around the country. Right from the get-go, when the film was announced, people who had read the psycho-erotic book about the man who tortures women for pleasure all knew that revamping the book into a film was going to be a horrendous idea.The film got very cheesy and boring at times (especially with all the times Christian mentioned that he had to ""go back to Seattle"" because he was confused, or move to some other place because he is a ""monster"" and is incapable of love, and other loads of crap), as well as a bunch of other cringe worthy scenes, like the first time he took off his shirt and randomly leaned in and took a bite of Anastasia's piece of toast. Like can someone please explain to me why(?)...But with that being said, the film was actually very suspenseful and aroused curiosity heavily many times throughout. The acting was looked down upon by all critics everywhere, and to be completely honest, it wasn't actually that bad. The plot was the one thing that was a bit repetitive and ""back and forth"", but in the end, it was a very interesting story about a man who had a very rough childhood and let his past grow on him into adulthood, making him the quote-on-quote ""monster"" that he is. Not to mention all of the deep erotica scenes were portrayed very well. It was definitely way further from any sort of BDSM pornography I've ever seen, but still managed to show how much of a sexually obsessed monster Christian was. In my opinion the film deserved a 5 on 10 because, much like The Interview (getting a 9 rating in the first 3 weeks of it's release because of biased reviewers), this film needs to be evaluated at a personal standpoint because everyone has different taste in these types of ""unique"" and sort of contrasting types of films. Also make sure you go watch this movie in a packed theater because your experience will be much more enjoyable if everyone is watching it with you right by your side.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fifty shades of dull, though not as dreadful as you'd expect.","Few movies come with more baggage than Fifty Shades Of Grey. The bestselling book on which it's based has been criticised for everything under the sun: destroying literature, shaming women, and completely bungling the portrayal of BDSM. The film itself, though outfitted with a female director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) and writer (Kelly Marcel), has come under fire from various women's rights and religious groups, all pleading for it to be boycotted upon release. Articles about how stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson can't stand each other have gone viral. It's hard for any movie to struggle free of so much controversy, but you have to give the filmmakers credit for trying. The final film isn't, strictly speaking, very good, but - in doing away with some of the more odious elements of the book - becomes surprisingly watchable.One fateful day, literature student Anastasia Steele (Johnson) takes the place of her sick friend to interview up-and- coming young billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan). They're instantly drawn to each other: Ana can't stop thinking about him, and Christian can't stop himself from seeking her out. But it soon becomes clear that their relationship won't be, as Ana hopes, a ""normal"" one. Keeping himself at an emotional distance, Christian reveals that he would like Ana to consider an unusual sexual request: he wants her to consent to be his submissive, to allow him to control everything about their physical relationship within the walls of his ""playroom"".There are a few things that do work about the film. In the book, the character of Ana feels trapped - not just in an unbalanced relationship with a creepy guy, but by E.L. James' awkward and frequently laughable prose. Shorn of an inner monologue about her sexual awakening that's liberally peppered with phrases like ""Oh my"", ""Holy cow"", and ""inner goddess"", Ana actually becomes a welcome focal point for the movie. She may be dangerously drawn to Christian, but she also seems to maintain a fairly strong sense of self - she constantly questions why their relationship needs to be precisely as he dictates, without any concessions to the way she would like things to be.As a result, Fifty Shades plays with a little more romance and feminism than you might expect. It's here that Taylor-Johnson and Marcel's influence on the film really asserts itself. There's an occasional burst of fizzy humour in the way in which Ana and Christian interact, particularly when they are (literally) negotiating the terms of Ana's sexual contract in his icily professional meeting room. Ana is the one with the upper hand in this scene, and many others - she's guarding rather than giving up her freedom. After all, as some have argued in defense of Fifty Shades, Ana has every right to decide how she wants to be treated in the bedroom - even if that means having her hands tied up above her head and being spanked when she disobeys a direct command.Ironically, what works rather less well is the film's constant and strangely dull focus on sex. Presumably, the allure of kinky, alternative sexual practices was what contributed to the success of James' book. There's plenty of nudity here, with gags, whips and cuffs galore, and it's certainly one of the most explicit films ever made by a big Hollywood studio. But it barely conjures up any sort of genuine tension: sexual, erotic or otherwise. The plot, such as it is, flags frequently, clearly unable to bear the weight of a two- hour running time.There's also the rather troubling problem of Christian Grey. Try as she might, Taylor-Johnson can't completely excise or explain away the more questionable aspects of his character. It's in the book, after all, and so it's replicated - rather unfortunately - in the film. Christian's intensely specific demands are meant to be rooted in his difficult childhood, but the psychology breaks down after a point. In the second half of the film, especially, Christian feels less like a dangerous romantic prospect than an obsessive stalker. He turns up in Ana's home after she's placed plenty of distance between them, and sends her a flurry of desperate e-mails demanding that she look over her contract.This is the film that will make - or possibly break - the careers of its two lead actors, both relative unknowns who are now, for better or worse, enormous movie stars. Johnson acquits herself very well: she lends Ana a tremulous charm but also a feisty spirit that suggests she won't give in except when she really wants to. Everything about this film is a tough line to walk, particularly her character, but Johnson navigates her way quite effectively through her copious nude scenes and clunky dialogue.Dornan doesn't fare as well. Perhaps he was never really comfortable with what he's called ""heinous"" sex scenes, but he's an almost magnificently blank presence here - both in and out of the bedroom. He's so stiff - and not in the naughty sense of the word - that he seems dead inside. That might be intentional, to some extent, given Christian's stubbornly closed-off nature. But it means that he never quite conjures up the right chemistry with Johnson.Apart from fans of the series (and even they had their doubts), there weren't many people expecting great, good or even mediocre things from Fifty Shades. It seemed to be headed for horror: a dreadful adaptation of a dreadful book, an offensive joke played on the world at large. Well, it's not quite as bad as that. The film is problematic and unforgivably dull in parts, given its subject matter, but anyone turned off by the very thought of it might find themselves surprised by how watchable it is (most of the time, anyway). It's certainly a better adaptation than the book deserves - and that's really a minor miracle for a film struggling beneath the weight of so much controversy.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Immature reviews and misguided judgments,"Rule 101 of reviewing movies: Only reviewers who finish a movie have a right to an opinion of that movie.The book trilogy is not the movie (and I never read it). What's more, rape and abuse are controversial words and sensitive topics. They also mean non-consent. Both lead characters as presented in the film are highly-vulnerable, consensual adults, utilizing safe words. This film does not promote rape or abuse. If anything, the filmmakers over-stress the consensual nature of Christian's playtime and Ana's intrigue.It's telling that men - so many of whom are adolescents or under 20 - have ripped this film apart on IMDb, without considering how many women in this world have an interest in, or a fantasy about, Sub roles or BDSM lifestyles. Part of the same anger toward Ghostbusters remake with an all-female cast I believe has a related hatred in Fifty Shades. There's just something about female empowerment that scares so many men.Fifty is flawed. It's not the best movie ever. And I felt the ending was jarring and awkward. But it's hardly the trash that so many have attempted to throw out. It's a sensual story with complicated themes featuring emotionally vulnerable characters who are pushing each other in directions that neither has experienced before.

"Not a fan, yet mildly surprised","I was intrigued. I haven't read the book and I probably never will. There must be better fanfiction about the ""plot?"" than the actual novel, written by people who do understand the power play and the complex psychology behind the BDSM world. There is just none of that here. The author didn't do her homework at the time. Wikipedia is just not enough or me or anyone, and probably highly offensive for members of that community.Storyline aside (nonexistent), I am surprised at what Taylor-Johnson accomplished with such poor base material. There was little she could do to hide the flaws, as some of those are actually inherent to the story itself. (multi-gazillionaire and helicopters? seriously?) But I believe she did a pretty good job and I admire her for it, all things considered. Sam, get the money and run. Or stay to earn more, it's up to you. You are a free individual. Respect.Dakota Johnson did great work, she gave a strong performance. Those who don't think so probably forget that these characters are quite shallow to begin with. To me, she gave the shy submissive a nuance of playfulness more than appropriate. (I might be biased because she is a cutie pie. OK, she's the only reason I watched this)The role of the dominant is clearly fantasized over the top of the highest Dubai hotel. Jamie Dornan did what he could. Could have been much better, though. But again, this is not a faithful BDSM representation of sex. This is just extrapolating the kinky side and adding a troubled millionaire with mommy issues to the mix. 0 personality. Grey is not a real person. How to bring a fantasy to life escapes my understanding. Clearly didn't work.Regardless, I watched it to see what this was all about. I get the fuss. I really do. Many ladies out there who are not sexually satisfied. But there is so much better erotic literature out there that it's painful. The story is sloooow, meaningless and often just plain idiotic. Ladies, raise your vibrators and claim your right to be satisfied. Tell your partners what you want, where to touch you. Communication is the key to pleasure (even with yourself). Something Grey doesn't seem to understand. Regain control. Give up control. Whatever works best.Anyway, if this film brought you happiness, I'm happy for you. I truly am. That's the goal.

The Best Comedy of 2015 So Far,"There were times during my (honestly more than a little intoxicated) viewing of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" where the movie genuinely made me wonder if I was watching a parody of E.L. James' horrible book. The entire audience and I guffawed heartily at several of the early scenes, and I got the impression that we were all laughing with the film and not at it. Even more numerous were the times where I felt I was laughing AT it, and the times where I was so thoroughly baffled at the characters' actions and their development, or so massively bored by the tame and interminable scenes of protracted S&M, that I almost took a conscious decision to drink myself into a stupor and miss out on the ending; a big emotional moment that will probably lose what little meaning it has as soon as the inevitable sequel rolls around.Inconsistency in tone is far from the only problem the film has, though. The borderline glorification of abusive relationships, poor acting, bad dialogue and a frankly (James got final say on the casting, after all) surprising lack of chemistry between the leads (Dornan is by far the biggest culprit here) certainly go a long way in making this film a lot more enjoyable at its worst, but the aforementioned boring bits are SO boring, and so unendingly devoted to the book, that whatever schadenfreude I got from them is simply insufficient for me to squeeze out an ironic recommendation. A saddening fact, because I could easily see myself endorsing an intentionally funny parody or an unintentionally hilarious slavish adaptation, but not a mismatched hybrid of both.I have a feeling that the people involved in the making of this picture could have cooked up a pretty decent parody of the laughable new wave of ""mommy porn"" erotic novels that E.L. James inspired. As it stands, though, they crafted what is probably the single best adaptation that anyone could have possibly made from the source material.Unfortunately, that is not saying much. At all.Funny as hell, though. Even if I got more titillation out of Alexander Portnoy's liver episode.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fifty Shades of B.S.,"Quickie Review:Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a naive literature student, who goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). They both are instantly attracted to each other. However, Anastasia's life is changed forever as she enters Christian's luxurious and sexual world. Fifty Shades of Grey is horrible. A soft-core porn masquerading itself as something more. Laughable dialog and shallow caricatures, although plentiful are the least of its problems. Avoid this movie at all cost, please don't support such horrid excuse for a film.Full Review:I understand the appeal of exploring sexual fantasies. Considering the world-wide sensation that was the novel, there is a lot of curiosity to know what all the fuss is about. That curiosity is what got me to go to the cinema to check it out. I really wish Doc Brown's DeLorean arrives this year so I can stop the past me from making this terrible mistake.I am not an unreasonable guy, so I'll start with the positives. The cinematography is done well, it looks good. However, polish a turd as much as you want, in the end it's still a turd.There are two reactions you will have to the dialog: laughter at its absurdity or cringing at its awkwardness. There is no flow to what's being said. They'd be sitting at a dinner table having a conversation and out of nowhere Anastasia will say ""will you make love to me now?"" I instantly thought of Ron Burgundy's meme of That Escalated Quickly. Little did I know I should have saved that meme thought for the immediate gem of a line from Christian ""I don't make love, I f***."" Well at least he gets right to his point. What teenager wrote this script? It makes Twilight feel like Shakespeare.Now let's talk about the caricatures, yes caricatures because these aren't characters. Christian only has one mood setting, deeply brooding. The only other way to describe him is, rich. On the other hand, Anastasia is desperately made to look like a simple innocent small town girl. Oh look she drives a beat up VW Beetle, oh she's from a small town in Georgia, oh she doesn't own computer, oh she still uses a flip phone from her middle school, oh she doesn't have fancy clothes. We get it! Move on.If you are thinking I am looking too into this, and that all I have mentioned are just means to an end which are the titillating BDSM scenes, fair enough, let me address those scenes. They are simply not sexy, there is no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the time it doesn't even feel like Anastasia wants to be there. If you are looking to be shocked by the craziness of BDSM, except for the last scene it is actually quite mild. There are other movies that handle the topic of sex much better. For example, The Little Death, about taboo fantasies and how real couples deal with them, or Nymphomaniac about sex addiction and how it consumes you, or Secretary about the psychology behind BDSM.But the most insulting of all, that I can't understand how it is acceptable in the mainstream, is how weak of a ""character"" Anastasia is. The entire movie, she doesn't stand on her own. Even though she is being emotionally abused, she needs a man. Even when she is whipped and doesn't enjoy it, she is still in love with him. What did he do to deserve your love Anastasia? Oh right, new computer, new dresses, new Audi, helicopter rides, and glider rides. Simply insulting.So please, do not watch this movie. I know I've used the phrase, avoid at all cost, before for reviews of bad movies, but in this case I really mean it. If you are being dragged to see this movie, bribe your friend to not make you go. It's better use of your money anyway. I hate to rant non-stop, but for this movie I had to. If this review saves even one soul from the misery I've endured, I'll consider my life's purpose on this little rock we call Earth, complete.I was battling to rate this movie either 1 or 2 out of 10, but I opted for the higher rating. Why you ask? Because it managed to get a man in his mid-20s to complain about a movie filled with sex scenes. That's an amazing feat in itself that I must commend.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everyone just calm down.,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. A lot of the negative reviews are coming from someone that has either not read the books or did not like the books! If you liked the books you will like the movie! The lines are word for word from the novel, cheesy lines and all! The actors did a great job portraying Christian and Anastasia... The way they interact with one another is straight off the pages of the novel! If you did not like the books then do not see the movie because you will be disappointed. The sex scenes in the movie are graphic but they cannot be compared with porn. It was a little awkward watching this film in a theater full of strangers but after you get past the first few naughty scenes it is smooth sailing! Can't wait for the next one!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
So... what is the film actually like?,"It has sold over 100 million books in over 52 languages worldwide. It has become the UK's fastest ever selling book. It is the most talked about literature subject of many years. Heard of it? Yes! It is Fifty Shades of Grey!Given this success, it was almost guaranteed to be adapted into a film at some point. So Hollywood obliged and churned out a film quickly for fans. Presented with a world-premiere at this years Berlinale film festival, we have just seen. So ... what is the film like?For those unaware of the book's narrative, it follows the story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a college graduate who takes her friend's place at an interview with a young, billionaire tycoon - Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). But, what Anastasia soon finds, is that Grey is not all he seems, as she is invited to join him in sexual encounters.Brought back to the basics, it is essentially a story of a prince meeting a princess - just that the prince has several strange passions. 'I don't do romance, my tastes are singular' he says ... which is an merely an innuendo for over-the-top sexual endeavours, which include - but not limited to; bondage, whipping, ropes, dominance and submission.Obviously this is the talking point of the adaptation given its nature. So, how has this been translated from the book to the screen? Mainly it is slow-motion effects, close-ups and aerial shots with heavy breathing. Not to say that this is restricted from the novel's original ideas, as there are many nude shots in its twenty- odd minute sexual scenes (in the total running time of two-hours).The two leads of the film, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey are also noteworthy of some mention. When first announced, names such as; Clooney, Gosling and Pattinson came to mind for the role of Grey, with Johansson and Lawrence up for the role of Ana'. Ultimately the roles went to Dakota and Jamie Dornan ...Visually they both look the part. Dornan as Grey; the Bruce Wayne- like billionaire, who lives within the finest luxuries (yet a dark twist). And Anastasia, as the awkward college grad who seems out of her league. It starts shallow with some awkwardness, conferences and business formalities. But soon transforms into bulk sex scenes with some small intercepts between.Helicopter rides, skyline view hotels, and kinky sex-rooms (playrooms) are all the range, as the film pushes erotic boundaries like no other. Where most dramatic romances have about one bedroom sex scene, this, by comparison has at least eight. Likewise in the comparison, Fifty Shades' is more explicit than them too.Visually, director Sam Taylor-Johnson has shot it with style. In terms of sound it also compensates from Danny Elfman's backing, plus tunes from Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others providing lyrical pleasure.Raising questions such as why is the sex-weirdness so important, and what are the Fifty different Shades of Grey? Much is left on edge and - as fans of the novel will know, it ends of a cliff-hanger. Which, conveniently gets you to read the following two books (which have just been announced as upcoming films too).The big question, should you see it? Yes, other than divulging fans of the book, it does actually contains some potential of intriguing story too - other than the erotica, come pornography headlines.Read more at: http://www.gonewiththemovies.com/reviews/fifty-shades- of-grey-review.php",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful!,"This movie adaptation of the first book from the Blockbuster Trilogy of the E.L James novels, 50 shades of Grey, for me was 50 shades of what to do wrong in a book adaptation movie. First let me express the artistic qualities in the movie and acting. This movie exists only because of the success from the book trilogy that was targeted for women over 30 years of age. Why then make a movie that is basically watching a Twilight movie, this will surely disappointing for the novel fans. I understand why they might get influenced from this vampire movie, since both of them take place in Seattle, but you cant have a movie based on a novel for an audience of women over 30 or at least mature minded women over 20, watching the acting of the twilight saga with bad lines of BDSM or bondage scenes, which by the way this scenes have nothing of BDSM, basically just nipple showing and bad acting. The acting in my opinion was terrible, the adaptation from the novel was horrible and I think I am not going to be the only one disappointed in this movie. I would only suggest this movies for girls from 18 to 21 years of age, who are Twilight fans, since it seems more like a soft porn TV made movie, than a box office hit.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most boring film I've ever been to,"What Chinese water torture? If you really want to torture someone, make them look at this movie over and over again. They'll die of boredom. Literally.It was the first time in my life when I was checking my watch every 15 mins, praying for the ordeal to end. Too bad I knew it lasts for 2 hours.Never heard so many jokes in the movie theater before; and with all the laughs generated by those, it felt I came for a comedy.The sad part was that both characters seemed to be mentally and emotional unstable. There's no romance in there, no chemistry, just abuse. From any angle I see it.And the last straw..there were plenty of girls fascinated by the romance and giggling each time the actors kissed or had sex. Really?!Overall - I hope they never transform the other 2 parts into a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
When hot rich dominant guy meets innocent college grad desperate for love: story of abused love,"Fifty Shades of Grey is quite a disappointment, although the book is not that good to start with.Dakota Johnson who plays Ana, the innocent college graduate who is desperate for love but has been waiting for the right person, is pretty and acts alright. But Jamie Dornan who plays the filthy rich young CEO Christian Grey is quite a disaster. Yet I think it is the plot (if there is any), the script, and the direction that kills it.To start with, the plot was weak, as in the novel. But at least in the book there is some suspense which attracts you to find out what kind of person Grey is and how his haunted past has turned him into such a mysterious and strange person today. This suspense is fascinating as many women like to play the role of martyr/curer so as to ""save"" the man they think they love, even if it means sacrificing themselves. So it is rewarding seeing Grey changes his behavior patterns (eg not do the girlfriend thing, not sleep with women etc) because of Ana who probably wants to be his last woman. This in itself is a conquering feeling that would keep the audience/reader enticed.In a way, it is almost like a modern fairy tale – Cinderella is picked up by the pumpkin-turned horse carriage and Ana is swept off the feet by all those new electronic gadgets, a brand new car, and a helicopter and a glider ride by the man she feels intrigued with, not to mention Grey always appears like a white knight who saves her from all kinds of embarrassment.What's more, it is the abundance, spontaneous, various, intense and sometimes kinky sex that sustain the fascination in the book. Unfortunately they are drastically left out in the movie, hence making it less interesting to watch. Perhaps the hot sex would be difficult to show in pure graphic language. But better direction would have led the audience to imagine without laying everything out like an XXX rated movieEven Grey's wealth and taste is lamely portrayed. His supposedly luxurious apartment looks drab and bland. With the empty and heartless dialogues, it feels like a trashy afternoon TV drama with a weak plot, slow pace and non-arousing love scenes only bored and overweight housewives would watch.And all these is even before mentioning the negative criticism on domestic violence the film receives. Mind you though, Ana wants to know more about Christian and help him. That's why she is willing to step into this uncertainty, even it means letting herself be hurt. But perhaps a sensible woman would leave at such point and only a fictional character would exercise such involvement. Thus as reader and audience, we would feel safe while vicariously entering such risky relationships.The book itself, despite its mounting sales, is of limited literal achievement. However, I must admit it serves like a manual where it is tempting to try out some new functions. But other than that, the plot, character development, and theme are quite weak. Unfortunately the movie is worse. I would not recommend watching it with your date. In fact, you probably would not miss much not watching it. Briefly scan the book instead, there might be some practical tips you can pick up.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 Shades of I Ain't Mad at it,"He're the deal. If you read the books and hated them or it you refused to read the books on principle, then I have no idea why you would see the movie. You are clearly going to hate it. For those I described who saw it? The joke is on you because they have your money now and you have contributed to the monetary success of the film. Congrats, Sparky.Clearly, this was not a great literary achievement as a trilogy. The writing is poor, Christian has a serious creep factor and Ana was whiny and spineless. However, I think the movie is an improvement on the books.I didn't hate the books... and while I am not am not turned on by BDSM (and skimmed some of the rougher scenes in the books) the sex wasn't what gave me the ick-factor. It was their relationship outside of the bedroom that seemed borderline abusive to me. However, as I said before, it seems like the movie may have improved upon that a bit as Ana seemed to have some spine, some spunk here.I was excited for Jamie Dornan as I enjoyed him in Once Upon a Time and I do not find Charlie Hunnam to be attractive in the least. But I found Jamie's performance to be really stiff and awkward...he never felt comfortable in the role. Christian Grey is needs to embody the confident billionaire. Jamie didn't pull that off and it was disappointing. Hopefully he'll loosen up a bit for the next two films. Dakota Johnson, on the other hand, I thought was great. I do think it odd though, considering mostly women will see this, how much nudity there was of Dakota and very little of Jamie. Maybe this was an attempt to bring in the male crowd?So I give the movie a 6. I thought it did well with the material it had to work with and quite honestly, I thought it kind of hot. As long as you don't take it too seriously as a statement on relationships (I worked at a domestic violence shelter, the books did bother me at times) or care about the accuracy or lack-thereof of the BDSM lifestyle (it is fiction after all), it can be an...interesting...ahem...way to spend a couple of hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outsider's fantasy about wealth and sex,"A film that feels less like an exploration of wealth and sexuality and more like an outsider's fantasy of both. The movie attempts to be a sensual, provocative drama but instead delivers an oddly sterile and hollow experience.Rrather than an exploration of power dynamics or genuine eroticism, the film presents a surface-level, almost mechanical depiction of wealth and desire. Christian's riches are displayed in the most predictable ways-helicopters, luxury apartments, expensive suits-without any sense of taste, subtlety, or understanding of what actually makes wealth attractive beyond price tags. Likewise, the film's take on BDSM feels like it was imagined by someone who learned about it from a Wikipedia summary.Ultimately, Fifty Shades of Grey is not a story about power, control, or desire-it's a story about how someone with no understanding of those things imagines them to be.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I actually really liked it!,"I couldn't get through the book because the writing was so horrible, but I was able to recognize that there was actually a good story somewhere in there. I went and saw the movie today, and I really liked it. I can tell they cut out a ton of material from the book, but I still enjoyed the story, and I understood the reasons for Christian's behavior and tastes. I get it. It didn't seem far fetched to me. Dakota Johnson by the way did a FANTASTIC acting job. I was pleasantly surprised by that. Yes, there's lots of sex in it. I'm not sure why it didn't get an NC-17 rating because it is so explicit, yet I loved it. I did not feel like I was watching a porno. There are a couple of lines that are super cheesy, but that is because they went off of the book script and the author is so bad. All in all, I really liked the movie! It made me want to get the next book to see what happens, but I'm not sure I can stand that 1st grade level writing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Toxic and dangerous,"I'm not gonna say anything about misrepresentation of BDSM because there is enough information on that. What I want to say is how this movie literally gave me flashbacks from my previous abusive relationship because of how much similar Christian's behavior was to my abuser. Lovebombing, stalking, controlling behavior, isolation... How do people not see that? It's not romantic when your partner tracks your location and appears wherever you are, it's creepy and a red flag. It's not hot when your partner tells you what to eat and what birth control to take, it's damaging and humiliating. It's not generous when you get gifts and attention only when your partner feels like you are angry with them, it messes with your head and clouds your judgement. Nothing about it is hot, especially the part of bringing an inexperienced person into your kinks and shaming them for not going along with it or refusing to have an adult conversation with them to explain your side and be understanding about their limits.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 Shades of Suicide,"Well, I watched it and as per expected it was atrocious. Am I surprised? No. Fifty Shades of Grey was a book that somehow managed to get published and I have no idea how. It's as if the writer was a mom and rummaged on her 14 year old daughters computer and found a sexual fan fiction about some popular YouTuber and changed the names around and edited some of the stuff, made it longer and threw it at a few publishers. It became controversial for the absurd sexual content and a specific tampon scene. The movie takes this story and gives it a massive budget, and throws it on the big screen for you.What are the good things?The first hour of this movie is so bad that its actually good and pretty entertaining, the camera-work and soundtrack are honestly not half bad and Dakota Johnson is very attractive. That's honestly everything good I can name.What are the bad things?Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst big budget movie I have ever seen in my entire life. They try and go for subtlety and foreshadow a few things in the beginning but it's done so badly that it calls for a few awkward moments. The acting is sub par at best and the way the characters communicate to each other is ridiculously unrealistic. The first hour may be so bad its good, but the second hour is extremely boring, and it's just hard to watch. This movie honestly gave me anxiety.""BUT ITS NOT MADE FOR GUYS!!!""Honestly, I watch a lot of movies and I do watch a lot of movies people would consider chick flicks and have enjoyed some of them. It's such a ridiculously stupid argument. Maybe if you're a girl who doesn't watch very many movies ever and doesn't care about writing or anything like that, then they'll probably enjoy it. Good for you. But this movie if you actually take grasp of the elements that signify whether the movie is good or bad, then this swims deep into the bad side.Fun fact: The guy who plays Mr. Grey has quit the franchise, seemingly due to his wife not being okay with it.Should you see this?If you're curious you can go ahead, the first hour of it would be fun to make fun of with friends because of how terrible it is but the second half is god awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Film if you liked the book,"After reading all these ridiculous reviews on here i had to post one of my own. Firstly, as a woman who is completely comfortable with myself and who has previously been in an abusive relationship, i can categorically state that this film does not in any way demoralise women and does not at any time promote rape. Ana does these things because she wants to!Do any of you people know what rape is? Secondly, if you read the book and enjoyed it, i don't see how you can't like the film. Sam Taylor-Johnson has done a brilliant job of making the film classy and not in any way gratuitous. Lastly the acting was in my opinion excellent, i thought Dakota Johnson played Ana exactly how she was described in the book with just the right amount of shyness and inquisitiveness. As for Jamie i now can't imagine anyone else playing Christian, the chemistry was also apparent throughout (not sure where people are coming from with that). I think this film is receiving some harsh criticism and for what? It's true to the book, if you don't like the book don't see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

First movie review EVER...just to share my opinion!,"Given that the books weren't well written, I didn't have extremely high hopes for the movie. However, I was curious to watch it anyway.I made my poor husband go see it with me and we both wanted to leave immediately, but I made him stick it out.In addition, Jamie Dornan was the absolute WRONG actor for Christian Grey. Not only was the acting terrible, there was absolutely no chemistry and in my opinion he didn't have the right ""look"" or mannerisms for the part. It was literally painful to watch. They tried to add a little humor and playfulness to the movie, to most likely hide the seriousness of the subject matter, but it was an epic fail. They should have played more on the drama aspect of it and not worried about the subject matter. If they can make movies about war and serial killers, horror films, etc., they should have at least done this movie justice by making an excellent film.The lack of depth and character development was a huge mistake.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unconventional Love Story,"In Washington, the shy and naive English literature college student Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele (Dakota Johnson) goes to Seattle to interview the twenty-seven year-old self-made billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) in his office to help her roommate Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford) that is graduating in journalism and has influenza. When Ana meets Christian, she feels disturbed with him since he is handsome and self-confident. Soon he visits her at the hardware store where she works and invites Ana for a coffee, but he leaves her telling that he is not the man for her. On the graduation day, Christian sends first editions of romances to Ana as a gift. After the graduation, Ana, Kate and their friends go to a bar and Ana drinks too much. She calls Christian and tells that she will return the books since they are expensive and he goes to the bar and brings Ana to his hotel room. Christian dates Ana and offers a non-disclosure agreement to her to keep in secret their relationship. Ana does not sign the contract but loses her virginity with Christian that wants to introduce her in bondage since he is a dominant sadist. However Ana is seeking a romance and not sadomasochist relationship. Will they stay together?""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is an underrated film with an unconventional love story. The gorgeous Dakota Johnson is perfect for the role of Ana, with her sweet face and facility to take the clothes off. The plot is deeper than the classic ""Histoire d'O"" and the conclusion is perfect. The trauma of Christian Grey should have been better explored to explain why he has a twisted mind for kinky sex since there are more issues than ""Mrs. Robinson"" only. This romance is recommended for specific mature audiences and not for fans of ""Twilight"" franchise.

I have read the book and also felt it was a waste of time, so poorly written.If you have money to burn and are really extra bored, I would say go for it, see what all the fuss is about.

"Awful. Just, so, horribly awful","Let's get it out of the way: 50 Shades of Grey is one of the most laughable pieces of garbage I've ever sat through. I'll admit I read the first book, so I knew the quality (or lack of quality) the screenwriter would be working with to turn this joke of a story into a film. But honestly they could have produced something decent, at the very least tried to make it artistic or potentially thought provoking. The Secretary or 9 1/2 Weeks covered similar themes, and they seem poetic compared to this. In the end it's a mess, a boring slog of a mess that drags on and on until it climaxes with a tiresome yet lackluster ending (Really? That's the worst you want to do to her? Snooze...). No spoiler here: the movie ruins itself.Let's talk about acting. For all the hoopla, I really don't see the draw of Jaimie Dornan or why he is in movies. Yeah yeah, I should watch The Fall. But really, he used to be a model? Is that why he's here? I love how much people are fawning over his workout regime, like, Wow! He did sit-ups and drank protein shakes to get a 6-pack, that's crazy. Honestly, for someone trying to be ""The epitome of male beauty,"" he looked mediocre at best. I know all the lonely house-moms who've been waiting anxiously to personify their dirty little fantasies into an actual human being are dripping wet for this guy. But seriously, never once did I find myself have any emotion toward Dornan or think, ""Now that's an attractive man."" If anything I couldn't get past his stupid mouth, how it would crumple like a wilted sprig of ivy any time he tried to make sounds come out and hide his accent. And that's the true failure of this film. It wasn't the few sex scenes or the whips or floggers that made me or the audience uncomfortable. It was EVERYTHING ELSE.Watching 50 Shades reminded me of watching a sequel that went straight to DVD. IMDb says the actors learned all their lines in 5 days. That's really not shocking. The dialog consisted mostly of, ""Hello Anastasia,"" ""Hi Christian,"" ""Did you consider the contract Anastasia,"" ""I'm still thinking about the contract Christian,"" ""How about now Anastasia? Have you considered the contract now Anastasia?"" ""Maybe in a bit Christian."" I felt like I was being forced to watch two people with no idea how to flirt or function in society try to reason through installing an Ikea bed using only their feet. ""How will we put the boards together Christian? Should we use a screwdriver?"" ""Yes, Anastasia [*furrows brow, stares blankly at the floor], we could use a screwdriver"" [*Anastasia bites her lip. Christian continues to stare blankly into the ether. Screwdriver is seen for half a second]. That actually sounds way more entertaining compared to this movie.In short, Dornan couldn't act his way out of a cardboard box (even one for that king-sized bed from Ikea), and the film pays a huge price by casting him as the lead role. That being said: bless Dakota Johnson's heart. She really gave it her all in this movie and tried to make a steak dinner out of a baloney sandwich. She's relatable, plain and pleasant and does a fine job at her job (though anyone would appear great next to that block of wood named Dornan). The lack of chemistry is palpable, or bitterly dry (I don't know which is more accurate). You can't blame the girl. I couldn't imagine lying on a bed naked while cast and crew stare over you expecting you to moan and pretend to be turned on by a man with the personality of a washing machine pesters you over and over about a contract (Seriously give it a rest dude. You sound super rapey about the contract. And quit waking her up all the time. Let the poor girl sleep). Dakota's a decent actress, and I hope she pulls the rip cord and distances herself from this franchise before she gets typecast as ""full frontal"" girl.If I took anything away from this film, it's that sadly human beings will do anything for a paycheck, and an audience will pay to see how boring it is. Mediocre has become the norm, and this film doesn't even make the grade. There's nothing good, or original, or edgy, or thought-provoking about 50 Shades. It feels dated, and designed to be fantasy porn for those too vanilla to try anything risqué in their own lives. Truthfully, if the main character wasn't a billionaire, or white, or attractive, this movie wouldn't be so popular. It would be a drama about horror, rape, and abuse and real issues people don't want to talk about. 50 Shades is a false portrayal of kink and a subculture that is already misunderstood. Really people just want to see two semi-attractive bodies rub up and down on each other and maybe daintily slap each other with whips (LOL, the kink in this movie is such a joke!).For a movie gaining so much press because it covers the topic of sex, I wish I could have told it I had to work early in the morning and needed to go to bed. Nothing could ever make me watch this film again or convince me to see the sequel, even if they cast me over Dornan.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Then comes the the incredibly over-the-line sadomasochism sex scenes. Which by the way, are more like a horrible porn film. How did this even pass an ""R"" rating? I guess the main feature of the film is that she somehow ""changes him"". Which I don't really see depicted and quite frankly is nothing like the book the movie was based on. There is actually nothing I liked about the movie. I think the acting is poor, the character development is poor, the directing is poor. I feel like the creators just made ""cheap shots"" with all nudity and explicit depictions of disturbing sex scenes to compensate for their lack of talent to put together a decent movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A hype over nothing,The first and most important thing I can say is I wouldn't be proud to say I produced this film. Although the acting was faultless the content of the film was awful. There are big chunks of the book that are missing and I left the cinema feeling let down. As someone who enjoyed the books I would advise reading them rather than watching the film. Dakota Johnson's performance is amazing and she fits the role of Miss Steele well but the production let her down. I am guessing that a squeal is on the cards as there is a lot of content that is not explained. Definitely would not recommend paying cinema prices to watch this film because I regret doing it myself.,2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty Shades of give it a chance.,"If you read the book and truly know how the story is, the movie is great. The chemistry is good. The writing is cheesy but its still worth watching. I think Dakota is the perfect Ana. Though i wasn't looking forward to having Jamie as Christian, i warmed up to it. This story is beyond the sex, people need to realize this. There were laughs which were acceptable but at times people laughed at things that didn't need laughter. But i digress. I saw give it a chance and know that it isn't a porno, its part one of a twisted love story. I love the cinematography and i think this franchise will grow on to people rather than people ""knocking it before they try it"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A real, honest review from an open-minded viewer.","Here's my 100% honest review of FSOG, coming from a book fan and an open-minded viewer.Sam Taylor-Johnson's directing of the film was exquisitely done. The angles were perfect and she knows exactly how to create a sensual vibe for the audience. The close-up of Christian's fingers drumming against the desk was a perfect touch, as was every other little moment added in to the movie. Especially, I loved the elevator doors closing between Anastasia and Christian, as shown in the trailer as well. Everything looked beautiful, so for direction I definitely rate a 10/10.Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were magnificent choices for the roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Although a lot of people seem to think this, I don't believe Dakota outshone Jamie in any way. Their delivery of each line was almost perfect, though there were a few awkward moments, but I would blame the script for that. Dakota portrayed Ana beautifully- she has the right look, that perfect lip bite and she knew exactly how to act stubborn. As for Jamie, I believe that the role of Christian Grey was made for him. He knows exactly how to play a dominant, right from the delivery of his lines to his actions to his facial expressions. Every little detail was just so Christian, and I loved that. However, he seemed to be a little more awkward than intimidating in the beginning. Of course, I saw more positives as the film continued, so this wasn't a problem in the end. All the supporting actors and actresses played their parts well, too. I thought Eloise Mumford was a perfect choice for Kate, as she absolutely nailed the role. I can't say much for Elliot and Mia Grey, as we didn't see much of them, but they seemed to be good choices for their roles. A stand-out actress for me is definitely Jennifer Ehle, who played Anastasia's mother Carla. My my, she did a fantastic job. Every line was delivered perfectly, she seemed to really become her character and it was brilliant. Overall, for the acting and casting, I'll give an 8/10.The script. This is where I was a bit unsure. Some of the lines, for example Anastasia's 'why am I here, Christian?' and Christian's 'we don't have 24 hours!' felt very awkward and forced. A lot of dialogue in the book was very, very corny, and even as a huge fan, I can't deny that. I suppose hearing those lines spoken out loud on the big-screen just didn't look or sound right to me. For the script, i'm rating a 6/10.Finally, the sex scenes. I felt like I should give a separate section for this, just because it's a defining part of this movie. I know a lot of people were unhappy with the sex scenes, but honestly, they were exactly what I expected and more. Dakota Johnson's moans were perfect. They showed just the right amount of skin. The music played in those scenes was both beautiful and sensual. Every scene left the audience wanting more. I believe they should have included a bit more- for example, some of Anastasia's naughty moments from the book would have fit well into the movie, to show the audience of her sexual growth throughout the film. overall, I'm rating the sex scenes a 9/10.Finally, I'll average my score. Apologies for this being so long, I just felt I should share all my thoughts about each aspect of the movie to help those who are keen to see it. Averaged, my score is 8.25, but I'll round it to an 8/10. Again, apologies for the length!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
First time I've left home to watch porn,"I only decided to see this after the initial reviews, I simply could not believe it was as bad as everyone made it out to be. Many of the reviews here are similar in grammar and tone, I was starting to think it was some kind of conspiracy. I actually believed there was some kind of anti-fifty shades of grey movement happening on the internet. Shockingly, I was completely wrong.How to sum this movie up... pretty much everything that has been said here is true. The acting and plot outside of sex scenes absolutely plays out like the stuff you would see in softcore porn. Cliché after cliché right down to the core, I really can't stress enough how awkward and downright tacky some of the lines, or even reactions in the movie play out. While reading reviews here, I saw the phrase ""sophomoric writing"" pop up many times, now I understand why.The totally out of place and blatant lip biting, the ludicrous thirst showcased by Anastasia from the very first interaction with Grey is completely out of character and unbelievable for the type of person she is supposed to represent. Half of what she says reads and sounds like lines someone as awkward as her would come up with an hour later in the shower (alone). Christian's character has his owned forced one-liners that are obviously a service to book readers, I won't even bother with it because it has been covered extensively in other reviews. All I can say is I would be in for a few years worth of spankings after all the eye-rolling I did through this movie.I am convinced the writer's views on romance and courtship have never surpassed the preconceptions developed during her teenage years, when everyone dreamed of being swept away by a mysterious figure with the potential to make all their material dreams come true. This movie is nothing more than a fan service, and I would expect no one but avid readers of the book to enjoy or even be able to take it seriously. The music was okay though, so 2/10..... still a better love-story than twilight?",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 Shades of Grey: more pain than any dominant would ever ask,"It is apparent that the director and the writer of 50 Shades of Grey have never been anywhere near a Dom/sub relationship in their life, let alone be authoritarian enough to make a film about one. As a person who has been both a dominant and a submissive I am appalled that this film even pretends to discuss the envelope this world is seeded in. From the wildly unbelievable characters, and their increasingly irritable incomprehension of each other to the childish explanations for such relationships and complete lack of integrity in any scene presented makes 50 Shades of Grey about 51 points from even coming close to being a 101 on Dom/Sub relations.This film is nothing more than a conservative judgment call and an attack on a world that they clearly demonstrated they know absolutely nothing about the fundamentals of, let alone any whipper of insight.One star out of five...

"Started as Twilight fanfiction, huh? That explains a lot","Wow. Just wow. I'd heard things, both about the book and this movie. Having not read the book, I was curious and decided to watch the movie thinking it can't be that bad. Turns out it really can. This was astonishingly awful. The story, and I use that term very loosely here, features a shockingly creepy romance between the incredibly boring Ana and the incredibly insane Christian. They have very little chemistry, and what little they do is obliterated by all their faults, mainly Christian's. He stalks her, sells her car without permission, is incredibly possessive and jealous, constantly says things that send up all the red flags, and does a horrible job of selling Ana, and indeed the audience, on the BDSM lifestyle. For Ana's part, she comes off as very dumb for either not noticing the red flags or not caring, and the movie can't seem to make up its mind whether or not she's into the lifestyle. Heck, it can't make up its mind if the two are on a first name basis or not.The acting, dialogue, and direction are all terrible and seem to go hand in hand. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are beyond bland; they are virtually emotionless. The only time I believed their acting was at the end. The rest of the cast is no better. The thing is, I know Dornan can act; I saw him in Belfast and he was really good in it. So, the fault clearly lies in the writing and directing. The dialogue is one third exposition, one third cringy romantic dialogue, and one third disturbing lines from Christian. And the directing feels aimless, like the director had no idea what she wanted the actors to do in a lot of the scenes. Part of that can be blamed on the lack of plot, but the fact that this was her second film probably didn't help. Also, she seems to have a serious fixation on the color grey. It's all over the movie and the other colors are muted to make it stand out. I know this movie's called Fifty Shades of Grey, but give me a break.Not even the sex, the thing people go to this movie to see, is any good. First of all, it takes almost an hour to get to the sex and a full hour before anything even remotely kinky happens. And when we do get it, the film seems content with focusing more on the foreplay than the actual sex. Like, it's 95% the former and 5% the latter. Heck, they don't even say BDSM once in the film, which should tell you a lot. About the only thing that approaches good in this movie is the music, which to be frank is way too good for this film.Overall, Fifty Shades of Grey is indeed as bad as I heard. It's easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I have no interest in watching the sequels.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing film!,"This film, unfortunately, falls short of expectations with a weak storyline and a deeply flawed protagonist. The young woman - Ana is portrayed as being devoid of any principles or moral compass. She appears to be driven solely by a desire for sex and money, which makes for an uninspiring and unsympathetic lead.Her predictable response to every challenge or situation is to say ""okay"" and engage in immediate sexual activity. This not only becomes tiresome and repetitive as the story progresses, but it also raises concerns about the portrayal of women and their agency in such narratives.Moreover, the character's inability to stand up to her husband's questionable actions is equally frustrating. Instead of showing growth or demonstrating any depth, she remains a passive figure, seemingly incapable of asserting herself or taking control of her life.It is difficult to recommend this movie to anyone looking for a well-developed and empowering thought-provoking storyline.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

With a great cast and an actual professional screenplay, you'd be onto something.I never thought I'd be so bored during an r-rated flick about sadomasochism.This is an example of one of those movies that are whipped up with the sole purpose of creating an artificial media phenomenon.

People hate it because of the hype,"This movie is really not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Many voters haven't even seen it and others have hated it before they saw it.I was so focused on the book the first time I saw it that I didn't really appreciate the movie for what it was. Then a friend dragged me in for a second viewing and I knew what to expect. I was very surprised because it wasn't as bad as I thought the first time.No, it is not a masterpiece. And it's missing many scenes from the book - a book that was terribly written and originally was a Twilight fanfic (which still pains me),but had a good story. This is the story, they should focus on.The sex scenes were not necessary to that extent and they should have cut it short.Dakota Johnson was not my favorite choice for Ana Steele. She's not tiny enough. But I found her actually very fun and quite good.Jamie Dornan was a good Christian for me, though many do not agree. A few times his accent slipped, but other than that he did a very good job. Sadly the script didn't give Jamie and Dakota much room to explore their roles. It was too shallow so I applaud them for doing it so well.But a few casting choices were not so good. Elliot was not a sweet, hot lady killer, but looked more like a creepy drug dealer. Kate was not gorgeous enough and Grace (Christians mom) was too young.All the criticism for being anti feminism is something I don't understand. We start out with seeing a girl who doesn't have any self-esteem and lets everyone walk all over her. Then she meets a man who gives her confidence to stand up for herself. She finds her own inner strength. Also, there's no rape between Ana and Christian, not in the movie nor the book.Many from the BDSM community complains that the book makes it seem that you can only be into BDSM if you have psychological problems. It isn't true. Ana discovers that she likes it too and that 'it isn't the how that was wrong. It was the why'. There's nothing wrong with liking BDSM, but it is wrong if you do it to punish and work out your personal problems.I think it's sad that the movie has such a bad rating on IMDb because it's not terrible. Many horrible movies have better ratings so it's obviously because of the hype that many don't like the movie (or the books for that matter).Go watch the movie without expectations.

Will Everyone just calm down?,"I'm going to admit that I didn't have very high expectations when it came to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I went in figuring it would be quite the experience to see what I estimated would be a ridiculous erotic drama with a lot of sex, made for its audience of 30-something lonely housewives. Actually, and you can tell this is me telling the truth because I'm admitting this, the movie is better than you think it would be. I'd even recommend it if you're the audience it's targeting. The film stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia ""Anna"" Steele, a naive woman who becomes infatuated with the world's most eligible billionaire, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). There's drama aplenty when she discovers that Mr. Grey has a very peculiar sexual appetite.I really thought that this picture was going to suck and that if anything, I'd get a kick out of it by chuckling to myself (quietly, to avoid being noticed by the adoring fans surrounding me on opening night) but I really was pleasantly surprised. At least on a technical level, this is a very competently made film with an eye for good cinematography, some decent erotic sequences and a story that leans more towards pleasurable than agonizing. What I didn't foresee was that whoever was in charge of putting this project together really knew what they were doing. It's as if they read the novel and instinctively knew that there would be some significant backlash towards the film simply for existing and they asked themselves ""what can we do to work around some of the weaknesses in this material?"" Firstly, I felt like director Sam Taylor-Johnson knew that to make the story (which is very melodramatic, and not in a good way towards the end) bearable, some humor had to be injected in it. I can't really give any examples off-hand, but the movie felt self aware. It knew that people were going to make fun of certain passages of dialog, so dodges a bullet by poking fun at itself. Not too much, just the right amount.Even if you find that you have trouble swallowing the story and you can't stand the numerous sex scenes throughout, there won't be any denying that the cinematography present is quite good. There are three scenes that really stuck out for me. The first is a ""business meeting"" between Anna and Mr. Grey in which they are sitting in an office as the sun is setting. The diminishing sunlight peering through the windows and reflecting off of the glass table looked absolutely gorgeous. I loved seeing the warm glow reflect off of the two characters as they discussed their relationship in cold, calculated ways. The numerous sequences where Mr. Grey shows his would-be submissive some of the perks of living the high life were also very pleasing to the eye and there are a couple of shots where we see Jamie Dornan framed through objects that I thought showed a real eye for composition. Looking quickly at the cinematographer Seamus McGarvey's body of work, it comes to my attention that he's done a number of films. If I take one thing away from ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", it's that when I take a look at some of his works (which includes 2014's ""Godzilla"", ""Atonement"" and ""Anna Karenina"") I'll pay special attention to his shots.The faults, I pin mostly on the original source material. It's pretty clear that this movie is based on an elaborate fantasy put onto paper that just happened to hit the right note with certain audiences. Like in so many of these quasy-abusive romance-driven stories we've gotten since ""Twilight"", the main character is plain, kind of dim and can easily be substituted for the reader. For this reason I didn't find myself to be particularly drawn into the romance in the plot. While I found Mr. Grey to be interesting because of his mysterious past and exotic tastes, the pure virginal Anna is so wishy-washy about what she wants that I came to strongly dislike her. At over two hours, this movie is also way too long. If I can learn everything I need to know about a world as wacky as the one in ""Existenz"" in 97 minutes, there's no reason for ""50 Shades"" to eat up this much of your time. On a personal note, I was also disappointed to see that there really aren't that many big, memorable scenes in the film aside from the erotic ones (which, surprisingly, didn't really do it that much for me, despite the ample nudity). People have been protesting this film because of ""sexual violence"" and ""deviant behavior"" but come on... really? This is not that scandalous when you consider that the internet has been around for how long now? This movie was not made for me. I saw hardly anything that even looked like a glimpse of anything resembling a giant monster, a time-traveler or a crazed serial killer. It doesn't really appeal to my more refined tastes of solid dramas and soul-crushing honesty with romance thrown in either. You already know if ""50 Shades of Grey"" is going to be for you based solely on what you know about the plot, even if it isn't much. The picture already gathered far more attention than it deserves because it doesn't strike me as particularly good or bad. For what it is though, it is well made and I do think that the legions of ladies who gobbled up the novel (or want to give hints that they might want to try some bondage themselves) will not feel like they wasted their time with it. In a way, I'm disappointed that viewing ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" on opening night was neither a catastrophe or a wildly erotic romp that ended up with me grabbing more phone numbers than I would know what to do with. Oh well. (Theatrical version on the big screen, February 12 2015)",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unbelievably Boring and lack of any excitement,"I have not much hope to begin with for this movie. Since it was my wife's choice to see it. I never read the novel but I have saw the trailer, so going in to the theater. I have no surprise. As I expected, I was rape multiple time mentally. By the entire cast of the movie, the director , play-write, the actors and actresses..The movie is so bad. This type of movie used to be call Porn. I don't think anyone whose in the right mind would want to see this movie. The line between violence against women and sexual pleasure from torture is just so thin. So it is so hard for the public to distinguish whether this is an outcry of a middle age women or just promotion of sexually violence against women in general. This is just a major waste of time and money. I sincerely suggest if you would like to have a good time for the Valentine days weekend. Go for something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bit cheesy but not that bad,"I never wanted to read the books but I saw the movie. Fifty Shades of Grey is Twilight, without the religious cr**, sorry to say but the relationships in Twilight didn't feel genuine or plausible - supernatural aspects aside - and thank goodness she doesn't wait four books to put out. The film is sensual, not sexual even thought there are b**bs, bushes, and f-ing in it. It's a BDSM love story that reeks of teenage drama and desperation but it's still fun to watch, what does that say about?Sam Taylor-Johnson delivered a tasteful movie despite the dicey subject. Fifty Shades is well shot, the cinematography is beautiful and luminescent - sorry about that word - literally bringing to light BDSM practices. She suggested sex without showing it, to be honest she showed quite a bit. But once again, the movie is sensual and not arousing - at least, it didn't arouse me. Taylor-Johnson also got some pretty surprising performances out of her actors. Jaime Dornan and Dakota Johnson were surprisingly very good.Jamie Dornan is exceedingly good in this role, not that he is a bad actor, but I wasn't sure he could pull it off. He does though, he plays mysterious and domination well, and also clearly shows how Christian Grey loves the crack the whip. Dakota Johnson as the young and innocent Bella, I mean Anastasia is brilliant, she probably would have been a better Bella than Kristen Stewart - sorry but it's kind of true.I hope Dakota Johnson had a hell of a pay day out of this movie because however tasteful it is, she's naked a lot in this film.Chessy dialogues and unnecessary innuendos aside, Fifty Shades of Grey is not that bad.@wornoutspines",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing,"I went to see this without any particular expectations. I heard the sound and fury all over the social media from fans who loved the book to people saying it was all about rape and abuse. I saw it, ironically, in that grey area. It starts out (and continues through much of the movie) with some romantic-comedy elements, funny parts that a couple times had me laughing aloud. But it was also, in many ways, formulaic. How many times do we need to tell the story of Prince Charming romancing the pauper girl, after all? I think we all saw ""Pretty Woman"" in the ago. We all read and/or saw ""Cinderella."" It's been done too many times. Come up with something fresh already, for God's sake.Now, I didn't see anything I would fairly call ""abuse"" in the movie. There were several sex scenes in it, a few spankings, and a lot of teasing. Christian was going on all the time about her consent and I don't recall an event of him treating with her outside her consent, which she always gave him. Anastasia was, pardon my French, prick-teasing Christian throughout the movie, and Christian was trying to purchase her affections. I'll also say the whole sub-theme of anyone with alternative sexual predilections being portrayed as psychotics or trauma-mommas is also overdone, and it misleads people about what's honestly a big segment of peoples' sexuality, and I find that hatred of S&M practitioners to be prejudiced and sad. I won't spoil the movie for those wanting to see it, but it ends, I thought, with Anastasia being the emotionally abusive one, and as the final credits rolled, I decided I had fondness for neither character, thinking they deserved one another so nobody else had to be saddled with them. They were both bleeding assholes earning none of my empathy. In all, FSOG tried and failed. Save your money and see something else.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than the book,"It is good, there isn't one extra scene or out of place. The only thing that comes to mind is underused sex scenes and a particular scene which takes place in the garden. The focus is on the leads and this leaves other characters looking like extras but that's fine by me. The script is so much better than the book, all the lines are perfect. While reading the books, Anastasia would usually get on my nerves, but it's entirely different story watching this character on screen. She is already in this first installment of the trilogy a confident, strong person, unlike in the books, where we get to see that transformation in the third book. Chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson is there, that's for sure, perhaps not an animal kind of attraction, but it's palpable. Both actors have done an amazing job in this movie, so well, that I truly became interested into finding out whether there could be future for them or not, even though I knew how it all unfolds because I had read the books. I also liked the ending and am curious to see the sequel. I would recommend this even to those who haven't read the books.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I admit it's weird falling in love with such a perverted maniac but he did have some really good qualities, I mean he was always honest with her, he took her on that glider (and I actually loved that scene), he visited her in Georgia. Not to mention that he is ridiculously hot! But his acting were 1 of the few things that were not so good! Every single time he said ""laters baby"" in the book I thought of it as cute and casual but it was just awkward and laughable in the movie. I really liked her acting though, she was exactly like I pictured Ana, funny and doesn't look weird when she bites her lip. The scenery was splendid, I have to give that 10/10 and the soundtrack was flawless ( I loved the helicopter scene with ""Love me like you do - Ellie Goulding"". Rita Ora and the guy playing Elliot were there for like 2 second so I'm not even gonna review that. So overall I liked the script (kinda funny, respecting the book, and ending exactly like the book but was more like a cliffhanger), most of the acting was good (when he crawled on the the bed without a shirt and ate some of her sandwich and when he was in her room right before they started having sex was kinda good, so he wasn't all bad).

"Poor Direction, Terrible Screen writing and Bad Acting (except for Eloise Mumford)","1) The pacing of the movie was far too quick. It was as if director Sam-Talyor Johnson and the screenwriters went into making the movie with the mentality of ""Well everyone read the book already, so everyone knows what the movie is about, so it isn't like we have to put any real focus on building such silly things like characterization, plot building, etc..etc.... The movie felt like a visual cliff notes version of the book, which worked to it's detriment.Also, I feel that, this movie alienates those who didn't read the book. There was actually a man that I overheard coming out of the theater questioning what was going on in the movie because he hadn't even heard of the books.BAD MOVE Directors and Screenwirters. Very bad movie!!2) The only genuine actress in the entire movie is Eloise Mumford (who played Kate). She is the ONLY actor in the entire film that I felt was actually giving an truly believable performance, or even a PERFORMANCE for that matter. Everyone else (especially the two leads) felt like they were either phoning it in, and / or reciting lines directly from the book in a really bad staged reading rehearsal. This pure lack of character portrayal made the entire movie seem unrealistic and therefore, none of the relationships felt authentic.To Eloise Mumford, you are singlehandedly the reason why I give this film 2 of it 3 stars, and I hope to hire you in a future production of mine.3) The music was great, but POORLY used.4) The movie was far too comedic, which I didn't expect at all. Why was the movie so funny? For one thing, I didn't believe anything that Mr. Grey and Anastasia Steele were saying because the performances were so bad it made even the most serious dialog seem light hearted and comical. Lastly, the movie goes by so quickly that I wasn't fully immersed in the world of the story anyway (except of course when Eloise hit the stage).Overall, watch if your curious, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece here.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable,"WARNING the last 10 minutes of this movie is bad. Really bad.Having said that I surprisingly enjoyed this movie. I wasn't expecting great theatre, bust as a Sunday night movie it was fun to watch with my husband.

Worst Movie in History.,"Sadly they are going to make a lot of money based on the ""name"" and curiosity, so the people involved with this fecal matter may think they did a good job with this movie and produce the other 2 of the trilogy but fact of the matter is anytime I am having a movie discussion and someone ask me ""what you think is the worst movie of all time?!""... 10 times out of 10 I will say ""50 Shades of Grey"". There is absolutely no redeeming quality in this movie at all, I been telling everyone I could to save their money. It's not even worth watching for free but hey, I can't control how people choose to waste 2hrs of their precious life. There is no plot. Nothing is explained. Acting is literally laughable.

Chemistry,"I had read the books when they first came out, so my recall of the sex scenes had faded. In reading the books, I was able to skim through the most shocking and uncomfortable parts of the sex scenes, so it was very shocking to see them played out on the big scene, especially with my husband sitting next to me. He had never read the book, so he was just as shocked as I was. Apart from the initial shock, I absolutely loved the chemistry between Dakota and Jamie. I am a die-hard romantic and I love the underlying romance story between the two. I was skeptical of both of them in the roles of Christian and Anna, but they EXCEEDED my expectations. I left the theater angry that the film ended:)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting film,"I kind of liked this movie. I watched thinking it was typical romance movie but became surprised. The way the secret lifestyle is presented is sympathetic and makes you feel conflict between the woman and man. Quite different from most movies.I don't know well about D&S relationship but perhaps many people experience a similar kind of position in their lives but we don't hear about it. This movie gives us a taste but it is not too gross.I also liked the beautiful filming and actors, and music, so for me it was fun to see this movie. I will recommend this movie to my friends because it is not so hard to watch and makes you think a little about how different anyone can be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 shades of gay,"For the past 20+ years I have watched one or two movies daily from various genres. I have watched some very low budget films that were pretty good, some blockbusters that were not as good as expected. Then I watched 50 shades. If this were a low budget, I'd say it was a good effort to make a mainstream film. The fact is that this movie costs 40 mil. to make, and I wonder, what on earth did they do with the money? They certainly didn't spent in on a skilled screenplay-writer, director or good actors.That being said, if you watch the movie with a set of mind with very low expectations and not taking this film too seriously, it can still be entertaining. The first hour or so I really did en effort to look beyond the 4/10 rating IMDb has given so far, and not having read the book I was kind of interested in were the movie was going to. Unfortunately, after that hour I completely lost interest and I couldn't care less about the superficial characters that looked so hallow and uncomfortable and made me want to slap them in the face with a chair.Near the end I had the feeling I was watching ""50 shades of parody"". It wasn't romantic, it wasn't dramatic, it was empty in every dimension. If you just wanted to see the movie because of the theme, I can advise ""Shame"" or ""Nymphomaniac"", but please don't waste your money on a movie like this.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"wooden Grey, bad dialog, contract talk","Mysterious billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) is going to be the commencement speaker at Washington State University. English lit student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) takes her sick roommate Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford)'s place to interview him for the school paper. He becomes completely taken with her.I had to bail on this movie after the first ten minutes. It's so flat that I couldn't take it. Jamie Dornan is an Abercrombie & Fitch model without the acting skills. Dakota Johnson is so fake mousy that it almost put me to sleep. I had to readjust my sensibilities to continue watching after a little break. The courtship is boring as hell. It has a passable rescue at a bar. Johnson has some comedic chops but she's playing with a blank partner. The dialog is laughably bad. However not everything is lost. There is some potential as the characters talk about submission.A real discussion about S&M could be sexy, edgy and compelling. Then the movie grinds down with contract talk. Nothing can be less compelling than a ten page agreement. All the edginess and sexiness go out the window. The sexual encounters have its fair share of nudity but it's not that shocking. It's simply boring. The final encounter does have a little more emotional content but that's too late to save this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointment In The End Of a Tremendous Build Up,"Being a box office hit means nothing. The book series is the main reason for this film's success as the movie itself offers nothing but so many nudity. The romance flick between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey is not at all well portrayed and if you have read the book you will be scratching your hair. The movie seems a rushed one as it mainly focuses on sex scenes rather than a romantic movie. The portraying of Christian Grey was good but same cannot be said for Anastasia Steele, even though Dakota Johnson offers the sexy side of Anastasia Steele. When we watch a movie, it has to look natural,feel natural , but in Fifty Shades of Grey many scenes appear very artificial which normal audiences won't go with.

"Wow, this movie is bad","So I watched this movie last night, and I felt the need to sign up to write a review, I have seen many movies so far in my short time on this earth, but let me just say, that this has to be in the ""bottom 10 movies of all time"" list.I had a fair idea what the movie was about, my wife really enjoyed the books and I went in with an open mind. The beginning of the movie is so rushed, so much happens in such a short time, and the relationship is catapulted from infancy to a much deeper relationship in a ridiculously short and very forced space of time.What I find even harder to comes to terms with are the characters, you are never made to feel any sort of connection with them, and they are hard to relate to. perhaps woman find themselves connected emotionally to Anastasia because of the whole ""average girl, average life, which takes a twist"" fantasy. But as a Man, I cant relate to a Wealthy, Conflicted, Dark entrepreneur with a BDSM fetish. But in the same breath, Grey is the only character in the movie with depth, and the only character anyone is really interested in.I am sorry to say but Anastasia is boring, no one really cares about her, I don't think? and if you do, why do you? she is average, with a normal boring life, she lacks substance, I don't want to get to know her, why would I?Overall the movie warms up, very, very slightly around half way through but soon takes is right back to the rather silly sexual relationship that, again, at risk of sounded like a stuck record, lacks substance.In conclusion, this movie is very hollow. The acting was questionable and the actors had no chemistry, and seemed to force a connection every time required.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
I liked it but not loved it.,"Well I came in with no high expectations, I did know that the author had her hands in the direction of the movie. However it is obvious it was compressed due to time constraints. I enjoyed the movie as a fan of the books however I can see someone watching it who has not read the books be left out wondering what they just watched. I enjoyed the dialog between Ana and Christian, the acting overall was pretty good. The sex scenes were pretty tamed compared to a typical book fans imagination. My biggest complaint overall is that they left out key character development moments and I hope they will release an uncut version to rectify this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved it!,"I was a little hesitant when I decided to go watch the movie, since in my opinion most movies made from books lack a lot of scenes that are originally in the book. Jamie and Dakota have a palpable connection, despite other negative reviews (another reason why I was doubting this movie), cinematography was great, and over all this movie was if not completely then very close to what I was expecting after reading the books. Right after leaving the movie theater I wanted to go back and watch it again, it leaves you wanting to know more about Christian Grey, even when you've already read the books. I'm looking forward to the next one and I recommend you watch this one and don't listen to all the negative reviews. I loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A two hour trailer,"I have never seen such a lifeless, underwritten script make it to the screen, let alone with such a budget. A slow build up, I was expecting, but where was the suspense? This is a story about sex and yet there was no obvious reason why they would have sex. It was all mechanistic tease, no enjoyment, no orgasms. When Christian finally gets Anastasia in his Playroom he doesn't seem to enjoy himself anymore than when they did it 'vanilla' style. There could have been so much more detail here, so much more characterisation - we can assume that Gray can only orgasm in a bondage situation, but where was the evidence? Think of 'Some Like it Hot', with Tony Curtis feigning lack of interest while Marilyn Monroe lies on top of him - and that was a far sexier film. I like this director's work - her film about John Lennon was funny and poignant - but this script was almost unfilmable. The depressing thought is, and this evidence proves it, that box office failure was inconceivable, however bad the end result. Dakota Johnson does her best and brings some humour and vulnerability to the role, and manages to make the abrupt changes of mind (mostly) believable, despite minimal support from the dialogue. But Jamie Dornan is just pleasant, a nice looking boy like you might find waiting at your table in a Dublin restaurant. Totally miscast, too young, merely eye candy. (Reminded me of George Lazenby in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. But that was a movie with a *story*.) Meanwhile, if you want the eye candy then there's plenty of pics of Mr Dornan available on the web in various stages of undress. There's plenty of pics, and indeed films, where you can see people having sex and giving a damn sight better impression of enjoying it. Save your money. Please.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poor,"Let me start by saying that I've never read the books, my girlfriend has and I haven't seen her so excited to see a movie for a long time, so I went along with her to see it with an open mind.Put simply, it's a poor film. Poorly written with some really poor acting. The two lead characters are wooden with no real chemistry, I'd guess they were working within the confines of a pretty poor script so I'll let them and the director off a little, but this was still reminiscent of a low- budget B movie.It's beyond my understanding what people can see in this movie, maybe the book was better, maybe not, I'll never know... Unless all the women I know secretly want to be tied up and flogged I don't get the attraction or the point of the film.My guess is that even the people who are genuinely into BDSM are going to think this film is a terrible reflection of their way of life, the feminists will be jumping all over it (Although, in my opinion, there's nothing in it that's degrading to women. To each his/her own, if 2 consenting adults want to experiment, what right does anyone have to judge them?), the poor blokes who got dragged along to see it are going to slate it (me...) but the hundreds of thousands of fan-girls/women will still flock to see it in droves and ensure that the film makes a ton of money, the sequels get made and Valentines day gets ruined for another couple of years.Having said all that, my girlfriend enjoyed it, so each to their own I guess.For me the only reason it gets 2 stars is for the soundtrack, which was excellent.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you didn't read the book, don't see this film","I'd like to start by saying that Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson did a fabulous job portraying Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. I have read the first book (Yes, straight guys do read erotic dramas) and I must say that their portrayals were dead on with the characters that I envisioned in my head as I was reading.As far as the film goes, as much as it pains me to say this, this was a terrible adaptation which didn't do the book justice! Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel ought to be dragged out into the street and shot!!!! What kills me is that the film had a lot of potential with the sexy lineup of actors and top notch set designs and IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!!!!!My bone of contention with the entire film is the fact that it sort of jumped into the story with both feet in, opposed to there being any sort of build up. There is no introduction to the characters and very little plot. The opening sequences of the film is missing at least a half hours worth of detail and character intros crucial to any good film. It's as if the writer who obviously has read the book felt that since she was already knowledgeable about the extensive foreplay in the early chapters of the book, that was grounds for her to omit large portions of the story and kind of just jump to conclusions. Not taking into account that over half of the film's audience has never read one of the books, let alone all three! If I hadn't read the first book prior to seeing the movie I would have been completely dumbfounded and bewildered by the entire thing, which explains its resounding disapproval!There is no reason why 15 minutes into the film, Christian has already taken Anastasia to breakfast and told her that he isn't the man for her when it seems that they have just met! There is also no reason why 25 minutes into the film they have already F *CKED each other three ways from Sunday, and we still don't have a good feel of the identities of each character.The entire film has gaping holes in it, that can only be filled if you read the book and know what really happened! There are amazing sexual scenes, most notably the bathroom scene, and other great scenes that were either completely omitted or severely condensed and censored (THE BATHROOM SCENE). All in all, Great Book, Phenomenal Cast, but terrible directors and writers!THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CENTURY, I can only hope that the next two films clean up this mess that dares to bear the same name as the greatest erotic novel of all time!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I'm a guy who had zero desire to see this movie, but I'll be honest.","First off, I've never reviewed anything on here as far as I can recall but to give you a little insight on my tastes and the general level of quality I view, It's rare I watch anything below a solid 7 on here. I'm the typical TV-Drama kind of person who likes Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Homeland, True Detective, Game of Thrones, etc... in other words not the person who wants to watch Fifty Shades of Grey.Now that we got that out of the way, I was asked to see this with my Fiancé for Valentine's Day and while I put up a fight about it for a while I realize I can sacrifice 2 hours for her on that day -- At least we had a nice Dinner beforehand.I'm going out on a limb here and giving it a 5/10 though... a 1/10 seems just too predictable for a bad review and almost comes off as trolling to me. Don't get me wrong, I did NOT like this movie and have no desire to ever watch it again but I'll try and stay within the realm of honesty here.---1. I was uncomfortable seeing this in a theater filled to a sold-out crowd of strangers, luckily we got one of those 'couples' seats which had no other seats next to us and that helped me out a bit -- I went into this knowing it would be awkward watching this content with someone I've never met on one side of me and everywhere else... Crisis averted.2. The two main characters didn't really bother me like some reviewers are saying, I wasn't a big fan of them or their acting but it didn't seem much different than any other average movie and I think some people are being a hair overly critical of this. They're both attractive people as well, she's got nice eyes that's what I noticed most of the time.3. I could appreciate some of the Cinematography... because I am into this stuff as a creative person myself, the shot of them reviewing 'the contract' in the office during sunset was visually pleasing to me for example... there was some decent camera work, set design and so on in that department but most any movie these days has a little.4. The movie was far less ""Rapey"" than I was expecting, yeah at the very end of the movie was literally the only spot I ever felt like it really became somewhat 'abusive' throughout the entire thing it was tame and both parties seemed on board with everything going on... I think this was wildly blown out of proportion by social media and the reviews I have read. I am guessing that the 2 subsequent stories and/or movies may get worse I have never read any of them and have no desire to.From an 'abuse' standpoint this is really mild and not anything the level I was expecting from comments on Facebook and the general hype based criticism following the story/film. I feel like I am defending the story or film here which is not the case I am just trying to be reasonable and honest here, there are either a TON of overly sensitive pussies out there or I'm missing something.5. The Sex scenes were decent, totally soft-core but I've always thought the whole being bound thing was hot way before anyone ever thought of this book or movie. Nothing felt ""rapey"" again like I said earlier, the only abusive thing was the very end of the movie otherwise she enjoyed everything she got. I know the whole BDSM community is offended by this story/movie, whatever as well -- I don't think it's really so terrible enough to get in a tizzy about it but I think they're just more annoyed by all the 'newbies' thinking this is what it's all about.6... The best thing about the movie was all the idiotic women giggling over the obvious carryovers from the book, certain lines or reactions and even some of the sex scenes had giggles coming from everywhere and uncomfortable dudes pretending to yawn... I know how that works guys, you weren't yawning you were uncomfortable.I'm going to end this right here, it's the most poorly executed and written review because I haven't proof read anything and just word vomited... but hey, it's Honest.I feel like I should relinquish my man-card by giving it a 5/10 and not 1/10 like all the other cool people but what the hell... I'll just go back to my quality viewing habits and everything will be just fine.Fin.",,Anonymous,Romance
It's very INTENSE but definitely FABULOUS!,"The film adaptation of E.L. James' best selling novel is a story about a college student Anastasia Steele being blown into the world of Seattle's billionaire Christian Grey. A world that is so beyond her innocent mind. Also, it has turned into a life changing experience for her especially after meeting him for an interview.From the very beginning, I just knew that the movie is really going to be ""Intense"" and ""Awkward"". But in the end, I did not prepared myself to be so shocked by it; even though that I've read the book for like thrice already! Its beautifully made, and I salute the film's director Sam Taylor-Johnson for giving light into the story without making it too hard for its viewers. Giving its viewers a chance to really focused into the love story itself, and not the sex part. Though it cannot be avoided, but still, she made it in a sensual kind of way. And if you've read the book, it is quite obvious that it was much more detailed and shocking than the film adaptation.For someone who've read it, I really like the idea that the flow of the story in every scene in the film was just the way it was described in the novel. Even if there were some scenes that were cut, and altered just so that it could fit into the time frame of 125 minutes of running time. And as I keep on saying, it's a movie. What you see is what you get. But if you've read the book first, then watch the film adaptation. It's when that you'll understand each character, and the story itself; their feelings, emotions, and what really goes into their minds. Then again, the flow of the story will never be put into detail in the film. A visual story that will just go along the actors acting.As for the two main characters, Dakota Johnson really did blew me away. For she is definitely Anastasia Steele; she really is that awkward, innocent, clumsy, and smart girl in the novel. I mean, I just love the way she presents herself as a simple girl. Plus, her lines and actions just makes everything more hilarious. And then there's Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey. Now that is something that I would really like to write about. Honestly, I just can't find his whole persona as the character itself. Although there are times that he is Christian Grey, and then in some scenes, he is not! But I can see why they have chosen him is the lead actor. Jamie Dornan has this mysterious and unpredictable personality which is very important in the story. For it's not about Christian Grey being way too handsome. He should be portrayed by an actor who can really go deeper into the painful and darker world of Christian Grey. And that's where Jamie has fit the bill.Then there's the supporting casts. Every actor and actress in the movie really did well in portraying their roles. Especially for Eloise Mumford. For she really did well in acting out Kate Kavanagh. But I just don't get it why Rita Ora is Mia Grey! I mean seriously? She doesn't look anything like her! I just don't know what these producers were thinking when she passed the audition. Also, it was kinda sad that there were four characters that were not included in the movie. Hopefully they will be included in the sequel.For those of you who didn't know, there were about 14 songs (including the instrumentals) that were mentioned in the book. But only 6 of these made it into the film adaptation. As for ""Crazy in Love"" and ""I've put a spell on you"", these songs were mentioned in the book two.Lastly, I would like to point out. That if I were someone who haven't read the book at all. Only knowing about the plot story itself. I don't think that I would have enjoyed the film. For it's way too straight to the point. The important details that should have been there were left out. Only those who've really read it will know what I'm really talking about. Moreover, my main focused when I was watching the film was to get into the visual love story of Christian and Ana. And not the sex scenes. So if that's what the other viewers were really rooting for. Then they are missing the whole point. I'm just glad the they did not include that very disturbing ""Tampon Scene"". For it would have been insanely disgusting. All in all it was fabulous. And I' am definitely looking forward to the film adaptations of ""Fifty Shades Darker"" and ""Fifty Shades Freed"". Laters Baby!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

0 shades of entertainment,"So , first things first , i was not going to watch this movie. I had no plans at all. People told me that the book had some pathetic writing ( understandable since it's a twilight fan fiction ) and i didn't bother much about the movie too. But it was close to the release date when a lot people around me were super excited about the movie and couldn't stop about how good this movie was going to be , which is when i changed my mind , and boy , it was a really bad decision.First of , this is an ambitious project with little to no context trying to build up a story arc and cash in some money from the fans of the book and i guess the only thing that helps the movie stand on it's feet is Dakota playing the lead as Anastasia Steele who is a student of literature trying to get a few stories and roundabouts of famous personalities. There are specific reasons why the movie has got a very bad rating from me and I will also explain why it has received any rating at all .1 ) Story :- Now the movie's plot is kiddish and mediocre. If you thought Jupiter Ascending was a linear plot wait till you get a load of this. The story revolves around a literature student Anastasia Steele who gets a golden opportunity to interview a millionaire business tycoon Christian Grey, all because her friend ( who was supposed to do the interview ) fell sick, such convenience. So the plot continued , giving exposition on it's way , spelling out Christian's life piece by piece , telling us about his character which gradually evolves into a rude and self obsessed sex addict who wants to play a dominant role during his sex play. The movie is a perfect "" how to make cliché "" book. The plot is extremely linear as it progresses and i must say the director had the courage to give a stupid cliffhanger at the end of the movie teasing a potential sequel in the near future. And as you watch the movie you can easily draw the similarities between this story and that of twilight. Nearly every character in this universe can be associated with the Twilight one. Christian with Edward , Anastasia with Bella and there are lot of parts in the movie which seem like it's completely ripped off from twilight. ( which is a bad thing )2 )Casting and Characters :- Casting in this movie is bad , downright stupid. The only character i guess who stands out in the whole movie is Anastasia ,who is played brilliantly by Dakota. Dakota's acting is perfect and she does her best to portray herself as a dynamics et piece in this rather dumb plot. It can be clearly witnessed how Dakota's performance though good didn't flesh out well as the character she was playing was shallow and had absolutely no proper introduction, depth of realization or even a subtle back-story or motive. On the other hand is the man of the movie Christian Grey played by Jamie Dornan, who manages to single handedly bring Dakota's performance down to the ground. Let me be serious about this fact here. This movie is about relationships , and if you expect any kind of chemistry between them you would be surprised to see none here. Christian tries to be dominant and acts the way the script tells him to making him look like he is forced to act out the actions he does. His character is more of a burden for a viewer over the already burdened plot. There is absolutely no connection between the two characters and the couple didn't resonate their vibe perfectly the way the audience would have expected. On a whole Dakota yes, others , hell no.3 ) Direction :- To be frank I had absolutely no clue about the director of this movie Sam Taylor Johnson. I haven't watched any of her previous projects nor have I heard of her works. And for the very first viewing of her film , I can say with complete assurance that she has her own artistic angle to her direction making nearly every shot as vibrant as possible. Every single scene of this movie ( though named fifty shades of Grey ) was vibrant in every aspect. Colours were overflowing on the screen with lighting captured perfectly with a subtle touch of minimized lens flares. Sam Taylor has the ability and talent I can say to create beautifully shot moments in a movie but can fail terribly to create an atmosphere suitable for the characters to evolve and grow with the plot. One of the best examples of other talented but snubbed directors i can give is Steven Shainberg who directed the movie secretary. It had more or less the same plot as this but the direction allowed the characters to grow on the audience making them understand and feel for them.On a whole Fifty Shades Of Grey is nowhere close to the hype it was building up. The story is mediocre and cliché in many levels with blunt protagonist Christian Grey, and a relationship that feels forced with no context from both ends. There are only 3 reasons according to me why one should watch this movie.a ) Dakota's performanceb) Recognition of the director Sam Taylor Johnson who has the ability and talent subdued by this moviec ) Some sleep",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

A roller-coaster ride,"As a movie that has been hyped in all different ways - BDSM encouraging, feminist offender, female-freedom inspiring - we can say it surpasses all expectations. And that's not much.Inspired by the novel by E. L. James (which has been called sophomoric and amateur), the page-to-screen transition has been done successfully. Even if you can feel the exact lines taken from the book sounding cheesy among the speech adaptations, all the worst lines are gone, but you can find lots of Christian's I-can-play-the- piano moments.The movie goes fast-then-slow, paced strangely between little gags and seriously-taken moments. It never stops, though.Dakota Johnson steals the movie for most of the time. Her performance is so builded-up as the movie goes that you can actually feel the journey she's going through. Jamie Dornan, as unfittable as he might have looked in the previews, ""is"" Mr. Grey. His shadowy behavior and self-trust is perfect.Luke Grimes, Rita Ora, Eloise Mumford, all fitting their roles. José, though, seems too forced. Supporting roles are reduced to a minimum, making the whole movie feel like an intimate observation of their relationship.Sam Taylor-Wood seems to have done her best with the source material (even with the original author limitations on her work). It's a rare situation when the film surpasses the book by miles. She knows almost exactly when to play funny and when to go hard. Cinematography is top-notch, even if the aerial shots look reminiscent of Twilight.It's a beautiful movie that tries to go deep, steps back and then ends abruptly just when you wanted more.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Terrible, terrible film.",This film isn't sexy or risky. They have taken an R rated book and turned it into a M15 lifeless exercise in boredom.There is zero chemistry between the two main characters The sex scenes are so tame that it leaves little point to the rest of the story as it was very thin to begin with.Because of the M15 rating rather than R as it should have been it means that all the sex scenes have really choppy editing as they couldn't show any full frontal nudity. It also meant that when there is spanking done they can't actually show her being hit.Please don't make the next two books into films as I really don't want to have my next two valentines day evenings wasted with drivel like this.,2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Professionalism at its best.,"I can't help agree on some points with the other critics about some of the acting being lousy but I don't think that it is fair for them giving such a harsh review. I mean there may be a lot scenes that have not been shown to the general public as well as scenes which have not been portrayed from the book but if you would just consider the tremendous effort that the actors have given, it was all worth it.I actually appreciate that they cut most of those sexy scenes to focus more on the story because people should understand that there is more to this movie/story than the BDSM sexual relationship.All in all I am in total awe with the actors with their courage on taking up the lead roles and I am looking forward towards the second installment.

great love story,"Life is not a true and a false,yet this film could be someones reality so just be an open minded and You will have a great journey through the movie. The criticism is something that in a real life means that You had some experience and You felt something. So this is a good sign if someone is describing that it is not so good movie. Just read all the books too and You will realize that the movie is a piece of something you needed in Your everyday life. Drama gives us a little time to remind ourselves that life could surprise us too.

I can change him!,"I saw it last night and I did not like it but not for the reason I was expecting. The film has a technical story telling issue in that is has no ending whatsoever, but what bothered me is much deeper than that.When I took my wife to see this I thought I would get an inside glimpse into the secret fantasies of middle-aged women. I thought the popularity of this story was an admission that women secretly want to be dominated. What I found out was the true fantasy of women is to annoy a man into changing, and that fantasy is the main appeal of this story.The male character in this movie I actually somewhat respected for the first half of the film, he was very clear and direct about what he wanted, so clear that he put it in writing. The female character would constantly follow the same pattern of agreeing to what he wants then complaining about it until he changes. The entire film is simply watching this pattern on repeat until the story ends with no conclusion.For those wanting insight into the female psyche I would avoid this movie, I don't think you will like what you find.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
An honest review (from a male perspective),"Now, some disclaimers. I am not one of the people who give movies a 1 that I don't like, or a 10 for ones I like. I have rated very few movies as a 10. And none as a one (in fact, I think this is my lowest rating ever) That being said, I am not the target demographic for this movie but my girlfriend wanted to see it. She enjoyed the book, but isn't a huge fanatical fan about it. So well, we went and saw the movie and even she agrees that it was a piece of junk.First off, it completely ridicules the BDSM culture. I'm not a ""member"" per ce, except for some light handcuffs and spanking stuff, but I do know enough from having friends involved in the culture that this film is basically to the BDSM community what tons of other movies have portrayed gays, lesbians, blacks, insert stereotype here in a negative light. It was astoundingly insulting (and in the FAQ here, the reason is answered quite thoroughly) Second, the acting was atrocious. The actors made Keanu Reeves look like an Oscar winner. The script, from what my girl said, was fairly faithful to the book (which I don't know what says it better: that this book is that terrible that the film was faithful, or that the film was faithful to a terrible book?"" Third, the pacing , directing, and overall whole movie had the feel of a high school production. There was not a single moment where I had any personal investment into any of the characters and due to the wooden acting I really didn't care about anything that was happening. In short, I watched it and the entire time I just waited for the end.I cannot believe this movie pulled in 400 million world wide and is still going semi strong. And as I said above, I'm not the target demographic for this movie, being a 40 year old male. However, my girlfriend hated the movie even more than I did (and she's right in the target age group).Overall, don't waste your time. I give it 3 stars generously. Really, it is a terrible movie. I might actually read the book just to see the comparison, but if like my girlfriend said it is pretty similar to the movie, I don't know if I want to waste my time twice.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Here are a few things you could do instead of seeing this film: 1) donate the money you would spend on seeing it to a womens shelter 2) read a classic novel which has well written characters and relationships 3) actually educate yourself on BDSM - the film does not at all acknowledge how true BDSM relationships work 4) see also: educating on the signs of domestic violence 5) make sure this is not another film you romanticise 6) save money, don't endorse this film",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

They might want a BDSM relationship, which is okay, bu they might think this is a safe relationship. They could not know well enough and might get tricked into an abusive relationship.

Worst Adaptation - Lame Christian - Very Good Ana,"OK, the book's writing was poor but the story was good, and it did have its erotic moments. However, the script was the absolute worst part of the film - it was AWFUL. There was poor story development with horrible pacing in script and direction. I was not a fan of Dakota Johnson's casting as Ana, but she was very good. The emotions that moved across her face were exactly as I had pictured Anastasia. Jamie Dornan was as sexy as a dry stick of wood. This was horrible casting for Christian. He did not have any chemistry with Dakota, and I can't imagine chemistry with anyone. I did expect the sex scenes to be somewhat erotic. They were not; I felt that they were mechanical, almost with no context. If the sequels are being made, Christian needs to be recast and a real writer found. I didn't expect much from this film and was not disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well executed but drags on a touch,"It's common knowledge American audiences aren't particularly comfortable with explicit sexuality in film. Look at Martin Scorsese's unbelievably brilliant 'The Wolf of Wall Street', all anyone could talk about was how much graphic sex there was throughout - completing overshadowing the masterpiece of a film itself. So I don't envy the filmmakers charged with the task of bringing the infamous '50 Shades of Grey' to the big screen. If they went too far with it people were going to be offended and if they didn't go far enough the fans would be let down. Keeping all this in mind I think they did a pretty good job.You'd have to have had your head pretty firmly under a rock not to have heard anything about the rigorous casting process that went on to find the two leads for this film. You'd hope with the amount of thought and effort that seemed to go into it they would have made some good decisions. I'm pleased to say they did. Dakota Johnson particularly impressed me. She especially nailed the early scenes where the character of Anastasia Steele is still shy and awkward. Her transformation through the movie was well acted and believable. A very impressive performance. Jamie Dornan was not the first choice for the role of Christian Grey, and I have to admit that before going into the film and based entirely on looks, I wasn't entirely convinced. Any doubts I had though were erased pretty quickly and he encompassed the role very well. He found the perfect balance between charm and having a dark side that the audience wants to know more about.125 minutes run time is pushing it a little for my liking because all the extra 20-30 succeed in doing is to frustrate the audience that we've already seen the extent of what they're willing to show us. It could never be said that this film pushed the envelope - if anything it certainly leans further towards the safe side. Having said that, had the film pushed any harder people would most likely have simply dismissed it as pornography. As previously mentioned I don't envy the decision makers in this instance. The actors sell it though and make the two hours very watchable. It also contains an interesting ending that I'd imagine wasn't an easy sell to the studio.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fifty Shades of Grey,"If you liked the books, you will love the movie. Between the director bringing to life, Christian's Offices and Apartment, everything was just as E.L. James had described.

Dakota Johnson brought Ana to life with the innocence of the character and her awe/love of Christian.Due to the subject matter, I doubt there will be Oscars for these people. However after seeing the performances, with the right academy type roles, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson both have the depth and presence that I could see either of them receiving an Oscar in the near future.Parents, this is not a children's movie.

Just like the book.,"This movie was very true to the book which in my opinion was its downfall. The tried a little hard to make everything around Mr. Grey sexy. Jamie seemed out of touch with his character while Dakota took on her character very well. The dialogue in the book is some what corny and the movie the dialogue was basically word for word. This unintentionally made the movie somewhat comical. Nonetheless, The sex scenes were good. Dakota played a great Anna Steele. Jamie got progressively better throughout the movie.

Even  nuns would approve this lukewarm potboiler.,"""My inner goddess is dancing the merengue."" Anastasia Grey from the novel, Fifty Shades of GreyYou're approaching this filmed version of the wildly successful sex novel Fifty Shades of Grey in the right way if you think that quote is sophomoric, typical of a naïve English major stepping out into life. It is a silly statement, and the heroine of the film, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), is less naïve than she is a thrill seeker.Fifty Shades of Grey is a torture of unfulfilled curiosity about S-M, for the heat is low on the chili pepper. Although Steele's exposed breasts supposedly lead to greater erotica, they rather are the limits of exposure and the wrong signs of sensuality, which should emanate anyway from words, not just flesh.The purveyor of the sexual fantasy, the dominant Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), is a sadly repressed, secret misogynist, whose introduction of Ana to the pleasures of his red room (handcuffs, whips, et al.—the usual but just more finely turned out) turns out to be an exploration of low-level power plays rather than a turn on. In fact, her role as submissive eventually turning dominant is never fully explored here, just hinted at, but enough of the hints, please: She's a power bottom; I can feel it even if I can't see it.Mr. Dornan may be the problem, or perhaps director Sam Taylor-Johnson is, because the actor is a much better model than actor. At the least, he needs to have depths that can be explored, but here he seems cyber-like stoic. When he says, ""I don't do romance. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn't understand,"" the hidden promise that he is complicated and ultimately lovable never reaches the audience.In other words, although it takes quite a bit of bad sex to bore me, this antiseptic delivery of pleasure is just that, or just what you would have expected from boring Bella Swann of The Twilight tortures (Anastasia being based on Bella, I am told). Bella was boring, Ana is boring, and this film is boring. Yet in the cold light of analysis, Johnson is the best part of the film, a not particularly beautiful woman, all the better for us to identify with, and a semi-naif adventuring out without a map.To witness Ana panting from the first time she sees him in his perfectly tailored suit covering a perfectly sculpted body is to question immediately what kind of a Romantic she really is (or maybe I'm carrying my love for 19th-century sensibilities too far into the 21st). Again it could be the director calling for some over-the-top acting.Hundreds of years ago, Geoffrey Chaucer included a story in his Canterbury tales that explained what women really want—mastery over men. Now that's telling it like it is, and I suspect this tale, which goes into three novels, will end up the same way. The film is only a disappointing beginning.But getting anywhere meaningful through flabby porn is too slow and stupid, even for a broken-down Catholic boy in whom the S-M-leaning nuns instilled a life-long interest in passionate sex only to discover it's not in films that promise to bare it all but rather hidden deep in the Cinderella story.Mother Mary, help us all in this dead-zone time of year, where good movies are much scarcer than good sex.",,Anonymous,Romance
50 shades of abuse,"This movie... is just awful. The books were awful already so I guess I couldn't really expect anything different. But this film is really just the romanticized version of rape. This has nothing to do with actual BDSM, it's abuse in its finest form. What this movie does is pretty much encourage rape as well as tell guys that no doesn't necessarily mean no and could really just mean yes. I just hope that no couples went to see this movie to ""try out something new"" in the bedroom. Always remember that you need CONSENT!!

Fifty Shades of Wood Crap,"Fifty Shades of grey is a genius book written by E.L James who was a fan of the horrible written ""Twilight"" series. She wrote the book in the same format just like Twilight and now we have our story. This movie is just the same as twilight with the dialogue and plot a love triangle with more hard core sex and whip's and chains that will make Catwoman look like child's play. This concerns me about society it's almost like we have become so dumb. Now let me start off with this the movie does have so hard core porn nudity in it but it doesn't pay off with character's. The main actress is actually fine but its like she never goes anywhere as a person and becomes just like every stupid woman who needs a man in her life to save her from something. I would have been fine with the film if they didn't do that. How many times must you go to a film and you have a woman acting stupid and always needing a man. It was so cliché and Mr. Grey is very stiff and wooden (pun intended) as a character. This movie is so bad that its funny and kind of sad that as a society we have just gotten dumb. Now the BDSM part was actually fun to me because its fresh for the audiences today who act like they don't do that kind of stuff at home. It was just the fact that the movie gave Ms. Steel no arch she didn't become strong. I would have believed it more if she became more like him and being more into S&M and liked it and felt free and didn't depend on a rich man to save the day. Its just stupid and it makes you think how most people get around in the world and how to make money. Just do what ever a rich man says. Or like the writer of this book did. Copy from another shi*y book and make more money then you could ever imagine. It's no creativity in this society. I'm done, if you want to go see this movie fine but you might as well just watch so hard core porn because the sex scenes don't even pay off",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

So i had little hopes for the movie, and well it didn't disappoint. Acting...woeful. Dakota really? Terrible acting, really really terrible script, but i suppose the script is no worse than the actual book. All i can say is this...if the book was written by a man, it would never have been published, let alone successful. Why women get off on the story of a wealthy successful man using his wealth and power to coerce a young innocent woman to become his slave, using her merely as a sex object just amazes me. I'm a man, and this story puts women's liberation back fifty years. Why women find it alluring that a man uses a woman as a sex object i just cannot imagine. And to make it all worse, the script and the writing quality of both the book and script is so poor, so amateurish it is actually quite embarrassing.

Specifically Made for Specific People!,"A Sensuous Erotica, that prevails on refined execution that explicitly delivers what it was supposed to. A fresh addition into Romance/Drama genre; that sparked lots of Controversies and polarized opinions.
Mainly due to its naked nature in the portrayal of passion and sexual pleasures that has been duly debated all over the community. Barring the hatred, one cannot simply ignore the Polished cinematography and sound design that has been provided. The sets, the ambience, the tonality hit the right note in every frame. Moreover the performances by the main two leads, added the professional touch to it.
Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Gray shined well.
It takes a lot of courage and a bit of sincerity to say yes to such provocative yet challenging roles. Some credit should go to the director herself as well!
Sam Taylor-Johnson, did a phenomenal job in her own right. She managed to handle all the nuances regarding the above mentioned characters and carefully crafted the odd but sparkling relationship between them. Alas! The same cannot be said about the other roles. Drifting away from the norm, In this abyss of luscious journey; In the hindsight of passion and intense love; the deeper prospects are not profoundly addressed; but a subdued approach is followed. The subtlety sometimes dragged the screenplay a tad bit though. The sensual scenes, the erotic moments; never seemed vulgar. Although the BDSM aspects at times felt borderline abusive. But it depends on an individual's perspective too. As someone might find it pleasurable; others may find it offensive and far away from a rational thing.
The distinctive viewpoints are obvious, But to consider it as a trash is far fetched and nothing but an intentional ignorance. Sexual likings and All these sensitive stuffs are always borderline controversial. These things can easily go awry oftentimes but that doesn't mean it always needs to be under the microscope of criticism and sort of a plaything for the hateful audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A movie from a book written by a lonely woman who misses having sex and watches lots of porn. Remember when as a kid you stayed up just to see those shitty erotic movies from those shitty TV channels? That might give you an idea of what this is. The acting was really poor, zero chemistry, really forced faces and talking, awful accent by Jamie. Awkoward at times, really makes you want to leave. Well... maybe I went to far with that ""shitty erotic movie"" thing. This is actually worse, in those movies women are treated as... well, women. This movie shows Anastasia (Dakota) as a sex toy with long hair and beautiful eyes being abused in many ways. Some years before this would've make the director go to prison... or at least it would've made the same middle-aged women that now call this ""art"" being REALLY mad. This movie has nothing to sustain from, there's no ethical/philosophical theme brought to the table, just two people having sex, he abuses her, she tries to make him change with her ""love"". Really boring overused stuff.It doesn't get deeper than that. I really want to say something good about it, but I just can't, even the music was poor.

Movie was just like the book. And YES I am a guy!,"Well, I read all three books. The first two book is kinda filled with lots of steamy stuff but third book is more interesting.

""It's not like the book...blah blah...Oh, its like the book. No new material..."" But I say, this is not everyone's cup of tea. I like it because it has sensuality. People think this movie promotes violence. I don't see any violence in here and neither does my fiancé. These are acts of two adult, consenting to perform BDSM.

More M&S than S&M,"One must try - and inevitably fail - not to adopt a patronising tone when reviewing FIFTY SHADES The novel, whose literary merit is neither here nor there (and certainly not there) - launched a new genre of its own - Porno Lite - and so, I fear, will the movie. I'm pretty sure bondage involves more than a few smacks on the bum and lots of kissing, which seems to be about as far as an 18 rating allowed Sam Taylor-Johnson to go.The movie's fatal flaw is the lack of chemistry between the two leads. They are acting out an attraction they clearly do not feel. Dakota Johnson tries to play it feisty and vulnerable but comes over as a bit bland. Jamie Dornan, who was glamorous and creepy as the serial killer tracked down by Gillian Anderson in THE FALL on BBCtv, is not glamorous enough here - and rather deficient in creepiness. Apart from his under- used dungeon playroom, even the furnishings in his billionaire bachelor pad (and his suits) look as if they came from the high street rather than high-end designers. The whole movie is - sorry about this - more M&S than S&M.If there is to be a screen sequel - FIFTY SHADES DARKER - I wonder, without much enthusiasm, if some of the contraptions briefly glimpsed in Christian's chamber of horrors will be brought into play.

Fifty Shades of Nothing Happens,"I really don't get the hype. The anti-rape/BDSM-butt-hurt floating around the media hype of this movie is absolutely ridiculous.The movie floats mostly around the theme of consent. It is actually a fairly decent, albeit far-fetched, interpretation of what BDSM can be or mean to people. Did people see Rocky and say ""This is a terrible representation of what boxing is."" Probably. And they were cast aside. See The Green Mile and say ""This is not what death row is like."" Probably. And it's one of the best movies of all time.That's actually what's disappointing about this movie (and the book, too, really) is that it could have been so much more. A seemingly taboo theme gets loads of attention; but it's so incredibly awfully made that no one particularly cares.The movie comes off as a soap opera, an episode of The Bachelor, and an excruciatingly soft (read here: barely explicit) porno all in one.While folks joked that they wouldn't be able to hear the movie over the din of vibrators; the loudest thing in the auditorium was actually countless men snoring, having been dragged along by their dangerously unfulfilled wives.I'm afraid it did not receive a rose.

This movie deserves more than 3.3 rating...,"This is the first time I felt like writing a movie review, as I just watched this movie today and thought it deserves more than 3.3.First of all, I read all three books.

In fact, I can't even remember when was the last time I felt strongly about having to watch a movie on its first day of release.Secondly, the movie is pretty true to the book, and I am glad the director Sam Taylor-Johnson didn't make it like a porn movie but rather an artsy one. Dakota Johnson did a fabulous job. After watching this movie, I'm sure everyone will agree that she's really Anastasia Steele coming out from the book. I look forward to seeing her career taking off from here. As for Jamie Dornan, he's doing a pretty good job too. But the thing is, I don't think anyone can really portray Christian Grey. It's not just his look, but also his strong characters, i.e. intense and intimidating, but in the meantime...desirable. So I think it's fair to say that Jamie Dornan has done the best he could, and I enjoyed watching his performance. I also want to mention that Eloise Mumford as Kate Kavanagh is a scene stealer. She left a strong presence every time she was on the screen.Finally, Beyoncé's song ""Crazy in love"" went really well with the red room play...Overall, I think the movie deserves much better than 3.3...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Book way better,"The acting is awful, there's not chemistry between Dakota and Jamie, they look like they'r trying too hard to act. There's a lot of scenes on the book that they didn't put on the movie so that's why for me the movie is kinda boring and not as sexual as it needs to be, the movie isn't THAT sexual how everyone was saying, it has sex scenes just like a lot of movies that we have seen, nothing special so i'm disappointed. I would not say that i wasted my money but i would recommend to read the book and imagine your own scene that would be so much better than the movie. And of course the movie is so overrated by the public in general",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Several Shades of Grey,"I haven't read the books, but I had read a lot of the reviews before going to see this with my wife, so I could give myself a head start on what to expect. I found that a lot of the reviews were actually really unfair and based on a pre-conceived idea of whether the film would be good or bad - which is no way to review a movie. Open your eyes and be honest with yourself about how it made you feel, not what the media hype and controversy says! So, with an open mind I watched. I was entertained in parts, intrigued in others, and disappointed in a number of places. The main problem for me (having not read the books) is that there are too many questions/things that didn't add up, which made it frustrating to watch, and there were some parts of the movie where I was starting to get a bit bored...The screenplay isn't great, but I hear the book isn't exactly a masterpiece, so that makes sense. That did limit some of the acting in parts, but on the whole the character portrayals from the key names were superb. I 100% bought into the character of Christian Grey because Jamie Dornan made him believable, genuine, and intriguing - he is clearly a very deep character with many layers that unfortunately weren't explored enough (not his fault). I was less convinced with Dakota Johnson's character, mainly because she spent more time biting her lip than doing anything useful - but I understand the reasons why. The problem with her wasn't the acting, but again the character didn't have enough background to convince me - her behaviour confused me because I think key details about why she thinks/feels the way she does weren't explored.The contract scene was fantastic - it was slick, smart, well acted, and by far the best scene in the movie. The sex scenes weren't bad, leaving just enough to the imagination, and not so over-acted that they seemed cheesy.The stand out piece for me was the soundtrack, which was moody, seductive, modern, and set the mood well for each scene.Overall, the film left me with too many questions, sure they might be answered by the sequels, but at this point there's just blank space. It definitely promoted healthy discussion, and some of the acting was impressive. Bottom line, it is far from a classic, but a guaranteed money maker (as opening weekend proved).",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Atrociously bad,"Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse.The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect.Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliché now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking ""That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of sh't makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away"". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought.Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell.Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a ass-hole and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back.The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad.Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I hated it, I hated it. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie didn't followed the books and they skipped lots of essential things. In the movie.. the action happened too fast.. one second Christian was visiting Ana at work and the next second they went for coffee?it was just too funny and i just felt awkward for them they shouldn't do a 2nd or 3rd part for their seek poor movie",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dark corridors of sexual euphemisms,"(Spoiler Alert: This Cesar Marciano review may contain details that certain readers would rather not know or realize right away.)In ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" every set is spic and span, rooms and corridors straight from the pages of Architectural Digest. Every piece of clothing is a fashion statement on casual coolness or formal impressiveness, as in Vogue or Esquire. Every rack or drawer whether in a hardware store or a dedicated sadist's ""playroom"" is in perfect order. One can be in awe over pieces of equipment that are clearly new and arranged impeccably, as if they're to be used for the first time.And so are the people in the most successfully marketed movies in recent years. The secretaries of billionaire Christian Grey look like they didn't have to go through an interview, though they were picked along stringent standards of elite model agencies or fashion reality shows. The supporting characters such as the parents have the perfect jobs and the right temperament, their exits and entrances carefully plotted and counted, their needs and desires clear-cut. Read that: mostly nonexistent.None of the supporting personae actually questions any other non-character's action, nor raises objection to anything, come to think of it. Everyone seems to be oblivious to the story's explosive central theme, namely dominance and submission in sexual relationships.Everyone except The Dedicated Dominant Master and His Reluctant Submissive Trainee, whose sole purpose is to dig, no matter how shallowly, into the minute details of what can be a potent aphrodisiac in sexual relationships but at the same time a psychological and moral Pandora's box.Its psychological strands can fill up a college textbook. The moral issues revolve around what is at its core a deeply religious set of questions: Do our bodies really belong to us? Is pleasure a sin? What role does sex play in the hierarchy of values?The model-agency handsome Dedicated Dominant Master is presumably a young woman's dream. He's got the money, a stable of sleek cars, a condo unit in every city he needs to be, and above all the time to engage in his singular passion. He's got not just her number but her exact geographical location on his mobile phone. So very badly does he need to extract a narcissistic sexual high from the model-agency-pretty college graduate that he plies her with costly treats, rewards and even concessions, insisting that she signs what seems to be a legally binding consent form.The Reluctant Submissive Trainee seems to be drawn to the training process and sample excitation sessions, but she's of two minds about the rules and consent form. Dressed up in ad agencies' mandatory designer suit, she negotiates The Sex Contract's details right in his headquarters' conference room, no holds barred, businessman-to-businesswoman, striking out several items that could be hair-raising for ordinary people like us but are really quite normal and delightful to ""The Dominant"" and ""The Submissive.""""Fifty Shades of Grey"" titillates with its tautly choreographed and intelligently edited scenes of initiation into the dark corridors of sexual euphemisms. Pain is pleasure, and pleasure pain. A low point in a person's life is the ""high"" of another. There are ""50 shades"" of playroom pleasures, a number of them bordering on violence and courting permanent physical damage. Also, the ""first time"" doesn't just apply to the still-a-virgin heroine but to many who have flocked to the theaters. The frisson of the ""first time"" -- ahhh this could be the key to this movie's wild success. Virgins are queuing up for tickets. Masters-wannabes are jotting down mental notes on how to train a slave. Dress rich. Act rich. Reward rich. And punish hard.Dakota Johnson's sensitive performance as Anastasia, infused with vulnerability, is enhanced by director Sam Taylor-Johnson's attempt, which works very well for the most part, to make a human out of an inflatable doll. To those involved with casting, model-agency handsome Jamie Dornan proves to be a good pick for the role of The Magnate With a Quirk That Tabloids Must Not Find Out. Dornan subversively exudes not the macho-ness expected perhaps of porn-flick studs but a sweetness of character that is the opposite of certified all- male.Dakota and Jamie's rewards may not be great in heaven, but in the film world, they certainly will be. In fact they already are. I've just been told that there will be a sequel.Ah, what the heck. It's only sex.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

...because there will always be negative critics,"After reading all three of E.L James's erotic novels, I fell more in love with the ""love story"" even more then the sexual encounters that the two characters experience throughout their journey. Needless to say, the movie encaptured just that!Leads Jamie Dornan, and Dakota Johnson were a terrific pairing for portraying Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. The novel very intricately describes Christian Grey as a brooding handsome billionaire entrepreneur who invests most of his time in his work and not being very social, having little to not many friends, just acquaintances. Having an obsession for S&M due to being victimized in his youth he knows nothing more, but comes to find love in the end. The same goes for Dakota Johnson's character of Anastasia Steele, whom unlike her devastatingly handsome co-star, has never been introduced to the dominant and submissive lifestyle and for that matter had never even experienced the touch of a mans hand. Always having her head in a book and living her life out as a college student day by day, her character is thoughtful, humorous and witty.For the women and men whom have read the novel and prepared to witness the on- screen attraction between these two characters, this is DEFINITELY a factor! These two co-stars seemed very much into each others characters as well as portraying their own with remarkable ease. To be able to bring the love story to life must have been (I am assuming) an easy task for director Sam-Taylor, due to the fact that she had chosen to fantastic leads! However, for an rated ""R"" film with more than a million in attendance from the novel alone, to grasp the extremities of the sexual encounters that these two characters experience must have been a task not so easy to portray on film. Between ""vaginal fisting"" and ""nipple clamps"" with much more detail in explaining these many sexual acts throughout the NOVEL, I'm sure bringing this to life on the BIG SCREEN must have been a challenge and would be for any director trying to capture that experience. For most women, we just want to feel loved in every way by a man, whether that means sexually and/or emotionally. I believe this film held its bargain to producing BOTH!There will always be those who want more out of a film, but being able to portray these acts on a movie screen would be much more like pornographic film than anything else, and I don't think that this was E.L James's intentions when she created the story! Yes, things do most DEFINITELY heat up a bit, but in the long run, the story that is unfolded is one of love as did the novel (if you have read these novels, you would know this). I do agree with some critics that they could have carried out more scenes from the novel on screen, however for a 2 hour film, capturing the essence of both the ""sex"" and the ""attractions between the two characters"" was perfection, classy and tasteful for being a film based off of an S&M novel.I am extremely happy with the way this film resembled the novel and am hoping that future critics will look more into the love story behind it rather than a film strictly all in response to sex and the acts of sex and nothing else, for this is not what the true readers know and adore about their 50 shades of Grey.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awkward movie,"This movie has motivated me to register at this web page. The movie is just nothing. There is no truly emotionally developing story in it or sexuality. I personally got annoyed and irritated by Anna's non stop biting lip and breasts. It feels like movie consisted of these two elements interleaved by some action. The scene of her ""first sex"" did not differ much from any other ""sex"" scene in the movie. And not like I am demanding porno, it would certainly possible to express the excitement and passion much better, even without constantly showing her boobs (which are not even that great). After this movie all I wanted is to visit Seattle.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Zero eroticism,"OK, let's be honest. Everyone who had read the book (myself included) knew that it wasn't the most amazing piece of literature. The story has been told a million times in all the possible versions, the only new thing and the reason it got so much attention, was the ""singularity"" of the sex scenes. Now, that was the book. When you move to the screen however, you know that it's not possible to reproduce the effect of the book- as most of the book consists of Anastasia's thoughts and feelings- and of course it wouldn't be possible to depict what is described in the book. So, what I expected to watch - after so much waiting and speculation about the cast- was at least chemistry and tension between Johnson and Dornan. But there wasn't such a thing. Not even the slightest amount of it. The first thirty minutes of the film I was waiting to see magic happen, well it didn't. The rest of the film I just felt uneasy- that's the only sentiment communicated by the actors. It is definitely not worth watching.The acting is indifferent and falls flat. The only element of the film that lived up to my expectations was the soundtrack other than that, I don't think that it even remotely deserves to be called a ""romantic"" drama.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre movie with huge income due to bad publicity,"This movie can be described as an over-advertised movie for a ""different"" idea but with poor execution. Acting is lazy, almost forcing you to hate it. The conversations between the 2 main characters are weak, don't build a relevant plot and fail to achieve a certain level of ""aw"". This movie has earned it's box office income based on the bad publicity people gave the book. Specially about the ""R-rated"" content.

50 Shades of Disappointment,"As an erotica fan, I find this movie insulting.Despite the book's literary shortcomings, the plot isn't that dreadful. However, in this movie the majority of the plot was abandoned. Having taken into account that producers would have to shorten the plot, they seem to have compressed it down by only, of course, using the 'saucy' parts. This may be what viewers have gone for, but the build up towards it has been taken out almost completely, which makes it hard to follow, and instantly makes the story less important and meaningful. It removes the romance and takes away what motive E. L. James decided to write the novel on.If I could've given this title 0/10 I would've. I guess the only thing I can offer with this one star is the soundtrack. Despite Elle Goulding's awful song.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can't wait for the out-takes...,"First I had to negotiate the Odeon Leicester Square's bizarre pricing policy (although the cinema's signage stated seats cost £16, the box office boy told me they were actually £17 - some sort of first week supplement, apparently. Fair enough, but update your signage to match, Odeon - false advertising is not good!) Then I could settle down to watch the most talked-about film of the year.The plot is largely Mills and Boon territory - student Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) interviews rich-yet-sexy businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for her university's newspaper. He is enigmatic, remote and mysterious; she naïve, virginal and innocent, so - as these things always go - they are instantly smitten with each other. Christian romances her with his smooth talk (""I won't touch you without your express written permission"" he says romantically) while Anastasia dithers about whether she wants to agree to his demands.The wrinkle in the plot is, as is well known, Christian's bedroom activities: he's a 'dominant', and wants Ana to be on the receiving end of his collection of ropes, handcuffs, whips (and dildos, mentioned but never shown - a bit like Dornan's flesh-and-blood one). But the sex scenes make little use of these utensils: indeed, by some standards they're relatively tame - if a little more frequent - than some material seen in films nowadays. The lack of a full-frontal shot from Dornan has been widely commented on, but I think it was the right decision: the mysterious and enigmatic Christian would seem a little less so if we saw everything he has to offer and, let's face it, many men don't look that impressive frontally naked unless they're erect - and Hollywood was never going to show *that*. Perhaps if the film had been made in the UK or Europe?Given the clichéd nature of the material, the acting is acceptable. Johnson (who looks very much like her father Don, lending an unexpected dimension to the close-up shots of her and Dornan kissing!) makes a likable and believable heroine, caught up in something completely new and perhaps disgusted that she finds it exciting. The Irish Dornan delivers a passable American accent (but why not hire an American actor?) and, with subtle twitches of the lips or soulful glances of his mis-sized eyes, conveys a bit more depth to the stereotyped romantic hero. Plus they both look very nice naked, although given director Sam Taylor-Johnson's liberal use of close-ups, it's not always possible to tell whether we're seeing Johnson and Dornan's bits or those belonging to the many stunt players listed in the cast list. The set-designers - not usually a group of people I think to praise - do well too, from Ana's cheerfully chaotic apartment, through Christian's expensive interior-designer-sterile apartment, to his red-themed rumpus room.Is the film worth seeing? Yes. It has more depth than the books' smutty reputation would suggest, and I am sufficiently interested in the characters to hope the open ending is closed in a possible sequel (not having read the books, I don't know how the story ends - or even if this film covers all the story written by E L James).And I can't wait to see the out-takes section of the DVD...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing,"Let me first clear things up by saying I was hoping for this movie to be one of those so-bad-it's-good. I happened to pick up the book while at Barnes & Noble and I read a few excerpts. The writing was so unbelievably clichéd and cheesy, I found myself laughing out loud in the store. Unfortunately, the movie was not as entertaining as the book, mainly in part because the dialogue was a bit better. Don't get me wrong, there was still plenty of hilariously corny lines that had me dying in the theater, but aside from those instances I found myself just...bored. Stuff that I didn't particularly care about happened. The tone of the movie fluctuated quite a bit to where I didn't know whether I was watching an erotic movie or a tacky romantic comedy. The sex scenes were racy, I guess, but they lacked passion, and for me, were just there. This is probably because the two lead actors had no chemistry whatsoever. I'll give credit where credit is due though; Dakota Johnson gave a pretty good performance. Another problem with this movie is that the Twilight parallels are blatant, right down to the creepy-but- supposed-to-be-charming boyfriend, the pathetic puppy dog best friend, and the awful dialogue (though this one is better acted). So, all in all, I didn't so much hate this movie as I was just bored of it and I actually fell asleep during it. Don't waste your money.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Thomas Crown meets the Secretary.,"My wife read the books and liked them enough to drag me to this film on opening weekend. I wasn't expecting much since the reviews had been pouring out - no male frontal, in France they are letting their 10 y/o's go see this film, etc.Don't know this E.L. James author, but she isn't a Danielle Steele by any means. Sam Taylor- Johnson? She won the lottery when she married the kid from Kick Ass so I guess she doesn't care what she puts on film for people to watch.The producers should have never let E.L. have that much control over a script. Did anyone see the Secretary with James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhall? Did anyone see the remake of Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Brosnan? It seems like those two films got merged and made into this pile of whatever it was.I've heard the novels were plenty more graphic, so if that was the case, slap an NC-17 rating on it and get some actors that can act and make the film E.L. James wrote.I think the downfall of this film started with the casting - the guy from Sons of Anarchy was the wrong choice and then he dropped out from so much negative review and then they bring in Don Johnson's daughter and the British guy.The script was shameful. I've watched porn online that has better dialog. The cinematography was horrific.

This is a story about two stereotypical paper figures biting their lips and looking bored.,"This is a story about two stereotypical paper figures. I don't believe in the characters at all, and you feel all the way through the screen that Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan feel the same. The first half of the movie is extremely slow and uninteresting. They are building up to the first sex scene, which I don't even want to see. When the sex finally happen I'm surprised to find that this is where you find the interesting parts of the movie. Their relationship becomes a little deeper when questions like ""what do you want to do to me?"", ""Do you wanna hurt me?"" and ""Why do you wanna do this to me?"" rises. I'm sad to find that this isn't what the story focuses on, but instead it insists on showing her weakness and his superiority, which really doesn't need to be underlined yet again by her tripping or him buying her expensive stuff.So, if you wanna see Dakota Johnson biting her lips endlessly and Jamie Dornan trying to look intense and interesting, but instead looking bored, this is a movie for you.

50 Shades of Prejudice,"Yes, I found the movie kinda silly. Yes, I found the acting a bit mediocre. But my biggest disappointment, much bigger than with the film, was with some extremely sexist and misogynist comments (which were supposed to be critical to the MOVIE) that I found on this page. Comments such as ""you women are all ridiculous for liking this kind of movie"", ""if that is what women like, then I lost faith in humanity"" and ""you deserve to be raped for liking man like Christian Grey "". For you, sexist and fascist men who live in a bubble of prejudice, I'll tell you something: you know absolutely NOTHING about what women like. How dare you judge a woman because she enjoys reading books/ watching erotic movies? Have you by any chance ever seen any woman say to the winds that ""men are all a disgusting and ridiculous for watching porn since the dawn of humanity""? Do you judge your (men) friends for watching porn movies? What do you think gives you the right to curse a woman by the films she watches or books she reads? I'll tell you one more thing, in case you do not know it already: you're a big of a coward, that's what you are. A coward who is afraid because women are taking charge of their sexuality without fear of talking about what they like and don't like. You're a coward and a fool because you think women have to be what you want them to be rather than what they really are. Because women are taking control over their own bodies as THEIRS, not as objects belonging to the men around them or to the society. You are a big coward, that's what you are. And I hope in my heart that one day you marry a silly, submissive and dull woman that doesn't question your coward and sexist attitudes because you do not have the balls to be with a woman who is determined and knows what she likes (in sex and in life). And no, I'm not an old unloved ugly with-no-sex-life lady (before you come up with your typically sexist and ridiculous comments). I'm (very well) married, thank you, and with a feminist and wonderful husband that yes, TAKES ME to the movies to watch 50 Shades of Gray because he knew I liked the books a lot.And regarding the film (now down to business), although I found Jamie's acting mediocre, I was positively surprised with Dakota. She brought a graceful and delicate air to Anastasia that maybe in the book had not been so well portrayed. I loved her performance! I do think though that the writer could have taken the plot to the next level, making it better than the book and a more fluid history. They had the tools to do so. But I believe that the directing also had it share of blame. I read some professional reviews that the director was very inexperienced, and maybe that explains some flaws in the movie in general.Overall, I found it an entertainer film. For me particularly lacked some scenes from the book that I missed, but I think it is a good program for a Friday night with the girlfriends or the boyfriend.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thank GOD the tampon scene wasn't in this movie.,"""""You'd kidnap me?"" ""Oh yes,"" he grins. ""Hold me against my will?"" Jeez this is hot."" - Definitely not rape, from 50 shades of grey.the 50 shades of grey movie was much less painful to experience than reading the horribly written, edited, and disturbing novel. This movie doesn't even extend into the ""Cult Classic"" category with it's nightmarish acting, horrific dialogue, and warped concept that offends the BDSM culture itself!""He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string what! And a gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet. Holy (bleep). Sweet mother of all Jeez. And then he's inside me ah!"" - True love, from 50 shades of grey.Acting: 1/10 - There's a lot of things that you can tell about a movie from the actors. During many interviews, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan express contempt for one another (if not the film itself). This followed into the movie. The acting seems almost robotic, lacking in personality.The gooey sexual content: 1/10 - Porn was never meant for mainstream theaters. This is another example on why. The book ventures into bizarre forms of paraphilia and gender abuse that readers can't seem to get enough of. While many were making their pants moist, or pitching a tent for the tampon scene, the film had to be heavily edited from the ""Fifty shades of sexual abuse"" guide, in order for it to enter into theaters.The atmosphere: 6/10 - The atmosphere along with the camera editing did indeed help make it slightly more tolerable. But what it didn't do, was keeping the men in the audience from laughing, saying ""This is just diluted porn"" to get up and walk away, or keep the women from sneaking out of the theater, hoping that nobody saw that they paid for it.Overall: 1/10 - Porn is porn, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. There are many websites of men taking advantage of women and beating them while the woman says ""More please"" if that's what you're into. Attempting to add a storyline to porn doesn't often turn out well, and this goes double when you edit said porn and put it in mainstream media. This movie holds no stable plot to satisfy those who are seeking a good story, and it's offensive to women enough to spawn boycotting campaigns, it's offensive to the BDSM culture because it depicts a practitioner as being someone who takes advantage of their partner, and ultimately, there is absolutely no saving grace for this movie other than the tampon scene not being added. This movie holds no comedic value to compensate for its horrible performance in the sense that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does, and it holds no strong plot, storyline, or acting for it to be taken seriously.""Next time you'll be in the cargo hold, bound and gagged in a crate."" -50 shades of greyThis movie will stand strong as being one of the largest money-makers this year, but its performance score will remain below the Spongebob Movie.Don't torment yourself by watching this movie, and don't give someone who gets work inspired by twilight your money.

Excellent,"The reason for why I liked the movie, is based on the setting itself of the very movie, the dark and mysterious weather and the lightning in the rooms and sky. I think the acting was good, and I really like how the movie pushed itself over the limits of what was okay in movie-making, based on people's opinions. I'm 14, male, and I watched this movie with some male friends and some female friends, and I really enjoyed, and amused myself at how people show disgust of this movie, just because it contains some pornographic material. Where I live, in Oslo, there was even a protest outside Colosseum cinema. I really wanted to provoke them by saying ""I want to be just like Christian Grey when I grow up"", however I saw the movie at a different cinema. I think the movie was good, and I think people would leave better reviews if it was not for the modest pornographic material. And hey, everybody watches porn, right?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sick Perverted DISGUSTING,I'm sorry but i feel sorry for the people who actually made the effort and wasted nothing but their time and threw money down the sewerage for a trash like this movie. The book was horrendous to say in the least and the writer should not even be acknowledged/regarded as a professional but perhaps the writer should seriously consider getting psychological help or perhaps save everyone the trouble and get admitted in the mental hospital. HOW CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S OK TO ABUSE Each other?????????? And this is NOT a romantic movie...love is so different than this S**T. I don't want to waste my time or energy on describing how sick this is and the idiots actually had the audacity to make a movie out of it....i wonder if the writer gave the same favors as described in the books to get the movie...,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disgusting,"So obvious to the audience that it is just a brushed of version of a 'Twilight' FanFiction. Just like 'Twilight' it portrays an abusive relationship, that for some reason people are going crazy over.Why anyone would want to watch the glorification of an abusive relationship is beyond me. The film degrades BDSM by not showing an accurate portrayal of what a BDSM relationship is actually like. Christian is not a Dom. There are countless times when he ignores Ana's requests to stop, or doesn't respect her boundaries. He also stalks her, like all the time.50 Shades also degrades women. It teaches people that when a woman says ""no"", it's okay for you to carry on. As if we don't have enough trouble having people believe women in our rape culture. I really feel for women who have had to live through abuse, such as the stuff shown in 50 shades, and then see their misery and pain blasted all over the media and portrayed as ""romantic.""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shockingly dull!,"To be honest, I never have high expectations of movies that generate so much hype before anyone even saw them, but sure I was curious to see what this is all about. I was stupid enough to think US producers finally came to terms with sexual topics but then again, it doesn't get any more dull than that. The acting and the entire cast are into this and they are trying their best to deliver some sort of performance, but the script is so shallow and the dialog so cheesy that I wonder how many people will be brave enough to ask for their money back as in the end you are left with a feeling of being totally ripped off by Hollywood! If you want to see some real taboo sexual topics, go watch an European production, cause nothing will even come out of the US without being hand picked for the entertained minds...shame this time there isn't even a hint of entertainment!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like a car crash!!,"Well....I didn't expect much. I read the books more than two years ago. (Yes, the writing was bad, as well as the storyline etc.) However I kinda liked it-THEN, because don't we all love fairy tales. Don't we (women) all want a guy who whoos us away and all that?!? Yes Christian introduced her into BDSM, so what. Yes that contract thing was totally ridiculous, so what. But I think a lot of women lost themselves in the story and dreamt of Christian and imagined him and the way things happened in our own way....BUT..seeing it on screen,realizing that there is no difference between 50 Shades of Grey and a cheap, lousy sex movie, apart from ""in that cheap, lousy sex movie there is actually stuff going on"" made me feel sooooo bad, because that book became real on screen and it showed me HOW BAD IT ACTUALLY IS!!! How bad the movie is and how bad the books are. And don't let me get started on the acting! Jamie...a piece of wood, Dakota...not good either! This cast...is soo bad!! But then, how could they have been anyhow, if everyone and their mom would have picked someone else anyway! And i believe that no actor would have been able to make this work...because in the end 50 Shades of Grey does not belong on screen! It's simply rubbish!!! I can't think of one good thing in that film..wait let me think...mmmhhh...the soundtrack probably, I guess.But then, there's always the film industry...and with this movie/book will happened what happened before....with ""Lord of the Rings"" (good movie), ""Twiliight"" , ""Hunger Games""(good movie)...they will drag it out and torture us with two more sequels, although the critics say otherwise! But because there are so many people watching this movie (you, me, him, she, your neighbour....), they will make enough money to do so! And people will go and watch it..not because it's a good movie, or story, or the sex is good--NO, because this movie is like a car crash..you can't look away!! So the only thing is not to go and watch it, so that they can't make enough money for a sequel! But I guess that ship has sailed!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Big hype, mild erotic with messy delivery and translation into dramatic movie.","I have read the books, all 3! This movie followed the theme and important scenes in the book. The beginning portion of the movie was too rushed. The relationship between Steele and Grey was going from meeting for the first time, to all of sudden talking about being in a relationship. There was a lot more depth or quality interactions that led up to the initial sexual interaction in the book. The sex scenes were steamy. The serious scenes with lines, lacked delivery by actors. I'm not sure if it was lack of chemistry or the fact that they were so uncomfortable doing these scenes that they were not focusing on the lines and being realistic in the delivery. It seemed corny at times. There were one liners that added a little humor into a supposed dramatic movie, which made it feel childish. I wished it could have focused more on why Chrisitan Grey is the way he is, instead of spending 1/2 the movie with soft pornographic scenes that lacked depth, follow through and feeling. I'm sure this is to be continued in the sequel. A lot of hype, and I'm sure it will make a lot of money in the opening week. Dakota Johnson will get many more B and C grade acting jobs for her ability to bear all for the art. However the movie needs a lot more work and maybe even new actors.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst movie experience ever !,"Before I begin talking about this ''movie'', let me clarify a few things- I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. I watch movies everyday. When I finished watching this ''movie'', I felt so angry. Let's begin by talking about everything that's wrong with this ''movie''.The screenplay is god awful, the story is damn awful, the characters are stupid and laughably bad, the first half is laughably bad and the second is just painful to watch, the editing is absolutely stupid, the directing is awful, the female protagonist is the weakest character I've ever seen in my life, the entire movie is so cliché and atrocious, the sex scenes are boring and awful, the main character is called Anastasia Steele (the worst name I've ever heard), not a single frame is interesting or worth watching, you don't care for the characters even for a small second, all the characters except the protagonist and Mr. BDSM are useless and add absolutely nothing to the film, even the original song for the movie is not featured but a instead a remake, I laughed so hard when a curtain dialog happened, the ending was the best part because the credits finally showed up so I could breath for a moment, and this movie's so bad I actually refuse to call this ''movie'' by it's original name- for me right now it's called ''Fifty Shades Of Bullshit''.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"no secrets, if you liked the book shouldn't be surprised","I don't really understand all the bad reviews if so many people bought and read this piece of ""art book"". I don't think it could be any better if you consider its origins. I think is a modern version of old grandma/aunties romance books where sex was always involved. Now with internet people can get into more. I wasn't expecting a lot, so no surprises for me. Stop complaining and go and try to find a Mr. Gray (if you can or if he exists). I particularly was a little worried about girls laughing at some wrong stuff, but this is not the movie's fault. Is just the world that is well f****Ed up. What scares me too is the fact the girls won't never have a Mr Grey in their lives, but well let's be honest, even Disney sold this wrong before with all the prince charming stories, so nothing changed.It is a fairy tale for single grown ups.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly realistic characters,I have not read the book. This review is mostly about realism of the main characters of the movie. In some movies I notice that they really well match the logic of real life. E.g after my own divorce I noticed in some divorce-related movies that the scriptwriter certainly has observed very closely how a divorce evolves. I had similar feeling about this movie.I (a boy) was abused as a sex toy by an old woman in preschool years. Based on my experience the psychological profile of main male character seems very realistic -- yes that's the way one can feel and act after abuse -- request endless weird/cruel proofs of love and still not believe. Also the female character seemed quite realistic -- compassion was driving her into the relation with that quite weird person and at same time she had quite good ability of psychological self-protection so she resisted to falling into that abyss. Of course in the movie everything is amplified.I guess that one reason why many reviews say the movie is nonsense -- mostly people have not been in such situations (good for them).I admit the acting could be better :-),7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible,"I read all 3 Fifty Shades books and the movies somewhat follow them. I thought all 3 were outlandish, rubbish, and pretty implausible. Yes, I found myself watching all 3 movies on a streaming service. In general I like Jamie Dornan's acting but not in these movies. He's better than this. Dakota Johnson is not a good actress. I can't stand her voice. I think she made it in the movie industry because of her parents. If women think that this is the way they should be treated by a man they need therapy. The abuse that goes in with Christian and Anastasia is sad. The storyline and acting is one you can skip with this trilogy.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

These things have character minimums. Go away and find nearly anything else. This is less sexy than the worst porn and it has a dumber story than the worst romance movie.

It's kinda vanilla.,"This movie wasn't at all as bad as people make it out to be. It's kinda vanilla, not very kinky.Fifty Shades of Grey is about a young literature student named Anastasia Steele. She meets a handsome billionaire for an interview called Christian Grey. They start a romance that is complicated by his sexual desires.They made this movie out to be very kinky and it's not. It's a bit erotic but mainly I thought it was unintentionally funny. The dialogue and delivery makes it look more like a spoof than an actual movie. I loved the scene where they discuss the contract, that was very funny (and i think it was actually meant to be) if the rest of the movie was written that cleverly this would be a fun erotic romantic-comedy. Dakota Johnson isn't awful or anything but she's given very little to work with. Her character Anastasia Steele (her name alone) is so forced and just not a real human being. Jaimie Dornan as Christian Grey has even less development, he's a bit boring. Seeing as this movie is made for a mainly female audience I didn't understand why we had to see Dakota Johnson naked so often and Grey barely, that just doesn't seem fair to us girls.I think that if you go into this movie with a bottle of wine expecting to laugh at the cringe- worthy dialogue, you could enjoy it. Don't expect anything good, it's not good, but it's also not the worst movie out there.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I had a rough start in life...that's all you need to know.""","He's a billionaire CEO, handsome and single and 'clean,' she's a virginal English-lit major who's been waiting for the right guy to come along...so what's the problem? Turns out the shady Christian Grey has a playroom full of S&M equipment and asks his latest conquest to enter into a contractual agreement for her to be his submissive sex partner. Adaptation of E.L. James' bestseller seems a little white bread from the outset: she happens to work in a hardware store, he comes in to buy tape and rope (!); he says he doesn't 'do' romance, yet there is an awful lot of kissing and canoodling and pillow talk (set to a soulful soundtrack); she asks for a contractual meeting (with a wink) to tell him of the sexual things she absolutely will not do (no anal or vaginal fisting for our heroine). This derivative, glossy movie hedges its bets, wanting to shock and titillate viewers while at the same time make the sex games as palatable as possible to seem romantic. Unfortunately, in a set-up like this one, there's really nowhere for the narrative to go once the action moves into and out of the bedroom. There are no surprise twists. Dakota Johnson asks Jamie Dornan to punish her because she's breaking the rules by wanting more from the relationship than he can give her; he obliges, she submits and they both end up feeling lousy. Not as lousy as the audience is likely to feel. *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film that needs to have justice done,"I don't understand where the hate against this movie comes from: if you adjust your expectations you get rewarded. To start with, it's not a piece of art, it's just another romcom, a teenager movie. And no, it's not porn, erotic scenes are very decent imho, the camera always stops before showing too much, and if someone believes teenagers nowadays would be shocked by these scenes, you don't know what you're talking about. I expected the protagonists to be lousy, yet I must confess they are convincing in their roles, and believe me I had a prejudice against them! 
I find the story be very suitable for today's young generation - in this material world obsessed with sex and false images here there are the two characters being authentic ( she is a virgin at more than twenty, no false breasts, quite common facial features, romantic, looking for the human being beyond the public image and the wealth; and him, looking for a true, ingenue and smart girl) - something unusual among the plethora of in-human movie characters.

First, the leads are not attractive or talented enough to carry off this kind of pretentious soft core adult fare.The acting is amateurish, silly, and almost childlike, which makes it all the worse. The script and dialogue is shockingly inept and cliche-ridden. Were the characters in the book this self-absorbed and lacking any chemistry whatsoever ? What is even more shocking is that the very talented and intelligent actresses, Marcia Gay Harden and Eloise Mumford, read this script and agreed to take on their rather minor parts in this fiasco. Luckily, it didn't jeopardize their subsequent careers, even though those two went on to take part in the sequels. Good paychecks, hopefully.

An insult to the BDSM world...,"Frankly, I'm not sure that there is a rating low enough to accurately describe Fifty Shades of Grey. Universal Pictures and Focus Features, along with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti took E.L. James' badly written book series and made them into bad movies.The only reason that Fifty Shades of Grey gained the amount of attention and popularity that it did was because the subject matter is considered by the general public to be taboo. Taken as a whole, the books and films are a colossal insult to and a highly inaccurate of the entire BDSM community.If Christian Grey were a real person, he would be shunned by the community.

I have not read the book, but I saw multiple girls reading it on the tube, so I though it must be good right?After the movie ended people in the cinema were looking at each other and you can hear them asking ""That's it???."" Yep, that's it. I have watched many erotic movies that have much better plot. It is not a cinema movie, it is a poorly written television film with a big budget. The acting was quite good and I do feel sorry for the actors, because they had to play somehow with very poorly written script. The movie is just senseless and does not deliver what it was supposed to deliver! The sex scenes were supposed to have a shock factor, engage us and make us reflect on our sexuality. But sorry, handcuffs or spanking is nothing new or shocking in today's sex culture. I bet half of the people sitting with me in the audience enjoy much more intense sex life. This movie was as if it was targeting teenagers ( if I was 16 I would have probably enjoyed it), the paradox is that at 16 you probably would not be allowed to see it.

I understand that the subject matter is distasteful to some people, but it should have been no surprise to anyone, considering the kerfuffle over the housewife porn book. I had never heard of Jamie Dornan who played the perv billionaire with all of the emotion of a terminator. I was also unfamiliar with Dakota Johnson who at least put some feeling into her role. I'm sure she is lovely, even though they had her overdo it a bit on the mousiness. What lovely boobies, so much nicer than the mounds of silicone that one sees all too often.

Of course there are a lot of passages I've just skipped, but all in all it was a relaxing book. Therefore I was quite curious about the film... and I was highly disappointed. At not a moment I was caught by the action. The actors didn't managed to reproduce the tingly atmosphere.

Easy prey,"This movie is easy to take apart. It seems to try to steer away from some of the ridiculous things the book included (from what I have read in reviews and other things, because I haven't read it, I think watching the movie was ""enough""). Still as many have observed there is no chemistry here between the leads. On one hand it's nice to see ""romantic"" movie steer away from certain things, on the other hand, it just a shallow diversion, that actually isn't one.You get the same things (read clichés) that you get in your plain romantic comedy. Just without the comedy! Which is a factor that is sorely missed here. No matter how bad those were, you at least had some funny scenes here and there. The funny things here consist of stroking (which is supposed to be hitting?). And while it's nice to see a powerful female character, the transition of ""plain Jane"" to super woman/healer/confident character does not bode well.Obviously there is a lot of nudity, a lot of longing looks and a lot of dialog that will make you cringe and (maybe even) whine at times. It still isn't as bad as expected, but that's not saying very much. The ""helping"" a ""poor"" soul excuse is also a masquerade that is as awful as it sounds.

Honestly, after watching the movie I can't see anyone else as Christian or Ana. In book 2, Fifty Shades Darker, Christian really starts to evolve and we learn more about him and I can't wait to see Jamie bring FSD Christian to life.

Fifty Shades of Why,"Once upon a time, a television executive discovered the ""Twilight"" books, and became such a super-fan of the poorly written drivel that she decided to take up the hobby of writing Twilight Fan Fiction.Somehow, this developed into the novel that is ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".She has admitted to being aware of the fact she is not a great writer, and that the book is her ""midlife crisis, writ large. All my fantasies in there, and that's it."" Allegedly, she was as shocked as anyone that the book's popularity escalated so quickly and that suddenly she had film studios negotiating for the rights to turn her version of Twilight into a major motion picture.The film adaptation is just as bad as one might expect given the facts I have presented you with. One gets the impression that both writers really don't have even a rudimentary understanding of what BDSM is, how it actually works, and that everything they know about it is based on every bad cop drama that's misrepresented or otherwise created an aura of terror around that subculture, things they've seen but didn't understand at an adult ""bookstore"", and maybe a glance at a Wiki article on the subject.This resulted in the perpetuation of the ignorant perception that BDSM is synonymous with psychopathy and that it's really just domestic violence dressed in leather and carrying a whip. Needless to say, this really angered people that actually do participate in such activities - especially those that consider it a lifestyle. I myself having a working knowledge of the subject and an open mind, find it irritating and obnoxious. The film has all the eroticism of an episode of ""Saved by The Bell"" and honestly that show is more arousing.Yet, inexplicably, there is a sequel in the works.My advice, if you have yet to see this film is to never watch it. It's not even so bad that it's good...it's just garbage with a big budget.If you went to see this because all of the media hype regarding how kinky and risqué it was supposed to be, and that part of it piqued your interest...and you were hoping to get at least a glimpse into that world, I highly recommend watching the documentaries ""Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist"", and ""Graphic Sexual Horror"".",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 Shades of Dreadful,"In all honesty, I was not expecting much of this movie but after watching it, I must add that it was worse than I expected.I have bought the book out of curiosity like many people and didn't like it either.The main problem with the movie itself is that the actors are terrible. Dakota Johnson is slightly better than Jamie Dornan but sill pretty bad.There was something seriously wrong with the cast choice...Jamie and Dakota have zero on-screen chemistry in my opinion and everything about their relationship seemed incredibly forced and predictable. Their ""romantic""adventures are just as exciting as watching a freshly painted wall dry.The other major problem with the movie was that the lines were a mere copy-paste from the book. There was no creativity or imagination when it came to transforming the book into a movie. The line 'Laters,baby' was by far the worst. It was so unnatural that it made it look like the actor was actually reading the script right there rather than acting. The only reason why this movie is selling out theatres around the globe is because people are curious and have no idea how bad it actually is. When the movie was finally over and the lights were on again,everyone in the room was laughing and commenting on about how much of a joke it had all been.Having just said this, I only regret that this is a trilogy and that we're going to have to go through two more films (well, not me anyway,because I won't waste another penny on this).

Fifty Shades of romanticised domestic abuse,"Right. First thing's first, before I launch into an enraged monologue, I will attempt to review Fifty Shades of Grey as a film, as this is technically a film review. It is awful. Not so-bad-it's- good awful. Not hilarious awful. Not even a friend made me watch it and I fell asleep awful. Actually awful. I have personally never seen either of the lead actors in anything else but I've seen better acting in the amateur dramatics plays in my local village after everyone's had six too many pints at the pub before the evening performance. Not that they can be entirely blamed of course, when the film (and, I'm assuming, the book, which I never intend to read) has utterly no plot and the writing is genuinely embarrassingly bad.So yes, the film is terrible, but now to the real issue. I had heard a lot of the controversy about this film and feel strongly about some of the issues raised, but felt as though I should watch the film so that my arguments would been grounded in actual knowledge, so as not to seem hypocritical or ill-informed. So I sat down and watched it. I can honestly say I have never been so traumatised in my life. To add some context, I am a great lover of horror films, and this film was the most terrifying experience of my life. I cried on multiple occasions during the film and when it finished, I sat in a state of shock for a whole ten minutes, my body shaking uncontrollably.As someone who has been a victim of domestic abuse in the past, I tend to avoid films that depict violence, control and emotional manipulation in the context of a relationship. Films such as these are usually marketed as psychological thrillers. Not romances. The way in which Fifty Shades was marketed genuinely appals me. The fact that audiences are being told that domestic abuse is not only acceptable because 'he had a tough childhood' but also romantic and desirably is utterly disgusting. It's not only unpleasant, distasteful and misogynistic, it goes much further than that. It is violating, insulting and most of all actually traumatic for people like me. For a film to bring back old memories of abuse is bad enough.

Avoid like the std you'll inevitably get after watching this,"This has to be plain and simple the worst film I've ever been dragged to by the mrs.Even she changed her mind about 30 minutes and wanted to leave but after witnessing two other couples returning to the screen having been refused refunds we remained and suffered the rest of the film.Quite simply, awful casting, wooden performances, secondary cast phoning in performances on the safe knowledge that hysterical middle age housewives who should know better will secure their pay days.other than the film, the worst thing about this film is the pathetic immature tittering of gaggles of certain age groups of women at the sight of a mans bare bottom on the screen. for gods sake, grow up.This has to be a shoo in for multiple razzies but simply having a successful PR campaign behind it means we will be subjected to two more installments of this utter and absolute drivel.I would rather watch Steve Buscemi have his ingrown toenails treated than suffer through any more of this 'mummy porn' and no, I'm really not kidding.If you have to waste your money and time by watching this, then expect nothing less than a boring and thoroughly unenjoyable 2+ hours.When I say a prostate exam with a iron glove would be more enjoyable, its a fact.I cant say this enough, AVOID!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was not that bad at all.,"I read some reviews before I watched it and I expected it to be a piece of trash or like the worst movie ever. But it was actually quite good. I was not bored and to me, that is really important considering I easily get bored. It has a story and although they kinda stretched it so it is a bit slow, maybe that is even better because everyone can catch up. I think that there was enough sex and it would be boring if there was more. After all, this is a movie not an adult video. It is for sure not very erotic but do not forget that these people are not porn stars. The acting was decent and the story was not super predictable. I think Jamie Dornan was a good choice. He has that caring killer look. I don't know how to explain it differently. I enjoyed it although I could also take it if it was a bit creepier. So, I do not understand why everyone gave such bad reviews. I mean, it was not supposed to be an enlightening, educational and beautiful documentary or something like that. To people who love this kind of movies, I am safe to say, it is a good movie. I recommend you to watch it. Even if you do not like it, it is not the end of the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disgusting Movie,"Nope, not because of any sex scene, I actually did not find any of the scenes erotic on it any way.

Make your decision,"I WOULDN'T go and see 50 shades of Grey in the cinema. I read the book years ago and it seemed interesting, so it made me want to see the film version. While watching the film I started to get bored and felt like the film was starting to drag (even though it is 2 hours long). There was a big hype about the film for about 2 years but it isn't what they make it out to be. If you want to watch 50 shades of Grey just watch the trailer all the good parts are in the trailer the rest of the film isn't very interesting.

Terrible,"Please b careful if u want not to spoil your own imagination.The book was too good abut the movie was awful.Mr. Grey isn't that Grey that you imagined for an entire year...Ana is too...how should I say?Too much of a dominator!All the action of the movie is based on what Ana looks and physically does...nothing interior/nothing from her mind,no interior voice,no goddess,nothing that could make u understand how and why she is attracted by Mr. Grey. This movie is why women shouldn't create erotic movies. I was completed disappointed by the script.The only good thing about it was the music...

The storyline is unique-and gets big points just for that alone! First rate performances by ALL, and Dakota and Jamie indeed, drive this compelling movie into the winners circle!

"Pretty bad, pretty boring","Well... I saw this movie to discover what was so appealing in it that everyone was talking about it whether they've seen it or not, whether they've read the books or not. One of my friends - after she read the book - told me: I fall in love again, referring to Mr. Grey. So, yes, I was curious.Anyway, it was very disappointing. It was not about romance or even about sex - as everyone says - it's about controlling a person - Anastasia -, controlling every detail, every aspect of her life, even sex... and also telling her in many different ways that he wants to hurt her.The movie is bad. Boring, too long, no chemistry between the actors... The story is OK (so so). At least Anastasia is not as submissive as Grey wants but she tolerates a manipulative,jealous, controlling and abusive guy just because she wants him to love her... Sorry girl, that's no love.Leaving sex apart,it seems to be an apology for domestic violence with all those rewards and punishments.... and all those excuses for his behavior because he is a complex, traumatize man who has shades... No woman should tolerate a man like Mr Grey and, actually, it worries me that so many women have fallen ""in love again"", as my friend.I said before ""sex a part"" because I'm not judging neither it nor the practices the character have, that belongs to the intimacy in a couple but yet I judge the model of man that is making women crazy about in a time when so many is made to combat gender and domestic violence.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Don't bother to watch. Seriously.,"I don't usually write reviews, but today i'm feeling obliged to do so since i vehemently criticised people who did't bother to watch the movie and, guess what? They were right...Firstly, I'd like to advise readers that I've never read the book and therefore my opinion does not regard the literary work. On the other hand, i assume it is bad - according to what i saw - and will not do it anyway.So, why shouldn't you see it? I am not being presumptuous or anything, but the reason is that the movie is unbelievably and utterly bad. Everything is wrong since Its foundations. The badness does not contemplate one single part of the film, but goes from the actors to the plot itself. As a matter of fact, I can resume the entire feature in one single sentence: ""A girl gradually 'falls in love' with an unbelievably multitasked (and sadomasochist) billionaire"". That is it. Seriously, that is it. Nothing really important happens besides this.Then you have the acting. The actress slowly improved in the middle of the story, however and until so she was truly horrific. Alternatively, the main actor was not that bad. His role did not require a magnificent performance, but still not pretty watchable. The rest of them don't really matter that much, they were just plugging holes anyway.So, why 3 instead of 1? Because I don't think it was such an awful spectacle to deserve the very lowest grade. Nevertheless, it will not acquire any good reviews, since it completely failed to captivate the audience. The songs were quite catchy and there weren't the nasty parts the internet has been talking about - it is probably from the book - but still not a good idea.

Still a better love story than Twilight,"for my surprise, i have to defend the movie. i read half of the book a couple of years ago and it was really stupid. i hated it. so i expected the movie to be even worse. but compared to the book, the movie is actually OK. it's watchable and you won't get bored at any time. of course, the whole story is probably stupid and unbelievable and many people will get upset or offended by it. i don't think there's anything to get upset about. the story is slow. this is the first part out of 3, so nothing special happens. the sex scenes are nice, the chemistry is average. the dialogue could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse. the good thing about the movie is, that they could skip some really cheesy parts from the book. i think if there wasn't such a huge advertising campaign around this movie, most people would say, that the movie is OK. but now everyone was expecting something like titanic and got disappointed. i expected something like twilight and it came out better, so 6 stars from me.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

She did fine in some of her movies but as Ana, she didnt even act like her or even have her expressions. And her voice was so dull and boring as well. Im like this is not how Ana talks and acts like in the books. Shailene Woodley should have played Ana, she was more suited for the role and her expressions and her hair and image was more fitting as well, matched the book's perfectly. I dont know why they didnt have Shailene pay her, they did her dirty but not having her in this role. This maybe brutal but someone else should have played Ana instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

This looked to me some rehash of junk Lifetime movies. Its story about emotions raging between a newly graduated women and a CEO of Grey Enterprise. Hence the word ""GREY"" in the title. Or else everything in the film was dark. For the initial 60 minutes I didn't mind the momentum as I thought something will happen soon. But nothing did. Not in the next 60 minutes and not even after the film ended. I would suggest a BBC cuckhold porn show would be better fulfilling than this crap of a film. And I wonder why this film did get much talked about. My 1/10 is for the entertainment and if any movie lacks entertainment, then there's no use of the best of dialogues, sceneries incorporated in it. All in vain.

Only You,"I must be one of the few straight men to have read the book, but five years ago everywhere you went you saw women engrossed in copies of it (which charity shops are now awash with), so I thought it might provide some useful insights into what women actually seek in men rather than what they say they do. The suposedly all-important Sense of Humour is little in evidence in Christian Grey, unlike the vast quantities of dosh and very expensive presents that he liberally sprays about to facilitate the charmless and very basic advances that unless allied to fabulous good looks or or the sort of wealth that enabled Bruce Wayne to found the Wayne Foundation would never on their own have got Christian Grey to first base with Miss Steele. (Both book and film are extremely vague about where his vast wealth comes from, other than the fact that he is using it to attempt to End World Hunger; but the carbon footprint from his private helicopter alone probably undoes all the good work his philanthropic endeavours facilitate.)There is actually more sex in the film than in the book (which not surprisingly devotes far more space to his billionaire lifestyle - and precious little to his supposedly busy life as a hot-shot businessman - and with the haggling over the contract before their sub/dom relationship can commence), but it remains as chilly as it's inscrutable anti-hero and it's presumably the undivided attention that she's getting that women reading the book - and watching this movie - crave rather than the sex.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not the worse movie out there but disturbing when you actually think about it,"Warning : Possible spoilers OK, so i've read all 3 books. Not the greatest piece of literature but i actually liked it, although found #3 the most interesting. Considering how explicit the books were I curious to see how they would bring this to the big screen without it just turning into a Porn film. Watching the film i thought it was much over-hyped about the s%$ scenes. The scenes are very short and these days, you see just as much nudity/action on a TV show like Game of Thrones. Now, these books were written as a romance, but it's a very confusing version of romance and a very confusing understanding of BDSM. Now, the film could have been romantic ... billionaire falls for Average Jane, they fall in love and the scenes in the Glider/helicopter are a bit romantic (hey, who wouldn't want a Billionaire to sweep them of their feet and take them on a helicopter ride) But... this is no romantic film and having now watched it on Blu ray, when you watch it again, you realise how controlling Christian is over Ana and it is really disturbing to watch. I found the final scenes in the film difficult to watch. The spanking thing was not out of pleasure or some kinky BDSM thing, it was out of control and it really was hard to watch. There is no real chemistry between the stars or that they geniuinely loved one another. I can see why people are up in arms that this film promotes domestic violence. Before i saw the film, i thought that was rubbish just based on the book, but the film just seem to potray a real control freak who just thinks about hurting his girlfriend for cheap thrills. It's sad that this film tries to disguise itself as a romance or even a film about BDSM, but it barely covers that sort of stuff. It really is just a film about a messed up guy and his messed up relationship. I thought i liked this film initially but watching it again, i'm not really sure. As for the acting well, there are heaps of well known actors in this film but they get barely any screen time. So many characters from the books, quickly slotted in for a few minutes screen time with no real purpose. I like Jamie Dornan but i didn't think there was any chemistry between him and Dakota Johnson. I don't think she was a very good fit for the role. Overall, not the worse movie i've ever seen, but it is definitely a bit on the disturbing side as a disturbed romance.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

So grossly hashed together,"Late to the party on this film, having found the book in a charity shop for a quid, I thought I'd see what all the hype was about. The book was trashy but enjoyable (I like what I like) but this film. I dont usually ponder awful films like this but it was just...it was as if the writers had just cut lines of text from the book and thrown them at the storyboard. The dialogue made no sence out of the contact they were originally written which made the characters seem so two dimensional and just rambling random lines to one another for no purpose. It didn't convey the tone at all. Grey is much more intimidating and Ana is much more intimidated by him than the film let's on. Which, in the book once you remove the sex, is the entire dynamic if the pair. They had little spark in the film, which made the dom/sub sex scenes in the red room feel flat and not at all sexy. She is supposed to be utterly overwhelmed and thrilled by the experience, despite her reticence to enjoy it. He is supposed to be dominant, that's how BDSM works, yet the writes dumbed it down so much it became like any other sex scene in any other film.I don't understand what the point is of making a film from a book if you are not going to do the book justice and actually tell the story properly.

There was no emotion in their role.The plot was also pretty ridiculous, but we all knew that going into it. I just do not believe anyone would behave like this.There were some kinky scenes that redeemed the movie a little bit.

Seriously not worth it,"If you're watching it for any erotic purpose, there are far better options out there including ones that actually show BDSM. This just glorifies abuse.

No hate to the actors, but seriously, there's no chemistry and some of the deliveries are just not great, but I put more fault on the crew rather than the actors since it's up to them what's a good shot or not.If you're looking for anything out of this movie, it's probably found in better places elsewhere. I've seen fanfiction better written than this and I'm aware the original books started out as Twilight fanfiction. It's one thing if fanfiction is meh, but to be such a big franchise over the past few years, just yikes.Also for BDSM portrayal, no. The entire time, it's like ""just get therapy and stop preying on a girl you know is inexperienced."" Unfortunately abusers and such do use BDSM especially those newer to it to abuse people. Consent is a big thing and none of this is proper consent. And even if you do have fantasies like this, which are one thing when they're strictly fantasies, I go back to my original statement: it can be found better in other places. I like my toxic fantasies and characters too, but when it becomes mainstream media, it comes along with romanticization which can be extremely harmful.Either way, no matter what, this movie isn't worth it. Common sense is out the window and honestly, if you're looking for anything erotic, porn is better than this. More chemistry even there than in this film. I'm sure some people will have this as a guilty pleasure, nothing wrong with that if you acknowledge the fact it's not good and harmful, we all enjoy bad media after all, but really for the majority of people, this is going to be a major pass. At best, it's a boring film, at worst, you're really just watching some guy use BDSM as an ""excuse"" to abuse a naive virgin woman.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not good, boring, no chemistry between the actors","Happened to catch this on the telly. Now what a lousy movie! It looks like no one enjoyed making this (and as the director and actress later told in interviews - it's actually true). Of course you can't help but feel sorry everyone was forced somehow to work on a project they didn't like, and that the project was not what they initially envisaged it being. But strangely enough the audience couldn't get enough of this turkey and it was a box-office hit. This movie is not even so-bad it's good - it's no Showgirls. It's just a dully shot wannabe erotic movie devoid of eroticism. Boring cinematography, lighting, editing. The lack of chemistry of the actors is palpable, with Dornan looking like he would prefer to be anywhere else in the world than spanking Ms. Johnson. I don't know who Dornan is, he looks like a male model - but he is certainly not a talented actor. The movie doesn't seem to go anywhere, first Dakota's character is getting spanked and she is enjoying it, then she later stops enjoying it, but nothing seems to have changed - maybe there was more detail in the book? I don't know. Nothing interesting happens during the whole duration of the film. I definitely won't have watched it if it wasn't just showing randomly on the TV, it's just way too boring.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very rushed,"As someone who has read the book and enjoyed it (yes really) I was intrigued to see how the movie matched up. It started well, but then quickly deteriorated in what I can only describe as numerous rushed scenes with absolutely no continuity. Many scenes important to the story were simply skipped and some changed completely.
All in all the movie isn't a great success and I was left disappointed.Avoid if you've read the book, you will feel very let down. If you haven't read the book you'll just be left wondering what the heck it was you just watched.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reader of all three books and enjoyed it,"There are two reasons why people wouldn't like this movie: they didn't read the book, or they expected the movie to be exactly like the book. I don't think people realize that most movies based from the books usually don't compare to the book. Stop going into it with high expectations like it's going to be exactly equal to the book and just enjoy it. All key points from the book were not in the movie as expected. This is one of those movies, either you will like it or you won't ( for book readers and non.) I've read all three books, and I think the director did an amazing job fitting most of the points in.

Read the books, don't consider then Pulitzer material but then I also don't think they were such trash that I've read better first grade essays. The acting was okay, by the end you can buy both of the leads in their roles. The plot, well see above. The material - honestly if you have an issue with it, you should never have read the book OR saw the movie. In the end this movie will appeal to certain demographics and others were going to trash it no matter what. Many of the ""issues"" being protested about the movie are flat-out wrong and people are reading far too much into it and the book and can't get past their own issues.

Surprisingly well shot film,"Sam Taylor-Johnson, from whom I've never seen another movie, did a pretty good job, and not just her. Cinematography was on point, with some great shots, and the use of colour was interesting too. There is a lot of purpose behind the way scenes are framed. Way more effort was put in the technical aspects of this soft-core porn than one would ever expect, people brought their A-game. Also the main character's name is Anastasia Steele, which will never not be funny.The worst aspects of this film are the writing and the non-existent chemistry of the protagonists. Other than that, I have trouble filling the character quota. I have no idea how they stretched this into a 2h movies, when the whole trilogy could easily be condensed to the same length. You get a 3 in 1 review. The sequels have a different director and even less things are happening, there. If you are wondering why the first one got better reviews from critics, Sam Taylor-Johnson is why. Still was a pain to get through though, and I unironically may not had made it to the end was it not for her name amusing me throughout.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Come on guys.,"All the reviews I have read about this movie is about the plot. Screw the plot, this is a movie based on a book, if you wanna rate the plot, rate the book.Anyway, I gave this six stars, but I haven't really decided fully on how I feel about the movie. So, of course there's a lot of things missing from the book, but they did a pretty good job with keeping in the essentials scenes.The cast, well first of I think that Jamie Dornan is a handsome man, and it is pretty hard to find an actor that everybody finds attractive, so just go with it, they aren't going to change him because you don't like him. But I can see what you guys say, when you're talking about the lack of chemistry between the leading characters and since this is very important, it downgrades the movie a bit.I like that Dakota Johnson isn't the most hot, sexy and perfect woman, because that's not how Anastasia Steele is described. They are following the book quite well, and that's very pleasing because too many times has a movie destroyed a book. Christian is a very complex person to portray and many people may not be happy with the way Jamie played him, hell maybe I aren't happy about it, but there is so many haters in here, who just wants to hate because they can. And I know that everything this movie (book) is showing/telling is horrible. The way their relationship is.. It is just wrong, and nobody should want to be in a relationship like that, but to be fair they had to agree to it. Safewords and all. So you can't say that it's wrong, you might think it's wrong, but both people are agreeing to it.Anyway, back to the movie. It wasn't the best movie ever, but it was good entertainment and I liked most of the movie. They did their best, and to me (who didn't expect much) it was good enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Blah, blah, blah. People corrupt themselves.

This is all about how cool it is to be a sociopath or a shallow thrill seeker acting as if a bit of fun has any meaning.

A mixed bag of sensuality and drama,"""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" based on the best-selling novel by E. L. James, ventures into the world of erotic romance, exploring the complex relationship between billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele. The film delves into themes of power, control, and vulnerability, set against a backdrop of opulence and mystery.Dakota Johnson's portrayal of Anastasia brings a certain innocence and curiosity to the role, while Jamie Dornan's Christian Grey exudes a brooding intensity. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, capturing the tension and intrigue of their unconventional relationship.However, the film struggles with its pacing and narrative depth. The plot often feels stretched thin, relying heavily on the allure of its provocative themes rather than substantial character development. The dialogue can come across as stilted, and some scenes feel repetitive, lacking the emotional impact needed to fully engage the audience.While ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" succeeds in creating a visually appealing and sensually charged atmosphere, it ultimately falls short in delivering a compelling and cohesive story. It's an intriguing exploration of desire and boundaries, but it leaves much to be desired in terms of storytelling and character depth.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Terrible in all categories,"This movie was confusing, not because of any complexities, but because of the plot, the acting, and the lack of chemistry.
The film's plot is ridiculous; a young chaste woman meets a S&M sex addict and they begin a relationship, but it's not a relationship because he doesn't do romance, but it is a relationship because she really likes him, but she needs to sign a contract so he can do S&M things to her, but she won't sign it, but does all the S&M things anyway... yeah- weird and doesn't make sense.
Jamie Dornan is a great actor... in the fall, but not this. The role doesn't suit him, and he lacks chemistry with south Dakota Who looks as if she's about to burst out laughing in every scene.

Bad Movie,"Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst movie I have ever watched. I'm sorry, but the 2/10 I'd give it comes solely from the book. First, let's focus on the movie. Anastasia Steele was incredibly boring.. she had no personality, seemed perpetually confused, and was just dull overall. I couldn't even finish the movie, but I still knew the whole plot because I had read the book. And while the book was better than the movie, it wasn't great either. At least the book gave Anastasia more depth as a character, but in the movie, everything felt so rushed and completely unrealistic.I understand that the book provides far more detail, but the way they portrayed Anastasia in the film was just poor. I'm not saying she's particularly brilliant or well written in the book, but at least she had some personality there. The same goes for Christian Grey. They could have portrayed his character much better in the movie. While he is admittedly cold and distant at the beginning of the book, his depiction in the film felt flat and unconvincing.I'll never understand how people can watch and enjoy this movie. Honestly, I'd rather watch 365 Days than sit through this again.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A film to see,"I have read the books and was interested to see how the film would turn out. This is a film about an unusual love story. Mr Grey is young rich, fit and handsome. He does not have a girlfriend. Anastasia interviews Mr Grey for her friend who is the editor of a University paper. Anastasia looks like a nice girl. During the interview, Anastasia ask Mr Grey if he is gay. He does not date. He does not want a girlfriend. Mr Grey - Christian, takes a fancy to Anastasia and tells her about his problem - straight dominant look for a submissive. He presents her with a contract sitting out the terms and conditions of their relationship. Anastasia does not sign the agreement but falls in love with Christian and allows him to take advantage of her - including a spanking and a wiping. This dominant / submissive relationship is not something that most of us know much about.The film leaves out some of the characters in the book, the Mrs Robinson is talk about in the film but makes no appearance. A flash back of Christian being the submissive might have been good. It might have given some insight to how Christian's developed his interest in punishing the woman he loves.The book has been referred to as ""Mummy porn"". The film is a well made and good enough for the public to want to see more. Apart from the punishment, which is very mild in the film. Nothing to upset Mummies. So they will all still be dreaming of a Mr Grey coming into there life. To get the man of your dreams, they might put up with a spanking! Clearly both Christian and Anastasia are in love with each other. It does not have a happy ending, well the ending most people would expect.I liked the film and the cast were good.

I knew that they wouldn't be able to add in certain scenes from the book due to the R rating, but other than that they pretty much stayed true to the story. The people who called this ""porn"" certainly haven't seen porn before because the sex scenes were just like any other rated R movie sex scenes. They really weren't that graphic.

Similarities with other films,"Fifty Shades of Grey has a formulaic quality that puts it alongside films such as 'Maid in Manhattan' and 'The Devil wears Prada'. At the beginning, Anastasia presents herself to Christian Grey and his assistants in a frumpy outfit that hardly fits with the professional environment. In 'The Devil wears Prada', Andrea has an identical situation in being outside the fashion statements of Runway magazine as she also arrives at the office looking frumpy. Both characters get sucked into their respective new worlds - Andrea into the corporate fashion hypnosis, and Anastasia into Christian Grey's hypnosis. Just as Marisa crosses over into the world of Assembly man Chris. Marshall as the Manhattan maid, so Ana's situation is similar. In both cases, the basic human activity is girl meets boy.Chemistry between Ana and Christian is not as flawed as some have asserted. Ana is slowly trying to understand the strange new world she is entering, and this develops as the film unfolds. Members of the BDSM world who say they wouldn't do what the film's characters do fail to recognise that everyone is different. What Christian and Ana do is unique to them, and so cannot be attached to a text book life style.There are some reasonable sub-plots, small though they are. The two mothers and Ana's friends and family provide the contrast.As a romantic/erotic genre, I wouldn't expect the film to be an intense set of character studies that might be found in other films. Fifty Shades of Grey works on its own terms, even if those terms are unique.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Now I Understand.,"Now that I have finally watched this film, I can understand all the negative reviews it received. Its only real purpose is to titillate, and it certainly accomplishes that, but there is no real story here. They give us very little reasoning for why either of the main characters are like they are, especially Grey himself. Oh, they hint at things, but only superficially. The biggest crime they commit is the ending. Knowing you fully intend to produce a series of films rather than a single stand-a-lone of a certain story is no excuse for ending it so obviously on a 'To be continued' note. Also, I never got the feeling that Grey was a billionaire with a b.... a millionaire maybe, but not a billionaire. He just didn't come across that way.

"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (2015) - Stylish, but Shallow","The first entry in the Fifty Shades trilogy, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and based on E. L. James's bestselling novel, is a glossy yet superficial exploration of romance and BDSM. Dakota Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele, an awkward college student who falls for the enigmatic billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). While the film boasts sleek production design and a memorable soundtrack (with hits like ""Love Me Like You Do"" by Ellie Goulding), it lacks the emotional depth or chemistry needed to make its unconventional love story compelling.The performances are mixed; Johnson brings charm and vulnerability to Ana, but Dornan's Christian feels flat and one-note. The film's portrayal of BDSM relationships has been criticized for being unrealistic and problematic, with Christian's domineering behavior bordering on abusive rather than consensual. While visually polished, Fifty Shades of Grey ultimately feels like style over substance, failing to fully explore its provocative themes.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
BDSM thought provoking film with extremely cliché love story line,"Fifty Shades of Grey has two main characters: Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). As in most love stories, they belong to two different social classes - the girl being a poor, beautiful student, while the boy is a rich, powerful, handsome billionaire. They meet each other by chance and fall in love. For now you might think that you've seen it hundreds of times and you are definitely right about it. Most things in this movie is so well known and familiar that it bores you. Accordingly, if you continue watching it as another complicated love story, you might walk out of theater or order a cup of coffee to keep yourself awake. What I tried is to look at this story in a different perspective, something alike to Nymphomaniac or even more, Blue Is the Warmest Color (the comparison does not necessarily mean they are equally good). At the end of the day, not many films, at least in Hollywood, talk about BDSM or dominant/submissive sex experience.Having said that, I was very surprised that the film is R rated. And it's not only a rating, it perfectly describes what approach director Sam Taylor-Johnson took while filming it. To shortly say, it could have been much more erotic and as they say, book has lots of it.I will try to talk about the love-story side of Fifty Shades of Grey. We all know it's shitty cause it's very average and not original. By saying that I mean everything, including relationship lineup, dialogues, character development and extremely predictable ""twists"". Instead, I will focus on Grey's fetish - BDSM.Dornan's character is an absolute cliché of rich playboy - handsome, full of gadgets, self confidence and kindness. But his sexual life is nothing alike of others. The only way he gets sexual satisfaction is pain, pain of other partner who is always submissive. In any world, one can not easily find an absolute submissive person, who is ready to enjoy the physical stab because other person does. So, Christian has to negotiate with Anastasia step by step, tries to talk her into his dangerous game. Miss Steele is ready to try for sake of love. I don't want to spoil anything, if its possible, so I'll just generally tell the idea.The film provokes many thoughts on BDSM: whether it's normal; whether it's naturally born attraction or later formed due to specific life events. Fifty Shades of Grey gives a definite answer, which you might not agree, just like me. But it does give an answer. Another deal-breaker is how another person can accept this sexual behavior and if the denial is really about the pain or humiliation.For Grey, bandaging, spanking, slapping is a form of endearment, a form of loving and the only way to experience orgasm. He means nothing degrading by that. To the contrary, Anastasia perceives it in a different way - the way most of us probably would do. While she sometimes enjoys it, since Christian seems to be very professional/good at it, there is a part of her that feels wrong, as if being submissive has nothing to do with love.As I mentioned above, this film has some similarities with Nymphomaniac, which also talks about masochist sex. But the latter is more sincere and open about it, showing sexual desires more naked and a it is. For me, Trier's film was sometimes too hard to watch, too explicit and very true. While Fifty Shades of Grey demonstrates BDSM in more acceptable way, which I enjoyed to watch. I mean, it maybe something most of us have never experienced, but I have to acknowledge that each sex scene was beautifully shot, perfectly shooting the pleasure of both parties. The biggest complain I have is that it could have been more +18. In it's core, dominant/submissive sex has nothing to do with shame or diffidence and filming this scenes with shyness does not feel frank enough.As for Blue Is the Warmest Color it had more explicit sex scenes that, everyone agrees, was one of the most pleasant scenes in years. So what director Sam Taylor-Johnson could have done is to adopt the same attitude by filming her movie in more ""pornish"" way that would be equally acceptable.Even though Dakota Johnson is an exact pretty face a girl like Anastasia should be, her performance was far below average. Her tears, drama scenes were somehow irritating. But Jamie Dornan was quite much better, especially in the last sex scene, where he finally gets what he wants and you can see it in every move, emotion and wrinkle on his face.Danny Elfman, who has created some magnificent music for Good Will Hunting, Milk and Big Fish, did nothing special for Fifty Shades of Grey. In fact, at the end of the movie, I remembered none of track played during the film. Only Beyonce's memorable song captured the spirit of film perfectly.Oscar nominee cinematographer Seamus McGarvey did not have much to do here, but he did picture several sex scenes in a very good way, focusing on important parts (!) sometimes, moving through bodies of lead characters and giving glimpse on their faces. It created an impressive motion that kept audience engaged in sexual act, at least, sometimes.In conclusion, if you are looking for groundbreaking, philosophically deep discussions on sexual behavior, Fifty Shades of Grey will disappoint you. If you are going to watch it as a love story, it will disappoint you. But if you try to look at it as a discussion of BDSM and not generally accepted sexual life, it will definitely provoke some controversial thoughts",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very enjoyable, much to my surprise","This film tells the story of a university student who interviews a successful, young and handsome billionaire, Christian Grey. He falls for her, and they embark on a mind game of physical and mental control.It turns out that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is more a romantic film than a film about alternative sexual practice. Christian Grey is portrayed to be super handsome and charming. He has this irresistible charisma, and certainly knows how to make a lady smile. How Christian Grey charms Anastacia to be very sweet and Romantic. An yet, he has this dark side which needs to be unleashed. The film does not concentrate on this dark side, as Anastacia is actually so good at playing mind games with Christian. The end result is an engaging and intriguing struggle between the two.I really enjoyed ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", much to my surprise.",,Anonymous,Romance
Few redeeming qualities.,"I'm not a FSOG hater. For all the book shortcomings I couldn't put down the first book and half of the second. I didn't start the third but I understand why so many women would find this romantic. It's the same love story that has been favored by female readers for centuries in a way or other. From Cinderella, to Beauty and the beast. This fantasy of taming a not approachable man with your love. Unrealistic and unhealthy as this is, those kind of books bring the kind of drama that keep some people turning the pages. I thought the concept even if not original had potential. No inner goddess, no holy cow, no graphic scenes (because they wanted to stick to an R rating) no repetitive scenes, and you could end up with a decent story. Add that to Nowhere Boy director, a Danny Elfman score, and a visually appealing setting and I thought the movie could be one of those cases in which the movie is better than the book. The book is more character driven than plot driven so I wasn't going to complain about the lack of a beginning a climax and an ending.Well, I was wrong. The movie is not as bad as I thought it could be but Kelly Marcel lost a great opportunity to get rid of the horrible dialog. One thing is Reading ridiculous lines like ""I don't make love I f*** hard"" ""I'm going to f** you into next week"" ""What have you done to me?"" and another seeing them in the big screen. Ridiculous! Everybody knows that EL James is not the best writer and she wrote this piece for fun but I thought the scriptwriter would have a Little bit of respect for her reputation and try to get her name attached to a decent script. I know that giving the nature of the material she couldn't do much but still, something could've been done at the scrip department.Besides I thought that the whole point of the story is that these couple who are very different from each other, who don't know how to have a healthy relationship, who try to get what they want through manipulation were slowly falling in love. Nothing that I saw in the movie made me feel they were really into each other. Part is that the actors have no chemistry but also that the script gives them little to no room to create characters that convincingly convey how much they are into each other. Scenes that were supposed to be romantic (yes romantic, because disturbed people like Christian fall in love too) turned out to look cheesy or creepy.The only redeeming quality of these two is how they fall into each other but Kelly Marcel seems to have been more interested in presenting sex scenes. There are plenty and they are not particularly graphic but with the exception of a couple of sex scenes outside the Red room the rest is just...meh! I felt like they were there just trying to say, ""look we are presenting sex scenes in an artistic way!""Also I can't believe I'm going to say this but Christian Grey in the book I can totally understand and is better written. He was hurt, had certain vulnerability, he was a good mix of arrogance, Jack-ass attitude and mystery. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor didn't bother to give him more background, more sass, a hook for the viewers to understand why Anastasia was drawn to this man. It looked like she was after the money because other than that, what else is there to draw an intelligent manipulative college graduate into a world she doesn't like?Talking about the sex scenes. It was really necessary to insert a pop-song in each of them? Danny Elffman's score is one of the few redeeming qualities of the movie and you get distracted by the pop songs.I thought that Sam Taylor Johnson had good intentions with this film.The scene in which Ana and Christian are discussing the soft and hard limits was brilliant. Besides she inserts some themes here, some themes there. Those themes are part of the book but the sub-par prose doesn't let you appreciate them. Kudos to that but she missed the opportunity of making this movie more Secretary and less twilight.Dakota Johnson's Acting is decent and in certain scenes she displays a strength that Anastasia didn't have in the books. She's very expressive and carries the movie well. I think her performance is another redeeming quality of this train-wreck. A lot of book readers are always claiming how Anatasia is easy manipulated but I think any woman who wants to change a man for whatever reason has a tendency to manipulation, too. That's not unconditional love. If you love some one take him for what he is and if he is not what you're looking for leave. But if you stay it's because you're as damaged, controlling and manipulative as he is. Dakota plays this woman who tries to turn a disturbed guy into her prince charming quite decently.Dornan's casting was a huge mistake. His horrible performance reinforces this idea that the only reason Ana is after him is his looks and his money because he gives nothing sexy, interesting, intriguing, magnetic about his character. People who haven't read the book would be wondering why so many women fell in love with Christian Grey. If Charlie Hunnam (who I think could have saved this movie from the disaster it became) wasn't available they should have postponed filming till they found a guy who could portray the role. I've seen Dornan act in the fall and he's not good but he isn't as bad as he is here.So overall I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie but saw it in an advanced screening.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Atrocity,This film rarely interested me i sat in my chair restless and counted the lights in the cinema. When i did watch i felt nothing but sheer anger. To see so many women turning into giddy school girls over a lead character who is basically promoting domestic violence. Women have come far in today's society and to see them lusting after the idea of a man who is going to control them and tell them what to do like some 1920's husband and sickening. Forgetting the storyline for a second the film itself was absolute garbage. The the characters were completely one dimensional and may as well have read on screen from the script. It was in fact not even sexually arousing which i believe it was meant to be. i have never been less excited to see boobs in a movie. Such obvious product placement was laughable worse than james bond film sponsored cola. Everything was just so unrealistic. also Christian grey is clearly a psychopath. Just do not watch this movie!,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Screenwriter Killed the Essence of The Book.,"I didn't go in expecting an Academy Award winning movie, but after hearing how much EL James fought to keep the movie as close to the books, I was disappointed with what they came up with. No... didn't need more sex scenes, but definitely could have added another 1/2 hr to develop the storyline and other characters in the movie. Books were definitely much better. Movie cut out way too much that helped create and develop the emotional attachment and chemistry I felt while reading the books. Storyline was too disconnected and rushed, and some parts out of sequence from the book. Friendships Anastasia has between her friends and Christian's body guard weren't developed enough either. Plus they make his body guard just seem like a chauffeur in the movie.If you didn't read the books, you wouldn't understand the significance of when he says ""Laters Baby"" and when she says ""Yes Sir"". For example, in the books, Christian & Anastasia ' s emails back and forth were written a bit more formal with subject lines that were fun and teasing each other back and forth. . And always signed off by Christian with ""Laters Baby"". Both big phrases that became key to the books so much that you could buy t-shirts and other stuff with the phrases on it after the books came out. But in the movie, they're just words that wouldn't make sense if you didn't read the books. Book one wasn't my favorite though. Boring compared to the other 2. So I'm hoping the next 2 movies will be better written and more connection with the characters.Hopefully they will hire a screenwriter & director who read all the books and knows what needs to be left in the story line.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Noooooooooooo,"People seem to realize that this movie is bad. Horrible, even. But that's not the real question; no, the real question is: Is this movie worse than cancer? Well...at least with cancer you die. Everything about this movie is wrong. The acting is wrong. The script is wrong. The sex is wrong in all the wrong ways. At one point, Christian states that ""I don't make love. ""I f***. Hard."". He promptly ties her up and makes love to her. Christian, I hate to be the bringer of bad news here, but just because you tied her up does invalidate your love making. There wasn't even a point to her being tied aside from ""oooh look at our edgy, kinky sex"". But it wasn't. It was pretending to be. The most accurate plot summary of this movie would be ""a compulsive liar pretends to be a sadist and is constantly on the brink of tears about it."".",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Filthy Shame of Grey's Lack Thereof or (The Unintended Virtue of Audience),"by Rob FeightWhen the girl twenty-somethings were buzzing about a book titled as though it was intended to assist passionate monochromatic painters with technique, I hardly took notice. A couple of months afterwards when the buzz had turned into giggled whispers at housewife round tables and on the radio, my curiosity peeked open nary an eyelid.Three years, a movie and a cringe worthy mountain of negative reviews later and now hopefully, just maybe, this fraudulent, lecherous abduction of the classically beloved story of Cinderella will extinguish itself. Though, from the droves of moviegoers that have seemingly been going to bed unfulfilled, that fire may already be gone--with much the same speed in which a shallow, lustfully founded relationship fizzles.The sooner the significant others of hard working average guys can cease daydreaming about this fallacy, the better.",,Anonymous,Romance
The movie was worth the time,"I didn't read any books before this movie and had only heard bad reviews. I had a very open mind to the movie and I ended up with being satisfied in the end.The movie was not great.The storyline was a little to thin, so the movie lacked Ethos. The lack of Ethos made some parts early on in the movie a bit cringy.I think the movie had good actors. The atmosphere in the movie was also really good. There were good choices for clothes and environments which made the story gain Ethos. The good actors made me emotionally engaged with the characters. So the movie had fairly good Pathos I would say.50 Shades of Grey was a decent good watch that was worth my time. I think the movie gets unnecessary much hate, probably because its just so popular.

A Tied-Up Viewing.....,"Things out of routine always interest us as they provide us an excuse from the same boring itinerary. So a movie like ""50 SHADES OF GREY"" would naturally pique interest of the general audience as it advertised itself as a movie dealing with sadomasochism (S & M) bondage included and yes! it is based on a bestseller of the same name by E.L. James.While we jog through the wafer thin plot which mainly deals with the protagonist Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) meeting a business tycoon Charles Grey (Jamie Dornan) while being stand-in for her friend during an interview session. Grey falls for and through what appears as an innocent courtship pulls her into his world of pleasure and pain. He makes it clear that he does not want any emotional attachment (no touching him, no sleeping on the same bed, no dates) and also sends her a copy of an NDA which he expects her to sign.While Anastasia takes her own time in deciding to sign the contract, she finds herself falling in love with Grey and experiences Grey's weird taste in love making which also involves punishment if she disobeys him during their sessions.Anastasia soon gets tired of this one sided relationship which is not going anywhere.Dakota Johnson is excellent as Anastasia Stelle, her innocent charm and most of the child like lines give you the perfect protagonist as against the ""in control"" women in porn flicks. Her performance is noteworthy in scenes when she discusses the contract in depth with Grey and the final outburst.Jamie Dornan, underplays his character and gives a nod to Dakota Johnson, as the film truly belongs to her. But yes, there is a spark of fine performance especially in scenes where he explains his childhood trauma and the switch from suave businessman into a sadistic lover.Kelly Marcel's screenplay is fantastic and does not actually dump you with love-making scenes for no rhyme or reason, but actually uses these scenes to actually let the audience have a grasp of how Anasatasia is changing in character and the pain she undergoes emotionally. The screenplay at parts does give you a feeling that what you are watching is nothing but glorified porn, but to Marcel's defense, that's what the novel does on which the movie is based.Music by Danny Elfman is excellent as always, and adds a little something during the love making scenes which in fact is in sync with the characters emotions during those scenes. The music is what makes this movie different from other porn flicks.The reason I keep categorizing this movie as porn is because what do you categorize a movie which has 7 minutes of love making scenes every 15 minutes or so? But, we cannot say we were not warned about that? And yes! lot of people walked into cinemas because of that promise......which the filmmakers did not break.Sam Taylor Johnson's direction is top-notch, giving a classy touch to what could have been just another film with naked bodies. He handled the scenes with the emotional content really well and with a lot of help from Seamus McGarvey (DOP) who used his lens to cover the beauty of Vancouver and giving us a sweep of the Grey world as well as a modest look at the Steele world.Would I recommend it to anyone? Yes as long as I am sure that the people I am recommending this film to are not sick of S&M, Bondage and other forms of unnatural love making.I would rate it 4 upon 5",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
There are some flaws but overall I enjoyed it.,"To start with I would say that the movie is hit and miss. I do not agree with the one-star reviews though. There is more to that 'porn' as some people are describing it and limiting it to. Some of the lines were a little ridiculous I agree. And some of the lines were pretty funny! So to me it was a little bit of comedy, erotica, drama, romance. I am still deciding how I feel about Dakota Johnson as Anastasia. At first I thought she was super awkward and shy and boring. But I think she became more and more confident as the movie progressed. She has some witty and funny lines. Jamie Dornan did a great job as Christian Grey. Of course as I woman I thought he was super hot and in the sex scenes, which by the way are done very well, he knew exactly what he was doing. I have not read the book so I did not know that it's not just about the sex in it. But the movie is clearly revealing that there is a deeper reason as to why Christian is how he is. I think the first movie was an exciting opening and definitely makes me want to see more and know what's going to happen next. I have friends that have read the books and say there is more unexpected to come. So I will definitely see the other movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Should be renamed ""Fifty Shades of Boring""","I didn't read the book. Prior to seeing the movie, I only saw trailers and briefly heard about the movie from news and others. The movie was what I expected in terms of story. But the acting was lackluster from everyone. The directing was minimally acceptable. I almost fell asleep a couple of times. I think the hype was mostly because someone wanted to tell a story of the taboo S&M sexual practices. So it was supposed to be ""racy, daring and different"". Apparently I missed the memo on how bad it was since I saw it on opening day and the theater was about 15% full. It's sad that I'll never get this two hours and three minutes out of my life back.

"The actors try their hardest, but Fifty Shades of Grey deserves fifty spanks","If you ask any guy, then chances are that if you bring up the idea of watching a chick flick, then they'll probably give you that look that questions not only their masculinity, but of all masculinity representation all together. It's not that I think that all chick flicks are bad, but when it comes to making and promoting film for a women audience, then the executives of the production company are probably not going to put a lot of effort into. They'll simply look at When Harry met Sally, Love Story, and Pretty Woman and slap together what they think works.So more then often, movie studios will turn to romance novels as a quick way to make more movies for women. The setups are very similar; a woman who wants more out of life meets a mysterious man who changes their perspective and then something comes in between that will tear the two apart only for one of then to realize that they were wrong and get back together and live happily ever after. The Twilight franchise is probably the most obvious example, yet is one of the most successful of the chick flicks. Now we go from vampires tosubmission erotica in Fifty Shades of Grey.Fittingly enough, we open in the grey Seattle where Ana Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) is filling in for her journalism major friend to conduct an interview a young corporate executive, Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). The interview starts out awkward, but the young stud seams to have interest in the young innocent. She encounters him again ad the hardware store she works at and asks her to a coffee shop outing. Though she initially leaves, he goes as far to send her a first edition of a Thomas Hardy novel to show his interest in her.She still seams resilient to his advances until he takes her home after getting a phone call from a drunken Ana. When he doesn't take advantage of her, the two start dating and the two seem pretty good. This all comes to a halt when Christian reveals that he has a hobby on the sidelinesbondage. Yep, he's into the handcuffs, whips, and other naughty things that shock Ana at first, but agrees to go with. She signs a non disclosure contract and agrees with Christian that they are playing and not ""sleeping together"".Fifty Shades of Grey sounds more like a soft-core porn story then a genuine movie. Though the hard R rating is well earned, I don't know if I say that it went as far as it could have gone. I have seen erotica dramas that are far better (like Last Tango in Paris and Chloe) and most people have already gone as far to call this a waste of time even before it was released. It came and gone and honestly, it could have been worse.Oh it's badly written (I mean laughably bad dialogue bad), but I can tell that director Sam Taylor-Johnson tried her hardest to make this more thrilling then anything.Dakota Johnson has a lot of talent. So does Jamie Dornan. The two have genuine chemistry and try their hardest to make some bad writing work. It doesn't even come close though I still applaud their effort. The novel of the same name, from what I'm told, is just as empty and bland, but the production seems to want to make this work. I'm clearly not the target audience, but I think that the same audience who loves the book will still like thisThere's not much else to say other then it had an odd ending that seems to only set up for a sequel. It'll probably receive one, but it's not on my pleasure list.I'll give this four sexy handcuffs out of ten.

Not worth money,"Look, the books were badly written in the first place so adapting this to the big screen was a bad idea from the get go......

She did just that. Even the author agrees that the books are badly written. She says that she is normally more disciplined. Also as someone in the BDSM lifestyle, everything is so wrong about what is done. The playroom is awesome though but for instance the knot tying around her wrists is done with a very lazy knot that is not secure and can tighten done to easily cutting of blood flow.

The deep breathing, fist clenching, shouting etc. seem out of place for there is no real cause for them. And it gets more and more random.

-50 Shades of Charisma,"I cannot believe I persevered with this truly dire film, hoping at some point it would redeem itself. No such luck unfortunately, minutes of my life I'll never get back. The leads had zero charisma or chemistry, and with such a poor script I guess it's no surprise, so the writers can shoulder some of the blame.Really speaking though, while it would have been somewhat predictable casting 'known' more suitable leads, it would have at least made things a tad more bearable. I suppose the dilemma is finding Hollywood 'A-list's', that are willing to gamble their career.Anyway to sum it up: creepy, icky, awkward, unconvincing, z-movie, lame, wooden, worse than 'Show Girls' (rating-wise; as I thankfully haven't seen that pile of poo), actors & film crew who must've thought OMG have I really involved myself in such an embarrassingly bad project (oh heck at least I'm getting paid loads), Thunderbirds puppets delivered lines more convincingly and had oodles more presence, worse accents than Dick Van Dyke (""Chitty bang-bang, chitty chitty bang-bang!"" 😁), unsexy, not a jot of romance, more cringe worthy than watching your folks getting frisky.

"Man, you swallowed those blue pills faster than any previous victim","If the title 50 Shades of Grey, aside from the obvious play off a character name, is meant to imply some sort of moral ambiguity or complexity on the subject of love, sex, and kink, then there is definitely a case for a class action law suit here.Full disclosure: I have not read the book. I know some who have read it, in full and in part. The impression I got from what talk I heard of the book was that it was just an unusually successful dirty book. I'm male, I have access to the internet, and don't feel enough of a sense of guilt over my dirty thoughts to have to dress them up in a story to read to give them good taste. Now, for the romantically inclined who are rolling their eyes right now, I beg you to not misunderstand me. I do have a sense of romance, and can enjoy a romantic story. If the movie is any kind of reflection on the book, however, you won't find any romance there. That isn't itself a bad thing if the movie is just serving to scratch an erotic itch for you. I'm willing to bet this movie will fail miserably in that department for you as well.The principle issue with this movie as romance is both characters seem to suffer from some form of personality disorder. Our male lead, the not-so-secretly kinky billionaire Christian Grey, is supposed to be the archetype of the bad boy the female gets to ""fix"" and settle down with but this aspect of his character is handled with no grace at all. The script literally has him telling us that characterizations of him being heartless are based on just simple fact. He warns her, in about three different ways, that he and the whole love thing don't mix. He's in the market for a sex slave and he is more than willing to engage in polite and professional negotiations about it while he cuddles with you in the bath, and takes you to dinner with his family. Aside from the contradictions, he also suffers from Twilight syndrome in that most of his words and actions would be huge red flags that would have any woman reaching for a Taser or panic whistle and running.Not a problem for the sheltered Anastasia Steele. (Excuse me as I groan every time I speak that name). Upon meeting the apparently dreamy Grey she offers very little hesitation in the ""play room"" and seems to be having a good time in the steamy scenes that she judges him intensely for because they are painful and demeaning. There is the most hilarious example of this that I can't even give you as it would qualify as a spoiler being essentially the end of the film.If you wanted to see this film because of the sexual content, lower your expectations. The movie is rated R, there is nudity and simulated sex. Most of the ""kink"" is in dialog, and the two actors have zero chemistry with each other. The lack of chemistry combined with awkward and questionable character behavior throw a cold shower on any eroticism. One odd note, if you're a straight male whose girl wants you watch this with her, don't worry, it was directed by a straight guy who apparently had little regard for this movie's target audience. It suffers terribly from male gaze, as the camera is on the woman way more than the man. As I said though, it's little comfort as the scenes just don't work. I watched this with a friend and we were hoping the much cuter guy who shows up for a few seconds in one scene in the hardware store would appear again.To readers who have seen this movie, can someone help me? There is a scene where Anastasia wakes to find ""eat me"" and ""drink me"" signs on the bed side table, and the ""eat me"" tray looks like it has big blue pills. Are these pills? Are they candy? Can someone tell me what they are? I've never seen anything like it and I certainly wouldn't have popped them in my mouth without a second thought! Is this a Matrix sequel? Seriously, the blue pills are bothering me!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 Shades of bad,"I went into viewing this with no expectations having not read the book so I like to think I was unbiased. What a total disappointment on every level. This movie is a turd.And Hello??!! Does anyone else see the obvious references to 9 1/2 Weeks? Which after just re-watching 9 1/2 weeks I can say is so much better in every sense and still holds up after all these years.Ugh 50 Shades.....want my time back!!OK so I need to write a minimum of 10 lines to post this review.

No Shades of Humanity,"So I finished watching the dreaded - and dreadful - Fifty Shades of Grey. It really was a struggle to get through this movie. I only read part of the first book and thought it was problematic due to the Domestic Abuse that happens throughout the story. Although it has been somewhat toned down for the movie, it still remains the same.I'll go through the Pros first. The cinematography, wardrobe, lighting, set direction, and soundtrack (with the exception of Ellie Goulding) was top notch. However, the old adage, ""You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"" really is true in this case. Everything was very sleek, modern, and sophisticated, almost sterile, recalling Mickey Rourke's office and apartment in 9 1/2 Weeks, but on Steroids.The Cons are everything else. Dakota Johnson's acting was probably the closest to being the most competent out of everyone and she seemed close to being human in the few moments where she asserted herself and stood up to Grey (which I wish there were more of). She did have little bits of humor I thought were cute. Otherwise, she constantly bit her lip (the Ana character also does this a lot in the book), which was annoying. Once or twice would have been okay, but it was distracting. She constantly had this sickly, unhealthy look in her eyes and face. She is supposed to be vulnerable, but there's a difference between vulnerable and just plain weak - she was definitely the latter, whether consciously or unconsciously.Jamie Dornan fared less well. His Irish accent slipped out a few times and he seemed like he was reading through his lines instead of truly emoting or becoming Christian Grey. Not that Christian Grey is a human enough character anyway, or anyone else in this film, for that matter. My biggest problem with this film (other than the Domestic Abuse) is none of the characters seem real or true to life. The dialogue was weak, awkward, and stilted. It did not flow naturally like real dialogue is supposed to sound. Everyone, including the lead actress (although she was the most ""human""), was very two-dimensional. When you watch a film, you want to feel like you're going through the character's emotions and struggles, you want the couple to get together, to overcome their problems and obstacles. That just wasn't here in this film. I struggled to make sense of why these two people even get together in the first place. In real life, I would've gotten a restraining order on this guy, no matter how ""hot"" or rich he is. There are several instances in which stalking takes place. She asks for space constantly and he never gives it to her. I could go on, but you get the (twisted) picture.As far as the sex itself (which is what many people have raised a fuss about), it's nothing to write home about, although it was tastefully presented. This movie is surprisingly vanilla for a hot-button topic like BDSM. You will not see real BDSM in this film. I would suggest seeing a classic erotic film like The Story of O, 9 1/2 Weeks, Belle du Jour, or something more recent like Secretary. I have seen more explicit sex watching Cinemax at 1:30 in the morning. It was nothing groundbreaking. The sex scenes seemed more like music videos than anything. Ana doesn't even have an orgasm. For a movie that was made and produced by women, it seriously shows a lack of demonstrating to women how female pleasure should be presented on the screen.Much has been made of the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I have seen lots of cinematic on-screen couples with far more heat. There were moments when there is an obvious lack of chemistry such as the scene where a photographer takes their picture at Ana's graduation ceremony. When the same picture shows up in a copy of a newspaper later on in the film, it is obvious the two clearly dislike each other (on and off the screen).Honestly, this movie was very depressing and although I made fun of it in the beginning, toward the end I felt uncomfortable and disturbed. Even though I didn't pay for it, I felt guilty that I even watched it, even out of curiosity. This is not empowering to women and it is not a relationship anyone should aspire to. Yes, I realize it was a fantasy that E.L. James created based on Twilight fan fiction. Of course you must have a suspension of disbelief whenever you watch any film, but in this case I could not. Money and power does not excuse the fact that abusive relationships can and do exist. Real life Anas haven't been so lucky. Many of them end up in shelters, on the run and in hiding, or dead.Does this mean anything in this movie could cause people to abuse others? Not necessarily, no. But if anything else I hope something like this starts a discussion about how we should help Domestic Abuse and Domestic Violence victims get on the road to living a better life. I hope women realize a relationship with a controlling man, no matter how materially generous of physically attractive he may be, is destructive and unhealthy. I hope this inspires other filmmakers out there to make better films that show sexuality in the context of a healthy, happy relationship. That's what I hope people get out of this above all else.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining but NOT...,"5.3/10 Fifty Shades of Grey might not be as bad as people wanted it to be, or at least thought it would be. But it sure conveys a pretty bad message and overall feeling. Yes, it might be sexy at times but it was never arousing nor appealing. But instead it gives you this sense of worry for Anastasia-played very well by Dakota Johnson-because she clearly has no identity or self respect, and so it can be somewhat dark and disturbing. Meanwhile, Christian-portrayed blandly by Jamie Dornan-is clearly a control freak that wants to use and control her but it is all extremely sugar coated, that it might even seem as true romance, but it is not for the most part. However, the movie was indeed very well directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson based on its material, and it's cinematography looked very nice as well. Also, the soundtrack of the movie was fairly good, but sometimes too distracting when played in the more erotic scenes. That said, the movie is not as graphic as you might think in my opinion, but still it has its moments of roughness. Moreover, as I mentioned before, the performances were partially good, mainly from Dakota Johnson who gives this awkwardness and lightness to her character in a very dark movie, but it is Jaime Dornan that clearly misses the mark and comes out as more secondary and kind of empty, only depending on his looks and attractiveness. Overall, this is surely one of those movies that people will love to hate, or at least that's how I feel, even though I'm still undecided what to really think, because it has much more than just this masochistic relationship, it's not as simple as black or white, and so that's what really challenges me to really analyze it and see what it is trying to say. Thus, it was entertaining but not quite as shocking, and it might not be the healthiest romance on film but still it has a big impact on today's society and culture, so hopefully it won't influence as much. But still, it is something ""fun"" and out of the ordinary to experience at the movie theater by yourself, and decide if you like it or not.~February 12, 2015~",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The problem is... it's boring,"I must say that having not yet ventured into any sexual activity, let alone BDSM, I went into this movie for the mere curiosity surrounding it. And much like the Twilight movies, I found myself bored and unpleased. Basically this movie is about nothing, and not in the good Seinfeld way. To tell you the truth, the only parts with some actual excitement to them were the more spicy ones. It's nothing too extreme, but still sexy in a small way. While the movie does have some good set decoration and wardrobe, that's about all the redeeming qualities about it. The leads share little chemistry, the dialog is awful and the script is about as pointless as it gets. Let's be honest here, I know this is for the ladies looking to see their fantasies on screen and I don't condone that. Still it's clear that apart from those ""bold scenes"", there isn't much more to this movie and its future sequels.Rating: 1/10",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty Shades of Boredom,"I recently watched this with my girlfriend thinking it might get her in the mood. I've never read the book but I've heard so many women gushing about how great they are I thought it would be worth a go. Well it turns out it isn't sexy at all, it's just plain boring. There is no chemistry at all between the lead actors and what they engage in is nothing like the BDSM I've dabbled in, no, it's just plain abuse of a naive and spineless young girl by a run of the mill narcissist that inexplicably has untold billions of dollars. Grey, like any narcissist is internally weak, empty and full of self-loathing which he overcompensates for with his carefully crafted facade and material assets. The only reason I'm giving it more than 1 star is because I've seen a few movies that were truly excruciating and at least this one had nicely done sets, some impressive cinematography and Dakota Johnson, while a bit scrawny for my tastes is easy on the eyes and spends a decent amount of time naked. None of that is enough to make me to recommend this though, most of this movie just feels like boring filler. If you're looking for a movie that will turn on your lady you're likely to be sorely disappointed, and if this dull drivel does turn her on then you may wish to reconsider your choice of partner.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
was OK,"OK so being my first movie review that I felt I had to do, I thought the movie could have followed the book a bit more closely. If who ever decides the ratings on these movies wanted to make it nc17 the producers needed more flesh to be shown. The acting could have been done better and Ana was OK, but she just seemed awkward. The lip biting was very forced, at least it looked like it. There were a lot of things that was not explained in the movie that needed to be explained. The supposed emails they were writing back and forth did not look like emails bit rather like IM's. Having read the books, I feel that this movie did not do them justice. The books are not as poorly written as some say, they need to stop over thinking the writing and take the book for what it is not for a classic. I really wanted this movie to be really great but in the end it just left me shaking my head wondering if the producers had even spoken with the author or bothered to read the books. E L James, great books, but dear fight for your movie, it's worth it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dialogue Writing,"This will be a very short review, focused on one single aspect of the movie... the dialogue writing. The dialogue writing in this movie is among the worst of the thousands of movies I've watched. Off the top of my head, I cannot recall any movie that has dialogue as bad as this. I have never read the book, so I have no idea if this is a product of staying true to the source material, I am only judging it in the context of the movie. Characters speak in terribly obvious and unnatural exposition, with long pauses after sentences, so the audience can presumably absorb the subtext. You could shut the picture off altogether, as virtually everything happening is explained in mundane detail by the characters. The dialogue is written at an English level and pacing that would likely be deemed too slow for a children's movie. The movie wasn't for me, so I'm not a good judge of it overall, but as a human being who reads and watches films, I can say the dialogue writing was insulting to my intelligence. Advice... keep your expectations even lower than they may already be.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful! Deep! Real!,"I was intrigued to see this because of all the bad reviews and the one good one. I thought this movie was great and had great depth. There was good chemistry between them. She was healthy and loved herself enough to say no. He had never met anyone that he couldn't control and had feelings for. He was obviously in need of healing from all the abuse he suffered, and she gave him a taste of what real love is, and set boundaries of what she would and wouldn't accept. She was not seduced by his wealth and power. In real life, I believe people are attracted to others because they trigger unhealed issues within them. She gave him an opportunity to begin to reevaluate his behavior and childhood abuse. She opened his heart as much as he could allow and triggered an opportunity to begin to heal if he so chose. Everything in this movie was consensual between them which confirms our own free choice and what we are willing and unwilling to accept. People can only abuse you if you allow them to. Real love is not abusive. I thought this movie was important and a mirror for all of us in relationships. I admire her strength for being able to walk away and say no, despite her attraction, desire, and love for him. There are great lessons here for anyone who truly wants a healthy and loving relationship and healing of their past issues, which will always follow us into the next relationship until we do the real work of facing, dealing, releasing, and healing our own issues and needs for love. For anyone who has no interest in that, then this is not the movie for you. Relationships are powerful mirrors and an opportunity to heal and evolve. It was a powerful relationship, one in which each will be forever changed and forced to look within. If you are only interested in a superficial, feel good relationship and unwilling to do the deep inner work, I can see why you wouldn't like this movie. I loved it! It was nice to see something real.

Definitely underrated!,"One can say that it is a sort of Cinderella story, where a simple girl is suddenly overwhelmed by this stunning handsome gentle millionaire who takes an interest to her, she becomes fascinated, maybe even infatuated. However, it is no classic Cinderella, as she goes on to realize that he is in fact, no prince charming. Because of her immaturity and inexperience, at first she does not take his ""problems"" seriously to only when she's matured realize that.I read just beyond half of the book and could not finish it. That kind of writing wasn't for me. But as a giant fan of cinema I must say this movie wasn't half so bad. The picture is amazing, the soundtrack is beautiful and the mystery portrayed by Christian Grey is very convincing. I felt that Dakota Johnson did a pretty decent job as Anastasia and was also very convincing in naivety and inexperience. I definitely look forward the sequel as I could not put myself through books 2 and 3. I do think they could have shown Christian as a more problematic overachiever, like in the book, and maybe show more of his past, but then again, the film is more concentrated in his obsession with ""getting the girl"", and getting her to agree to his crazy proposal.But I definitely enjoyed he film!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"How bad could it be? Well, now I know.","I thought I've seen some bad movies in my time. But this does take the cake. And the cigar. And the cherry on top. This thing (I'm reluctant to call it a movie) is so ridiculously, incredibly bad that I'm genuinely feeling sorry for myself for having wasted 2.5 hours of my precious life on this. And even the fact that my wife now appreciates the effort that I've made by watching this with her can't make me feel any better.This film fails on every level. The nonsensical script feels like something that was written by a 15 year old who'd been watching too many music videos. We all know the source wasn't great literature to start with, but the script apparently stays close enough to the novel, making it just as bad if not worse.The acting is depressingly irritating. Jamie Dornan's character is supposed to be a charismatic dominant. Instead he is a robot with a single voice tonality. Dakota Johnson is trying her best not to laugh, and I can't blame her really, but unfortunately it does nothing for her acting. And since most of the screen time is shared between those two their lack of chemistry is too obvious.The soundtrack is nauseatingly predictable. Not a single courageous choice there, nothing memorable or emotionally involving.Lastly, I think this movie completely outdid itself by making sex scenes not sexy. Arguably BDSM isn't everyone's cup of tea, but not every sex scene here is BDSM. And yet this surely was the first movie I've ever watched where I found myself falling asleep during almost every scene involving some kind of intimacy. In fact, I felt compelled to skip forward a few times because I just couldn't be bothered with watching those two make sex look unappealing.And now I know that I'll probably have to spend another 5 hours watching the second and third installments of this thing, and it's enough to make want to hit the bottle.No redeeming qualities.1/10 (way too generous)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 shades of ABUSE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is a tale of stalking, domestic violence, abuse, and torture, dressed up like a love story! My honest to god biggest fear of 50 Shades of Grey is not that people will watch it, because people will, but that abusers will use it to brainwash their victims more than they already do. That more women will be left wondering why this isn't making them happy when it's suppose to. And more women will be hurt in worse ways because ""this is what everyone else wants."" If someone you care about likes 50 Shades of Grey, ask them if they would be okay with you being in a relationship like that. Ask them what they would do if you came to them and told them your boyfriend is controlling what you eat, what you wear, what you do, and is making you do sex acts you aren't comfortable with. Ask them what they would say if you told them that a man you just met is stalking you at work.

50 Shades of Wasted Time and Limited BDSM Knowledge,"Couple years ago managed to force myself through the first book to see what the fuss was about. I have literally read fanfictons with more substance and far better sex scenes. Went to see the movie with my sister to see if they'd managed to adapt it into something tolerable. They haven't.The movie is just as awful. Bland. Dull. Absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads, which is sort of important in a supposed 'romance' movie, I was very tempted to leave less than halfway through and get a refund. The plot is very almost non existent, there's no logical explanation for Grey wanting Ana, there's no VALID back story for the reason Christian is ""F*ed up"", extremely limited character building and no substance.The script is beyond poor, some lines that were supposed to be sexy were downright laughable and there were awkward laughs shared by people in the cinema on more than one occasion. The acting was wooden (I've seen my younger brother act more convincingly) and both leads were far from arousing, even to one another it seemed.And for those of you who have looked extensively through the reviews on here, I'd like you to know that the men and women who have rated this higher than a 3* and claim to see no abuse, have probably never participated or even looked up the BDSM community.The consent in this movie (if you can call it that) is questionable at best, and the fact that he doesn't even CONSIDER her input and tentativeness towards some things in his contract shows that. He tries to OWN her. He stalks her and controls everything she does from the moment they meet. That is not a consensual relationship. That is abuse. It sickens me that young women BELIEVE that this sort of behavior is OK.BDSM is nothing like anything in this movie. In a BDSM consensual relationship EVERYTHING is on the subs terms. Absolutely everything. If the sub says stop, you stop. If the sub is happy, you're happy. If the sub says no, you don't push it. What Ana and Christian exhibit is a controlling, manipulative relationship, please look up BDSM and be safe if you're wanting to try and spice up your love life.

If I had a time machine and could only go back in time and change one thing, I would not go to this movie. The singularly tolerable thing about this movie was the soundtrack, but even then the horrendously filmed BDSM scenes have pretty much ruined any song by Ellie Goulding or The Weeknd for me.

"I loved it, it was exactly as it was supposed to be.","I saw this film on Valentine's weekend, And as all book to film situations the film lacks the description, and this book holds a lot of description especially where fueling imagination goes. The film always had a lot to live up to. But i think they did it well. A few of the scenes jumped through quite quickly without explaining what was happening so I'm hoping maybe when they release the DVD there will be some uncut scenes added or bonus scenes. I think you understand Ana quite well but you miss some of Christians Depth, and how he really feels about Ana.

No chemistry!,"Pro (there is one): pretty cinematography Cons: lifeless, bland, no chemistry between the main characters, corny lines, horrible writing, boring, weird casting choices, very few and tame sex scenes, insincere and forced ""passion"" and bad actingMy fiancé and I wasted our Valentine's Day night watching this. There were times in the movie where the dialogue or the line was so corny that the entire movie theater laughed. I had relatively high expectations for the movie. I read the 3 books a few years ago. While they certainly reeked of Bella and Edward, and poorly written erotica, this movie is worse. It was so boring. A very poor adaption of an already poorly thought out story.Jamie Dornan was not good a fit for Christian Grey. I have see him in a few other things and enjoy his work. I'm not sure if it was the writing or him, but everything he said came out awkward and overly rehearsed. The American accent did not work great for him either. Dakota Johnson I did not really like either for this role. I have never seen her in many thing else but while she fits the character of Ana more than Jamie fits Christian, I feel like her acting was not great. Everyone else in this filmed absolutely sucked at acting as well (or maybe it was the poor screenplay - I don't know). I noticed they took a lot of stuff verbatim from the book - it was a lot better left on paper. A lot of the lines, like I said, just sounded unnatural and weird.One thing this movie lacked a lot of was the natural grace and realistic dialogue that good acting has. The actors and the screenplay sounded very unrealistic and nothing anyone would ever actually say in real life. It was just not relatable - it totally missed that very important aspect of believability and naturalness. Everything sounded over produced and scripted.This movie also has one of the most severe cases of lack of chemistry that I have ever seen between two main love interest characters. I didn't feel like it was believable at all that they liked each other. It felt like a lot of weird fake forced passion from Christian's end and again just really unnatural.Not to mention, the movie was super boring, even more so than the book. The plot seemed very predictable and I am not exactly sure where the climax of the movie was supposed to be. I guess the end - but it was a pretty dry climax.Neither my boyfriend or I enjoyed this movie and I feel like I wasted my money. Way over hyped. There are no real redeemable qualities about the actors, writing, sex or anything else that a good movie has. I do applaud the great marketing campaign this movie committed to for most of 2014.

Not that bad,"First I'd like to say that a review should stay objective, how can you be objective when you give 1 or 10 stars to this kind of movie? Even if you hated it, you have to admit that the soundtrack is quite good and that the director did a decent job. I also understand that you can love this movie but you can't say that Dackota Johnson and Jamie Dorman deserve an Oscar for their performances. I am a male and I wasn't expecting much of this adaptation but surprisingly I enjoyed it. This movie is not a sexist soft-porn. It's just another love story. Christian is not too handsome and has a strong voice witch gives him the credibility needed. Ana has the kind of natural beauty that gives her the innocence needed. The director managed to make you feel their complicated personality without to much psychological details. I was a bit disappointed by the sex scenes that could have felt more intense. I'll have to wait for the next one to talk about the plot,I hope it gets a bit better. This movie made me curious, I wan't to know how this is gonna end.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
All for nothing.,"What can I say, another director who cares more about making the money, rather than actually making a decent film. If your going to make a movie based on a controversial book, then go the whole 9 yards with it, Don't just tip toe around the topic. That's the feeling I got from this film, If anything; a couple more cuts here or there it could possibly of been a 15. I think that's the certificate the director was secretly going for (More money, more viewers) but realised that was not going to happen. Other reviewers have touched on the Twilight series comparison, I have to agree it's going down that route. To summarise; another poor adaptation which will leave many fans of the book, scratching their heads, thinking: was that it!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
I made an account just to warn everyone how boring it was,"Drink 6 Redbulls before you walk in, if not you will fall asleep... so non plot developing, so awful, so...slow and ignorant we walked out 1:30 in so agitated at how lame of a movie it was I didn't even ask for a refund for fear of just spreading negative energy... Just.... it was worse than ""open water"". Just a horrible movie. This was like porn for 1920 Amish community... mind you it was... 20 min of talking about an agreement on paper, then a truly boring sex scene trying to bring bush back ( not the president ) Followed by another 20 min of a rich guy driving around going.. "" come on.. you should sign the paperwork"" then another lame scene... it was awful.. just ignorant..just...a horrible use of time. It was so awful everyone in the theater could have been on their phone and I would have cared less. Anyone that says this movie was entertaining is just... a odd person that identifies with the female character... a boring person. They have made 81 million on watching a rated R movie of ""you got mail"" with no plot... it was just... pathetic.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
ewwww,"the adverts made it look amazing, they hype surrounding it made it seem amazing, that actual movie made it awfulnever have i seen such boring acting, even the line 'mr Grey will see you now' is just awful and she couldn't have sounded more bored saying it, the only truly amazing thing i saw in the whole movie was a bunch of excited 18-25 year old women walking in with huge grins and leaving in horror as they had just realised that their sexual fantasy does not stretch that far. It was cute their sex at the start but the second he put the tie on her wrists i just got weird.in conclusion i am pretty sure there are websites on the internet which have better quality bondage then this and you don't have to pay £15 for it!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a joke,Don't waste your money or time. This movie is disappointing in every way. Starts trying to be a love movie between a rich guy and a college student and 15 minutes later it's all about nudity BDSM and terrible unromantic rough sex.The WOMAN'S DIGNITY IS EXPLOITED TO THE MAX BY A RICH GUY WHO HAS SERIOUS SEXUAL ISSUES AND THE MOVIE TRIES TO ADDRESS THOSE SEXUAL BDSM ISSUES AND THE WOMAN TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS RICH GUY IS SO SEXUALLY PERVERTED. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NICE LOVE STORY BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE THAT IS SO ROMANTIC ON VALENTINE'S DAY YOU CAN FORGET IT. IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.I walked out towards the middle of the movie almost throwing up that the movie community would have the nerves to put something like this out and ruin everyone's valentine's day..,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of Time,"A complete and utter waste of time. I can see this movie landing itself a world record for worst movie of the 21st century. However, I don't exactly blame the crew behind the movie's production; how could anyone make a good movie out of a horrible book? The plot is poor, the acting is cringe-worthy, and the concepts presented are shabby at best. It seems they're putting anything into theaters these days... I wouldn't be surprised to find a movie adaptation of yesterday's newspaper. In fact, said movie adaptation would probably get better reviews than this rubbish.I recommend not seeing this movie, but instead spending your time doing something you would actually enjoy, like watching grass grow or paint dry.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I beg you, no award please","The damage is done, the book and the movie are out there. The big fat question is: really? Twilight is not enough now? does any American women feel it's OK to be treated like this in a relationship? I am a Chinese and we were told to respect other religion/life style/choices people make. So I will hold my tongue here and only say this, please do not give any award to this movie.. we have more population who are less educated and less experienced to the comprehensive ability to adapt to the recent development of human desire and happiness, please think about what they would think and start doing after watching this movie ... Our people won't be able to read the reviews here on IMDb to know that there are thousands of normal people gracefully giving their reviews on how terrible this movie had made them feel (oh how I suffered since the beginning) and if you guys give it any award, the media in China (before watching it themselves) would immediately make a big deal of it and the damage would be irreversible. oh yes, they tell would say its award winning in America!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Missed Opportunity,"I read the book and was interested to see how they would adapt it into a film that was both, true to the source material and would appeal to the mass market. The filmmakers may have been attempting to do both, but in trying to please everyone, they seem to have fallen short on all accounts.The lack of faith to E. L. James's novel is noticeable right from the opening scene, when Christian Grey is shown with his shirt off. Grey's lack of comfort ability being shirtless is a rather major plot point in the book and the movie completely writes off a major part of his backstory immediately. This details sets the tone for the divergence from the book right from the opening.The casting choice in this movie was the most talked about thing in Hollywood for the past year. Despite the high profile search for the leads, they managed to cast two characters who just never found their mark. Dornan does a decent job inhabiting the character, but his American accent is atrocious and he never manages to capture the magnetism that Christian Grey possesses. Dakota Johnson is just terrible. There is nothing much I can say positive for her performance. She appears awkward with the dialog and uninterested in everything around her. The worst part though, is the fact that the two leads seem to have zero chemistry. Nothing about their on screen time together feels genuine. The whole thing feels forced and rushed. So much emphasis is placed on innuendo it can hardly be called subtle and becomes more of a joke than anything with sex appeal or intrigue.The soundtrack feels like a parade of high up celebrities and though it has some excellent songs feels distracting. The music becomes memorable as opposed to making the scene itself something that burns in your memory. More of an emphasis on the score would have better served the director.The decision was made to go for an R rating as opposed to a PG-13. This decision typically limits an audience, so the decision should seem worth it. Unfortunately, despite the R rating the actual sex scenes were tepid at best. The film displayed a poor display of BDSM knowledge. (The first book does not dive into anything too deep BDSM related, but the movie does a terrible job displaying even the light work.) Lastly, the Hollywood double standard of nudity is ever present. Dakota spends a fair amount of screen time topless but the make lead never does. For a movie that is marketed as a steamy romance this movie appears to fall short and comes across as shy and unsure of itself.The movie does not deserve a 1,2, or 3 star. Those people are just judging because they do not care for the trendiness of the material. The movie is not terrible, it just fails to shine. A missed opportunity to make something great and possibly expose a larger audience to what healthy BDSM could look like.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Loved all 3 of the movies butt Anna really annoys me,like to the point I cant even watch the 2nd and 3rd movie anymore","Okay don't get me wrong I loved all three of the Fifty Shades movies but honestly Anna in the 2nd and 3rd movies she is highly annoying to the point where I can't even watch the movies more than once anymore and honestly I think they could have gotten a much better looking and prettier woman than her with a better body as well but my real complaint is that she's highly annoying!!! I know it's probably in the script and that's how she's supposed to be but I wish they never made her that way because like I said I get so annoyed watching the second and third movie and the second movie honestly is my favorite out of all 3 but once again she's highly annoying and the way she talks,her voice is even more annoying just wish they have gotten someone else to play Anna. They should of NEVER let Dakota johnson play the part of Anastasia steel,she was Absolutely horrible and She Can't act...I really wish they would redo all 3 movies the same way but with a different Anesthesia.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful awful awful!!,"Firstly, I can't get over how cringe worthy bad this movie was. I had very low expectations because I didn't think the books were that great but I didn't expect the movie to be so shocking! Five minutes into the movie I knew I would hate it. The icing on the cake was the scene after she interviews Christian and he says ""Anastasia"" at the elevator, it sounded so put on and fake. And I found this through the whole movie.The acting is horrible and wooden. The main actors American accent is SO bad. He can't keep the accent up so very often during the movie he slips up. The girl is slightly better but still bad. The two of them have absolutely no chemistry. None at all. The lack of chemistry is what makes so many of the scenes laughable. She looks very old for her age and she looks tired most of the movie. I found all the acting scenes put on and I couldn't take one scene seriously. I spent majority of the time laughing out loud. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema is because my friend paid for my ticket. Oh and I went to go get some extra food to get myself through the second half of the movie. The sex scenes.. well because the two leads had no chemistry and can't act, I found myself laughing and cringing again.And who the frek cast Rita Ora in this movie? Bahaha.I would rather not give this movie even a 1. But I can't score any lower. Dreadful, dreadful dreadful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Terrible plot, conversation, depiction of BDSM","This is simply a horrible movie (I'm reviewing the movie, not the book). Ana through doesn't display an innocent, studious college girl. She displays a mentally handicapped person who can't even interview or dress well for an interview or talk properly!!! She doesn't show any love for Christian except being captivated by his looks and wanting to touch him--the line comes up almost every few minutes half-way through. Neither boy nor spastic/handicapped girl display any common ground at all. Instead, there is a handicapped girl who never owns a laptop or computer (unbelievable for a student) who wants to ""love"" a guy for no reason other than looks. She's never heard of BDSM (he erroneously introduces the sport as dominant and submissive as if that's it) and then suddenly accepts it via an idiotic and poorly worded NDa and contract. Christian acts more like a stalker and serial killer than a person or even a guy wanting to like not even love her. The whole sex/tie up/spanking/blindfolding (that is not even a tie-up game) session is more like a spider tying up a dumb fly than bondage at all. The final part of ""punishment"" is more like ISIL/ISIS style torture than sexual punishment.Watch the show to see a mentally handicapped girl and a dumb guy. But as always there are people who want to love idiotic shows and TV series.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty Shades of Grey is literally Grey and really disappointing....,"I am a huge fan of the book. I love that it's different from any romance novel I know. But this movie which is an adaption to the book that I refer to is really disappointing. I think Jamie should return to acting school because the only thing that is good about him is his look and if that is the only good thing about him than he should have been a model not an actor. I love Dakota. I think she is funny and beautiful in a way that not many people see. The lack of chemistry in this movie does not go unnoticed and of course that is another disappointment from this movie. And maybe for those who have read the book, I believe you notice that the story in this movie was told way too fast. This is the main problem that I have with the movie. It's just too fast! They forgot to put many little details from the book into the movie and because of that I could not have the same connection with the movie that i have with the book. For those who haven't read the book, I suggest you not to watch this movie because you WILL be disappointed with this movie, especially if you are just curious about all the hype that is fifty shades of grey. Overall, Fifty Shades of Grey is indeed grey. It's bland and it's grey, simple as that. I just hope the next movie won't be as disappointing as this.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

If anyone say that Jamie Dornan are sexy in that movie, I beg your pardon but he's not and during the whole movie he just scream awkward.

Nothing but a bad chick flick version of BDSM,"I didn't know about 50 Shades Of Grey until February, when it was shoved onto everybody's face. I never heard of the wildly popular book, either. Of course, that's because any book that is wildly popular is usually some scribble geared to teenagers. Not to say that I haven't indulged in schlock as my brothers and I read Sidney Sheldon books in the 1990's. These days, I am a lot more careful about my reading material.So going into this movie, I knew nothing about the contents of the book or what it was all about. After viewing it, I can't understand why anybody would want to see this crud in a theater. 50 Shades Of Grey represents the nadir of Hollywood. Proof positive that crap can draw money because people will pay to watch mediocrity (which this film isn't even) and praise it because they refuse to bother looking for the much better in years past. Films from 1975 explored BDSM way more explicitly and honestly than this fluff.All this film offers are Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) doing G-rated versions of BDSM. That's it. Add in horrible acting from the entire cast, a insipid script written by Kelly Marcel in which she channels a 7th grader's mindset and terrible direction from Sam Taylor-Johnson and you have a multi Razzie Award winner come to life. Boring, unerotic and sterile is all I can say. There's much better out there in regards to films exploring BDSM. If they make a sequel, boycott it. Tell Hollywood that you're not going to get your intelligence insulted any longer.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

I had not read the book and went to watch the film with an open mind, and I'm glad that I did. They do a good job developing the characters, and the film was nothing like I thought it would be.

I watched this and some parts were sexy and others not so much, such as the beatings. Yes, the guy was pretty sexy and had a sexy voice. However, what I was expecting was a lot more ravishing I guess. No woman is going to be aroused by this, some parts yes like what he says.I knew all along that when people who are into ""rape"" themed sex on paper saw this, they might rethink that after seeing that crap with their own eyes.

Meh..,"Okay, first off, I have not read the books. I went into to this movie just expecting the worst. Well, it wasn't that horrible. Now, don't get me wrong... it wasn't a GOOD movie but I feel like its getting a worse grade than it should. Lets cover a few things: 1.) The acting. It's very vanilla. The actors have a few moments of chemistry together, but I don't feel the actors represent who these characters are supposed to be. There are some cheesy moments and lines and you can't help but laugh. When I go see a movie, I feel like the actors should pull me in, make me feel what they are portraying and that didn't happen. Grade C- 2.) The storyline. So, since I didn't read the books, I was left with questions that were never answered. I feel like some of those should have been addressed. There is sort of a story here but because of the pace of the movie, the acting, and the general non-awareness of what the heck is going on, its kind of hard to follow with them. Grade C 3.) The sex. I didn't feel that the sexual scenes were that bad. I was expecting more and a tad better because of reputation. All in all, it didn't consist of the entire movie, but I feel it shows enough to convey what the story is telling. Grade BSo, I feel like I was entertained for 2 hours and thats what I pay for. I will probably see the others just to see if my questions are ever answered. But, will I watch this again, will I buy the movies or read the books? Probably not.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing,"This is my first review but I had to write something about this movie. It was a very disappointing one. I left the movie half way through. Christian seemed pretending to be someone he clearly wasn't. Anna was better in her performance but soon joined Christian's league. In the beginning of the movie, I got a feeling that Anna was trying to be intimated by Christian more than Christian doing something to intimidate her at the interview. He almost seemed boyish. When Anna trips at the door to Christian's cabin, it was one of the most predictable scenes that one could see. Their discussions over the clauses in the agreement for whatever he wanted to do, was a joke. It was a very wooden performance. This subject did not seem to be a new one but even with that, they could have made a much better movie had they not tried to force a wolf's skin over a lamb.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Its not plausible in anyway and to top it off, its BORING. I kept waiting for something of a actual story line to emerge from the miasma but nothing came.

Better Than The Novel,"I have a tendency to read the books before the film nowadays, whereas I used to read the book after - if I enjoyed the film. The former applies to Fifty Shades. I began it in 2012, got about a third of the way though and got very bored. I hurried along when I knew the movie was coming soon. I gave the book a 2 out of 5 on Goodreads, or 4 out of 10 on my scale.The writing is juvenile, and reads at the grade five reading level. It is a book marketed to adults, but it is embarrassing to read as an adult. The dialogue is very corny and doesn't flow naturally. This is where the film is better than the book. Yes, the dialogue is still poor, but it seems more natural than the novel. Here's an example. When Christian pushes José and says something like, ""She said no, man!"" But, in the book it's something like, ""I think the lady said 'no'."" That clichéd line really stuck with me and in a way, it sums up how trite the novel is.Much of the audience reactions were that of surprise, which made me wonder how many had actually read the book. Even the abrupt ending had the audience gasping. I knew it would end abruptly, because this film is based on book one, which segues into book two and three. I don't really plan on reading the second and third books, unless film adaptations are gonna be released.The sex scenes were quite tame compared to the book, which is expected, otherwise it would have gotten an NC-17 rating, which most theatres won't carry. There's a tampon scene in the book, which is basically Christian having sex with Anastasia while she is on her period. But, this isn't in the film.A lot of the novel has internal monologue from Anastasia's perspective, and her thoughts and emotions don't translate to the screen well. She has multiple orgasms in the book, on more than one occasion, but it isn't in the film. The scenes do, however, show that she enjoys herself very much as a consenting submissive who is yet to sign a contract with her dominant, Christian Grey.The viewer has to suspend disbelief about Christian being a self-made billionaire who knows people well. For a CEO who has a strong work ethic, he seems to have a lot of free time on his hands, and lives more like a trust fund baby from billionaire parents.The cinematography is excellent, from the opening aerial shots to the one-point perspective of the elevator doors closing at the end. The two lines spoken by the main characters are ""Anastasia"" and ""Christian.""With over two hours of screen time, this film would be much shorter minus the sex scenes. And like the rest of the cinematography, these scenes are filmed well. They do a good job to eroticize the sex, although I did let out a laugh here and there. Then there's a scene at the end where we feel Anastasia's pain, which seems more emotional than physical.There isn't much of a deeper meaning or theme. There aren't many shades; it is pretty much black and white. Like the book, Christian describes himself as being fifty shades f****d up. We don't know much about him other than he is a billionaire of a company we know little about, he has mysterious marks on his chest, he was adopted, his real mother was a crack whore, and he is a talented pianist, and he can fly a helicopter. He doesn't smile much, and has an intense stare. He is not a psychopath, but he seems to only be able to express his sexual interest through sadomasochism. He himself was once a submissive. His mother's friend was his dominant when he was fifteen. Okay, so does this explain his behaviour? Yeah, they're consenting adults, but Anastasia wants more than just kinky sex. She is saddened by his constant desire to punish her, even though she enjoys it. She wants more. She wants a loving ""normal"" relationship.While this film of Fifty Shades of Grey is better than the novel, it is still not an excellent film. The director really didn't have much of a script to work with, but she did a good job considering the bland plot. I would go so far as to put it in a comedy genre. Even more comical that it was released on the week of Valentine's Day. Also, males may even enjoy it more than females, since it shows more female nudity and orgasmic expressions. I give the film a 7 out of 10, but maybe I would have given it a 6 out of 10 if not seen in theatre, since I find the theatrical experience always adds to my enjoyment.Justin",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
despicable,"I'm not sure if Sam Taylor Johnson did not understand the depth of the book E.L James so brilliantly created but I am deeply sad and confused on to why she would think that movie would suffice to the intensity that was portrayed inside the book. I can go down a list of regrets Miss Sam should have let alone the embarrassment she should feel. She in no way did this movie justice, and I CALL FOR A REMAKE. That was NOT the Fifty Shades Of Grey that any of us has read. She took this book from a grown adult read to a children's book, for Jesus Christ did it even qualify for rated R I mean come on it belongs in the PG13 movie section. Honestly, Sam must've read the Wikipedia version of this book as a lot of us used to do for our English class. Wow I am ashamed, for her..for the audience.

could of done a better film,"50 shades isn't as good as what people was hoping. It hasn't got anything in the film that was in the book, such as the foil from condoms he unwrapped, it doesn't show her giving the glider to Christian from what she got from seeing her mum also the kissing in the lift didn't happen till later on in the book you never saw him ask her out for coffee she just tells Kate that he asked her. Also after her first time Kate asks her how it went and if he made her cum the first time and go in to detail about it. She just says you look different and Anna goes I feel it doesn't explain how she does. , I know its not got half the hard core sex bits in but that's what most women falled in love with the book. The film has ruined it. The film was the new talk with most women, it should have had more effort to keep in line with the book with every little detail as well as the dirty parts. Could of done a lot better should of been a bit longer with more detail and kept with the story line of the book not made up bits in a hour and 56 minutes",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
An A for Effort,"Extremely drab.The book has seemingly been written as a joke, and the movie looked like a lot of effort and cash has been spent in vain.The primary theme is s/m; the movie made a good effort at retaining the fine line between a commercial movie and porn. However, that somehow defeated the purpose. Did I also mention how lackluster the plot is? Not to mention, the bizarre way the plot ends. The credit goes to the author, though. Book writing is not for everyone. The next time i come across ""fan fiction"", i'll steer clear. The movie was a better effort than the book.

A Review from Someone Who Likes This Stuff,"I'm a man in his early thirties who's written and read a decent amount of erotic fiction, most of it involving some sort of BDSM. Most of my relationships have been ""regular"", but I fancy myself a dominant when I am involved with a willing submissive. For this reason I had to see this movie (I hadn't read the book). I had to see if this movie was ""real"" BDSM and whether the main character was truly ""abusive"". I also had to see this movie because I couldn't trust any of the reviews. The first 10 or so user reviews on IMDb I've read rated the movie low because the main character was reportedly a bad guy or because they had high expectations for the dialogue. I didn't mind either of these flaws.For those interested, yes, this is one representation of a BDSM relationship. While Anastasia is naive and apprehensive throughout most of the movie, there is sexual bondage, domination and submission, making it BDSM. Some of the action flirts the line of Safe, Sane and Consensual, but that doesn't change the definition of words. Christian Grey is somewhat abusive. There is nothing as bad as I've been led to believe, but there is severe jealousy and light stalking, not unlike you might see in a movie about a regular relationship. For me, the movie could still rate a 10, because I don't need all my main characters to have the golden morals of Superman. Flawed characters make for better stories. The problem with Fifty Shades is the *lack* of story.The buildup is quite good. The characters aren't brilliant and the dialogue is definitely unnatural at times with Christian spouting one-liners reminiscent of made-for-TV movies. The sex scenes weren't overly titillating, but they were moderately hot and seemed to be edging closer to some hot grand finale. The actors are nice to look at in their barely-R-rated nude scenes. In my head, the movie was getting a 6/10 for the first 30 or so minutes.But then the movie stalls. The characters stop growing, the plot goes in circles, you wonder where the chemistry went. Why do they still like each other? Finally, it's over before anything significant happens.I can forgive lackluster dialogue and stereotypical characters, but the lack of sexy, BDSM, and plot in a sexy BDSM movie is unforgivable. Watch Secretary instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Liked it!,"If you've read the books you're expecting a lot of steaming sex, bdsm and luxurious environments. And that's exactly what you'll see in this movie. I was a bit afraid that the producers should romanticize it but no, it's exactly like the book. Dakota Johnson is absolutely perfect as Anastasia Steele, the virgin college student who meets the dominant business man Christian Grey. Jamie Dornan is handsome and very sexy with intense eyes. Maybe a little bit stiff (I'll forgive him for that).Something that I really appreciates is that they've brought a little bit of humor in the movie.Looking forward for the next two movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't get all the negativity,"I realize that this may be the highest review this movie has and I have my reasons. Most people that gave it much lower scores and I have noticed that they are sorted into two main categories. First: those that were disappointed in the amount of sexual encounters. For these people I have to say: go check your local porn section is you want hardcore sex. Your expectations for outrageous sex are misplaced. It's rated R for a reason, not X. They did not want to market this as porn. Following the book too closely would have been a mistake. The second category is those that find the acting to be sub-par. To you I'd say you have to much prejudice. The actors they chose seemed to fit the characters better than the typical mainstream. The directing was not terrible. Looking at the actors from the point of view their previous works holds prejudice of what you think they accomplished in this film and frankly it is unfair. I don't see what all the negativity was about. I was entertained the entire time. People that read the books (I did) were too judgmental of its closeness (or lack thereof) to them while people that did not read them were either lost, or judgmental because ""it wasn't what it was portrayed to be."" You want to pick on some acting check out The Twilight Saga. The first movie has the worst acting I've ever seen. More the most part I think people were upset that they didn't see any of his junk. People really need to lay off. And the next ones will only be better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointment,"After watching the movie, I cannot stop being disappointed for almost every single moment throughout the entire film! It just, you know, kind of having so many confusing scenes which causes audiences misunderstand what's going on, what the film actually features about. One more point is that the film doesn't show how important the 2 main character are because they played their scenes constrainedly. I think that they should have some more scenes so that they can link together and make the audience easily get to the main aim of the director or the film maker. For the rest of the series, they should have considered more about which necessary scenes they should put on so that the audience can enjoy them positively not like with the first one.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't let curiosity rob you off precious time u will lose on this movie,"I can honestly say that whatever marketing company marketed this book must be amazing, any company that can get masses and masses to spend money on such despicably written insult to literature must be amazing. The only feat is on the marketing company for the movie as well. Such trash. Makes me ashamed that I am a woman and the success of this franchise makes me realize that indeed women are stupid and men treat us like idiots because general population of women who contribute to the popularity of this series shows just that. Also it is clearly an indication of how much of women are sexually repressed and unhappy with their sex lives that even such badly written stuff helps them imagine a better sex life. I am so glad that no respectable actors have accepted to be part of this movie, I would have hated to see any decent actors reputation be tarnished with this movie. The actors are awful, Mr Grey looks like the dude from Cruel intentions with curly blonde hair had a love child with Barney from how i met your mother and he is the resultant weird looking kid. Anastasia (i even hate her name) needs to get her nose done! I never encourage plastic surgery but my god the girl could use it, get some lip fillers, decent teeth. Actually she should stop appearing on screen bcos she is so displeasing to see. Everyone in this movie is awful at acting. In defense of the actors it would have been near impossible to produce decent acting with those awful lines and scenes anyway and all the actors are straight from starbucks i presume so considering that...they are barely alright... Also no human ever lives this storyline ever, none of those sentences were ever said by anyone ever. Also casting what looks like a 35 year old for the role of a virgin? deserves a belly laugh really, she has crows feet and lines all over her face and the fact that her teeth are mostly worn away from the fact that she is OLD. If the writer of The story of O was alive she would have sued that her amazing book has been reduced to this...this is basically twilight mashed badly with the story of o. its a sham and just like this stupid modern culture that allows Kim kardashian to be famous and miley cyrus to sell records so these kinds of trash makes it to the bookshelves and to the movies and does well and nurtures the ongoing success of bad mass produced books and movies that make younger generations stupider and stupider.

50 Shades of Misconceptions,"****Contains NO spoilers****That's what this crap of a movie should have been titledI saw this move (against my will and better judgment – long story) days before its theatrical release. Now that the initial hype has greatly subsided, I felt it was time to post my thoughts about Fifty Shades of Grey.SKIP IT!!What a lot of misconceptions in which Hollywood over glorifies as well as glamorizes in what they (including the author of this poorly scripted badly written mess of a book series) perceive this life and concept is and consists of. How do I know this? Basically, because I'm a switch – meaning I exhibit both dominant and submissive personalities within this lifestyle.Just skip this movie as well as the book series. If you're curious, read The Story of O or the works by Marquis DE Sade. Better yet, if you truly want to feel sexual tension in an office setting, rent The Secretary.

"This should be renamed ""50 ways to make a crappy movie""","It is finally here, the movie every housewife saw opening weekend and every boyfriend was dragged to, and i feel sorry for what they had to sit through for two hours. For a book that was so highly praised by so many people this film was all kinds of terrible, from it's plot (or lack thereof) to its characters and dialogue this movie just failed to deliver in any way. Now i know i am not the target audience for this film but even if i am not the target audience i have to be able to have at least a half decent time watching it. Right from the very first Anastasia and Christian scene this move was just so cringe-worthy and a complete bore-fest. This movie did a terrible job of creating and introducing these characters, one comes across as a weird, over-controlling freak (some words i cannot include here) and the other a very confused ,dumb and poorly written woman. Whoever wrote the dialogue for this film whether it was the same as the novel or updated for the film needs to retire their writing career because the conversations between the two leads are so boring, all the lines seem very fake, like this writer has never had a normal human conversation. Most of this crappy dialogue is the writer's fault for writing it but also Jamie Dornan was just completely bland in this role, his delivery of the lines were so robotic and fake that you didn't buy what they were saying for a second. I do believe that Anastasia did a half decent job while having to portray one of the dumbest characters who is completely incapable of making any kind of rational decision. Her scenes when she is away from Christian are more bearable, it is when they are together that it just gets unbearable to watch.Now, the plot was just so plain and simple that for a whole 2 hours the movie went absolutely nowhere. The movie was not building up to any kind of event, it was just a series of conversations and sexual activities all spaced out over the two hours. Whoever read the script and thought that THIS would be able to capture the viewers attention the whole time was dead wrong. This film did its very best to make me fall asleep, but i fought it because i had to see what stupidity they would come up with next to keep the film going. This film was just filled with many, many weird and awkward conversations that just make you wonder why on earth this woman is interested in this man and why this man is so interested in this woman. With a bit of unsexy sex thrown in there a few times and one of the worst endings in film history this movie was a disaster waiting to happen. If it wasn't for Dakota Johnson actually making her character at times amusing this would have somehow been even lower. - 2.9/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"5 shades of very, very dark grey.","There is much talk about 21st century women turning away from emancipation. Or at least from inconvenient parts of it, like struggling, uniting, committing, and unattractive hassles like 'thinking things through thoroughly'. 50 Shades of Grey is part of that movement, but more importantly: the audience full of bitter 40-something women are exactly that.There is something very wrong with the semi-whispered remarks, the uncomfortable giggles and the disingenuous laughter - the atmosphere in the theater is almost poisonous. Come to think of it: the atmosphere is somewhere around 5 shades of grey, all shades in the very dark and gloomy spectrum. I used to find these observations about 'women my age' confusing and worrying, but nowadays I find them fascinating, so I sat all the way through this movie. What an insufferable drag.Days later I ran across a remark from Jim Jefferies: ""To all the people that like 50 Shades of Grey... Have you heard about porn? I think it will blow your mind!"".

Better than the book,"I can understand the bad reviews this movie got, since it had a bad scenario to start with. The book is pure example of trashy literature and I'm surprised that they even managed to make the movie that is more bearable than the book itself. To be honest, I'm so happy i didn't have to hear once again those stupid Anastasia Steel monologues all through the book and the famous inner goddess bs.. or the annoying remarks about price tags..What I'm trying to say is, these guys who made the movie deserve a recognition for making it better then the book, which is very hard to achieve these days since it's always other way around.It's not hard to enjoy this movie once you silence the desire to experience something uplifting or new or in anyway creative, and once you convince yourself to just want to be entertained by a fairy tail like soft-porn story.My first attempt to watch the movie was a fail, I stopped after the interview part, annoyed by stupid , cliché like scene where she falls while entering his office.. After few days I tried again watching just to see then end, and after 30 minutes I'd say movie kind of hits on and might appeal to women just because you get the feeling..OK, she is not trying to be a complete dumb chick...don't ask me why, that is the only plus point that I see in this movie..Both actors are in my opinion fine, for what is asked from them they did their part and I don't think other pairing would have done it better..I'd like just to express my condolence to them for making bad decision to be part of a movie that will just drag them down with it. Don't get me wrong.. there are worse movies.. just there is something about the thing when you decide to do a bad, almost pornographic movie...it kind of sticks in people's minds and we are easy to judge it if it fails to impress us.And one last thing to add...the bad chronology of all three books will really mess up this movie..if they even think about making the sequel...

Too bad,"I was sorely disappointed by this films overall lack of details... Not in terms of the sex, but in key elements that were relatively crucial moments in the book. Of course the actors cast for the roles ( all roles) have much to do with my disappointment in this film. Sadly, Jamie Doran, as adorable as he is, was the wrong man to portray Grey and Johnson... Somehow she reminds me of Kristin Stewart, whom I personally think is the worst actress to ever be blessed with hit roles & movies in the Twilight Saga. OK, so I went a little off track, Johnson isn't that bad, maybe even a great actress in other roles... But perhaps it was the overall disappointment in the screenplay that made me cringe during this film. I was not expecting this movie to be as 'B' rated as it was. 👎👎",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sex may sell but a story helps..,I don't fault the actors who had to perform to this script which was void of anything meaningful or redeeming. The only saving grace was the likability of the actress playing Anastasia. She had potential which was wasted in this movie.Sex is one thing embedded in a good story it can even add some interest. This is not.How this book was ever so widely read is beyond me. To make a movie out of this crap was really bad decision making by the studio exec who approved it.All this movie was is soft porn.

Fifty Shades of Nothing,I'm so disappointed because I expect too much. I don't know but I fell asleep while watching. I don't feel anything while watching. I was just totally bored. There's no chemistry between the characters. Christian Grey is not intense as I expected and completely zero emotions. His voice is just not what I'm expecting. It feels like he's just reading the script. Anastasia Steele sounds flirt? I mean she should be shy and not too giddy right? Kate is not what I picture her to be. The sex was okay. I feel like this is the end of both lead actors career. It's just bad for me. I hope the sequel will redeem this one cause I really like the book.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rubbish!,There was such a big hype for this film and yet i have just wasted £9 at my local cinema watching this garbage people call a 'fanstastic film'.

Not all will be let down,"For some of you wonderful film lovers who perhaps know a little bit of life and the language of this art form, it will be hard to recommend Fifty shades of Grey. For the rest of you, if you hang in there for a while, you might see at least a particular body part you so craved, or, who knows, some new yoga move? Lets face it, sex or no sex, you have to admit, Dakota Johnson is a cute, if not interesting beauty to look at. She has the same gift her mother had. A vulnerable adorable charm that wins anyone with a heart over. Jamie Dornan, as Christian, seems to have let her down, aiming for the stilted brooding rich male - save for some, he's pleasing enough to look at.Director Taylor Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel can both take the hit as a team for the soft stroking and pandering. Whether it was a choice to be conservative for the sake of Hollywood standards, or trying endlessly to tease us and keep us wanting more, they missed miserably and should donate their salaries to a battered women foundation. We have a right to expect more out of the shot list cannon, approaching the intensity of sexual relationships. The screenplay lacks any type of depth or daring beside simply hanging on and playing it safe to the book. (reminder hear to children reading, books work on a different tone and mood level than do films) Expect more! Though I like a little spice in my sauce, even if its just a little, this film is hardly brow raising and little to no breath of new air much less dirty mud in the sexual arena. There is more tantalizing sexual thrill on the local news channels. I can't go on. There is nothing here left to address. The Film cannon is little less than a soft porn. The acting, cinematography, and story is average at best. The directing could have been done by my mother. I think hi of my mother but she is no director. But I still think Dakota was the one bright spot, perhaps not so much in that she worked with very little else help, but because you can see to her shining potential. NOT ALL WILL BE LET DOWN? Of coarse not. People or the youth with less film knowledge or perhaps simple life experience will find it matching the tenors of the Twilight film saga. And then kids will want to know what all the hype is about. So I believe it might be an average film to see on one of the down loading sites. To the director; It is obvious that there is no good message here, If anything it speaks sadly to the state of these empty vessels you call characters. With that said, there is no 'pushing the envelope of seduction.' So Sam Taylor-Johnson why do it? Much less do it in such a boorish manner.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film adaptation of a book is only as good as the original book,"A film adaptation of a book is limited by the quality of the original book. And let's face it, 50 Shades of Grey the book was pretty awful. Cringe worthy dialog, incredibly slow and with a noteworthy redeeming quality which gave it worldwide acclaim - lots of sex. I think many of the readers must have skipped past the pages of Anastasia's inner monologues and skilled to the sex scenes, as I don't understand know why people were surprised by the quality of the film. It stayed true to the book, and was better than I expected. Yes it was slow, dialog was trite and didn't see any of Mr Grey's rude bits, but the acting was pretty impressive considering the limited dialog and action that Dornan and Johnson had to work with. I'm in the middle of watching The Fall starring Jamie Dornan as a serial killer, so did struggle to separate him tying up his love interest from his victims.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

But I got exactly opposite. Jamie Dornan was horrible choice for C.G., he didn't portray strength and sexiness, he more looked like he was constipating and he delivered his lines without a bit of charm. Extremely bland actor. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is Dakota Johnson. She did her absolutely best with what she got, she even made Ana look not like a complete fool (which I thought would be impossible).I get why this move was such a hit (books were a huge hit, it was very well marketed etc.) but I think that people who go to see the next one should be automatically refereed to their doctor for hearing, eye and mental check.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Any ways I had a hard time believing someone like Christian Grey would want to get a V-card girl to be his concubine. And why a girl like that would even consider the contract.And as I have already mentioned, the acting was terrible. Dakota Johnson was wooden and no chemistry with Jamie Dornan. About all she did was show a little T&A. And Jamie wasn't much better. I am glad Charlie Hunnam turned the role down.FINAL VERDICT: Mainly for male teens that want to see what Dakota's got.

2 hours of nothing,"Fifty Shades of Grey was always going to be terrible. Unsurprisingly, it is terrible, yet it could have been worse. In contrast to Bella Swan (FSOG originated as Twilight fan fiction), the heroine may not be a brilliantly written character but Dakota Johnson does an unexpectedly good job. Sam Taylor-Johnson directs the movie well and the cinematography has a certain style to it. The soundtrack isn't the worst either. But don't think for a moment I'm defending this. It's not the utter, complete, irredeemable failure it may have been, but it's still a failure. Slow, airless, boring, plot free and devoid of any compelling narrative arc, it's difficult to see a point to this movie. The sex scenes, surely? Well, they don't take up that much of the film and much of it is... nothing really. There's no chemistry between the lead actors and Jamie Dornan gives a wooden, charisma free performance. Plus, it's in many ways a fairly tasteless and sexist film with many highly uncomfortable moments.So, the question still remains. What is this? Is it a porn movie? Well, no since the sex scenes don't take up that much of the film and they're not as strong as many were evidently hoping. Is it a character study? Well, some more character depth would have been appreciated. Despite the occasional interesting lines, mostly the characters are two dimensional so no. Is it a romantic drama? It's about as romantic as a torture porn horror film due to its lack of passion and emotion so definitely not. Is it an erotic thriller? Well, if you want thrills you won't get a single one, while it's really not that erotic, so again no. It doesn't even have a proper ending. It doesn't feel complete, it's outrageously, obscenely overlong at 2 hours and in general it's just a total bore. That's what FSOG is. A bore. Now we have 2 sequels to look forward to despite the fact that if you reduced the movie to its amount of actual story it'd be 15 minutes long. Overall, a dud although at least it's not as bad as Terminator Genesys.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unrealistic,"So at the beginning of this film Anastasia Steele goes to the city to interview Christian Grey at his office.

I swear I've spent up to an hour on some occasions trying to find a parking space in the inner city suburbs of Perth and it's not even that populated here. Where is the footage of her desperately trying to find a park, sweating and panting as the interview time steadily creeps closer? Or when she eventually says ""eff it!"" and ends up parking in one of those multi-story car parks that cost upwards of $50 an hour?

It wasn't that bad!,"OK it's not the movie of the year... but if you enjoyed the books, you will enjoy the movie to a certain level. Dakota J plays a fun Ana, Jamie D is really hot, however he is a weak version of Christian Grey. The biggest drawback from my opinion is that the movie is a bit superficial compared to the books where you get a deep insight of the characters and what they are experiencing. The movie is just a series of ""illustrations"" of the best scenes from the book... There is no way you will enjoy this movie if you haven't read the books and enjoyed them. As to the sex scenes, they do not do justice to the book but they are hot enough. This movie will need the sequels to actually make sense. It needs to be enjoyed as a trilogy rather then one movie...It's not like Harry Potter or Twilight were you can actually ""get"" or enjoy the films without having read the books. AGAIN, don't bother watching this film if you haven't read the books.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not lot I expected,"I am a lover of the books.Not a super enthusiastic fan of them,but I have read them and I liked them.I was looking forward to seeing the movie.. Then it was released and the opinions I heard were pretty much all the same : ""It sucks""; ""It was not what I expected""; ""It's not worth watching it at all"".. So I decided to wait..I watched it last night and I have to say that I am pretty disappointed.It was only 3 minutes after the beginning of the movie..that I was shocked..This was not the right choice of actors..I mean this ""Cristian Grey"" that was described in the picture was dark,cold,hurt,sex- appealing,intimidating and the Cristian we got on the movie is always smiling and worm and his voice..The voice is just easy,fun,light,childish even;and his eyes..they were always warm and kind .. This is just something you can't miss,if you have read the books.. In the movie,everything was quick and messy..and the end of it was just stupid ... The ""Anastasia""role was really more good played ..But my overall opinion is that the movie was overrated and long-wanted,but the expectations were not justified.I think that the movie was failure and they should try really,really hard for the next one.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ridiculous,Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life just totally ridiculous acting was terrible just an outrageously stupid dumb movie if that girl is that idiotic all the power to her but for me it was just a bunch of garbage and I'm sorry this movie was ever made for anyone who like this movie you have a few screws loose in your brain just a horrible movie please stay away I wouldn't rather shut off the TV and go gardening or go play golf or something it was just an asinine the movie the only good thing in the soul entire movie was the girl actor she was halfway decent but besides that what a cornball movie this was.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing,"First of all, I don't hate the book. In fact, I enjoyed reading it even though sometimes it can be boring, I know, but the movie is just dull on the whole.A lot of important things are thrown out from the movie; the important things that make the story interesting. That's why I'm so disappointed!No offense, but in my opinion, Jamie is not exactly the Christian Grey I imagine. I just didn't feel the charisma of Christian that I felt when I read the book. In the movie, Christian's expression is just flat, not like in the book where he can be so intense all of a sudden.As for Dakota, oh well, she's pretty decent for Ana.My expectation for this movie was too high, now I wish I have never seen the movie. I should have just let the story played in my mind. Now, the image of Christian Grey is ruined.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifty shades of GAY,"Horrible movie. I seriously curse myself for watching this garbage. There was nothing in this film. It's neither erotic, nor a feel good movie. It's more like a torture than a soft p*rn. There is no chemistry between the characters. Dakota Johnson is a pure product of nepotism and tbh she couldn't act. And as for the male lead, what can you expect from a model. Idk much bout BDSM but i hated the idea of torture for pleasure. And plus those users who had BDSM hated it too. The girl in this movie ( Dakota) is so stupid virgin and desperate bout sex that she even let him abuse her. Is this where humanity is going to? And the sad part is that some wannabe showgirls are getting kick out of it. Avoid this crap pls",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reviewing the reviewers,"It seems many have a problem with this movie but I found it amusing and pretty light hearted considering its supposed 'seriousness'.I found many reasons why it has no chance to be accepted these days.The fact that the main male character was white, strong and not defeated by anyone must concern a lot of you. Also there were no gay characters in this movie. Even worse, the lead character appeared a bit disgusted when he was asked if he was gay. The straight white woman is supposed to defeat this rogue and date the Hispanic guy, right? No, in fact he was told to back off by Grey. Did you feel that was racist? I'll bet many of you did. Watching a white woman have sex with a white man must have been disturbing to many of the viewers! This movie violates everything you have been told relentlessly by the mainstream media for many years. You should feel uncomfortable.If you think I am wrong, make Christian black and the girl's friend a lesbian. I am sure your hatred for the movie would be mitigated whether you liked the plot or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
From Fanfic to Flop,"This movie started out as not just a book but really poorly written Twilight fanfiction. Yes I will admit I know that and have even read a bit of it. Now I don't want to knock fanfiction authors because there are many talented fanfiction authors out there; look at Star Trek the original series. Its only 3 seasons yet has been kept alive for years thru fanfiction.At least when this drivel was on paper and in my mind I could use my imagination to make it a little better. The writer was not liked in the Twilight fanfic community; her ""works"" were not praised. I don't know why anyone thought it would make a best-selling novel when there are already tons of romance novels out there that are 100 times better. But I digress this is not about the book, this is about a really terrible movie.I do have to ask: did anybody consult the BDSM community for this film? Because their thoughts on this mess might be worth noting.So let's start with Dakota Johnson; I don't know how she keeps getting work...oh that's right because her parents are rich and famous. Hollywood is currently filled with barely mediocre actors because they're the children of people who are in the industry themselves. Dakota Johnson is no different. She's a terrible actress who brings absolutely nothing to the screen. I would even go so far as to say that she makes every scene worse just by her very presence.I used to like Jamie Dornan. I liked him on that once upon a time show. He's attractive and yes I'm a sucker for the accent. Now every time I see his face, I get physically repulsed, like I cannot watch him because I know he did this film. I hope its just me and this terrible decision didn't ruins his career. Such a shame because I think he's a pretty decent actor. However, his acting abilities definitely did not come through in this. Every scene is uncomfortable, there's absolutely no chemistry between the two of them, it's all forced, sad, plastic.Thankfully I did not have to pay for this crap. I was subject to it during a girls night. The things one does for free wine and friends.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Is this a movie or porn?,"I watched this film a year after its release. I heard all of the negative reviews, and as someone who has never read the books, I was curious about the film. I ended up being highly disappointed. 2 hours and 5 minutes of my life that I will never get back.Let me start off by saying that Jamie Dornan's American accent was less than average and threw me off throughout the film. Now on to the movie, the pacing was very slow and the ""storyline"" was quite boring. I had to fast-forward the last 30 minutes of the movie because I was waiting for something interesting to happen. Maybe a shocking ending. In reality, what I saw was about 20 minutes of ""romance"" that could pass for pornography. Sidenote: Is really a rich man who stalks a girl something that women find attractive?In my honest opinion, don't waste your time watching this movie. I bet the sequel will flop.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the worst movies ever made,"This is a truly disturbed and terrible film. There is no real plot but just some sadistic moments. Why didn't you just make a porno? This was almost everything short of a porno without any real story. Most of us are adult enough to watch nudity within a broader and coherent film. In this case we have cheap nudity that pretends to have a story. Someone as sick as the male lead would never be in charge of such a large company, large companies are run by actual busy and hardworking adults.The writer of these books must be truly disturbed to write such worthless filth. The director of this rubbish is even more disturbed to adapt these books that are not good enough for toilet paper into a film. What is bewildering is the number of women that are into it. The female psyche will forever be an unending mystery.

"There's a lot to like... A lot to dislike... Not the worst movie ever... Overall, very disappointed.","I finally saw the movie on 02.20.15. I purposely chose NOT to relive the book before seeing the movie as that particular mishap led to my dissatisfaction with Twilight. I found that after rewatching Twilight I enjoyed it more than the first viewing, though still consider it the best book and worst movie with the Twilight Series.So there we were. It was my wife and I. My wife read all 3 books multiple times and was LESS interested in seeing the movie than I was.Now, I am a movie guy, movie buff, whatever you want to call it. I have nearly 500 DVD/BluRay movies that are all store bought. I grew up with a father who loved movies and we spent countless hours, together, watching movies... all kinds of movies. Drama, Horror, Comedy, Scifi, Classics, Low Budget Indies... all kinds of movies.I was put off the moment the movie started because one of the first things you see... is Christian Grey. Not close up parts of the man, you see him. This put me off because as a movie fan and watcher of countless movies, I knew from a cinematic standpoint that an egregious error had been made to show him. More on that later...So we finally get the main character, Ana. I was not a huge fan of Dakota Johnson's casting. Seeing the magazine photos, the trailers, nothing made me feel better about her as Ana. But I will tell you...Over the course of the movie, I came to thoroughly enjoy her PERFORMANCE as Ana but still feel that she's not a great FIT as Ana.So we're treated to the opening. So far it's pretty faithful to the book, I feel a little better. I know the interview is coming and know from reading the book how crucial a scene it is.I was put off again because I felt that getting to the interview was rushed... In the book there's a gradual build up and as you read the words you totally understand that this young woman is getting into something so much bigger than she is and is about to jump in the deep end.In the movie, you see Christian. You see Ana. You get a brief scene of Ana interacting with Kate. She's at the Grey House. She's in the interview. It was rushed.Now, the interview is such a critical scene and I feel like they totally MISSED on the scene.You get next to no impact of the big ""reveal"" of Christian from Ana's point of view. The entire start of the movie was a rush to get there and it felt like it was forced and rushed to get it done.The ""reveal."" The book is told from Ana's POV. The first time she sees him, we see him. We see him through her eyes. Cinematically, we've already seen him. When she fell and he gave the god-awful look over the shoulder, the impact of that moment is lost. Let's go back in time...Remember Twilight? In the book, Bella first sees him as he enters the lunchroom. They recreated that in the movie... and guess what, it worked! The first time the movie viewer sees Edward is the same time the main character sees him so you experience that impact together on the same level, cinematically.I don't know why they chose to do it that way in FSOG but the interview stumbled from the start, just as Ana did going into the office.So... by now you probably think I hate the movie and everything in it? No, actually.There's A LOT to like in the movie, but it's counterbalanced by the bad stuff.Please read the full review on my blog: http://50shadescastingblog.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretty good, certainly not as bad as I was expecting","When I heard that the trilogy of poorly written books were being made into movies I began to convince myself that they, in turn, would also be pretty bad. I wasn't sure about the casting at first but after seeing the movie it's really not that bad. I've read the books, out of pure curiosity at first, but then again with general interest. The story line is generally intact, with a little of the BDSM trimmed off for mainstream people which I assumed would happen. It's not an award winner(although I wouldn't be surprised if Dakota Johnson is nominated simply for making the phrase 'Holy cow' seem slightly less geeky and strange). All in all this movie wasn't a big disappointment, but it also wasn't a huge win. It was well made and followed the storyline pretty closely. I'd say it's definitely worth a watch if you're already partially interested.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A poor sexual movie from a mediocre novel,"Earlier this week it was finally time to watch the much talked about film, Fifty Shades of Grey, based on the book by the same name. For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is about young Anastasia Steele who gets the opportunity to interview the billionaire Christian Grey. Their meeting creates heavy sparks between them and they later meet again and start to develop feelings for each other. But, Christian Grey is not like ordinary people. He has a very special taste when it comes to sexual activities, which Anastasia will soon discover.This film has been such a big topic for the last year and it has practically been impossible to avoid hearing about it. For instance, the director Sam Taylor-Johnson will not return to direct the sequels because apparently she constantly fought on set with writer E. L James about the dialogue and details from the script. In the leading roles we see Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey.Before I start to talk about the film I will say that I actually started reading the book, but I did not finish it. My first reaction now after I've seen Fifty Shades of Grey, is that it could have been made better. I feel that the film didn't go in the direction I think it was intended to. To my understanding, Fifty Shades of Grey is supposed to be about feminism and encouragement for women to also be able to explore their sexuality. I am uncertain if this message really did go through to the audience. In the film Anastasia seems to be eager to please others but rarely appears to do anything for herself. Perhaps this is the point of the film, but I feel that it could have been made differently to create a greater impact.This leads me directly to the second big problem of the film, the characters. There is no doubt that Christian Grey has a permanent scar from his teenage years, which makes him unable to love anyone else. Jamie Dornan actually makes him pretty insecure and we clearly feel that there's something else behind his hard shell. Perhaps this is the reason why some people have criticized his performance, because they feel that Christian should be more self-confident and macho. I however liked it and thought it made him more human. Dakota Johnson's take on the character Anastasia is harder for me to get. I feel like I never really understand why she falls for Christian in the first place, or whatever motivates her at all.There was of course a few things I did like about Fifty Shades of Grey. The music was almost always very fitting, except for Danny Elfman's film score, which at times felt a bit repetitive. Beside the music, I did like Seattle as a background and a lot of the production design was very well made, especially Christian's apartment. To summarize, I really don't know how I feel about the film. It does feel like it is too faithful to the book, despite the fact that the script excludes some plot lines. Perhaps it was E. L James constant interfering at the set that prevented director Sam Taylor-Johnson from having more creative freedom. I guess in the end I would have rather seen more character development than helicopter and glider flights, even if they did look good.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
50 Dull Shades of Grey,"Okay, lets make this simple. After all the hype about the books, I was curious to see what many had come to love about the series. Now i have never read the book, but this movie was just plain awful. Without spoiling any of the ""story"" let me just say this. The acting was a shameful experience. Both characters where very unlikeable. I think what to blame is that there was NO character development. Basically giving you 2 characters and throwing them into a dull plot. The 2 characters are supposed to be adults. Yet this plays out like a teeny- bopper film. What I think really killed the movie was the very very very poorly written script. Awful dialog. Very dull, uninteresting, and unoriginal. Now i am somebody that loves movies and tries to find the artistic and special parts that make all movies enjoyable. But I am sorry Fifty Shades, even with an open mind to movies and film like mine, I just couldn't find anything good about this film. Its a real shame. I had thought with the success and popularity over the novel, that the writers would put a little more effort and time into making this movie watchable, but despite all that this was a flop. If the sequels are like this, why not go straight to DVD?",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Shallow and empty.,"On of those films that you eagerly sit through waiting for the ''good part'' to start and then it ends and you get nothing, no thrill, no suspense, no emotions. Empty. One of the worst endings i have seen in my life, seriously how did the people behind this movie decide to make the ending that way? This movie was anticipated to be extremely controversial and over the top in many ways, i for one did not witness any of those.The premise was kind of interesting and the first half of the film was not as bad, i was actually thinking - wow, maybe this is not going to be as horrible as almost every reviewer here have deemed, unfortunately they were right and the second part and the ending just affirmed my low expectations for this movie. The biggest problem was that the movie did not ''grow'' as the time passed, it just stayed the same throughout, hence it wasn't enjoyable. Also the songs and soundtracks chosen for various scenes were just horrible and didn't fit at all with what was happening at the time.Some people dislike the movie, because, in their opinion, it is derogatory towards women and since it is a widely known mainstream movie it reaches out to many people, it could harm the relationships of men and women, ehh just some classic feminist ranting, i simply disliked this film, since everything was off as i stated above and i did not find this controversial or shocking in any way. The only emotion i had during this film was boredom, because of its linear plot and slow pace.I only wanted to watch this, because from what i had heard, the over-whelming majority of women really liked it, however the majority of men i know thought it was thrash. In my opinion, this is due to the fact that women really enjoyed seeing a normal woman being put on a ''pedestal'' by a very wealthy and handsome young man, who can give her everything in exchange for sexual pleasure, despite that casual women don't usually like bdsm, they were ready to put that aside just to care for the sad and love seeking woman. Men on the other hand, although, on paper this should be a movie most men would love, disliked it, because it just did not meet their expectations, just like it was in my case. Lets get real for a second. Nobody wants to sit through two hours of nothingness just see a couple of poorly thought through sex scenes, which were promised to be super controversial. Men just rather watch regular porn, i would get if it would have something else to, interesting plot, etc., but unfortunately there was just that.Is worth watching it? No.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just try to understand the circumstances that happen to them, and you might appreciate this movie.

Fifty shades of Sheldon Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler,"I just finished watching the movie. I have not read the books and will not cause I am more into watching the movie kind of person. I watched the movie out of curiosity.I gave it 7 out of 10 for the type of movie that it is. I will not bother telling the story cause everyone knows it by now. But lets say it is about an ordinary young inexperienced girl who meets and falls in love with an older very much experienced man with unusual tastes in sex and unconventional notions of a what a romantic relationship should be, who is filthy rich.The movie has a lot of clichés, which are a part of life anyway. And we move on to the sex part. Sex is a human activity that is highly subjective. One can do whatever the hell they want with their partner as long as it is agreed upon by both parties. And also lets clear up that the parties are adults. Also, sex involves experimentation and exploring practices and techniques out of the ordinary. So, that is the dominant component of this film accompanied by the underlining matter of emotional attachment no matter what type of sex is involved. The young girl who is a virgin allows herself to be introduced in a more explicit, unusual kind of sex. It is not about abuse either physical or spiritual. The guy in the movie clearly seeks her consent before he does anything of what he has in mind. There is a CONTRACT specifically mentioning all that is involved. So there is not in any case taking advantage or forcing the girl into anything that she doesn't want to do.Both characters have their everyday lives that have nothing to do with what they are getting into once they are behind closed doors in their own privacy. The guy is the dominant one, at this stage of his life at least, because when he was younger he was the submissive. So, the dominant and the submissive role has nothing to do with gender. It is absolutely irrelevant.As far as the actors, Dornan at the beginning of the movie comes out quite uptight and rigid. He struggles throughout the film with his Irish accent but from a point on it becomes a minor matter. He is detached, for that is what his character is supposed to be anyway. He could have been better at it of course, but that is a matter of the director as well as the script writer. Johnson portrays the young inexperienced girl fairly OK. She is not supposed to be the sex bomb nor the sassy horny student. Her innocence and naiveté is what catches Grey's attention. So far so good.The directing and the dialog could have been better, but come on boys and girls this film wasn't meant for the Oscars!!! Also it is a part of a trilogy so there had to be things to be put into the following movies.The music was good and fitting for the mood. Overall it was an easy watched movie with its pros and cons. If you start watching and expect a ""Dearhunter"" or a ""Sofie's choice"" or red hot porn you will definitely be disappointed.To sum up, it is very much like the relationship and contract that Sheldon Cooper has with Amy Farrah Fowler but with sex....",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very good book, awful movie",I am a big fan of the book trilogy. The director Sam Taylor Johnson did an amateur work. There is more sexual tense in Gone with the wind between Rhett and Scarlett than in 50 shades of Grey. We can not see any feelings between Anastatsia and Christian. The film is showing unrelated scenes without any transitions. This is as if the director would have taken out of the book some chapters without being able to link them. Jamie Dornan is unable to show any feeling. We can neither see on his face nor on his body how attracted he is to his partner. He is spoiled.We started a petition to stop the damages.

I actually gave it such a low rating because having read the book, and even though I wasn't such a big fan of the series; I mean the reason I started reading was out of curiosity... Anyway, I didn't like the book, I don't hate it, but then again I don't love it either... But, if the book was kinda annoying then this film is the epitome of boring! Why such a fuss when the sex scenes aren't that shocking, the acting is below average and the plot, well... Everything happens way too fast and from my point of view, it does get boring.

Not very interesting,"This wasn't a movie that I would be interested but, as my wife had read all the books and wanted to see the movie I decided to go along and watch the movie with her.One way or the other I wanted to see if all the media hype around this movie was justified or not. The lead actors weren't known or interesting to me, so I wasn't expecting some off the wall interpretations.The story plays around a young woman that replaces her friend in an interview of a young wealthy business man, and is attracted by his charm and wits, as he is to her.The next almost two hours of movie we can see their relationship growing, into his kinky sexual preferences that she sometimes doesn't understand, trying to make him love her the ""normal way"", without physical pain. Which she only endures because he is rich, otherwise this would be called sexual harassment.This said, the story is kind of flat, monotonous, and doesn't prove or show all the explicit sex the media is trying to sell to us. People that I talked to that read the books said that the movie doesn't show 1/10 of the sexuality of the original story – rating oblige??!!. The interpretations seam competent com a slight relevance to Dakota Johnson over Jamie Dornan. For someone that didn't read the books, it seemed like a competent movie but not very interesting and It was made clearly to make dividends on the popularity of the books.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do not listen to anyone who says it's a woman hating porno...it is none of those things. Secretary was much more intense.,"""Mr. Grey will see you now."" Anastasia (Johnson) is a shy woman about to graduate college with no real plans for her future. When her roommate asks her to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) for the school paper she nervously accepts. He immediately becomes infatuated with her and does everything he can to win her over. When she finally accepts his invitation to his place she is shocked at what she sees. The two enter into a very strange relationship where neither fully understands what the other wants. This movie is a phenomenon and unless you live under a rock you know what the movie is about. Like you I knew about all the controversy going in and was really looking for what the fuss was about. 50% of the problems people have with the movie has to do with the fact that the woman is so submissive to the man therefore this portrays women in a negative light, by doing whatever a man says. The other 50% says its pornography and should be banned. I am a man but I have to think that all of the people that had this critique about this movie never actually saw it. While the movie does show sex acts rarely seen in a mainstream movie it is done more erotic than pornographic. I don't want to give anything away to the 5 people that haven't seen it or read the book but she is not as submissive as people will have you believe. I look at it as the other way around. For all the hype this movie has behind it, the movie Secretary is much more intense in terms of this subject matter. Overall, it could be because of all the hype surrounding it but I didn't see what the controversy was about. Do not listen to anyone who says it's a woman hating pornoit is none of those things.

why such hate,"This movie is getting a lot of bad press from people that have not seen the movie nor read the books and just basically against this type of movie that the topic focus is sex. It has a rating of 4.0 or something, that's right in par with say Sharktopus vs. Pteracuda or Croczilla...haha. This movie is not even close to as bad as those movies. There have been other movies out there that have sex in them but yet didn't get so much hate, say Sex in the City(2008), not a good movie at all but didn't get the hate because of the sex content.Its sex people, no one goes all nuts when movies come out about kidnapping and killing kids, only cause we know the bad guy gets caught at the end. You know its about sex if you don't like it simply Don't watch it.The movie in general is a decent movie, nothing great but it is entertaining. Never read the books, but movies are never as good as the books. On to part 2 of the series haha",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

the retractable claw of a cat,"Me and my friend E. went to the cinema. She has bought tickets. I have to give some money. She tried to convince another friend, S. to come with us. Offered to buy popcorn if she wanted to come. S. did not accept.Directed like a Brazilian soap opera. Main male actor with two facial expressions: hard and harder. At minute 20 I tell E. ""I should go to some ironmongery a bit more often, maybe my life would change"". Rivers of banality. But how many laughs! Not only us. Half of the movie theater reacted to what was thought as dramatic moments as ridiculous. She, Anastasia, is a good actress and enjoys decently 'Grey's appeal' and really cry when she felt treated badly (poor girl). At min 40 I think, ""I did not buy bread. I have to buy bread."" After ten minutes I have an attack of yawning. Goes on for a while. The only moment personally exciting is when he spanks her, her lovely tiny ass. For the rest the excitement level could be metaphorized as ""cat's claw"": the penis becomes retractable, gets inside instead of going out. Anastasia shamelessly resembles Charlotte Gainsboug in a pathetic effort of the producers to evoke the 'ninphomaniac' atmospheres. The last word should have been: anal (and not Ana, her name: Anastasia). Too bad. but how many laughs.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Get some therapy.,"Dear female (non-feminist) reviewersSimply putting adjectives like 'amazing' in capital letters and adding some exclamation marks does not a review make. Nor is it a sign of sexual inhibition to hate the franchise and everything it stands for - rather the opposite is true, I'd say. Finally, the fact that the adaption is like the book, is not, in itself, any kind of recommendation. Instead, you may ask yourself why you'd be interested in a film about an unpleasant bully who forces a patently slow-witted woman into increasingly brutal sexual practices because he likes abusing women. In fact, it couldn't be any clearer, he actually says he can only get off with women when he's inflicting pain on them! Why would this actually appeal to anyone without severe self-esteem issues?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Frustrating, pointless, a missed opportunity","I personally didn't read the book before watching this movie (and now I probably never will anyway), so I can't make a comparison between both.I didn't like the movie one bit and felt like there was absolutely zero chemistry between the two lead characters. It makes you wonder why they're attracted to each other and the characteristics of both figures seem completely off.Jamie Dorman attempts to portray the character of Christian Grey who is supposed to be this dominant, wealthy businessman that wants his counterpart to submissively surrender to fulfil all his sexual needs. Why he chooses Anastasia is beyond me, as he can certainly find a lot of way more attractive women to fulfil those needs than her, who are as 'innocent' as she is or are willing to play that role. I get it, Anastasia isn't used to anything sexually and that arouses Grey's dominant nature, but when she constantly argues with what she wants to do and can voice her opinion and wills time and time again, it just doesn't make sense.Dakota Johnson portrays Anastasia Steele as this innocent girl with no sexual experience to speak of, yet suddenly goes all out with someone she barely knows and interferes in all kinds of SM role playing that she doesn't know anything about. I mean she even asks Grey, when he talks about his 'play room' with a seductive face (well again, attempting it), if that's the room where he plays on his consoles like the XBOX, Playstation and whatnot. Has she been living in a cave all her life? Then she enters the room and asks all these dumb questions about what everything is used for, yet a couple of scenes later she's making up a contract and acts like a very confident young lady, who knows exactly what she wants to try and leave out.The characters; the relationship; the lack of plot; the awful acting; it all just doesn't make any sense and it makes for a really terrible movie.This movie will still do great in the box office though, because of the enormous hype surrounding it, which is the reason why you can't even blame directors for junk like this. If there's a demand for crap, they'll squash one out and collect the money.Disappointing, as the concept could make for a psychologically thrilling movie. Sex is a very complicated and weird phenomenon and the struggle between what's normal and what's not, and what crosses the line and what doesn't, could make for a really interesting screenplay. Especially when both characters would actually unmistakably fall in love with each other and if there was actually a lot of chemistry noticeable between the both of them. None of which is seen in this movie.Truly a missed opportunity.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

No character arcs, hence no intense emotional depths in characters, plots or scenes.Poor Poor writing. Is this a Hollywood so called erotic film? A virgin girl intimidated by a young rich guy falls for him and eventually want her to be whipped. Ridiculous! Okay, but are there any scenes to prepare our consciousness for that? The way of Dakota's breaking dialogues really made me frustrating. No symbols used. Poor directing for that matter of fact.Okay except Dakota's good figure, even whipping is undramatic and boring.

Do not compare to the book but it is overall a good film that explores sex in an artistic way.,I have read the Books by E.L.James and throughly enjoyed them. When the film came out I was so excited to go and see it so when my boyfriend took me to see it on Valentine's day as part of my gift I was so happy! It contains many of the events in the book however it's done in a shorter way. It does emphasis on sex as you would expect but it does it in an artistic way that makes you happy to watch and it doesn't look like porn as many people have been saying. It has all been done very tastefully :). Some of the scenes in my opinion were slightly too long but overall a great film. The soundtrack is amazing especially Ellie Goulding's love me like you do.

Fifty Shades Of Garbage,"It finally was filmed. A movie with absolutely no storyline what so ever. A movie that has made over a half a billion dollars due to the post advertising of the film and the writing of the book. I never read the book but did go to the movie to see what all the hype was about. I can say this was one of the worse movies made. A plain girl who draws the attention of a billionaire. A weird billionaire at that. He leads her into the dark world of whips,leather belts and sexual games. And that IS the entire movie. I went to the premiere and the stadium seating was totally filled from the bottom to the top. At the end of the movie I thought there was going to be a riot in the theater. Everyone,and I mean everyone, started talking, yelling, swearing at once. The young man next to me stood up, looked down at his girl friend and said ""I told you this movie was going to be a piece of crap...but you had to go!"" A half empty box of popcorn when flying to the screen stage. If you remember the final show of that great HBO series the ""Sopranos""..be prepared. The movie is total trash and I am not a stranger to movies of this type. Entertaining it was not. There was a much better 8-10 minute sex scene in JLo's movie ""The Boy Next Door"" that was far more sexier then this entire movie. And face it,that's what you went to see. Jamie Dornan (Gray) has said in an interview he will NOT be appearing in the sequel at the request of his wife. Ya..good play Mr. Dornan..until they put a $20,000,000 pay check in front of you. I'd have said the same thing to up that paycheck too. Based on the what I seen and heard I would be willing to bet the sequel won't make as near as much as this film did.

The blandest shades in a colorful portrait,"The film adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is exactly the kind of film that makes me seriously question the tastes of the mainstream and the approach Hollywood utilizes in adapting bestselling novels into films. To cut through all the evasive language and answer those reading this review have, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a horribly mediocre film, timid and unsatisfying in its depiction of the bondage and BDSM subculture, with dialog and acting that are frequently astonishing in how awful they can be. Having never read the E.L. James' trilogy, I, the ignorant, take a look at the film adaptation and have to question, like I did with the film adaptations of the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy and ask myself, ""is this really the root of the phenomenon?"" Just by watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" an ignorant soul has to assume that this is a muted representation of the book. A juicy, erotic book about bondage, which was said to describe sex acts in explicit detail, had to have been more graphic than what we got on-screen, and the characters, I sincerely hope, had to be more than empty vessels, as they were in the film at hand. What we get for the film version of the book isn't a piece of work without merit, but a drearily boring and safe depiction of a topic and a culture that deserve more respect, especially given this film being the mainstream break for both.The story follows Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a depressingly ordinary college girl, who goes through life without many close friends outside her roommate leads an existence of convention and routine. This changes when her roommate asks her to interview Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), an elusive, single billionaire who's consistent protection of his private life has warranted great question. From the moment she sees him, Anastasia is smitten with everything about him because he is everything she isn't: bold, confident, unafraid, and suave.One can tell just from the way Christian looks and speaks to Anastasia, having great patience and acceptance with her that he admires her for her own traits as well: she's simple, frightened, vulnerable, and just the kind of girl he's looking for. The two quietly hit it off, with Christian requesting simple things like coffee outings and simple hangouts before going through one of his many periods of being standoffish and confusing to Anastasia. Eventually, he reveals his motives; he's looking for a sexual relationship with no commitments and no conventionality in terms of going on dates. He wants sex and he wants it his way, proposing a contract to Anastasia in hopes she will become the submissive to his dominant, in which she'll stay at his spacious penthouse on weekends to engage in wild sexual escapades.I love the idea of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" being made into a film because it would make a topic that is so taboo and mainstream and force it into the limelight, optimistically making it something that more people would talk about. I was immediately frustrated when it was given an R rating, greatly limiting the impact of its presumably explicit sex scenes and resulting in a failed opportunity to also make the NC-17 more commercial and profitable (but that's another argument). To begin with, the sex scenes are a hair more graphic than what mainstream America is used to, but they're depressingly ordinary compared to what kind of emotions usually arise from BDSM activity. There isn't a lot to say with the scenes, surprisingly, and that's the biggest issue with them from the start.Johnson and Dornan fit their roles pretty well, in terms of accentuating the traits they need to and giving off the kind of vibes they need to as well. However, the two completely lack any kind of chemistry together. Maybe that's intentional, again alluding to Grey's refusal to make this a relationship of any conventionality, but it's difficult to get wrapped up in the sex scenes when both parties seem disinterested in one another and bored. Furthermore, the acting of the two leads varies from acceptable to incredibly poor and contrived, leading to the final nail in the coffin being the film's dialog.""Fifty Shades of Grey"" may go down as one of the most poorly-written films of the film year in terms of having singular lines of dialog that are capable of producing unintentional laughs and sneers. Lines like ""laters, baby,"" which Grey always says to Anastasia, ""I'm fifty shades of f***** up,"" as said by Grey, and a multitude of others that need greater context are uttered to cringe-worthy effect. Combine the element of brazenly bad dialog with unremarkable sex scenes and an an overall vapid portrayal of a sex subculture, and you have a film that flatlines when it should captivate and stun.The film, as I stated, isn't without its own merit. The cinematography is bleak but paradoxically inviting, with Seamus McGarvey making the color gray about as vibrant as it can be, so much so that infusing other colors effectively changes the mood of the audience as it does the characters. The contrast established between the characters functioning in the outside world and the characters functioning behind clothes doors is present, and McGarvey communicates that very well through look and tone, with screenwriter Kelly Marcel (writer of ""Saving Mr. Banks"") effectively doing it in dialog. Furthermore, the way the film creates a world established by these two characters that is left mostly uncorrupted by the opinions and interference of outside forces also helps it in establishing a level ground in its own world. But such features are secondary to the primary features, which should've been a lot more fleshed out and detailed than what was provided in a lackluster portrayal of an exciting idea.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Aburrida,"Very poor personality and the plot is extremely simple, with moments of several stops in the way of the story, only to see a video clip that doesn't show nothing but good looking vehicles. The main actors are correct, but their characters don't let them to make a better performances because the plot doesn't go ahead and they are all the time in the same place of their objectives. Locations are pretty, but mainly the office of the company and the flat where Grey lives. Sex sequences are shooted with taste but they can't achieve a real emotion in you. The result, in general, is very boring because you know that you will not see a real end of the film. This is the first adaptation of a trilogy (there are three books), so the end will come in two more films, as usually in the recent times of films based on books. Franchaises lately remain TV series more than a film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An atrocity, more kink and originality in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than this 125 minute film","You've heard from all the rest, now hear from the best movie site about this year's biggest mistake: Fifty Shades of Grey.You might be surprised by this fact, but this twenty-something female never read the 50 Shades series by E.L. James. As a member of the novel's target demographic fan base, you know the group that allegedly goes gaga for this crap, let me break it down for you folks out there.Even if you avoided hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey with a fervent effort, you probably were susceptible to some information about the film and book series. You know, assuming you don't live under a rock or are some survivalist living off the grid while you prepare for the end of the world. So a summary of the film and series is basically unnecessary. There's this meek girl named Anastasia Steele who meets a billionaire named Christian Grey. For some inexplicable reason they are captivated by one another and their lust-affair begins.Who here has watched porn? For those of you that didn't raise your hand, please skip to the next paragraph. For those of you who did, or should have because you are a liar, then read on. So you know that formula in porn, doesn't matter if its teacher-student, boss-secretary or housewife-handyman the recipe remains the same: BS dialogue to feign a reason for these two (or three) people getting it on and then bam: naked sex city! Nobody actually pays attention to what the porn stars are saying, not even the production companies, because nine times out of ten the video you are watching is free from any one of the known purveyors of this service. Same goes for this trash but rather than lasting about two or three minutes like with porn, it lasts close to forty minutes in the film.E.L. James wants you to think Christian Grey is this sexual, magnetic and mesmerizing man. You'll have to take James's word for it because there is nothing that actually serves as proof in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. There is more chemistry between Christian Grey and his suit than with Anastasia Steele. For a film whose whole foundation relies upon the main characters' inherent and undeniable attraction, this is kind of a big deal. From the initial meet-cute, which is just contrived exposition, the rest of the film unravels as the series of far-fetched events that theoretically lead to this, I guess you could call it, relationship.The character of Christian Grey is just your average billionaire playboy cliché, you know the type, the one that has his name on a building. Jamie Dornan's portrayal is equally uninspired and would've been more effective had it been done by a robot. For anything would have been an improvement to his emotionless and stiff performance. Dakota Johnson's version of Anastasia Steele is purely physical and devoid of feeling. She hunches her shoulders, drops her head and averts her eyes, but she doesn't inhabit the personality or character. Johnson does her best impression of acting, even desperately overacting at times to compensate for her co-star's inability to emote.So the characters and plot suck, but surely a film about BDSM has to still be entertaining, right? Wrong. Fifty Shades of Grey is about as sexually adventurous and innovative as vanilla yogurt. The audience of the theater I was in was in a fit of giggles because it is so dreadful it is cringe-worthy and awkward. This isn't BDSM, this isn't even kink or fetish, this is just sex: guy on top, holding your hands up above your head sex.Friends, family, generous guests: I implore you not to waste your time or hard earned money on this garbage. There's more kink in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than a 125 minute film based on source material stretching an unimaginable 500 pages, woof. The best thing about the film is the Crazy in Love remix by Beyonce.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Better Than Expected,"Firstly, let me just say I have not read the books. I heard nothing but people rubbishing this prior to watching it at my local theatre last night. I walked into the cinema expecting to have a bit of a chuckle and I walked out of the film surprised at how much I liked it! The other reviewers are correct in stating there was very little, to no, sexual chemistry apparent between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson although in spite of this, I feel they each played their respective roles quite well. From what I am told there was a fair bit of material left out of the film. All in all, a rather enjoyable movie to go and see provided you leave any high expectations at home....and no, I will not be rushing out to buy the books :)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I kept an open mind. My brain fell out.,"I really tried to see it from all angles. I forced myself to ignore the really weird dialogues, the uncontrollable female gasping at every touch of the guy, the impossibly longing looks shot to the girl or the fact that for any person I know, the behaviour of Grey would have really freaked them out (and I don't mean the sexual practices).But after all that, I just couldn't believe how inconsistent the characters were. Any story has a first goal that absolutely must be achieved, and that is the suspension of disbelief. When the viewer cannot believe things like this can EVER happen (I mean, we believe magic and star ships are OK) then the movie fails. This film has failed.I could not believe a twenty-something virgin can have the confidence necessary to wrap a hot charismatic experienced millionaire around her finger. I could not believe that a guy that needs to dominate women can be so weak and out of control. But worst of all, I could not believe the sex scenes.I understand and acknowledge that women have their fantasies, but the one about the hot single rich stud, domineering and charismatic, who falls head over heels for the virginal girl, then ultimately either submits to her cultural perspective on a normal relationship or gives her the power to reject him is not only spooky, it is offensive.Bottom line: Just like that joke about soft porn being hard porn at half the speed, this two hour long movie is a sort of softer soft porn, at a quarter of the speed. The fact that many critics praised the movie for being a lot better than the amateurishly written book makes female sensuality seem even more terrifying to me that it already was. And it was boring, people! So so boring!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
I have not read the books. Did not intend to watch the film.,"A spontaneous trip to the cinema resulted in the 'interesting' experience of watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. Honestly, my only two thoughts during the film were: is this young adult woman really that pathetic (or is she just thinking that her behaviour is 'cute') and whether the movie was a re-make of Twilight just without the Vampirism element - Mr. Grey and his ever brooding and agonised persona was a too great of a flashback of Edward Cullen.The only thing I had heard about this film (and book) before I watched it was that some found it female-liberating and some found it female- oppressive. I think that what ever you do in your boudoir - you do in your boudoir as long as both parties are in an agreement (the whole Dominant- Submissive thing), but the relationship between Ana and Christian, outside the bedroom, is VERY manipulative and degrading, and I ponder how someone (based solely on the film, of course) might find their relationship romantic.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 Shades of Lost.,"Although I do not find this film quite as terrible as others, it was not particularly one that I enjoyed either. I have read the book as well, so naturally I was constantly comparing the film to the book throughout the entire thing.I felt that the movie was very choppy, left out many parts that I found significant in the book, and that it had no aspect of mystery or room to let the viewers mind wander. It was a film about an average, college student who begins to fall for a rich entrepreneur who is completely different from her in every aspect. We learn about his secrets, and watch as the couple tries to overcome them but in the end can not. It is your generic love plot, just converted into a much more erotic and dark way.The movie went from scene to scene, often with no transition at all. Had I not read the book, I would have gotten lost. The filmmakers should have found a way to get from one place to another in a way that continued the story line but that flowed easier.I felt that the acting could have been better, however I do feel like they captured the look of the characters in the book well. Both Dornan and Johnson acted well, but I didn't feel the chemistry between them that I felt in the book. They appeared almost as if they were nervous and uncomfortable around each other.All in all, the movie was an okay film that I wouldn't recommend unless you don't mind skimming details and lots of inappropriate scenes.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Missing That Little Something.,"I liked the movie but if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have known what was going on because the characters lacked depth. They only explored the sexual theme. They left out the key relationships that helped to give the characters life like Kate, Ana and Jose's relationship. Sometimes the character of Kate pushed buttons and said things that helped Ana discover things. She's her protective girl friend I missed that interaction. It lacked that little stuff. And I actually liked Jamie Doran as Grey. I was excited when Charlie Hunnam got the role than disappointed because he gave it up. I see now it wasn't right for him.

Not as bad as people are saying,"I give the overall movie a MEH+ rating, however I think this movie was saved by the girl playing Anastasia, Dakota Johnson.I saw it with my wife for Valentines day on a double date with our gaming friends. I went into it thinking it was going to be the worst 2.5 hrs of my life, especially after seeing the low rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It wasn't that bad.My wife said that Anastasia was supposed to be homely and the main guy Christian was supposed to be super hot and out of her league. Well, the actress playing her was hard 10 ( I mean, come on, Don Johnson and Melanie Griffiths daughter isn't going to be hot?) , so the story of how easily he got into her pants didn't make much sense. And I could give or take all the sex scenes, they didn't help nor hurt the movie.However there was some excellent acting, especially on the part of Dakota and you could really empathize with the girl and could tell she had strong feelings for Christian. Most of the dialogue was forgettable, but several of the scenes stick in your mind. My wife had read the books and hated the movie because of all the stuff she said was missing from the film. It didn't seem like anything was quickly glossed over from a non-readers standpoint, so I would say that didn't affect the movie.If this movie did nothing other than introduce the world to the acting of Dakota Johnson, I say good enough for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 Ways to Bruise Your Lover,"This film is not recommended. (Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)In brief: 50 ways to bruise your lover...and an audience as well.GRADE: CFloggers ready...it's time to beat a dead horse! 50 Shades of Grey has arrived, a guilty pleasure that quickly becomes a guiltless displeasure.But first, let me digress...Years ago, my sweet elderly mother drove out-of-town to see the racy Saturday Night Fever, a popular R-rated film. Her desire to see this film proved greater than her actual enjoyment but, at least, she was able to experience it first hand and no one she knew would know her dirty little secret. Her reputation remained purloined and intact. I bring this up as that film was nearly forty years ago and not much has changed with the latest sexual romp being Fifty Shades of Grey. The beat (or the beatings) goes on, even with its wall-to-wall contemporary pop soundtrack.￼We now return to our regular scheduled review: Fifty Shades of Grey is a dull boring affair. The sex on screen is strictly rote, badly wrote. Most of this carnal action has been seen countless times in other sex films. You know the routine: quick cuts of breasts, rears, and even quicker glimpses of genitalia interspersed with arched backs and stylized poses in various states of undress, all looking for unattainable ecstasy. The sex is sanitized for the masses. After all, it has a R-rating. It's the softest of soft porn.Fifty Shades of Grey celebrates sexual diversity while condemning that sexual choice with Puritan fanaticism. It's smug, condescending, and pure fantasy. The filmmakers plays both sides hoping men can relate to that male dominance angle while women can empathize with their sensual desires. (I won't get into the debate of degrading women or the issue of sexual domination and violence. This film degrades mankind in its silly treatment and romantic disillusion of pleasure and pain.)￼James Dornan and Dakota Johnson play the mismatched lovers, Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Grey is handsome, sexy, and rich. He is ""the world's most eligible billionaire bachelor"". Ana is a young awkward and naive virgin, ready to be plucked and educated in the fine art of lovemaking. They stare longingly at each other. They breathe heavily and talk dirty. They strip down often, moping more than groping. The endless droning and groaning at the height of their sexual passions is repeated often between their trips to the infamous ""red"" room, a private boudoir filled with the all of the latest S&M equipment that money can buy. Ana continually bites her lips. Christian plays the piano whenever he needs a Zen moment since he never can crack a smile. He showers his pretty woman with expensive gifts and demands of obedience. She complies. And so it goes. On and on.Their mating dance becomes downright laughable. and their dialog is just awful. The actors are so intense and deadly serious, uttering this nonsense with every spoken sentence ending in large exclamation points. Both Mr. Dorman and Ms. Johnson are physically attractive performers, but their acting never rises to any level of reality. That they were able to say their lines with the straightest of faces, at least, shows some acting restraint. (I wish them all the luck in the future with more challenging roles than these one-dimensional characters allow.)￼The director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, does an adequate job, but she seems as obsessed with the excesses of Mr. Grey's vast empire as our darling Anastasia. This is a big budget picture after all, even if there is no real money shot. The director carefully places her camera strategically out of view of any male frontal views. (But there is still a fleeting glimpse of Ms. Johnson's private area that goes pubic, I mean public. So much for woman's liberation.)As Mr. Grey so eloquently states at one point in the movie, ""I'm fifty shades of f**ked up."" So is this movie.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
......Oh dear....,"I didn't want to bother doing a review for this movie, because being honest it doesn't deserve any more of my time. Nor your's for that matter. Getting straight to the point, a lot of this movie just doesn't work. At all.Based on the inanely stupid book of the same name you have cardboard cut out sheltered chick Anastasia Steele (yeah, really) and kinky billionaire Christian Grey who partake in confusing bondage sex that actually barely appears in the movie. Yep the most anticipated movie in years because of it's graphic sexual content and Twilight mum fan base that trolls the internet doesn't feature much sex.So if there's little sex in a movie all about bondage, bdsm and all that stuff what can we rely on to carry the movie? A good story? If you've read the books you already know the answer to that question (those who haven't, it's garbage). Good and interesting characters? The main characters have less engaging chemistry than a two hour chemistry lecture presented by a professor who should have retired a hundred years ago at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. If there was a huge amount of sex going on in this movie it would be more awkward and uncomfortable as opposed to sexy. Why? Because there is zero sexual tension in this movie which culminates in it committing the worst sex movie/porno sin...inducing boredom. Severe boredom.I give this movie props for two things: one it's actually shot fairly well and does it's best to create an intimate atmosphere (unfortunately the dialogue and awkwardness undoes all that hard work) Secondly at least it's not as laughably bad as the book its based on. Two kinda positive points results in it being given a 2/10.Thanks for reading and if you found this helpful /enjoyable check out my other reviews.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I, for one, really liked it","First of all, I read the books and found them entertaining, but I appreciated them for what they were. The movie could have been disastrous to watch, but I found it very enjoyable. I thought Dakota was a spot on Ana. While Jamie's Christian was probably not exactly what was in everyone's mind, I really thought he played him well. Both actors were great (yes great) and Sam made a beautiful film. I do think it was a tad bit rushed and could have been extended about 15 or 20 minutes to add a few more minor things. For me, the sex scenes and nudity were very tastefully done. It is not porn for crying out loud. Were there some cheesy lines? Of course. Is it going to win Oscars and receive critical acclaim? No. People giving it a 1/10 and dubbing it the worst movie ever clearly haven't seen very many movies. I think far more people liked it and don't want to admit it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Complete waste of time,"The advertisements for this movie left little to hope for. So I didn't go into it with high hopes and even then it managed to disappoint. The acting was forced and pathetic. It was set out like a teenage love film with occasional scenes of horrifically strange sex acts. It would also have been great if Ana followed the common procedure of shaving her private area... or at least trimming it dear Heavens. I literally fell asleep during this movie and got woken up by another viewer falling asleep and dropping their popcorn. The movie ends with the suggestion of the other two books being made into movies but Jamie Dornan is refusing to be Mr Grey anymore so it will hardly make sense. However, thanks to this wonderful decision of his a third series of The Fall has been announced.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Loved it and Couldn't Get Through The Book,"Watch this movie alone. You will enjoy it more. The acting was fabulous the entire premise is awkward and scary. The lack of music in parts is to show this awkwardness.I am a 41 female author and I couldn't get through the book. I am a submissive in my personal life and no one who would know me would guess this.The original billionaire fantasy is cheese in and of itself. However If you look beyond the bad music, lack of music or sound of any kind. there is an awkwardness that you cannot resists. I keep finding myself rewinding so I don't miss parts LOLI found this movie HOT! However, I think it would be awkward watching it with someone else in a theater. This is a personal awkward thing by its very nature. Best if enjoyed alone or with someone who understands.I thought it was perfect and exactly what it was supposed to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Look forward to the sequel,"I did not read the book, I saw the film then I got myself a copy of the book. I think the Director did a good job, the adjustments she made gave faster pace to the story and lost nothing that is essential. I disagree to comments that there is no chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson on screen. there is. They project faithfully and successfully the attraction the characters have for each other on screen. they each fit the looks of the characters described in the book. Jamie has the posture, the penetrating look on one hand and aloofness on the other. Dakota plays just right the part of a young, innocent and pretty graduate, unaware of her own sensuality. She takes after her mother, Melanie Griffith, sensuality is no lacking. I am not a middle age spinster or desperate housewife, I like a good love story and I look forward to the making of the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure rubbish!,"It's too bad I can't give this garbage a minus 10. After seeing this crap, Endless Love seemed such a significant movie. It was almost as though 50 Shades of Grey was filmed in one day and in only 2 different rooms. Yes, rooms. I'm a Seattle-ite so, for those who were impressed with the scenery, all I can say is; ""What scenery?""For those who haven't seen this, be glad. You can do so much with 2 hours of your time which I will not get back on mine. The book wasn't literary genius and it is obvious the film will not be classic. The only saving grace of the film is none, zilch, zero. There was not a single redeemable frame in the film! It is utter garbage that made money based on the rabid wish of people to prove themselves right in surmising this film will be a career ender to those who were involved in making it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Literally made me ask for my 2 hours back...,"This film would work as a parody for something. If you have any expectation you will be disappointed, but if you see it knowing it is the lowest movie possible, you might even laugh! In terms of conversations, it had as many lines as a Van Damme movie. She seems scared and about to cry most of the time, while he looks stupid and says things that make you think he's reciting from a different script. The sex scenes are really weak, there is no tension between the 2; the story and the characters don't seem to evolve naturally, rather the whole action seems fake and awkward. If you have not seen the movie yet, do not bother! I guess lots of people have seen this first part out of curiosity, but after their disappointment, I believe the next 2 films will play with empty cinemas.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pointless Crap! 2/10,"Review: What a load of rubbish! After all the dominating talk about what he's going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys, he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he can't live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie. The storyline is extremely simple! Basically, woman meets man! Man & Woman fall for each other! Man has a weird sex appetite! They Get It On! Simple! I thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love. I can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a man's point of view, it's boring and pointless. The acting wasn't bad because I was intrigued about the individuals background but I can't help feeling cheated. Maybe it's better on paper than it is on the big screen! Anyway, it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so there's obviously an audience for this type of movie but I really didn't get why there is so much hype surrounding it. Terrible!Round-Up: For a movie that is based around two characters falling in love, I really can't see were the $40million budget went. Jamie Doman has only really starred in TV series, except for his role in Marie Antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster. Dakota Johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies, like 21 Jump Street, Need For Speed, The Social Network and Black Mass starring Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch so she's obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen. Personally, I haven't heard of her before so I thought that she was a newcomer. Anyway, the director, Samantha Taylor- Johnson, has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are Districted, Nowhere Boy. Maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad. Its been reported that she won't be returning to make Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed so there's a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $570million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird, sexual appetite. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Well actually Dakota looks weird. And guys, why don't you put his vital in the movie? I mean come on. Dakota showed her breast. And your purpose is to make the watchers horny right? And I'm sure if your purpose is to make a good movie with art, it wont be like this. This is a seriously trash. I mean it about this movie is a porn. Even my boyfriend watched this just the sex scenes. He said he don't wanna watch another scene because it was boring.

He is complicated , try giving Christian a thought, can you describe in just max 2-3 adjectives Impossible He is a man with several ingredients People who say , 'why would a girl agree to be with a man who is hurting her' see the care he does for her ! She bloody stays because its love ! A man who has done something all his life and it gives him immense pleasure forgets about it and changes for an average girl Guys open up and do the thinking again With a positive mind Its a book to ponder on and not skip pages which do not have sexual content !

Fifty Shades Of 'Meh',"Fifty Shades of Grey is a very silly film, based on an over-hyped book, in which an incredibly attractive young billionaire decides to initialise a clumsy young girl into his world of sado-masochistic sex when she turns up one day to interview him.Aside from a few notably graphic scenes involving blindfolds, restraints and whips, their is virtually nothing here to distinguish this bromidic mush from the thousands of others tales of it's ilk... From the chiselled hunk with the 'tortured' past, to the flighty heroine, who one minute is all for this guy's weird fetishes, and the next (for no particular reason) decides to back away.In other words, don't expect an in-depth psychological profile... Christian Grey is a d*ck simply because he had some unfortunate experiences at the hands of an older woman in his youth (which aren't really elaborated on) and the brilliantly named Anastasia Steele wants true love in her life... She doesn't like it when Grey forces her into a more casual relationship. Still, at least he gives her a nice car. She should be a bit more grateful, if you ask me.Most of the film proceeds like this, with Grey popping up where Steele least expects him to, trying to 'get it on' with her at every possible moment, and Steele umming and arring over whether to sign a contract, which would turn her into Grey's personal plaything for months. In other words, she'd be selling HERSELF into slavery. But, hey... a slave with a nice car. Love that car.The attempts at drama fall as flat as the Rolo I sat on last night, the non-stop brooding by both leads becomes very irritating very quickly, and the always present pop songs in the background make you want to listen to the soundtrack, rather than suffer through the rest of this soporific slop. You know the one... ""I let you set the pace... Cos I'm not thinking ssttrraaiigghhtt"". Damn you Elle. And Damn this movie. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
For people who have not seen the movie and rated it 1/10. Such maturity.,"Well, I read the books several times and I still am. I saw the movie and I think it was perfect! But before I watch the film, I wanted to know what people who had seen the film could well think. There is a huuuuuuuuuge enemy team and the opposite. I read all opinions about fifty shades that are against it.It is right to have an opinion, but look, it's yours. Just do not generalize about feminist subject or anything else. Oh and yes, stop judging. There is a lot of people who are practicing this kind of sex. I do not judge you because you do not like Facebook or because you eat McDonalds, etc. Whatever...In the movie and the book, Anastasia was not forced by anyone to do it! She and only her decided to do it. This can be degrading for you, but maybe not for her ... and for all others who are practicing all that sex and stuff.For those who hate, if you do not like it, just go away and go live your life! I mean, yes, OK you do not like this, and you think this is the worst movie ever! Good for you! But people who have not read the book and have not seen the film have their own opinion about it. Maybe you do not like, but others like it.And please, don't stop putting 1/10 if have not seen the movie.Well, who the hell are you to judge ???",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why is everyone so hard on this movie?!,If you're going to watch this with the expectations of The Notebook level romance.. you'll be disappointed. IF you see it expecting a straight up porno.. you'll be disappointed. If you go in with no expectations and try to enjoy it for what it is... I think you'll enjoy it more than most of these people did. I think the chemistry between the actors was nice. It felt very unfinished to me but I did enjoy it and it left me wanting to see what happens next. I was rooting for them. I think the main actress made the scenes feel a little stiff and emotionless but I'm actually really looking forward to the next movies. I feel like the rating for this movie is really unfair and its just one of those things people love to hate because everyone else says its bad. 1 out of 10 stars?? Thats like Sharknado bad. There is NO WAY this movie is a 1 star. Take it with a grain of salt.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I've seen nothing as poor as this, and I probably never will","This film is beyond me, it's beyond terrible so much so that it gives cinema a bad reputation. Me and a friend saw this in a half full screening of mainly women, us being the minority male viewers.Firstly, how women can like this is shocking. There's blatantly no chemistry or expression of any intimacy between the two lead characters. There's nothing to suggest why any women would be even slightly aroused by the behaviour of this poorly written ""dominant"". It's almost as if you just presume they didn't actually like each other in any way, outside of the role.That being said,and it being so obvious, this film is degrading to women everywhere. The book must be too. If I presented a contract that suggested I sexually abused you via things like whips, sex toys and fisting you, I would expect you to run a mile or 60. The fact that he can do this (in film and book) and people found it arousing is pathetic. E.L James has degraded women everywhere, she's literally wrote something that dumps every morale standing women have, everything about Mr.Grey's behaviour is stereotypically slating the standards of females. By her writing, it's fine to treat women poorly if you have a ton of money, you've got a great body and like to exert the power you have to belittle women. Also, you like to intimidate them to a point where they can't speak, invade their lives like a stalker and force yourself into everything they do as if you were a spot on their face, just when they wanted to look flawless.I've never noticed poor choreography in a film, this film opened my eyes to how not to get actors/actresses to move on screen. It's awkward. The characters emotions are completely backward, there are points where the audience thinks she should do one thing, she does the opposite. Then its vice versa next scene.Don't waste you're time watching this generic, forcefully made, un-erotic, poorly written, terribly directed, miss- cast leads and emotionally redundant garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just didn't hit the mark.....,"A comment I heard before the movie was ""it's not good, but watchable"", was very fitting post watching Fifty.The movie had some great points; Dakota Johnson was fantastic in the lead. She was the exact character fit. I believe her acting bettered the character of the books. Her comic timing of scenes really made 'Anna' age appropriate and likable.Things that just didn't work as well...Jamie Dorian, I think he over thought the character and it didn't work. His physical presence wasn't compelling and his chemistry with Dakota wasn't tangible. Also, his accent slipped too many times, the script should have just made him 'English'.I felt that some of the nudity was there for nudity sake, not adding to the overall scene. I disagree with other comments regarding assault.The two biggest areas of improvement...The lighting, it was extremely poor to the point where it made most of BDSM scene awkward. The brightness of the BDSM scene felt like the 'red room' was a school class room full of fluorescent lighting. The movie needed to utilize more moody lighting such as the 'negotiation scene'. The overall movie needed a moodier feel.The script was too jammed pack with scene from the book that it made the movie feel rushed. It didn't build the required tension between the two main characters. It would have been better to have fewer scenes which were longer and more detailed.My recommendation is to watch it once it's on DVD without any expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
horrible chemistry for a movie about about relationships,"As I am not the target audience for fifty shades of Grey nor did I read any of the books, I am married to someone who did care to read the books and has now seen the film. As I stated before I did not read the books so I have the added benefit of judging this as just a film rather than judging it as an adaptation.This movie is not atrocious but its not good by any means. This film is all about a relationship, regardless of what they do in there relationship, This is the key factor in this film, the most important part about it. It was this key element that fifty shades of Grey lacks. The relationship between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey was not believable at all. The chemistry between the two actors was stiff and unbelievable. Although Dakota's performances was the redeemable quality of this film. It was Jaime's performance that gave the relationship it's stiff and scripted feel. Even though I didn't read the books and I don't know what Christian Grey's character is suppose to be, I still felt his character should have had more presence on the screen, Anastasia up staged him totally when he is suppose to be the dominant one.One of the biggest complaints I heard about the book was how poorly the book was written. This is clearly the case because the script was awful. The dialog, the story, and most importantly the relationship between Christian and Anastasia. I think this film had the potential to portray this relationship and all it entails with out making an all out smut film, but by having an actor who dominates the screen, as the relationship. Someone with more charisma. Instead it was Anastasia who stole the scenes.I think my biggest problem with this film is the fact it would have been interesting to see this story play out the way it was suppose to. To take this taboo subject and have it reflected in this film. I am going to give fifty shades of Grey a 4 out of 10. I recommend this if you have read the books and want to see this play out on the big screen, unfortunately if you liked the book I think your gonna be disappointed.

The sex scenes are not worth it,"So I just saw Fifty Shades of Grey in theaters by myself How has it come to this?I believe that for this review, a bit of back story is in order. One day, while waiting for my plane at an airport in Dallas, I stumbled upon the much talked about erotic novel. I had some money to spare and bought it out of pure boredom. I sat down and read it for the next few days, and I kinda liked it. Fifty Shades is what I'd called an ""easy read."" Not a piece of literature to be examined or talked about. Just a nice piece of smut to pass the time while you're forced to read Hamlet in English class. I was actually kind of rooting for this film in a way, as a I felt that people were taking it too seriously as a film. It's simple porn, what's there to criticize?However, as the reviews came in, the sirens went off in my head. With criticisms directed towards the acting and the characters and the writing, my expectation were hit. So I bought my ticket and just said to myself, ""Hey, if I'm not expecting much, then the film won't suck.""So, I sat down in a theater with a bunch of chatty young women and all of the boyfriends wanted to kill themselves, and the movie started.Well I didn't HATE it.So the major problem that I have with Fifty Shades of Grey is that it is boring. The scenes between the two main characters where they're just talking and interacting is just not interesting. You sit there waiting for the LEGENDARY sex scenes to come on, and even those aren't enough to carry the film! I know the BDSM scenes are shocking and new to most people, but the truth is, I'm not most people. And apparently, I wasn't alone because the guy sitting right next to me was just as bored as I was. I swear, we both yawned at the exact same time!The directing doesn't stand out at all. The shots and angles were pretty stationary and standard, nothing exciting or new or interesting. I did like one shot were Christian was sitting at a piano as the Seattle skyline shined in the night.Along with that, the acting was sub-par AT BEST. Nobody stands out. The whole time, I was just thinking, ""this actor is delivering their lines.""The character of Anastasia Steele can only be described as a pushover.And other than that, she's also can be pretty indecisive. I mean, she spends the whole movie complaining about how Christian doesn't treat her like a normal girlfriend (even though he does) and how this BDSM business is too much for her (even though the film shows she clearly likes.)Christian Grey is NOT an interesting character. He's merely a prop for female readers to grab on to. The purpose of him having a dark and lonely past, coupled by him being changed by Anastasia, is merely a female fantasy of taking a bad boy and trying to help him see ""love."" It's no brainer to me know how this evolved from Twilight fanfiction.But yeah, with all of that said, Fifty Shades of Grey is simply a boring romance film with a minuscule glimmer into the world of BDSM. But when you see that speck of a new world in sex and fetishes, it's really not much to write home about.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yes, there are a lot of nude-scenes in it, but isn't that what the book is about? Maybe they could've done more nude-scenes/sex-scenes, but then it wouldn't be just a movie, but a porn-movie.

Cheesy scripts. And very bad ending. The worst ending I have ever seen on any movie. And worst of all, guys miss the point.

Tell me why Christian looks like his balls dropped yesterday, with his 12 year old self. And Anastasia? Really now!? Anastasia was looking a little rough and old, and that's before all the beatings happened. I honestly feel like the theater needs to refund my money and than on top of that pay me yet another $20 dollars for the 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.

Bad Directing,"I love the book. Read the entire trilogy. However, the movie was disappointing. Dakota Johnson is a good actress. However, Christian Grey looked really short in the movie (in comparison, Tom Cruise is short, but he never looks short in any of his movies. Height should not matter). Several of the intimate scenes lacked good camera angles, editing, and heat. The scenes should have been shot with more focus on bringing the sensuality into the movie. The script was not bad, but Dakota Johnson has a playful side that could have been played up more in the movie. She is a good actress and the director should have used her more rather than going for a cut and dry interpretation of the movie. For example, the dance scene could have showcased a more playful side of her and the dancing between Christian and Anna should have been beautifully shot. the red room suspense was lacking too. The problem was that imagination just did not come alive on the cameras. I am disappointed and want to ask for a remake of the movie using the same actors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Chloroform In Print = Chloroform In Celluloid,"The emperor has no clothes. Or rather he does, they're just really really dull.Behold the sexploitation film. The bottom of the barrel in exploitation sub genres. And it's a deep barrel! Sexploitation is just one step short of outright porn. Except sexploitation doesn't rate as high a porn. At least pornography gratifies its audience. But 'Fifty Shades' doesn't even rate as high sexploitation.Behold the great American novel, the bottom of the barrel in print. Based on the recent successes of 'Twilight' and 'The DiVinci Code' and 'The Hunger Games' (the first novel to ever advertise itself as being plagiarized) the American reader is dumb as rocks. Raised on 'Sweet Valley High' and 'The Babysitters' Club' the American reader cannot be expected to comprehend any type plot, character development, or writing prose. It has to be dumbed down, mashed up, and spoon fed to them.When I first heard about the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' novels I was just as much up for (no puns intended) some good erotic fiction as any other reader. I read the first twenty pages of a bootleg version before I fell asleep. To sum it up in a single word it was ""juvenile."" It read like stereo instructions, as if the words had merely been randomly assembled by a computer program rather than a typing monkey.The mere names of the characters are laughable. Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele? Seriously? Were the names Hester Prynne and Seymour Butts already taken? How can any reader take this seriously after reading those names?The setting is equally as cardboard. An office. Move over 'Claiming of Sleeping Beauty' this erotic novel takes place in an office.So no matter what your personal tastes the last thing you want anything to be is boring. That's what 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is, boring and juvenile.Then came the media sensation! The novels were plugged left and right as being ""erotic"" and ""controversial."" As I already stated they're as ""erotic"" as stereo instructions and the claim of controversy would be more convincing if these novels weren't SOLD AT THE CHECKOUT LINE IN GROCERY STORES!!! Come on! How ""controversial"" can it be?Finally last night I chose to embrace the horror and get it over with and finally watch a bootleg version of this movie. How bad could it possibly be? I figured, if I could endure 'Cannibal Holocaust' 'Cannibal Ferox' 'Riki Oh' 'Salo' and ALL THREE 'ILSA' movies I could certainly survive this.I braced myself (no puns intended) for this ""controversial"" ""shocking"" ""erotic thriller"" which barely got an R rating to see..... bare breasts. That's right! The most shocking scenes in the movie feature bare breasts. That's it!!! That's the big ""shocker!"" Bare breasts! Dakota Johnson's flat as a board bare breasts. I can name PG movies that feature bare breasts!Staying true to the novel it was boring as sin. Well I guess I should have expected as much.This only reinforces what I've said all along. Who is the target audience here? There's no shortage of actual porn. And porn fans will be bored to tears. The only way they'd enjoy this is if the role of Anastasia Steele was played by Tanner Mayes and the role of Christian Grey was played by ten black men.At the same time other people won't be interested in seeing this trash. So who was the target audience to begin with?'Fifty Shades' is pure hype built on nothing. The emperor has no clothes. Or rather he does, they're just really really dull.I was very saddened to learn that this film was produced by Michael De Luca. The Michael De Luca? The same screen writer of one of the greatest films ever made 'In The Mouth of Madness'? Now I hate 'Fifty Shades of Grey' even more!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dumb,"Actually, dumb and disappointing. The acting was poor, the direction (was there really a director?) was non-existent, the plot was so bad that describing it as ""no plot"" would be most accurate. Those moviegoers who were expecting some erotic excitement were cheated. The beginning and end of the story could only be best described as when the film started and when it ended. In short, there was no reason to go to see this movie at all. I saw it on one of my pay movie channels so thankfully, I was out no money, and the producers and director received not a cent from me. What I was out was two hours of my life that I can't get back. And, oh yes, there was some emotion, but it was all mine and is better defined as anger. I have only gone to two movies in my life that were so bad that I growled around the theater searching for the manager so I could sign for and get my money back. This one was so bad that physical damage to the theater or the manager would only do even if I got my money back. Please, please don't watch this movie, even if you watch it for free, because it's not even worth zero. I thought (very briefly) of giving the movie a rating of ""2,"" because seeing the female star naked might be worth a ""2"" and she is indeed pretty and sexy.

How to make an unerotic erotic movie,"I watched this because I was advised to by... feminist women, who found it great.OK, first the sex scenes. They are rare and short, but more particularly they give the impression of having been edited by a puritan committee, which is totally awkward, because contradicting the intention to show kink. They stink, not of BDSM violence, but of such a hypocritical mixture of peeping and decency.Then, the emotional build-up maybe? Because that would differentiate a mainstream movie from cheap porn, right? Well, the male lead shows the emotions of a real estate agent walking a client through posh apartments, while all the time doubting that the client can pay. And as far as the fascinating virility goes, it turns out he has Mummy issues. The female lead displays the emotions of a girl visiting a new sports club. And eventually she decides she's not interested anyway. Good thing the director made her bite her lips a few times, so we can notice she felt some kind of fear. But her eyes looked totally uninterested throughout. The guy too.In the meanwhile, you have to sit through a lot of seemingly irrelevant scenes. In that respect they have achieved the feat of making those scenes feel both extremely long and extremely rushed. You constantly wonder if you might have missed something, that would explain where is the dramatic tension. Or even why the characters are there.So, basically, a very unpleasant movie. The real phenomenon is why it attracted such crowds. Surely the trailer made it appear hot, that accounts for the male audience presumably, so congrats to the producers for the tease of the decade. But what about those who declared it fascinating even after having watched it? Apparently, exclusively women.Here people like me are left in the role of a chemist during an experiment, seeing that something happens, and concluding that there must be a chemical element that has not been detected yet. The only element that I can assume is that the guy is immensely rich.To conclude, I would say that this is a success, not at all a failure. It achieved exactly what it was meant to achieve: lots of bucks.It will give lots of women an opportunity to complain about domestic abuse. Then lots of men will reply that a relationship where the woman says yes all the time, then finally says no and walks out free, is not domestic abuse. And altogether it will make a lot of tickets sold.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not that bad,"I haven't read the books and i don't think i am going to. Not one of the fans. That said , i just watched the film and it wasn't bad.Its sort of a mix Pretty woman / American Psycho / 9 1/2 weeks into a modern type of film.The lead actors weren't exactly extra-ordinary , but they were pretty good in their roles. They say there was no chemistry , well i detected some chemistry between them , there was a vibe accomplished. Maybe there was room for even more chemistry , better bond , better vibe , but i think it's biased and stubborn to say there was no chemistry.The direction was decent. Nice aerial shots to set the mainstream mood , and relaxing for the eye.The thing i liked most about the direction of the film , was that the sex scenes had a progressiveness , taking it step by step. So that in every scene , the audience is prepared for that level of progression. You get used to it , because it has been built up. It wasn't too sudden. Maybe this credit needs to be given to the screenwriter and not the director , maybe to both of them.From what i had been hearing about this film , i was expecting way more intense extremities surrounding the sexual relationship of the two leads.It isn't that much extreme. At least what it actually shows. The main flaw of this film for me , was that it didn't evolve a lot. Its more like a chart of a straight line with a few small bumps.Its not a line that goes uphill and downhill with a lot of harsh , sudden bumps.Meaning , nothing really intense happens throughout the whole film. Which is pretty bad, if its true , for any film.And thats just what this film impressed on me. It didn't raise the stakes much. It gave us a taste , but it didn't go for it. We took a tour and it ends.Still nice cinematography , and nice music ( but could be better). Its not a bad film to watch on a rainy night , when you're bored and can't think of any other film to watch.Its watchable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Captures the story,"I loved the books, all three. The story of Ana and Christian captured me completely. After seeing the reviews and rating given to the film I went to be disappointed. How wrong I was, within the first five minutes of watching the film I was captured again. I didn't move for the next two hours. It had warmth and humour,tension and emotion. Seeing Jamie as Mr Grey when cast I wasn't sure but will they ever find a Mr Grey to push everyone buttons. But he played Mr Grey brilliantly, he had all the facial expression you needed to know what he was thinking. But for me it was Dakota, she was excellent. Ana was funny and loving but so strong and in control. If you loved the books you won't be disappointed. I will be seeing it again and very soon.

Pretty Good!!!,"Watched Fifty Shades of Grey. The only thing that stands out is the amazing soundtrack. Oh! and thank god! they had a better cast than the Twilight franchisee. Though in the first half Dakota kept on constantly reminding me of Kristen Stewart's extremely irritating vague confusing too much underplaying. And I liked Jamie Dornan way better in Once Upon a Time. In here, his tone sounded as if he is trying too hard to suppress his Irish accent but he did succeed in projecting Christian's magnetism as it has been described, though I wish the leads had a better chemistry. The movie is pretty faithful to the book, though. All in all, I think the fans of the book will find worth watching it at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Glorified Porno for Repressed Young Women,"Understandably you may have been led to believe from Fifty Shades of Grey's marketing that it is edgy, racy and sexy. It is none of the above, yes you heard me correct and have been sorely mislead, but at least the marketing was highly successful.It is necessary to understand how the film came about, no pun intended. It was adapted from the poorly written book of the same name by ""author"" E. L. James, which in turn was adapted from a fan fiction of 'Twilight', all of this figures. Many of the plot points and events are parallels to the 'Twilight' saga and lines like ""I'm not the man for you"" feel directly lifted from it.But at least the film gets some things right, which is another way of saying barely anything at all. The film is well shot which is unsurprising when it is Seamus McGarvey who photographed the exquisite Avengers. However, this becomes redundant when the film you are photographing is utter trite.The music though, sounds like the things of wet dreams, yet never quite reaches the full potential of composer Danny Elfman, who is somewhat underutilized, as the majority of the film has techno pop songs thrown into the sound scape. 'Love Me Like You Do' is as expected the best element of Fifty Shades and Ellie Goulding's vocals accelerate the intimacy very well. I would rather listen to it a hundred times on a loop than watch the two or three inevitable sequels, depending on whether they split the last book in half.One more element that must be considered before I go on an endless rant is Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia Steele sounding awfully like a female porn star. She gets the chance to interview renounced Billionaire Christian Grey and they build a rapport to say the least. Johnson really should not be here leaving a giant mess of a film making a bad impact on her limited filmography. If this is the one that she expected to launch her into the atmosphere then God help her. She does the best with what she is given bless her. Mainly biting her lip and trembling with anticipation to be punished by Mr. Grey played by Jamie Dornan who has no idea what he is doing in any scene that he is in, it begs the question; does he even know how to have sex? Dornan is just plain and simply bland and bad, he delivers his lines with the dramatic resonance of a new comer to a soap opera. Almost winking at the camera like a reality TV star from Geordie Shore. At least he has the looks because otherwise he would have nothing going for him, this level of acting I expect to find in a low budget pornographic film, not a Hollywood Blockbuster or is that Block Basher?Which unfortunately brings me to the script. I do not think there has been one this awful and misguided since 'Twilight', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth'. It is the work of four amateurs (or at least it feels that way) and it sticks out like a sore thumb. How four people mashed together this terrible script is beyond any comprehension because it stinks. I have seen better work by one person, Aaron Sorkin, he seems to be one of the few script writers that actually possesses a working brain. The lines do induce laughs, but unintentional ones. You never feel that Grey and Steele are connected emotionally; they are only together because the script is insistent that they are. I fail to see what Anastasia gets out of their sexual encounters apart from losing her cherry. Mr Grey spanks her butt and that is all there is to it. No chemistry whatsoever. Dornan is like a plank of wood, but Johnson reaches to inject her character with some well needed development and tries to make sparks fly, they are just nowhere to be seen. If this is true love, then I think I have more sexual tension with my Blu- ray Surround Sound System.It is far too long and padded to the limit; and I thought 'The Hobbit' and 'The Hunger Games Mockingjay' where stretched to the max, within an inch of their lives. We have to sit through endless talking about mundane topics, which will seem sexual to a male audience under the age of twelve and a female audience under the age of sixteen. In the UK, 'Fifty Shades of Sh*te' is an 18, so they are unable to view it. The only audience members it therefore has are forty-year-old women who have tragic sex lives and unwilling couples who are fooled into watching it because it is released on Valentine's Day.Yes, there are sex scenes and we see Johnson's boobs and butt. However, this does not mean it is worth the ticket price; I do not care how amazing they both are! Dornan simply stares at her like the male equivalent of Bella and there we have it Twilight with rough sex! Which includes BDSM, but the writers seem to have glanced at what a Wikipedia page can tell you! There is no understanding prevalent in the film and Steele seems to be uncomfortable as her bum is slapped about. Just a hint, now might be the time to use your safe word.I can go on for no longer and cannot review what is the worst excuse for a film and not only the worst film of 2015, but also the worst film ever made. 'Batman and Robin' you have been robbed of your kingly crown. Don't take your loved one to see it. You may lose them forever.

Warning! Read this If you liked this movie! Seriously important!,"If you liked this movie either you are a female in hunger or a man with personality disorders. I read in a newspaper that a recent study reported that the woman who find this movie to be good have serious repressed sexuality issues. On the other hand, the guys who enjoy this movie apparently had problems in early stages of sexuality development. So if you had psychological growing issues during the organization of your individualization (separating from your mother) you will, for sure, like this movie; you can even feel some kind of pleasure by watching this perverted man (with serious sado-masochism disorders). It goes deeper in the early stages of the sexual development as Freud described it. I'm referring to the anal phase. The retention and lose of the faeces. The way you deal with it, and you cope, could determine sexually fixations, such as this. To the woman who wrote this story, this is also true; but, anyway, all the movies tells a lot about the ones who wrote them. Actually it seems that the movie could act as some form of catharsis, helping the writer to externalize her deepest, repressed and not fully-understanding desires. I must tell you, also, that this sexuality behaviour is not normal. Most of the people don't engage in this type of sexuality (wich in fact consists in a behavioural deviation) as the main form of satisfying their desires. Thankfuly! So, be warned. If you are one of those, there's still hope. Find a good analyst and deal with it. The world is full of people in psychological need.

There were a few nice set pieces, and a couple of moments where the filmmakers obviously tried to rise above their source material. That's the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1..Aside from a few OK scenes though, this movie is mostly awful.. There was NO chemistry between the two leads IMO. And for a movie whose subject matter is based almost entirely around S&M, there was extremely little to be found here. I did not expect the film to be a pornography, but considering the book reads like grocery store soft-core, I was surprised that the movie was so tame.

"sex scenes are lame, plot is ignorant and insulting","A baser reason one might watch this is to see the sex scenes, but even those are disappointing. The BDSM stuff that is actually shown is the kind that non-kinky folks might try just to be mix things up a bit in the bedroom. When I hear about places banning or cutting scenes, I wonder if the filmmakers encouraged this to build a rep. There are loads of better sources for bondage scenes out there, making this movie totally worthless in that department.Now it would be interesting to explore the dynamic that might result if two people fell in love where one of them is way into BDSM and the other is categorically turned off by that stuff. It would be cool to see love set against an irresolvable sexual preference in that way, and to explore the process of discovering how much trust and respect between people is really involved in BDSM stuff. Unfortunately this movie doesn't do those things.Instead, the film tries to convince us that the only reason someone might be into dominance role-playing is if he's a controlling selfish jerk who is not capable of love. The movie's only victory is a completely failure to communicate, both between the characters on screen, and between the filmmakers and their subject matter.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sticks and stones may break my bones but whips and chains excite me..,"When the sexually naive Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) interviews billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dorman) as a favour for her friend, sparks begin to fly. Christian begins to woo her by initially sending her expensive gifts and creepily stalking her. Eventually they get together and Christian tells her he has 'singular tastes'. Mmm, what could that mean? It's a bit of an understatement to say that Christian likes a bit of bondage and he wants to be a dominant to Anastasias Submissive. Ana appears reluctant at first but soon gives in to the charms of Christian. The sex scenes get more uncomfortable as it becomes increasingly obvious Ana is getting scarred, both physically and emotionally. The film is an adaptation of the book by E.L James and luckily she didn't write the screenplay. I'm saying this as I tried to read the book and managed just five chapters as it was such a badly written and tedious read. So kudos to director Sam Taylor-Johnson for making a decent attempt at it, showing you almost can polish a turd. The female side of me loves a bit of romance but I like it with a bit less violence. In one scene Christian really whips Ana hard and she looks visibly upset but he carries on regardless. It's a very selfish relationship and I don't see what Ana gets from it. Is the name Grey being ironic? OK, he's handsome, he can play the piano and fly a helicopter but he's so dull. Throughout the film all I could think was, ""Ana, what first attracted you to billionaire Christian Grey?"" I'm broadminded but the contract he tries to get Ana to sign quite shocked me, it's far too explicit for me to write the details here. Dakota Johnson as Ana is one shining light in the film, she's pretty and despite early reservations I think she was well cast. There isn't great chemistry between the leads but they try their best with the slim material they have to deal with. My favourite part is when Christian gets his chopper out (his helicopter, you dirty minded buggers) as the excellent Ellie Goulding track ""Love me like you do"" is played. The soundtrack deserves a mention, the music is better than the film deserves. I don't get the love for Christian Grey. I get that it's a fantasy but he's controlling, selfish and cold with few redeeming features (apart from him being a rich hunk, would he have the same attention if he was on job seekers allowance?) There is a decent romantic film in there somewhere and they did a much better job than I expected. I wasn't bored and found the relationship quite interesting but ultimately it left a nasty taste in my mouth.Verdict: I'm damning with faint praise, it's far better than it could have been, fans of the book will love it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY review by Mike SmithLiterature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey.When I write a review I try to find at least one good thing about every movie. That being said, Fifty shades of grey had NOTHING to contribute to my cinematic love. The cast is terrible; Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have no on screen chemistry. They don't keep us interested in the film because they can't act. At one point Charlie Hunnam was attached to play the main role of Christian Gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion I really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck. The writing is crap and Christian Gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper. Anastasia Steele seems like she is slow and dumb. One thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if Christian Gray was just an average guy, not a billionaire, the tone of the movie would be completely different. The music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs.And let's not forget the sex scenes, there is nothing special about any of it. So what, you see her boobs not a big deal, but the sex parts (which is what the books are built upon) are nothing to be excited about. I should have just watched a real porno! There would have been a better story and much better acting. It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon.

No shades whatsoever,"I rarely write reviews, but after seeing this film I felt I had to warn everyone. I have never seen anything duller. The acting was poor, the chemistry non-existent.

Successful white guy uses a minion for his amusement...,"Seriously tedious movie; the actors almost seem embarrassed to be delivering the contrived lines some drone slung together for them. I've never read the book and now have no wish to do so.

Christian Virtues,"Rarely has a movie elicited such heated controversy well before anyone actually had the opportunity to view it. Based on the first in an astonishingly bestselling series of novels by Erika Leonard (E.L. for short) James, its catchy title had already been punned to death (Fifty Shades of Chicken, anyone ?) prior to the ""official"" film version, numerous YouTube send-ups and unauthorized adult adaptations notwithstanding. Pretty much every aspect of the material would be endlessly debated, from casting choices to the tale's ""questionable"" sexual politics, prior to the movie hitting theaters just in time for Valentine's Day of 2015. I haven't read the books cause I'm a guy and when it comes to ""erotica"" I prefer pictures to the printed page. Rest assured that there will be plenty of other reviews (in fact there already are) to compare one to the other.What pleases me most about the film is that it has singlehandedly ended the drought of big screen skin flicks. Porno palaces are but a distant memory nowadays and while there has certainly been a considerable display of nudity and (not always) simulated sex on art-house screens, it is rarely presented as a pleasurable experience, thereby reducing audience stimulation to nil. I fondly remember the heyday of the sadly late Zalman King, back in the '90s, when polished soft-core porn (though, it must be stressed, always told from a female point of view, courtesy of King's significant other Patricia Louisiana Knop) like TWO MOON JUNCTION and WILD ORCHID played to packed houses. When he withdrew to the more carnally conducive channels of cable TV, there was hardly anyone left to pick up the sexual slack at mainstream multiplexes. One notable exception was Canadian (of Armenian descent) Atom Egoyan who abandoned art-house for the lurid delights of CHLOE and WHERE THE TRUTH LIES. Yet at the end of the day, these were still men treading on a woman's turf, claiming to do her carnal bidding but prohibited from accurately adopting her gaze because of their gender.Fifty Shades, the novel(s), has reclaimed literary eroticism for a female audience, hence the innumerable inferior spin-offs it has spawned to date. The movie attempts to achieve the same goal for its cinematic counterpart. Rumors of the book's graphic depictions being drastically toned down have not prevented yours truly from being pleasantly surprised at just how far an R-rating will stretch nowadays as this plays mighty close to NC-17. Another kicker was just how knowingly Kelly Marcel's solid screenplay toys with the genre's attendant clichés, starting with its impossibly glamorous setting (Christian Grey's offices peopled exclusively with eye-popping runway model types in identical tight-fitting business suits) and the lifestyles of the idle rich most of us can only dream of. One of porn's most enduring hallmarks is that it takes place in an idealized fantasy setting where no aspect of daily drudgery can detract from the sex and this film is all but an exception but still satirizes the concept simultaneously.Above all, this is a romance, for much of its duration (meet cute and initial courtship) a rom-com even, and a highly effective example of the form at that. The only difference being that the love and laughs, of which there are plenty (most of them intentional), are embellished with extended sex scenes of an increasingly BDSM slant. Members of said BDSM community have, of course, already spoken up that both novel and film completely misrepresent their erotic enclosure. Like so many, they are missing the point. The whips and handcuffs are part of Christian Grey's personal obsession which is at the center of what essentially amounts to an updated Gothic romance. I really like the fairytale flourishes added to the material, from Bluebeard (the secrets of the Red Room) to Beauty and the Beast (Christian allowing Anastasia to visit her mother in Georgia even though he can barely stand being without her at this point), elements that further enrich the tapestry woven by Misses James, Marcel and (drum roll) director Sam Taylor-Johnson. For the latter, this is the definitive rise from the ranks of relative anonymity after an intriguing contribution to 2006's porn anthology DESTRICTED showed she could handle screen sex and the early John Lennon biopic NOWHERE BOY proved she was capable of coping with actors. Needless to say, both abilities serve her exceedingly well on FIFTY SHADES.The beautiful daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and resembling both, Dakota Johnson is sure to become a household name after her turn as audience identification character Anastasia Steele, combining gauche inexperience (innocence rather than naiveté) with out of left field sophistication as she gets the 27-year old billionaire to do her bidding. This fantasy figure was always gonna be tough to cast but Irish-born Jamie Dornan (former Calvin Klein model, so that gets potential body issues out of the way, but especially memorable playing the psycho on TV's THE FALL) surpasses all preconceived notions and expectations by bringing a human dimension to what was very much in danger of ending up as a walking cliché. It also doesn't hurt that both actors strike sexual sparks off one another for the heavy breathing final act. Taylor-Johnson elegantly captures every nuance of the characters dancing around each other, sniffing each other out, building genuine eroticism through a succession of scenes, even (especially, in fact) when everyone's fully dressed. She only drops the ball once, switching to decorous slow motion when Christian wields the whip, literally softening the blows, an understandable if ill-advised tactic to render S&M more palatable stretching all the way back to Just Jaeckin's STORY OF O. The cliffhanger ending has me chomping at the bit for the surefire second installment. Honestly !",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible,"OH MY GOD! This movie was just horrible! Just horrible! Thank God I did not spend more than 10 dollars watching this in the Theatre. I rented it with my husband this past weekend and he stopped watching about 45 min into it. I tortured myself and stuck it out to the very end. What a disaster of a movie. I have seen real porn with better acting and that's not saying much. Dakota's acting was awful, she did not convince me at all. Jamie's acting was also just as dreadful. In my opinion he should have been darker, he did not get into his character whatsoever. The chemistry between them was non existent, I have more chemistry with a piece of rock!

The worst ever!,"Spoiler? well....This book/story deserves a better movie. Poorly done, felt like it was done by a student. Barely any conversations and all major details were gone! Dakota is probably the worst actress for now. She looked more like a recovering alcoholic who lost her hairbrush somewhere deep in woods, while Dornan was more of Edward Cullen's twin, only with bigger eyes. The part where she is like .."" I mean, look at me..."" and he goes ""I'm looking"" (I'm looking at your limp hair, bad acting skills and don't understand how you got picked for this movie!)...No mention of ""inner goddess"" (if you read the book, you know what I'm talking about). I mean, you gotta be drunk to kind of like this piece of ""art"". I feel bad for the author, that's a major failure, major!!! Some people in our audience fell asleep and started snoring, I bet! All religious organizations who are boycotting this movie don't even need to because it already failed. Seriously, I never felt so bad for spending $11.

Middle of Nowhere,"I'll admit that I tried to read the books but found them lacking and full of trite and ridiculous material. I failed to see what the big deal was about this story. Was it just sex? Surely not. Have we dropped so far in our sense of taste that this story was made a big deal solely because of its supposedly graphic nature? I can't believe that because there are other stories out there that are just as graphic that are beautifully written.I'll also admit that I saw this movie twice. Once I watched it on my own because I was bored and I figured if I couldn't make through the book, the movie would surely be easier and less painful. In truth, it was. I was able to watch the movie completely. But unfortunately I'm still left wondering what the big deal was about this movie.The pacing of the movie is terrible. It does two things. One, it rushes parts of the story that should be filled with character development and then two, it slows down to a snail's pace when showing unnecessary characters like her mother. Yes, her mother should be introduced at some point and this character should give some background as to why Ana would ever fall for such a guy as Christian Grey. It's true he's rich and somewhat good looking, but Ana knows more about him of course and she knows there is this supposed dark side to him. Maybe Anastasia's background could explain it. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen. All we get are slow scenes with her that take away from what little of this story there actually is.In the end, I sat through the movie waiting for the big pay off. There had to be a point to this. I gave it ample to time to develop. Something to at least show me there was a point to this movie. Something that went somewhere. It unfortunately never happened. The story basically takes you to the middle of nowhere and stops.What was the point of this movie? Why didn't it have a proper plot and pacing? The first story of a series should at least do that much. I fail to see where else this story could go after this? In the end, it's tired and been done before and much better. Plain girl comes across a mysterious, rich, and good looking man who is surrounded by beautiful women and of course he takes an interest in her and therefore plays out the fantasy of women everywhere right? Wrong. There are elements of that to this story but again it has been done before and again...much better.There simply isn't much going on here.I give it 3 stars because it was worth watching again with a friend just to get some laughs out of it and to riff it a bit. If you're into that, it'll serve it's purpose and enjoy. If not, just skip this one. Go watch a good porn, there is probably a better story there.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
fifty shades of boredom,"Anastasia Steele (Johnson) is a demure young English literature student at WSU Vancouver who reluctantly agrees to interview the handsome but icy, intimidating young business entrepreneur Christian Grey (Dornan) for her college newspaper. Enticed by his mojo and magnetic personality she begins seeing him, but soon learns that sexual dominance is his ultimate aphrodisiac. While her mind may tell her to put the kibosh on it before it begins, her body tells her something else entirely. For a movie that's meant to be the epitome of erotic this doesn't really generate much heat; DJ and JD lack fervent chemistry despite their clear willingness to perform in the buff while immersed in whips, chains, BDSM paraphernalia, and other kinky sexcapades. For as long as it requires the viewer to sit through all the sadomasochistic foreplay and shtupping, it sure doesn't provide anything resembling a legitimate payoff. **",,Anonymous,Romance

Maybe you should hire the screen writer that did ""The Fall"", now that's someone who knows what they are doing. The actors defiantly had chemistry, at the beginning anyway.

Way better than I could ever think,"Fact: I am a fan. So if you are not a fan, or you are just trying to read some opinions about the movie...know that. The book is definitely not the greatest literature, and even being a fan, I admit that the writing fails several times and it is not the book you exactly want to tell everybody proudly you read it...but f**k that...it's for our pleasure. Of course, there are many people who don't enjoy, or don't take any pleasure of it. Some will say that it's a smooth porn, others will tell that the BDSM's scenes are too sweet to be really close to what it is, and you will find those hating Anastasia being hit by a rich guy with a strange taste. Beyond all the early concept from who has not given a chance to that story, has not opened their minds to something that could actually be enjoyable, you have a chance to experience an interesting movie. Funny several times, has hot scenes, but it's not a porn. The book is not a porn, so as the movie. If you are expecting to see some 'parts' of the cast: forget it. Like I said...it's not a porn. Only Anastasia gets more of her body exposed, but you won't see her womb...it's pointless...although I think she could have shaved her low countries lol. The soundtrack was pretty good, the cast acting got over all of my fears, although I have not enjoyed the chosen actors for Kate, Eliot and Mia. Jamie and Dakota has given life to Christian and Anastasia in a way much better acting than I was expecting. The movie, I would dare to say, has the power to conquer even those who did not read the book...but of course, you have to keep your mind opened and, please, stop creating monsters over this simply and catching story.

However, from Christian Grey's appearance to Ana's inability to not look like a moron trying to pull off a sexy lip-biting look, the movie is completely miscast. I doubt that the actors or anyone involved in the making of this movie actually took the time to read the original book.

Film Review: Fifty Shades of Grey/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn't know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.It's not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn't exist before E.L. James' novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.I'm not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screen writing and acting skills, you can't do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film's production.Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate's (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper's article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn't meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people's lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine's Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of 'love' for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?Fifty Shades of Grey is a film void of romance, as is the chemistry between its leads. Forcing to become lovers: one a submissive and one a dominant, is clearly seen between the chemistry of Johnson and Dornan. Looking more like two people exploring the world of James' highly clichéd and unoriginal imagination, Johnson and Dornan look strapped and tied to fake and cheap material within every frame. Hopefully, the scars and marks left from the production doesn't act as a metaphorical stain for these two talented actors for the rest of their careers by being typed casted.My biggest concern of the film is if, by forcing this popular notion of submission and dominance to young girls, charmed and enthralled by the glamorized and wholly unreal Christian Grey ever going to be taken advantage of by older, predatorily type males? What type of message does this source material and film send women who are naive, submissive, innocent and easily charmed by the erotically charged notion of rich men with high brow toys being able to get away with anything they want? Violence, language and difficult subject matters are always at the forefront of rating controversy, yet this film was easily given an R rating, when it's message is one that needs to be taken seriously and cautiously, especially for young women.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Definitely not unwatchable, but still boring","I was interested in why this story became such a big success, so I went to watch it last night. My opinion is, that this story (at least in the way it was adapted to the big screen) simply isn't entertaining enough for a 2-hour movie. It starts well, the main characters are interesting at the beginning (especially Grey), but after a 30 minutes of watching, I was pretty bored. In addition, the so-called story is very predictable, even for those who didn't read the book (like myself). The acting and the soundtrack was good, Dakota Johnson is a beauty, but these things can't save an entire movie.

Not as bad as I expected,"I have read the books. And I have to admit, I didn't enjoy the books as much as I enjoyed the movie. First of all, let's talk about the casting. I think Dakota Johnson did a nice job. She's kind of what I imagined Ana to be. Jamie Dornan on the other hand isn't... I like him as an actor, and I think he did great. But the way he looks just doesn't fit in my opinion. He seems to sweet. No problem for anyone who hasn't read the books, though.I thought the film was quite alright, actually. It was definitely not too dark and heavy like I expected from everyone's reviews. Ana is bubbly and funny, which is not at all the way she seemed in the books. When it comes to the sex part, as long as you're okay with a bit of boob and pubic hair here and there, it's not that provocative. Of course there's the topic of BDSM, but I think it's not shown like a terrible form of physical abuse like I've read here. It didn't seem disturbing to me.I thought it was a romantic, funny and easy movie that's perfectly appropriate to watch on a girl's night or a movie night with your boy/girlfriend",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nailed it!,"One of my favorite novels has finally came on the big screen!

Popular fan fiction turned into an average but cute drama,"I give this film a 6 because maybe I'm biased. I have always read erotic fan fiction involving my favourite celebrities. I favour the writing skills of the authors and how they emotionally engage the (mostly female) audience.I admit I never read the books of Fifty Shades Of Grey as I shun from overly hyped books.However, through the hype of this film, I found out about the BDSM aspect of this sexy drama/romance and, being a red blooded female, was drawn to it. I also found the idea of an average but cute young woman being prayed upon by a perverted man sexy and exciting. Maybe I'm just weird.The sex and nudity (mostly altered for the screen as the original content in the book is graphic) is nothing too explicit. I had seen hotter scenes in older erotic movies.That said, Dakota Johnson makes a very lovely literature student, Anastasia Steele, changed into a sexual woman by perverted and mysterious Christian Gray (played by Jamie Dornan).The problem is with Jamie Dornan, who could have made his Christian character more intimidating and cold but seemed to lack the motivation to do so. At least Dakota did a fine job of portraying a young, innocent woman who is romantically lured to the mysterious Christian.An almost ordinary drama, but cute and highly watchable.

"Haters, stay home.","I hardly ever write reviews but the scores and ignorant reviews for this movie annoy me.First point; if you didn't like the books then REALLY don't bother watching the movie because they really stuck to the book. Actions or thoughts are not explained better in the acting than they are the book so save yourself the trouble and please DON'T write reviews as they're not relevant to fans.I saw the movie in a packed theatre yesterday and loved it! Fanning made Anastasia a witty, funny character with personality and that was my biggest fear. That she might've been portrayed as a Twilight's Bella again; flat and boring. Dornan performed well but the first scenes didn't draw me in as much as I wanted to because the tension wasn't built well. The pace was a bit too quick compared to the book. From the moment she gets to his place I think it starts building up better.Dornan did his best. I saw him act in 'The Fall' and 'Flying home' and I'm sure he knows how to act. His American (fake) accent didn't bother me much, he was bossy and pushy enough to a point where it bothered me less than it did in the book. Would Bomber have been a better choice? When it comes to looks, maybe but I'm not complaining. The casting for Elliot and Taylor were fine, Mia/Rita Ora's overacting bothered me.The sex is definitely present. In a full (European) theatre there was an utter silence during all that (almost) full nudity. But hey, not complaining. It definitely gave me more than what I expected in that area. These are 2 people who consent in doing this, so let's skip the 'rape' drama. As these books sold over 100 of millions I'm guessing this is exactly what so many people fantasize about.All in all great romantic movie with a European feel because of the elaborate sex scenes. What bothered me was the chopped ending that made me think about 'The Hobbit'. To chop it off like that was unnecessary since the second book provides enough matter to make an interesting story.Enjoy this guilty pleasure and don't feel bad about it. The fine soundtrack that starts with 'I put a spell on you' doesn't hurt either. Definitely a movie made aimed to please.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fifty Shades of Twilight?,"*SPOILER ALERT*I am only given this 4 stars because the idea of this movie pleased me more than the actual movie. The whole 20something billionaire thing actually didn't bother me. It's a movie so it doesn't have to necessarily in sync with reality.My friends and co-workers were raving and talking about the book series constantly and trying to get me to read it so I finally did, the whole series. Not awful, series ending was decent. But the whole thing was just weird.I feel like the movie is the adult version of the twilight series with a creepy twist. Bad female lead with little to no acting skills. Creepy-esque male lead with issues. It just was all too familiar. And I never paid to see to the movie, thank god. The whole rape/forced feeding/strange behavior by ""Mr. Grey"" was so out of wack with my idea of BDSM that I actually did my research and found out what legitimate BDSM is.Waste of money if you paid for it, waste of time to watch, and waste of paper and film.

Dog poo poo,"As a connoisseur of all things BDSM, bondage, and leather.....
This movie was written by a bunch of amateurs that don't even know what it's like to trust yourself so much to trust someone else with their body. If they even knew what the intimacy of being strapped down and covered in leather to submit to your partner, then they would have not painted this beautiful ART in such a negative light. This movie reminded me however, of the mastery that the Pixar classic, Cars 3, with the strong female lead being able to silence the conquer the male role.

"BDSM? Nah, just Chick-Flick through and through","Thank God I'm not the only one here thinking the movie was horrid. I really hate to admit it, but it was even worse than Breaking Dawn, despite being equally horrid. At least Breaking Dawn has an actual plot, but I think I've heard Fifty Shades'plot somewhere else, like, it's oozing in every adult-romance novels there is. The only difference that those chick flicks dealt with normal sexual preference instead of BDSM.When I first heard about BDSM theme of the novel (haven't read it), I thought it'd be about a BDSM maniac guy and his one hell of twisted life. But, after watching the first half of the movie, I thought, ""What the hell? It's nothing twisted, it's totally chick- flick!""I'm never a big-fan of chick-flicks, and it's hard to determine which one's more irrational; zombie's falling in love, sparkling- skinned vampire, or impeccably gentleman-like BDSM maniac. I think I'd opt for the last to be the most impossible. Yup, bottom line.I don't understand what the big fuss people were talking about this movie. Honestly, after the first half of the movie, I practically sleeping in the second half. It's everything to be expected from a chick-flicks; a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy falling in love (well, maybe, since I never read the novels and most likely would never, thanks to this infernal movie) with an innocent young woman and (most likely) would change him someday. *yawn* It's too chick-flicks, I can barely stand it.Acting aside, they're just as wooden as Kristen Stewart, everybody could see that. For me, it's nothing more than a delusional fantasy of every girl. Well, who wouldn't fall for a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy even if he's a maniac? You get a new car, new laptop, a room that you could decorate all you want, and a romantic date every weekend. And then you get to have your own personal health-monitor and not to be afraid of venereal disease when you're having 'fun' with said guy. Now, sparkling-skinned vampire becoming even more and more realistic. Blah...Honestly, I prefer sparkling-skinned vampire. Sure, both guys are impeccably gentleman-like. But the vampire was consistent throughout the movie(s), while the BDSM maniac doesn't even sit well with his own contract. It's just doesn't make sense.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Only my opinion,"I like to leave my opinion that is just that: an opinion. It is not a criticism or a judgment, I'm not a specialist. About the books: I read all three. The first is my favorite. I do not consider either pornographic or erotic. I don't think CG is a dominant, instead is a control freak with singular tastes that help him to release his wounds (as the result of a difficult childhood, he has the need to control emotions and situations just to feel safe). He's a man with a lack of self-love and therefore he doesn't accept that someone can love him unconditionally. AS is a romantic girl but not naive. She's just waiting for real love. And surrenders to it, even when she discovers a whole world of less common sexual practices. It is therefore a love story. It has delicious seduction games, some fascinating dialogues. But that's all that is: a wonderful love story. About the movie: I expected so much more. I think it is a screenplay error. I believe that were left out scenes and dialogues which, would be relevant to the viewer (including those o didn't read the books) and could capture the intensity of the relationship between them. I think JD and DJ did the best they could with an unappetizing script. I had never seen DJ acting, but i think thought she is a promising actress. JD is phenomenal: his facial expressions of sometimes despair, sometimes charm, sometimes cold, sometimes free (when he heats ana at the end). (Please watch The Fall, one of the best series in last years, and you'll see what a great actor he is). I think Sam Taylor-Johnson did a god job and i enjoyed the soundtrack. Unfortunately, i believe this movie is the product of bad script; but fortunately it is a box office hit.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
' Roll your eyes at me again and I will put you across my knee!',"Though a few years late in viewing this immensely popular film and not having read E.L. James series of novels on dominant and submissive sexual experiences, the 'better late than never' applies. No, this is not a 'great movie' but as adapted for the screen by Kelly Marcel it is entertaining (though a bit long) and it is cast with credible appearing characters (the central focus couple spends the better part of the 125 minute film without clothes and pushing the usual standards of X rated to the limits - almost). Sam Taylor - Johnson, the British female director manages the situation well.Shy literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) rooms with the worldly Kate (Eloise Mumford) and goes to interview the wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) as a favor to Kate who is to interview Grey for the school paper. She encounters a beautiful, brilliant and intimidating man. The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. He gradually introduces (? seduces) into the realm of submission and dominance - and the film ends with a cliffhanger that guarantees the continuation of James' novel.Johnson and Dornan have fine chemistry and make the affaire noir credible. The others in the cast who contribute well are Jennifer Ehle (Ana's mother), Marcia Gay Harden (Christian's mother) and bit parts by Victor Rasuk, Max Martin and Luke Grimes among others.Be prepared for a lot of visual body contact - but of course everyone knows the story and its reason for being because of all the flutter about James' novels.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
If they wanted this to be sensual,"They really needed to pick a better cast.Dakota Johnson is neither sensual nor a decent actor. I'd compare her talent to that of. Ali McGraw.The stylist was way off base with the childish hairstyle, and wardrobe. He wasn't much more convincing as the dominating side of a BDS pair and she certainly picked up way too fast on the pleasure for someone who started with no experience at all and having just met a man completely out of her league in stature and wealth.The story itself is not believable or appealing. It has an element of abuse that shouldn't be there if both parties are fully engaged in the practice of BDS and don't extend it outside of the acts of sex. His obsessive ownership of her every move is a trigger for anyone who has been in a controlling abusive relationship.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly funny. Great girls night out flick,"I read the books, so I wanted to see how they could turn it into a movie. I give it to the actors especially Dakota Johnson. She was perfect for the role and she played her character really well. Those are some intimate scenes and thanks to her performance, weren't weird to watch.The biggest surprise to me is its funny! The book is serious with lots of sex details so to see them lighten things up with comedy was great. I loved seeing it in a theater full of women.Did I think this book was a romance for the ages and a soon to be classic novel no! So I didn't expect this to be a ""Notebook"" type movie. I wished it could have been a little longer so you get more character detail. The music was used great in the film.I will see it again because I think it's a fun girls night out film.

Awful casting choices and no chemistry between leads,First of all who ever decided to cast Jamie Dorman as Christian Grey made the biggest mistake. Second the two leads had no chemistry whatsoever!!

"Not completely awful, just kinda lame","After hilarity Jupiter Ascending was, we get these few weeks later. This movie isn't as horrible as Jupiter Ascending, but it's far from being good. But still, what would you expect from an even more hilarious book?I'll admit, the trailers were pretty good with a cool soundtrack and it actually looked promising and exciting in some parts, but no. There are 5 or 6, I can't remember, really short sex scenes with really toned down nudity and no one will be satisfied with them. For guys, Dakota Johnson just isn't attractive enough and for girls, they won't see Jamie Dornan's junk and end up being disappointing. I'm aware that this isn't a porno and wasn't supposed to be, but it could be a little more juicy because that's kinda the reason everyone went to see this movie and regretted it. The plot is very faithful to the book and considering that nothing really interesting happens in the first book aside from all that sex, this movie will probably be boring to you. But, like Jupiter Ascending, you can watch it with your friends and laugh at it. The cringe-worthy acting and writing are so bad it's hilarious. Okay, the actors weren't THAT horrible. They did what they could, but the script was awful and that's the main problem. The blame for that is probably on E.L. James because she was given too much freedom on set and you could even say it was written and directed by her.Sam Taylor Johnson did a decent job as far as she could and the movie is actually very well shot and the soundtrack and score fit the movie very well. But, Danny Elfman, what are you doing here? You deserve so much movies that are better than this. They must have promised him a lot of money. But at least he gave the movie one more positive side.I'm not calling this movie a complete garbage, it does have very few good sides, but it's still fun when you watch it with your friends and laugh your a*s off, but it's just lame. Maybe the sequel will be better and less embarrassing because more stuff happens and everything, but we will see.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
5/10,"I have read the book and I must say that I am a huge fan. When I say huge, I actually mean monumental. So I bought ticket to the fifty shades movie one month in advance so I could watch it with my girlfriends on the opening day. And the days seemed to go on and on and on until the movie. Finally the day came and when I was sitting on the cinema I was a bit nervous. What if it turned out bad? Such a good story should have a really great movie. And I found out my worst fear were true. Now I like the movie because I love the book and the story but the movie in itself is just bad. The best way I can put the biggest problem in this movie is that instead of a continuous line, the story line feels like a continuous one. Like different pieces of a puzzle glued together by force not because they fit. I think it just suffered from a problem of bad directing. Also I love the soundtrack, but it is incomplete. There are just to many parts of the movie where you just listen to them talk and in the best part of those, I believe that an original score would have been for the best. Perhaps even necessary. This being said, the first movie of all beloved series is the worst so I'll be anxiously waiting for Fifty Shades Darker and I have very high hopes for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fans of the book will be satisfied! Urge non book readers to either have a brief!,"So I've just watched the film and felt as this review is fresh and I should post it ASAP!OKAY, if you have not read the book it's X-rated sort of messed up romantic film with a lot of important bits cut out. But bare in mind the book has a lot more sex than the film. I thought it may all be porn but it turned out they managed to harvest the storyline well.There are in fact three books and this film is book one, so don't get caught up with - god what was the point in that and blah blah. The first book gets you to enjoy the character of Anastacia and Christian and how he is basically the bad guy gone good as most romantic heart throb men are in good films typically, when they then meet ""the one girl"" that changes them forever. But you realise Christian has that little edge to him.I personally was disappointed with Christian Grey's actor as he's not the charmer I imagined him to be in the book. I thought Anastacia was good, Dakota was brilliant, so real, so normal, I cannot even begin to imagine how much of a challenge this was to make as an actor. Yet I did grow to like them both more, but maybe because I know the characters already I already liked them.I wanted so much more though. The book isn't written well but it is addictive, sort of like when you get hooked on reality TV and you don't know why.I did love the books, honestly. It made me think about how funny and strange relationships are, I felt as though Fifty Shades the film kind of sums up what loving someone is really like, you'd do anything for them even if it means being hurt physically or mentally. As a woman it's hard to submit to a man, and when you fall, you fall hard. I enjoyed watching Anastacia fight her her needs and wants in the relationship, and not conforming. As my favourite film Gone Girl explains e.g. The style of music a woman likes and the way they dress will have a lot to do with what their partner likes. I hurt for Anastacia in this film, I wanted it to be cliché I think that's why I needed to write this, because secretly everyone likes a cliché ending.I mean think about it, if you were Anna what would you do? You'd play it like she did... A billionaire falling for you? Buying you amazing gifts...? You'd be shocked. You'd be flattered. But someone who wanted do that to you... You'd run.

Was it meant to be a comedy?,"By some distance, the worst film I have ever watched. The whole thing reeks of a low budget 1980's made-for-tv schedule filler. Where to start with describing the sheer awfulness on display. Plot? Non-existent. No tension, no jeopardy, no twists, no hooks whatsoever, just boring, boring, boring. Directing? Full of cinematic cliches that you've seen a thousand times before. Boring, boring, boring. Production? Specifically the background music. Or should I say 'foreground music' so bad, so intrusive. I'm sure the intent was to 'heighten the mood' but it just rode roughshod over whatever was happening onscreen, dreadful. Acting? All I can say is that Jamie Dornan has come on a long way since this, thankfully. Writing? I'll save the 'best' until last. Who was this written by? A 15yr old. SO clunky, predictable and lazy. Lines that would be rejected from a school play for these reasons. I'm sure this wasn't intended to be a comedy but it sure turned out that way. But for all the wrong reasons.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

If the movie was fairly judged for what it is I'd probably rate it a 7 but choose to give it a 10 to compensate.I thought it was filmed beautifully and the acting flawless. I haven't read the books but watched it being a fan of Jamie Dornan, if you haven't already you should watch him in The Fall with Gillian Anderson.

Fremdschämen at its very best!,"Boy, boy, boy. I don't know where to begin with this one.Okay. So, did I expect much? Nope. Because I (kinda) read the 1st book of this glamorous series called ""Fifty Shades"" by one E.L. James. Morbid curiosity got the better of me... ""Kinda"" because I was very much unable to finish even the first book. To even get to the 50% mark.But. I told myself that the movie had to be better. Firstly, because of Jamie Dornan, an actor who crossed my radar way before that whole train wreck of a film (and book). I really liked him. (Still do, although I hope that he won't be branded too much by the whole ""Christian Grey"" affair.) Secondly, the movie had to be better because a film couldn't possibly contain all these god-awful and painfully cringeworthy ramblings and inner monologues of one Anastasia Steele... those of her ""subconscious"" or her beloved ""inner goddess"". That brings me to thirdly (and lastly): because the script could only be an improvement of E.L. James' writing, or so I thought.Well, to be totally fair, the film actually manages to not be as dreadful as the book it's based on. Kudos for that. But that doesn't mean it was good in any sense of the word. Far from it.The film (same as the book) is a series of scenes of ""Fremdschämen"" strung together, to say the least. ""The cringeworthy"" simply never stops. The extremely cringeworthy dialogues between Christian and Ana. (Oh man, are they ever not?) The cringeworthy way Cristian Grey's stalking behaviour (and behaviour in general) gets romanticised. The cringeworthy (and wrong) portrayal of BDSM and people being into more, let's call it colorful sex. People taking home the message that Christian's general behaviour is okay because ""he's a Dom"" doesn't make it any better.It's funny (or not), how Christian always says That's not something I know"", This is who I am"", That's not how I do it"", You'll like it"", and at the very same time, while arguing that he doesn't know any other way, he's trying to impose his lifestyle on Ana. A lifestyle that she knows nothing about, that is obviously very alien to her. And is not at all ""the way how she does it"" or who she is"". But she'll like it"", it's for her pleasure after all, according to Christian, who, strangely enough, never once considers that Ana won't, in fact, like it. The thing is, Ana is clearly not very keen or enthusiastic about the whole BDSM idea, about playing the role of being submissive (because she is only that, playing a role, or trying to, as opposed to actually being submissive). Of course in the wonderfully world fantasised by one E.L. James, she'll either learn to love it later on (in the sequels). Because of him, Christian (imagine lovey-dovey eyes). Magic d*ck, come quick. Or, Ana will cure poor Christian of his bad, bad deviancy. Because looove. Either way, both are a total bag of utter nonsense, or, you know, cr...p.Oh, and don't get me started on the ""reason"" for Christian's deviant preferences. Because clearly, the only possible explanation for this kind of sexual deviance, for straying from the norm and liking BDSM and/or other fetishes has to be, gasp, an abusive childhood. Wow. Way to go, Mrs. James. Really. Chapeau. (No, wait. Are you bloody serious? ....)The only redeeming quality of the characters in the film is that Ana doesn't come across as the total blubbering, naive and insecure virgin that she is in the book. Emphasis on total.Also, what I don't get is (some) people being shocked at the degree of nudity in this film. Seriously? This is a film based on erotica, an erotic novel, or an erotic romance book in the very least. And it's (or wants to be) about BDSM – a sex fetish. So (kinky) sex scenes and nudity are to be expected. Come on.Well, to come to an end here: compared to the source material, this is practically a master piece. The acting is okay, as far as that is even possible considering what the actors have to work with. But compared to other films, I'm sorry to say, this was a disaster. On all counts. Ultimately, even the best actors (and writers) couldn't turn this into a grand film without throwing away the piece of rubbish that the book is and completely rewriting the story from scratch. I guess, you simply can't turn sh!!t to gold... I'm still amazed how they managed to fill two whole hours with barely anything happening.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Twilight is still worse,"Saw this to see what all the fuss was all about. The smart marketing guys and galls at Universal targeted this flick at women coz it opened at Valentine's Day and women crave roman at this time. This film is supposed to be romantic -and it sort of is- but at the same time it incorporates BDSM into the storyline (trust me, there is no BDSM in this film, very soft porn at best maybe) which is always good for controversy and to spike curiosity. A lot of criticism on this film was about the lead actress not being a strong female character, but that argument is moot. This film is supposed to be a female fantasy of a strong dominant rich alpha male who sweeps them of their feet. But it also tries to sell the not entirely convincing story of a tormented man with a socially unaccepted obsession. There is another film on this subject called 'Secretary' which did a lot better job at telling this story. I won't spoil anything but there is a comical scene (it's not intended to be funny) about a contract negotiation where words are used you normally don't hear in American mainstream cinema. So maybe we should be commending them in not trying to make a romantic comedy done a 1000 times before but do something a bit more dramatic. The problem is that it's not convincing, the dialogue is sometimes poorly written and it's basically a movie with an identity crisis, it tries to be more things than it is. they should have either gone full-out dramatic and focused on the story and made it darker and less mainstream or made it a flatout romance. In any case, it's not as bad as those twilight movies were and Dakota Johnson is quite nice to look at.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a waste of 125 min.,"This is officially the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! The acting was second rate, the characters were less then appealing. I had been told by a friend that the main character was a Sadistic F*@k... honestly, I was then intrigued, as well as excited to see what this man was capable of... I waited the entire movie to witness the sadism. To my dismay, nothing.. Nothing in this movie was in any nature sadistic. In my opinion this movie was worse then the Late Night ""B"" rated movies on Cinemax, or Worse yet the old Late night ""USA UP ALL NIGHT"" so called Sexualy Explicit movies. Just because this movie shows some breasts, the implication of fully naked bodies, and a peek of hairy male genitalia, which by the way I find repulsive, by no means makes it worthy of any exciting review or trailer..

For everyone putting doubts and hateful comments to the movie, it's just a movie. It's a love story between two characters that show love in a different way than others. Sam Taylor Johnson did a phenomenal job directing and portraying each scene with such magnificence. I give it a 10 over all! Go see the movie in theaters February 13, 2015! You will not regret it! Oh and another thing is that the protection and care Jamie and Dakota have for one another one set and off set was just amazing. There is nothing like it! I'm excited for 50 Shades Darker!

Two Major Problems,"This movie was butchered but in a very specific way. First it became a silent film in all the areas where it mattered, that was a colossal mistake. They should have made Ana narrate everything she was thinking, kind of like they did in Dexter, but instead they did.. nothing. So what ends up happening is, all the moments that would be described in great detail with thoughts and feelings are left unexplained. Of course no one who's never read the books would understand what was going on.Now on to the second massive blunder, the reason why the book was so fluid and worked so well is because of the encounter context, as in we put these specific people here and then make this situation play out in a way in which it makes her seem insecure and quirky(not shy and sad). Then and only then does the situation make sense and works. In the movie they did NONE of that. They took creative license but instead of cutting a few parts they shredded them all and made the encounters bland and tense. Case and point in the first couple of minutes in the movie, there was suppose to be an internal dialog where she's weirder out by all the blonde women on the way in, there's an entire section that brings out her insecurity and really gets the people to feel the emotion but instead there's none of that. They just skipped it entirely and went on with the movie.Bottom line this is just bad writing, whoever butchered this script needs to be fired and replaced with a person who understand the concept of writing, and can actually execute it without being held by the hand and directed around the playground like a child. 6/10 because the acting was pretty good despite the god awful script.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

This film is based off the popular novel by E.L James which was started as a twilight fan-fiction, turned into a novel, became a best seller somehow and now its one of the worst movies of this year. But guess what, it's made money so were going to have to sit through the next two sequels that will probably be made. The film is about Anastasia Steele, who does an interview for her friend Kate who is sick but after Ana comes back from the interview she feels better miraculously for some reason. Ana has to interview Christian Grey who is a young and very successful billionaire. She has the hots for him for some reason and is being asked to sign up to be his submissive to explore her sexual side. The film has the goal of appealing to it's demographic, I am not among that demographic but as film that is meant to have meaning, or be enjoyable, or fun even it most certainly does not succeed. All the characters feel like one dimensional real-world twilight characters. You got the female lead who is in love with the tough guy who is dangerous for her, you've got the completely different friend/roommate, and good friend who is in love her which sets up the love triangle. You probably want to know what I thought about the BDSM sex scenes, their there and I was not aroused. They are just filler and a plot device to tell this story, your girl might take you to see this but will make you delete your porn history. The acting in the film is alright from Dakota Johnson, I feel she could be doing better if the dialogue wan't so horrible. The direction is actually kind of good too. But as a whole this movie is fifty shades of crap, I'm giving it one silver ball out of five.( if you've read the book you'll get the silver ball reference.)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I tried to be open minded but,"Christian Grey is a guy who deals with history as a victim of abuse as a child by being elegantly and charmingly abusive, that is Christian Grey in a nut shell. as for the amazing Miss Steele, she gives us, over 21-year-old virgins, a bad name with here hilarious naivety, I mean, I live in third world country and I still know better than fall in such mistakes as she have fallen into. not only that each one of them is unrealistically troubled on their own right but they struggle to look good together and fail mainly because the dialogue is bad, it doesn't help them at all. now the second and third parts of the novels are becoming movies anyway, I really hop to see some character development, something to justify and correct all this part's mistakes or this trilogy is going to fall hard in the history of literature and movies among the worst.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
I May Never Go To The Movies Again,"Have we really sunk this low? This is what's considered entertainment? Poor Tippi has to see her granddaughter splayed all over the screen! This nonsensical tale is so tasteless, not to mention un-erotic, it makes you wonder whether the entire human race has lost their brains. It'll put you into a 2-hour coma. Poorly acted. Inane dialog. Hey, nice scenery. Did they have to steal the giddy glider rendezvous from the remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair?"" Have they no imagination of their own? Can't think of any redeeming qualities here. Someone please clue me in. No, wait! Better off spending your time reading D. H. Lawrence if you're looking for a wee bit of titillation. At least you'll get some exposure to good writing. And get this - ""Fifty Shades"" was such a sensation it merited a sequel! I give up. I'm going into hibernation. See ya!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I enjoyed the movie more so than the book,"The movie does not make her out to be an idiot like the book does. Then again, we cannot read her thoughts, so who knows? I am also glad I did not have to hear the phrase ""down there"". Lord knows if I heard that damn phrase, I would have walked out, so good on the screen writer. There is one sex scene I did find arousing, but that is where the line is drawn for me. The rest was, eh. I am sure if I did not read the book before seeing this, I would have thought it was ridiculous and pathetic. Since the books are more pathetic to read, watching the movie was not as bad, though still awful. I definitely say try to read the book before seeing the movie (though it is going to be very hard), but it makes the movie slightly more enjoyable.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
O.o I don't get all the negative reviews...I will be going to see the movie again,"Maybe Spoilers here!I went to see the movie today and was a little afraid after seeing the rating. But as a hardcore Fifty Shades of Grey fan I was ready to jump in and give it a try.So I will be quick with my points~ Dakota Johnson..Stunning..she was cute..charming...and classy she brought Anastasia Steele to life in front of me just the way I had pictured her from reading the 3 books.~ Jamie Dornan...yes his accent came through sometimes but I didn't notice it enough to make a big deal of it like some people are seeming to. His acting to me was great, his body language perfect, his look is amazing, he is a stunning man and a great actor. Too me he was intense, intimidating and kept me begging for me.~ The sex...was wow...kept me on my seats. I was a little afraid about seeing the red room in person and I thought they did it tastefully and to me it wont scare away people who have not read the books.~ Chemistry...who says they don't have Chemistry? or that the actors hate each other? You even see in the interview where they said Jamie would cover her up, they obviously have to care about each other and I never see any bad vibes between. Their chemistry in the movie was great, something most women are gonna be dreaming of having.~ It followed the books perfectly without being boring. They added their own flare to scenes to keep it from feeling like it was read straight out of the book.~ The ending was done just the way I imagined, it leaves us open and wanting for the 2nd film especially for anyone who hasn't read the books. My mother went with my group and she has never read a page of the books. But she left the theater wanting to know when the 2nd movie was coming out so she could know what happens to them.~ I expected there to be many haters of this movie, and its not going to be every ones cup of tea but I believe that its going in the right direction and the 2nd and 3rd movie will have more variety as anyone who has read the books knows where the plot goes. We can focus on romance/sex/ and then add some action in there and suspense.~ I love Dakota and Jamie. I hope they don't go through reading these and be to hard on themselves. They did a great job, so let them ignore the crap reviews and realize the real fans are here to support them!! <3 <3 <3",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't really live up to the Hype,"50 Shades of Grey is an erotic drama directed by Sam Taylor Johnson and stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) is a student attending Washington State University who is asked by her best friend Kate (Eloise Mumford) to fill in for her and do an interview at the office of business man Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan).However, Ana finds the handsome Christian a distraction, which results in the interview going badly. Ana puts it down to experience and returns to her usual day to day life, which includes a job at an hardware store. Ana's day is suddenly turned upside down, when, to her surprise, in walks Christian, who starts to search the shop for Masking Tape, Cable Ties, Rope. Ana tells Christian that Kate would like a few photos to go with the questionnaire that she had left at his office and he had secretly filled in. Christian gives her his phone number in order to arrange a photo shoot.The next day, Ana, Kate and Jose, their photographer friend, meet Christian at his hotel. Christian begins to show more than just a casual interest in Ana and asks her out for a coffee. Ana is surprised to learn that he to his single. Christian tells her how he enjoys the company of woman, but he is in no way a romantic. However, Christian later sends Ana a gift of some very rare and priceless books.Ana is flattered, but feels completely out of Christian's league and considers giving the books back. That night, a drunken Ana phones Christian, who decides to go and pick her up from the club and takes her back to his hotel. They arrange to go on another date, which includes an helicopter flight to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists she agrees to sign a contract, which prevents her from talking in any way to anyone about their times together. It also contains some very strange demands, that make it clear, that their relationship will be purely sexual and based on his dominance and her submission.So Ana, who was previously a virgin, now finds herself in a very complex and steamy relationship, a relationship were she's expected to be nothing more than a willing and submissive partner.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kept my attention overall,"I don't understand why this movie got such bad rating? I've seen much much worst films that have a higher rating but not as good films. This film is not for everyone. I am a male and went to see this with my fiancé over the Valentine's Day weekend. She read the book and told me that it was basically what the book was. A young female journalist goes into interviewing a billionaire that gets into the world of bondage and domination type of act. I gave it a 5 out of 10, just because the movie doesn't make any sense, its pure fantasy and the story line is just a vassal for the movie to show and and exploit sex scene and erotic behavior, which is way 99% of the movie goers went to see this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love in the Time of Sadomasochism,"How often does one get to see a movie that uses paintings, etc. in the background (for me scene-stealers) by excellent artists including Gary Hume, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Ed Ruscha, Rob Pruitt, John Baldessari, Michael Joo among others? The reason being that Sam Taylor-Johnson (a respected British visual artist turned filmmaker, formerly known as Sam Taylor-Wood) is the Director of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY - the much maligned film (particularly by those who have not seen it) mainly for its exploration of a sadomasochism - dominant/submissive sexual relationship based on the best selling novel of the same name by E.L. James.Not surprisingly the film is extremely stylish - beautifully photographed; yet too self- consciously ""framed,"" thereby creating a veneer of sleekness and glamour over the sweaty underbelly of an encounter between a lovely, naive young woman, Anastasia Steele (a luminous Dakota Johnson - lighting up the screen) and a wealthy young billionaire, Christopher Grey ( a miscast Jamie Dornan - whatever modeling he had done in the past for Calvin Klein is still in his DNA and needs to be flushed out.)I am of the generation that read Pauline Reage's The Story of O, an erotic novel touting the ""release"" of one's ego through complete submission to another - ultimately O becomes a slave to sensuality. This film on the other hand with its ""sex-light"" couplings, soft lights, and deep lingering looks eschews ""romantic love, "" but nevertheless embraces it.In essence this is a story about control and loss of control; purity/innocence ""corrupted""; in this case not underhandedly but rather straightforwardly, everything is laid out on the table in a written agreement. Anastasia willingly surrenders to Christopher's tastes stepping into a world of the flesh; dissecting pain and its relation to desire, delving into questions of what is considered ""normal"" intimacy between couples. The problem being that the script is too facile - what might have conveyed insight instead summoned laughter.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the worst films of all time.,"This piece of banal nonsense is exactly what I expected.I reluctantly agreed to watch it on DVD with my lady.I just hated the appalling acting and totally wooden characters and couldn't see anything appealing whatsoever.I am the most broad minded of men and have no hangups about sex in any form but after half an hour of pure boredom,I gave up.I apologised and poured my lady a glass of wine before firing up my laptop. I had more entertainment in answering my emails. Sorry,but everything about this film from script,characters,acting and storyline is possibly a record on the boredom scale.If you love movies with any semblance of quality,avoid this at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
