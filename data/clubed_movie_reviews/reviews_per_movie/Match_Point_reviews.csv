"Clever, polished, stunner with a lot to say about morality and fidelity","Match Point just joined Brokeback Mountain and Cinderella Man in the top three films for me this year. Like Brokeback Mountain, however, it is almost impossible to write a reasonably intelligent review without writing a spoiler.I have been a hot and cold Woody Allen watcher, but was only a fan during his comedic phase. So, despite hearing from a few reliable sources that this is Woody's masterpiece, I was skeptical and went in with few expectations. I am glad. Approaching the movie this way allowed it to creep up on me.The NYC Jewish dialog is gone. The quirky sense of humor is nowhere to be found. the hypersensitivity is missing. Where's Woody? Well, he's in London, but the place and time, despite the opinions of some critics, are largely irrelevant in this film.There is only one line in this film that indicates its origin - it has something to do with 'intertwined neuroses' and nearly made me laugh.The first 3/4ths of this film is almost completely taken up with character development, but also contains all of the basics of the inexorable plot that truly unfolds near the end. The characters are all quite likable, and, if you're like me, you will yearn for a happy ending. Watch out! - you've just been hooked and Woody's about to reel you in!Match Point draws its audience in quietly and slowly at first, defining its territory as a smart, hip, and sophisticated character study early on (in no way unexpected for Mr. Allen), but then it takes an irreversibly sinister turn as one man threatens to bring everybody we have grown to love and respect down with him.The performances and cinematography in this film are all-around the best I've seen this year. Allen uses a lot of very close-in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. I found no fault in the pace or the plot - this is easily Woody's most plot-heavy film, and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together.The story line of Match Point is powerful, disturbing, and exceedingly clever. Philosophical folks will likely want to talk about it afterward. Some will find it frustrating and others will find it pretentious. Still others will point to Woody's own life and claim that this film is some form of perverse confession. Well, from my perspective, it is simply damn good story-telling.Highly recommended for adult audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a terrific film,"Match Point is a cool, classically elegant and concise film that addresses all of the big questions--love, morality, death, fate, chance--without ever seeming heavy or self-conscious. I've never seen a Woody Allen film to match it. As a matter of fact, I can't remember another film of late that I thought was quite this good. From the opening shot, the film draws you in and doesn't let up, moving from shot to shot with a fine sense of rhythm and a narrative drive that builds the viewer's curiosity through a series of unexpected switchbacks. Rhys-Meyers is superb as an ex- professional tennis player from a poor Irish background who has turned social climber. Too proud to accept a favor from his upper class friends without immediately offering to pay it back, he affects an interest in opera and Strindberg. The viewer at once sympathizes with him and winces as he strains to seem refined and self-assured. Allen has put together a superb cast of young actors who bring his near flawless script to life so convincingly that one almost immediately suspends disbelief and becomes absorbed in the story. The shots of London are luxuriant and spacious, never self-indulgent. Few films, novels, or plays manage to form such rich dramatic material out of characters' inner obstacles. A classic piece of drama that reaches toward the likes of Shakespeare and Dostoevksy, every facet--from structure to dialog to editing to sound--is brought off with panache. This is not only Allen at his best but an example of what the cinematic medium is capable of when properly exploited.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ignore the UK paper reviews, this is terrific","What a throughly engrossing evening Woody Allen has provided. This film has been, by and large, poorly received by the British critics. I cannot understand why. Yes, it does have the strongest echoes of Crimes and Misdemeanours, but if a director/writer can't borrow from his own product, who can? This isn't funny Allen -- there are few laughs -- but it is an extremely intense and successful serious Allen.Does Allen's magic transfer to my home city? You bet it does; lovely locations; Notting Hill, the Tate Modern, the ""Gherkin"" in the City, all look great but are also entirely relevant. Many critics said he didn't have an ear for British dialogue. I simply don't hear that -- it may be a bit stagy at times, but the writing is spare, to the point, and literate. Few trans-Atlantic clunkers.Yes, there are some silly bits; bits where you wish any half-intelligent Englishman had watched the film and said ""Wood, old son, this is cobblers"". British detectives don't call themselves ""Detective so-and-so"". They might be Detective-Sergeant or whatever. The force that polices London is the Metropolitan Police, not the ""London Police"". Perhaps Allen didn't realise that his main copper, Ulster actor James Nesbitt, sounds a parody of the amusing roles he plays in some widely-seen British Yellow Pages adverts. Little things, so easy to iron out, that detract just a touch from credibility.Scarlett Johannsson -- what an actress, is she really only 20 or whatever? She packs huge power and stunning looks, if occasionally getting a trifle near Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Jonathan Rhys Myers does his forlorn sports coach bit, as from Bend It Like Beckham. The solidly Brit supporting cast is entirely believable, even if their effortlessly affluent lifestyle takes a bit of swallowing. Genuine surprises at the end. This is a thoroughly satisfying evening at the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I Don't Care if He's Great, I Just Hope He's Lucky...""","...and what a great stroke of luck it is to have sat through Woody Allen's latest, ""Match Point."" Fans of Woody could sense his comeback in the tragedy half of his last effort, ""Melinda and Melinda."" It was far more compelling than the comedy half, and the philosophical ideas it brought up were the best Woody Allen had given us in a long while. Here with ""Match Point"" he explores the notion of luck and gives us his best film since....well, since I don't know when. He proves here that when he leaves himself out of the cast, and changes locations (the transition from New York City to London is as flawless as it is invigorating), he can deliver the goods. This film, free of all the typical Allen shtick, and full of noirish twists and surprises, is every bit as good as Robert Altman's ""The Player"" or ""Gosford Park,"" and like those two films, it's the best kind of return to form you could hope for from a past master.Chris Wilton (played moderately well by Johnathan Rhys Myers, who comes across as a more handsome Joquin Phoenix) is a failed tennis pro from Ireland who gets a plum job at a snobbish country club in London where he meets up with Tom (an appropriately British Matthew Goode), woos his sister, Chloe (an adorable Emily Mortimer), and has an affair with Tom's flighty fiancée, a struggling American actress named Nola (a ravishing Scarlett Johansson). The film starts off like a more refined version of last year's tawdry affair, ""Closer,"" with Allen exploring the love lives of semi-bored, over-educated filthy rich Brits who when not hopping in and out of each other's beds are hob-nobbing at the opera, the latest art exhibit, or lounging around their lavish estates reading and drinking. There's also a hint of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in its exploration of the class system and Chris' obsession with infiltrating this exclusive and beguiling society. Thankfully, we're spared all of the weirdness of an atrocity like ""Ripley,"" as Allen keeps it all very clean, sheen, clever and classy.The film takes some dark turns and has some operatic overtures, spiced with some Dostoevsky references and plenty of pondering on luck. Allen here doesn't seem to be writing off the need for hard work completely, but to achieve a truly privileged life, where one can get away with just about anything, you better have a lot of luck.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good if not great Woody Allen film,"Along with Interiors(in a way), Match Point seems to be one of Woody Allen's most divisive films and that's understandable. With me, it is good but not great, interesting but Allen has done better(much worse as well). The ending was surprising which wasn't a problem, but it was also much too rushed and ambiguous, at odds with the rest of the pacing of the film. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and the script also didn't come across as consistent to me. Meyers is handsome and does make for a creepy sleaze in some parts of the film but at other points he underplays so much that he comes across as one-note. The script does have a very neat and healthy balance of sporting analogies and psychological questions, beautifully observed in distinctive Woody Allen fashion, unfortunately there are some clumsy moments and some out-of-place mordant humour(if anyone disagrees that's fine, it's just personal taste). The London locations, it's entertaining spotting the familiar ones, look splendid though and the filming reflects the dark, gritty nature of the story very effectively. The score is haunting, giving an ominous tone to scenes in need of it, and opera enthusiasts will love the healthy dose of opera excerpts throughout(though you wished they had a grander approach). The story even with the clear influence of Allen's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanours(a much better film) is an absorbing one, despite much of it being a slow-burner. Especially in the second half which takes a more violent turn without feeling mismatched. The gritty atmosphere worked in the story's favour as did the neatly interwoven plot points and story layers(the romance did have some resonating moments), and the characters as ever with Allen had a fair amount of realism though Chris was not very easy often to root for. Allen directs with control and assurance, though he's at his best in comedy-dramas like a lot of his films from the late 70s all the way through to the early 90s. With the acting, while Rhys Meyers didn't always convince, the largely British do some fine work, especially Matthew Goode and Brian Cox- James Nesbitt has been much better though- and Scarlett Johnansson in sultry, compassionate mode is superbly cast. Overall, interesting film and a good one(at its best even very good), but not great, Woody Allen has done better. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite possibly... (IMO),"The best Woody Allen movie in about 15 years. I would've said that a couple of months back about 'Melinda and Melinda' but this is a far better cry than Melinda and Melinda. Don't get me wrong, I think Melinda and Melinda is a good movie, but 'Match' is more fulfilling.Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro turned tennis teacher who is of Irish lower class. He is shocked to find out he got a job as a tennis instructor in a high class country club. There he meets Tom Hewett played by Matthew Goode in a very strong performance. What Rhys Meyers does is unbelievable, he showcases what he is really made of in this movie. Chris sounds like a simple person but what Rhys Meyers did was make him a person of complexity. From the moments of solitude when he's in the same room as his family, the way he grieves for what he's doing and what he is about to do is very convincing.Emily Mortimer plays Chloe Hewett Wilton, Chris' wife and Tom's sister. Also what Mortimer does is also outstanding, even though she isn't given much to make Chloe a person rather than a persona, Mortimer makes Chloe a person with ease. In my opinion, I think Emily Mortimer does a better job of playing her character than Kate Winslet would've done had she been attached. She has the right notes and chemistry with Jonathan Rhys Meyers to make their marriage and romance very believable, and what Mortimer does in the moments of denial and solitude she is given, she makes Chloe a complete person. This performance should make her a star.Scarlett Johansson gives, in my opinion, maybe her 2nd best performance in this movie. Johansson is OUTSTANDING as Nola Rice, a struggling actress. Johansson shows us her range to play this character, the epitome of tragic beauty, Johansson combines elements of sexuality, desire, nostalgia, in one being. Though this performance may not be as good as her performance in Lost in Translation, its still good enough to get her an Academy Award Nomination.Match Point starts off as a drama and works its way into being a very tense psychological thriller, and Woody Allen shows he is still in top form by trying something daring, and pulling it off. This movie is a silent masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody: an actor's dream come true,"Over the years, Allen has shown himself as superlative as a director of actors. He gives them scope to explore the wide range of human frailty. This is true in his outright comedies(Annie Hall, Manhattan) his ""problem plays"" (Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors) and here, in his great, dark drama MATCH POINT. What scene would any of you like to choose for discussion? Is Allen's perception and keen ear for human weakness evident in almost all of them? Witness, to chose but one example in a hundred, the scene in which Nola bitterly reviews her miserable youth and her mother's alcoholism whilst downing far too much wine? Yes, part of it indeed is Johanssen's innate talent, but there is here -as before with Keaton, with Caine, with Farrow, with Wiest- the steady hand of a master who knows how to get the best performances out of his actors. Whew, what a tour de force.",,Anonymous,Romance
"(""The heart wants what it wants""--Allen) A Progression of Chris' Heart","As luck is on Chris' (Meyers) side, a sweet looking Chloe (Mortimer) falls in love with him, a woman with a complete package, with money, with a complete family, even a good job upgrade for him, etc. Nonetheless ""ungrateful"" Chris still falls for a different kind of girl, a hot sexy Nora (Johansson) and begin an affairIt happens to us. Such is an ordinary event of life journey, an affair with a tempting hot woman, who is making a man's blood boiled (even though now Chris has all, has been given an American dream, including a sweet stabile cute woman). And the story of Match Point is also that of an ordinary progression, from point A to B, then from B to C. Even all the characters besides the main character, are conveniently providing this linear story, with perfect lines bordering suspension of disbelief. Why then, a story like this, still engaging? Well because it is. We are simple men and women, and when a story relates to us in such a true sounding with part of our life, we enjoy it, we want to know what next, and how it solved. Then we look for some little things to takeaway from a film (eg Match Point). Story maker sometimes allegedly added this little things after a story writing is finished, or sometimes it's the idea that started it allMatch Point tells a different story than Allen's usual film, because it's almost a normal movie, where all the characters speak just almost normal. Much more normally, Allen's film, well you know, Allen's style; Where every characters' line going towards possible comic. Anyway, arriving near Match Point ending, Chris will be facing difficult choices.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen discovers new terrain and creates his most ambitious film in years,"It's been said, but for a while one of the best filmmakers of the 20th century has been staggering with mediocre films not nearly up to his potential. But finally Allen has returned to the game with a subtle but perfectly done thriller which allows him to reinvent himself and discover new terrain like a brand new filmmaker.Match Point offers a simple but powerful message that luck plays a huge part in everyday life which to a major extent is true. Luck plays a huge part in Chris Wiltons life when he gets a job as a tennis trainer at a fancy club and meets Tom, the son of a rich business man. Tom invites Chris to an opera where he meets Chloe, the sister of Tom. From there, Chris and Chloe start to date and Chris, a small and unwealthy man, gets introduced to high society life. He's offered a high stakes job, a personal driver, etc, just to bring happiness into the life of Chloe.Chris is perfectly content until he meets the beautiful Nola, played by Scarlett Johansson. Nola is everything Chloe is not, exciting, extremely sexy, and unwealthy, which leads to Chris's dilemma. Nola and Chris begin an affair that leads to even more once Tom dumps Nola giving Chris the opportunity to live out all his sexual desires with a beautiful woman, but the high life of Chloe overpowers the little ambitions and lack of money. Match Point is about luck but also about choices made in life for personal enjoyment. Is it better to be rich and not completely satisfied or poor and happy? As a failure, Chris finds luck with Chloe's rich family willing to set him up with whatever he desires.The film is very similar to Woody's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors and it takes similar turns. Chris gets himself in the situation where he must choose from a small life with a woman he is satisfied and turned on by or choose a high society life with a woman he barely loves and lacks attraction to. I won't tell you what he chooses, but I will tell you the dilemma leads Allen to his most satisfying, tense, engaging film in over a decade.It's great to see Allen take such a simple premise, used several times, and put all his trademark qualities into it mixed with a discovery of new terrain. Match Point is an engaging, entertaining film that gives you a taste of the high life and shows you what it can lead a man to. 10-10 for this excellent film by the great Woody Allen. Let's hope this is a revelation for Allen returning him to morality film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Luckily for us, what might be Woody's swan song is a lean and powerful effort","(Note: I added ""may contain spoilers"" because I briefly describe how the plot is set up, but I don't discuss it's resolution.)Even though I'd heard beforehand that this movie was reminiscent of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" it still didn't quite prepare me for all of its twisting plot. Yet it's actually a very simple story. A man falls in love with two women at the same time. The one he's most passionate about he can't have, so he ends up marrying his 2nd choice. It doesn't hurt that his lesser love is part of a very rich family, and that he'll never have to worry about money again for the rest of his life as long as her father sees that his daughter is happy with him. But he can't deny his passions, and starts up an affair with the girl he loves more. The affair takes on a life of it's own until one day it gets serious enough that he is forced to make a choice: give up a life of chauffeurs, mansions and a wife he describes as ""sweet,"" or forsaking his deepest passion forever for a safe and comfortable existence. What he decides is something I won't give away.This is lean and powerful Allen. There is no amusing nebbish at the core of this one; all the pain and uncertainty that ""the Woody character"" would usually deflect so deftly with humor is stripped away here, and what's left is a more satisfying display of raw emotion from the two gifted leads, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson. Equally as satisfying is that Allen's theme about the roll of luck in our existences ended up being as strong as any of the performances. For good or for bad, you really leave the theater questioning just how lucky you or the characters you've just spent two hours with really are. Maybe the only thing everyone who can appreciate this film can agree on is how fortunate we are that Woody Allen (who turned 70 this past December) can still put together a small masterpiece like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply damn good story-telling,"'Match Point' is gripping and entertaining as well as well-made - the structure, the storytelling, the confidence of style are all impeccably crafted. The performances and cinematography in this film are all-around great. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johansson are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends fantastic support. This is easily Woody Allen's most plot-heavy film, and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together. Simply damn good story-telling.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the Cannes Film Festival recently where it screened out of competition. Being a Woody Allen fan, I was just hoping the film would be OK and not a disaster like some of his most recent films. Boy, was I surprised! MATCH POINT is easily his best film since CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS and once of his best ever. In his first foray out of Manhattan and into London, you would have thought he had lived there all his life. This film is a masterpiece and is a sure bet to win critical acclaim and many awards. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a revelation and finally lands a role of a lifetime as a young man who enters the world of the wealthy elite and would do anything to stay there. Scarlett Johansson has never looked as sultry and sexy as she does here playing the cool femme fatale. The film is beautifully structured and the performances by all and sundry are exemplary. Emily Mortimer and Brian Cox stand out among the supporting cast. The film has so many layers and so many unexpected twists that this is obviously the work of a genius director in full flight.What can I say. The best way to see this film is without knowing too much about it as I did and you will come away from it declaring that Woody Allen is still alive and kicking and still able to make a masterpiece even after all these years.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Murderous Mismatch,"Unlike most of his films which are usually romance or comedy or both, 'Match Point' is a suspenseful character-driven thriller. Woody Allen adopts a very Hitchcockian style in 'Match Point'. It isn't like anything he's made before. His fascination with England is interesting and you do see that he makes a lot of use of the English sights (though some may think the showing of monuments etc are clichéd). His other fascination seems to be actress Scarlett Johanssen whom he has already cast in his more recent three films. Though I have never found her convincing as an actress, here she actually does a fine job but the film clearly belongs Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Many seem to complain about his accent or his restraint but, in my opinion, he does a wonderful job playing a complex and difficult character. An adorable and vivacious Emily Mortimer shines. She is a scene stealer and it is good to finally see her in a role that exposes her talent. It's also good to see Brian Cox in something different for a change and Penelope Wilton has always been a dependable actress. Allen does a superb job in building the suspense by following the lead character and exposing his thoughts. The film is said to be loosely based on Dosteyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' and there are several references to his works. Opera music is cleverly used in the story as the characters are shown to be deeply drawn towards it. Lastly, 'Match Point' is another one of Allen's winners. It's impressive that at this age, and after so many duds, he could make a film that looks so modern and feels fresh.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Turning Point Of Woody Allen,"A Noir with English accents. A modern, ancient tale with super stars of the future and a score of crackling vinyl original recordings of timeless arias. A sixtysomething filmmaker with the flair of an impertinent newcomer. A masterpiece. Engrossing, entertaining, elegant, wicked. The meeting between the splendorous Scarlett Johanssen and the breathtaking Jonathan Rhys-Meyers at the ping pong table is right out ""A Place In The Sun"" - Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift at the pool table - the feeling is James Cain and Patricia Highsmith but the result is unique, bold, enthralling. Allen's British dialogues are refreshingly startling and I don't intend to spoil the pleasure of its perverse surprises by hinting at any of them. Just let me say that if you love cinema, rush to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too long and slow starting but rewarding in the end,"Slow starting and overlong, this movie lacked pace for the first hour. There was a plot building but so slow that I was starting to get bored. I liked the acting and the eye-candy (Johanssen and Rhys-Meyers) but the director could have made it move much faster. Some of the dialogue was stilted which is an unexpected weakness in a Woody Allen film. There also were several opportunities for more humour that were lost. Eventually the plot kicked off and it grabbed my attention back. The last twenty minutes and the conclusion were superb. Rhys-Meyers acting and accent also followed the same curve, at the beginning he really sounded awkward. I thought his Irish accent sounded wrong - until I realised he has a natural Irish accent. The clipped English dialogue and idioms were wrong for an Irish character. However, in the final twenty minutes he really delivered.It is so much better when a movie starts bad but ends well than the other way round.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a serious channeling of Dostoyevsky via infidelity drama by Woody Allen,"Match Point is my favorite American-directed film of 2005. Woody Allen, coming off of hitting his stride again with Melinda and Melinda, goes back to his darker, dramatic side, and makes a story that may seem a little familiar, though not to his discredit. Woody borrows (some may say steal) elements from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, one of the great novels of the 19th century (some may say ever written, I have read his work though not this yet), and transfuses it with subject matter that he's more than well acquainted with- the relationship drama. But un-like Love and Death, which was Allen's way of parodying the work of the author, this time he takes the work seriously, plunging the audience into the mind, conflicts, and outcome of the protagonist. That the performances by the actors involved, particularly the three main leads are top notch (Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johnasson in one of her best) brings full blood and flesh to Woody's strong skeleton of a film.The story starts slow. Chris Wilton (Rhys-Myers) is an Irishman in London, a tennis instructor who could've gone pro. He meets Chloe (Mortimer) through her brother Tom (Matthew Goode) and they soon become close, close enough for marriage. Basically, he marries into an upper-class family where he's coaxed into becoming a businessman for the family. But during this he also meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress, who's engaged to Tom. One thing leads to another, yada-yada, and Chris winds up in a big pickle as he's in a love-triangle between Chloe and Nola. Allen handles this dilemma with a powerful precision, by building up the relationships Chris has with each girl, and how there is not unbelievability in the set-ups. Nola is sensible and intelligent, if not altogether, while Chloe is caring and decent, if maybe too picture perfect for Chris. The dynamics are set-up so well, it leaves room for ample drama and suspense.Allen, who has also been a playwright for decades, knows the way people interact like so, and how not to rush the situations and use tact with delicate scenes. There is also the element of Opera, which Chris sees with Chloe's family often, and the element of tennis. The analogies that both produce could possibly be very trite or cliché. It's not to say a couple of scenes are even cliché (ladies, you know you've seen quite a few movies with passionate kissing in the rain), but I even bought into those scenes. There is perhaps a certain manipulation that goes into these kinds of love stories, how much the audience can go with the inner conflict of our main character. But as the protagonist goes into a frame of mind that most may not be able to identify with, we're still with him all the way. And, perhaps, it's also because I love a good, solid infidelity story. Allen has here not only his best film in several years, but also likely his most suspenseful one.Those who may not go with the sympathies &/or empathy for the characters may not like the film as much. Some have even criticized minor gripes with the film, like Rhys-Myers's unconvincing accent, or the over-usage of London's most famous landmarks. As an American, perhaps, I didn't mind certain things like these. When a filmmaker has this much trust in his script (and Woody, pushing 70 in making this, is not amateur), and has the right cast, it just takes off from there. To say I was on the edge of my seat through a good chunk of the third act is an under-statement and, at the core, was even cathartic in a way. It's the kind of film I would love to tell more people about, even if they think Woody is washed up after years of arguably less-than-great pictures. For some it might not even 'feel' like a Woody Allen movie, that at times it's a little 'slick'. It still is, however the work of an artist reaching further into his grab-bag with younger, exciting actors, and an interesting use of a (finally) new city.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
sharp and pretty enjoyable,"Both direction and writing evoke very good performances from an excellent cast (remember Emily Mortimer acting in ""Young Adam"" and she was up to her skills this time too) but the one taking center stage is not Scarlett Johansson but Rhyss Meyers, who delivers. Plot's quite unusual for Woody Allen's fans but the movie has heart and soul. It's not one of Allen's best ones but the domestic melodrama, then turning into a psycho-thriller is watchable and has a pressing rhythm. Finally the ending twist will be appreciated even by Alfred Hitchcock's fans. All things considered not a genial work but certainly a charming story that is worth the ticket.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Scarlett Johansson & Emily Mortimer shine in this tale of lust, ambition & luck","A drama about lust, ambition and luck, this is the first of Woody Allen's urban adventures to be set outside New York City, i.e., in London, and with the exception of one performer, all the actors hail from Britain or Ireland. Chris Wilton (misty-eyed Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a former lower rung touring tennis pro from Ireland now trying to scrape by. He lands a teaching job at a toney private tennis club, where he is befriended by the handsome young Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who comes from a wealthy family. Chris comes round the Hewetts' house for drinks and dinner, meets Tom's sweet but marginally attractive sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), one thing leads to another, and they marry.Meanwhile, Chris has met Tom's fiancée, the struggling American wanna be actress, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson). For Chris, meeting Nola is lust at first sight. But she is off limits, until Tom breaks up with her in favor of another woman. Now, despite being a virtual newlywed, Chris pursues and impregnates Nola. The narrative then proceeds along a well worn path: Chris must somehow dispose of his predicament without sacrificing his marriage (he does genuinely care for Chloe, never mind the family fortune). Bad things happen. I cannot say more about the resolution without shamefully spoiling things for you.This film is a mixed bag. The basic theme is formulaic. We know it from such classics as ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Room at the Top"": poor boy meets rich girl and sees a vision of Paradise on earth. The trouble in ""Match Point"" is that the (anti-) hero is not nearly as sympathetic as the principled, brooding Montgomery Clift was in ""Sun."" Rhys-Meyers is frosty, cool, and way too untroubled until close to the end. Nor, on the other hand, does he have the slick, psychopathic charisma that Laurence Harvey mustered in ""Room."" Rhys-Meyers instead comes off as an unconvincing kid, for all the daring his course of action requires, in the same sense that the boyish Matt Damon did not seem up to the title role in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""; ditto for Leo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me if You Can"" and ""The Aviator."" (Regrettably, box office appeal is a very different matter than proper casting.)I thought that Brian Cox seemed lost in his role as Alec, head of the Hewett clan; Penelope Wilton fares better as Hewett's wife, Eleanor. This brings us to the female co-leads. Ms. Mortimer is excellent as the pigeon-toed, plain but endearing, trusting Chloe, strained by her infertility and riffs of disaffection from Chris. She nails the complexities of this role beautifully.Ms. Johansson is simply marvelous. As ever a luminous visual presence on the screen, she also shows once again her impressive range in convincingly inhabiting her characters. Her American girl here is small town coarse, provocatively seductive, and more than a little desperate. How different from her pensive, measured, well-educated, retiring character, Charlotte, in ""Lost in Translation."" And both so different yet from her nearly mute, servile yet perceptive Dutch maid, Griet, in ""The Girl With the Pearl Earring."" Ms. Johannson is not only a rising star, at 21 she is already a splendid actor.The photography and production design are lush. I especially enjoyed the brief scenes shot at Covent Garden, though the operatic theme in general is somewhat mystifying. Is it the affectation of the rich seeming to dig opera that counts? Is there some special significance to the recurring use of ancient scratchy recordings of Caruso arias? If so, Mr. Allen has kept entirely quiet about it amidst his other comments at the film's website. The best things in this movie are its ""luck"" theme, its visual delights, and the two female leads. The rest is just OK. My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 01/18/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some new territory for Woody Allen,"This film at first doesn't seem like a typical Woody Allen film but at the end you know it's one and why. While the story and theme is familiar, Mr Allen brings new perspective and avoids clichés. He goes to the themes he explored in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but without the Ingmar Bergman homage. Instead it's more fun and exciting to watch. I guess the young hot cast and new location doesn't seem like the usual Woody Allen film, even though he used young hot talents before. This one belongs to his best films which is good news to his fans. The cast is excellent but the supporting cast outshines the leads somehow. Matthew Goode made a strong impression and sure to become a star in the near future. I'm glad Woody Allen changed locations and used some of the best British actors for a change. I guess people who will read this comment, will already know about the plot, so I will avoid it. I watched the film at Cannes where it was well received by critics and the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Know the Score of That Game----40 Love.,"Woody Allen goes totally out of character with this provocative and nearly outstanding dilemma of a movie. Former tennis pro Jonathan Rhys Meyers immediately falls for the sister (Emily Mortimer) of one of his ridiculously wealthy clients (Matthew Goode). All seems well in jolly old London until Rhys Meyers meets Goode's seductive American fiancée (another stunning turn from Scarlett Johansson). Interest turns to intrigue and then to lust and then perhaps to love or maybe a little obsession. Rhys Meyers begins to forget about Mortimer and fall into a twisted web with Johansson, but what happens when the plot does not go as planned and relationships become blurred? Allen's Londoners are just as fascinating and messed up as his New Yorkers. The change of venue is a refreshing alteration of pace for the famed film-maker and he nearly makes the whole project work with crazed symbolism and a reincarnation of that new-age style that dominated the European cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The pacing is a bit off as the picture runs too long and Brian Cox (as Mortimer and Goode's father) is not around near as much as he should have been. Still ""Match Point"" finds enough momentum to climb over that pesky net. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Romance
Allen Hithcock,"The audience wasn't expecting anything quite so restrained from Woody (they were so anxious to laugh they howled at lines such as ""Maybe you've had one too many G & Ts,"" not exactly a zinger by Allen's standards) who proved with Match Point that when he's pushed, he can still hold his own with the best. It seems Allen couldn't get U.S. financing to his liking so was forced to go across the pond to finance this one. Nothing stirs the creative muscles quite like wanting to show others they've made a mistake. Hopefully, Americans will stop financing his films altogether so that Woody can make films in Paris (Everybody Says I Love You doesn't count), Sydney, Berlin, maybe even somewhere in Africa. Of course, the one thing missing when Woody sets his films in other cultures are the witty one-liners he's so famous for, but if the tradeoff is better films for fewer one-liners I support it. With this script, he accomplishes an interesting marriage of manners, romance and Hitchcockian drama, which interestingly enough is the most compelling part of the movie. Really terrific set-up of the ending, which really is ingenious. After watching the Matador on the same day I must say I think the filmmakers are starting to out think the audience again, making for some truly brain-teasing plots. Of note, also are the performances of the actors, who it must be said seem far more comfortable with improvised dialogue than their American counterparts in other Allen films. They seemed to interpret the material in a way that made them all seem colder, yet more interesting. Particular credit should go to the chap who played Tom Errett, who really could be a lead actor and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers who did a fine job in a difficult role. Scarlett Johannsson is brilliant as always, although her descent into craziness may have been a bit over-the-top. What was pleasing was to see a love scene in which the woman is not rake-thin and forced to contort into unnatural positions. She really is a treasure, and I hope the celebrity B.S. doesn't eat her up. She's well on her way to being a screen legend  look for her next in The Good Girl, another British/American manners drama. Woody takes a lot of abuse for not living up to his early promise, not being a genius, etc. I hope after this film, we leave him alone to make his one year a film then watch it and appreciate it for what it is: like a visit from our favourite neurotic uncle. He's still got serious chops, writing, obviously, but as a filmmaker, too. The reveal of the couple's loft and the slo-mo shots of the tennis ball and rink were real signature shots.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Woody, Meet Mr. Hitchcock","Anyone who laments the fact that Alfred Hitchcock is no longer alive to make thrillers can rest easy---the Woodman is on the case.""Match Point"" is a ghoulishly entertaining movie that threatens to become a rip-off of ""An American Tragedy"" mixed with ""Crime and Punishment,"" until Woody jerks the film in a totally different direction and makes it utterly original.For about the first twenty minutes of the film, I was thinking how ironic it was that Allen's best movie in a long time (and even in the first twenty minutes you can tell it is indeed going to be that) should also be his most unoriginal. The plot is cliché, and is not helped by the fact that Allen borrows heavily from Theodore Dreiser in setting up his main character's dilemma. However, once the protagonist (for want of a better word) sets out to plan the ""perfect"" murder, inspired by ""Crime and Punishment"" (which you see him reading early on in the film), the movie becomes an anything-can-happen nailbiter, and had me on the edge of my seat.Scarlet Johannsson is remarkable as an emotionally unstable love interest; Allen uses her sultry good looks to perfect effect, and he includes her in some of the most erotic moments he's ever filmed. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who I can't decide whether or not I like, also equips himself well as the ex-tennis pro who finds himself torn between a life of privilege and his lust for the object of his desire. And all of the supporting players are excellent, though I expected no less from a Woody Allen film.Allen shows complete mastery of a genre he's never tackled. This doesn't even seem like an Allen film at first glance, but many of his recurring themes are here, and his usual knack for writing such strong characters with such believable motives adds much to the suspense and effectiveness of the film overall.A true stunner of a movie, easily one of the best of the year.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Polished, yes... Noir, sort of.... A masterpiece? far from it.","So, I heard about Match Point awhile ago from Golden Globes buzz, and decided to go out and rent it. I've never seen a Woody Allen film before in my life, so I wouldn't find myself being biased just because of the name behind the camera... and because of that, I can say that while the film was OK, it's nowhere near perfect.The only thing I will really say about this film, without giving too much away is that what keeps this film from being truly great, is character and plot development. When I watched it, I felt that everything moved along a little bit too cleanly, and a little bit too much like a movie. Maybe that was the point... maybe it wasn't supposed to mimic life as much as I would have liked it to but, with the exception of the last 30 minutes of the film (which did keep me wondering what would happen... and held my attention), everything's cleanly cut, cleanly shot, and is the same married man has affair story... needs to/wants to end it....and not much more.For a more interesting twist on this particular plot, and the consequences of it, see the masterful Diane Lane in ""unfaithful""... it's more raw, and hits the viewer's core a bit stronger than this piece, which might have worked better if released about 15-20 years ago.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen goes deeper and darker than ever.,"Match Point must be a pivotal turn in Woody Allen's career, for it is nothing like his previous work yet still maintains that unique style he is so loved for. There are definite elements that echo Allen's previous films Crimes and Misdemeanors and Interiors, but there is also a Hitchcockian flair that raises the stakes and the tension to a degree far above what is usually expected of Woody Allen.Allen has said this may be the best film he has made because everything simply ""fell in... I caught a lot of breaks."" Indeed, nearly all aspects of this film are in top form. The cast is superb, led by the stylish and passionate Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, brilliant as the reckless and amoral Chris willing to go to any length to please any and all desires. Emily Mortimer is sunny and sympathetic as Chris's wife Chloe, whose own life is filled with simple pleasures of love, marriage, children and family. Scarlett Johansson is also quite effective as the femme fatale in white Nola Rice who is instrumental in this plot. The supporting cast, photography, editing and art design also merit high praise.So why is this such a departure for the usual Woody Allen? First of all, it is set in upper-crust London rather than the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. This allows for some stunning sets of big flats, estates and beautiful countrysides. There is also more of a dark undertone to this story than even what is expected of Woody Allen. Of course he is the perennial pessimist, but he delves into nihilism in some sequences and all you can do is look, shocked and amazed.Because there is such a different feel to this film, I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Woody Allen fan as a warm-up. It is very entertaining, keeping you on the edge wondering what will happen next and also pondering what should happen and how it will. This is a conversation starter for sure, but it also is wonderful to look at and definitely stays with you after it ends. Agree or don't agree, one cannot deny Woody's deft ability to provoke and entertain.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not so much as I expected,"I had many good expectations on this movie, but I ended up a bit disappointed when I saw it. I thought it was going to be a masterpiece,but it didn't seem so to me. The most important thing for this story are the characters, and the problem is that the performances, in my opinion, are not powerful enough. I don't mean that Meyers and Johansson are bad actors, but I think that I may have enjoyed the movie better if it had a different cast. There are other movies which have the same themes as this one and are definitely better, as for instance, ""The talented Mr. Ripley"", in which the actors, for me, are outstanding, whereas in ""Match Point"", they can't awake almost any feelings in me. Besides, the dialogues are not very original,they are a little artificial. Anyway, the movie is worth seeing: it makes you think about the consequences of your choices, and that is always an issue which is important to approach.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Film Noir,"I'm always glad to see a new Woody Allen film and this is no exception. Here he returns to the dark, chaotic world he investigated in CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS -- his best straight drama, I believe -- and which he explored comically in BULLETS OVER Broadway -- his best comedy and you may disagree with both choices: a world without a god to impose a moral order which, tragically, destroys the men and women who inhabit it. A world of Film Noir that takes place across the river from London's Parliament where man's laws are made where he gives us a variation of AN American TRAGEDY. Yes, it can happen there.There is a lot less Bergman influence in this movie. Instead the influences are visual touches: Hitchcock, Truffaut and others jostle each other in this script, the effective story of how a former tennis player cold-bloodedly marries into a wealthy English family -- ""They've got nothing but money"" he says trenchantly at one point -- and winds up murdering his pregnant mistress, the former fiancée of his brother-in-law. The script is brilliantly done and, even as he struggles to hide his crime, he wants himself caught. That desire to pay for his crime is the only thing that endears him to the audience, but it was enough to put the New York audience -- including me -- who sat through the showing on the first day of the new year in a similar mood. Would he be caught, which would give the universe some moral shape, or would he succeed in his quest for freedom and wealth? The script is topnotch, the cast performs admirably and the background of operatic music adds to the melodramatic tensions.If the movie has any weakness, it is purely a comparative one: Woody Allen's New York films capture New York with subtlety. Wandering the streets of Manhattan, he can finds spots of beauty that would escape the casual eye: a scrap of paper blowing in the wind on 9th Street, the warehouse where the floats for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade are stored, the cramped interior of a basement store in Chinatown. His views of London are more conventional in this movie: a river view of Parliament, the brick galleries of a London tennis club, the wood-and-leather library of a stately country home.Perhaps, in time, Mr. Allen's perspective may bring us images of London that the natives have overlooked, but I doubt it. While this movie and his next, scheduled movie, also shot in London are worthwhile experiments, Woody Allen based in London is as unthinkable as Woody Allen in Hollywood. Come home, please, Woody. We need each other.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunningly disappointing,"I too am a great Woody Allen fan, and was very nervous about seeing his attempt at a 'serious' work. I'd read mixed reviews like everyone, and went fairly open-minded. After seeing this film I can not understand how it could garner a single positive review. Featuring the worst central performance I've seen in a long time (Rhys-Meyers) who gave his most wooden performance yet (and that really is saying something). A pretty boy and nothing more. The plot was bizarrely simple and well-worn, one-dimensional and utterly unengaging. Scarlett Johansson, bless her, tries but just looks ridiculous bringing such over top sultriness - the first time we see her, lighting a cigarette and giving the camera a Look made me laugh out loud. Completely devoid of humour, Allen has made a film about English Upper Class that he obviously knows nothing about. Attempts at intriguing themes of luck etc fall flat on their face with a big thud. For God's sake, don't encourage him to make more of this kind of cinema.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very personal Woody Allen film,"Woody Allen has made a very similar movie in the past, Crimes and Misdemeanors. Both movies are essentially this author's take on Dostoevsky and his ""Crime and punishment"", and might be called ""Crime and no punishment"" and contain a nearly identical pondering on the nature of conscience and how easy it is in fact to live with murder, as many people in the west, especially in the upper echelons of society, indeed do, both figuratively and, in many cases, literally, weather it is in the world of politics, military aggressions (the word ""collateral damage"" comes in this movie in the end spoken by one of the victims) or ordinary life, with extreme western hypocrisy as a great ""resource"" to ease the way. The similarities of the two movies (almost the same murder situation, and the same result, similar motives), and the director's penchant for autobiographical elements as inspiration, makes one wonder what aspects of his shady past gave rise to this story redone like this again and again. This movie follows more closely ""Crime and punishment"" and there is even an old (but being he is anti-Dostoevsky, a poor one) lady that gets offed like a rat in a peanut butter trap.The characters in this story involve some rich inbred British people, an Irish protagonist (fittingly), and a femme fatale in its American version (Scarlet ""Lucy"" Johansson), a failed actress but worth every cent in other, less reputable, domains, according to her own words. Faithful to the stereotypes, Irish turn out to have terroristic inclinations (movie was sponsored by BBC after all), American is ""innocent"" and ""likable"", British are boring, and there is even a Scottish detective (of Scotland Yard?!) who figures it all out, but to no avail, because blind luck was on the side of happiness of the elite British cream (who had been joined by another worthy member set in their standards of ""morality"").This, at last, is a new element to the story. Luck. In the beginning, we have a scene where a tennis ball hits the net and which side - by luck - it ends up on determines outcome of the game. Very similar scene in the end in turn also determines the final outcome, i.e. ""happy ending"" which is in fact a more realistic version of most ""happy endings"" and ""missions accomplished"" in the culture that did not bring us Dostoevsky, but did come up with infected blankets and rationalizations, conformism and hypocrisy to make it easier to quell whatever conscience is left in whoever is still not a sociopath. And brought us Woody Allen, with brilliant wit and experiences to match the point.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Noir,"""Match Point"" is reminiscent of Film Noir of the 40's like ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemity,"" and ""A Place In the Sun."" Like those films, it is a story of an ordinary nice guy who get lured to the dark side by lust and money.While the story might borrow more than a little from James M. Cain, what really sets ""Match Point"" apart from the older films is the excellent dialog and it's use of irony.A lot of people are not going to like this film because it is very dialog heavy and you have to really pay attention to every word to fully appreciate it. Since most people are used to CGI and short sentences, it is probably going to have a hard time finding an audience. For people who put forth the effort, it is very rewarding.Opera fans will be happy to know there is opera singing throughout a large portion of the film, mostly from old recordings of Enrico Caruso. Opera is mostly about sex and murder, so it fits into the themes of the film. An additional point of irony in the film is that the most commonly played aria, ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" while sounding dramatic, is from the opera ""The Elixer of Love, which is a comedy; the irony being that this suspense film is written and directed by a film maker usually associated with comedy.The acting is very good all around, especially Scarlett Johansson who plays a sultry femme fatale. She shows a side I've not seen in previous films.""Match Point"" is not an easy film to watch. You have to pay close attention and listen to every word of the dialog. If you are willing to put forth the effort, this is a very fine film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bright turn by Johansson,"Interesting movie with quite an ending.The story begins with Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) starting out a career as a tennis instructor after he had enough with the tennis professional circuit. He meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) who is a member of the tennis club, and upon knowing Wilton's interest of opera invites him over to the family box at the opera house. There, Wilton gets introduced to the Hewett family and then later with Hewett's fiancée Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Wilton gets very interested in Rice and then things get difficult...A brilliant turn by Johansson, she really shone in her part. She was radiant in this movie. One would expect good things to come from her in the future. Not much could be said about Rhys-Meyers. He seemed rather wooden.The supporting cast were rather brilliant. Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton respectively as Tom Hewett's sister and the Hewett parents kept my interest in the story.The pacing didn't really pick up until just after the middle part of the film but it's still a memorable movie.My vote is 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers give brilliant performances in Woody Allen's new film Match Point.,"When I first saw the trailer for ""Match Point"" a few months back, I knew this was a movie I had to see. What surprised me about it most though was the fact that it was a Woody Allen film. I personally like Woody Allen but lately his work hasn't been very good. And ""Match Point"" didn't look like a Woody Allen movie but t was about time that Mr. Allen tried some new material and it looked liked this was the answer. Today, ""Match Point"" opened in limited release and I ran to the theater to see it at the first showing.""Match Point"" is about a former tennis pro named Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who has just moved from Ireland to London where he teaches tennis at a local country club. One day he meets Tom (Matthew Goode) and they hit it off not only because of their love for tennis but also their love of opera. Tom introduces Chris to his sister Eleanor (Emily Mortimer) who falls for Chris. Chris and Eleanor start dating and everything is going great until Chris meets up with Tom's fiancée Nola (Scarlett Johansson). After Chris meets Nola he begins to have an obsession with her and can not stop thinking about her. But it isn't long before this obsession turns into a very serious dilemma than can ultimately make him or break him.""Match Point"" is mainly a movie about love vs. lust and the power of obsession. The film also has a subplot that deals with luck and how lucky a person can be. The film is definitely for a select crowd and I can't see the majority of mainstream movie-goers going to see ""Match Point"" and leaving it happy. It's definitely for more of an artistic, mature or older crowd.For me, well my eyes were glued to the screen throughout this entire film. The performances were excellent especially Johansson and Rhys-Meyers. The story was entertaining, interesting, and exciting. And finally the direction by Mr. Allen was perfect. This movie is definitely worthy of some Oscar attention just for the performances and direction alone.The only problem I have with the film is the ending but unfortunately I can't really discuss that here without spoiling the entire movie. But I will say that this movie is a near masterpiece up until the ending where there seems to be a huge plot hole. Some will say the ending is the whole point of the movie, which does seem to be the case; however it still bothered the heck out of me because the plot hole was way too big to be believable. Also I have to mention that while the film is a great movie especially for this day and age, it has the same plot and storyline of a 1951 film called ""A Place in the Sun."" This film is basically a remake of that film with an alternative ending. But other than the ending, I really enjoyed everything about ""Match Point"" from the performances, to the directing, to the score. It's a very well done movie.So in conclusion, I can definitely see where this movie is getting its buzz from not only because of the performances but the fact that Woody Allen has finally left his rich New York comedy setting and moved to London to make an engaging thriller. This movie is definitely one you want to see with someone because it involves quite a bit of discussion after wards. It's a movie that sticks with you and one that you won't soon forget. That's a pretty amazing accomplishment for director Woody Allen who hasn't had a hit in several years. I highly recommend ""Match Point"".MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Match Point"" is a 9/10. The performances and direction are worth the price of admission alone. Woody Allen is back with a vengeance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nevertheless, Chris marries Chloe for her family money.I found the story moved slowly. I feel like the movie can start much later. Starting the story from when Chris meets Tom seems unnecessary. Squeezing the timeline would help increase the tension. Although a tense thriller isn't necessarily a Woody Allen trademark.Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives an interesting performance. He's suave enough to catch Chloe but creepy enough when he's with Nola. Scarlett's performance is basically looking hot and do a bit of yelling. I don't think she stretched very much.

When Nola gets pregnant and presses him, he balances the financial advantages of his marriage but he has to take a decision in his life and choose the woman he wants for his companion.The great director Woody Allen moved his landscape from Manhattan to London to present a totally different movie, actually a film-noir. The amoral story of ambition, love, desire, obsession, lust and crime is totally different from his previous works and I really liked it a lot. His screenplay and direction are excellent and deserve the wins and nominations listed in IMDb. I loved the quote ""The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life"". Scarlett Johansson is incredibly sexy as I have never seen before and has another outstanding performance in the role of Nola Rice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has his best character and performance in his career. The movie begins with Chris reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's classic ""Crime and Punishment"", and ends with him living ""Crime and (Un) Punishment"", by Woody Allen. Even if you do not like Woody Allen's films, see ""Match Point"" that you probably will like it. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Match Point""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lead actors have all the charisma of the high school cheerleader and  quarterback starring in the senior class play.,"SJ and JRM obviously needed at least some direction from Woody Allen to develop their characters past the point of a teenage crush gone wrong. In their defense, it must be said that the plot was clunky and full of holes and the dialog was amateurish so they didn't have much to work with. Emily Mortimer and Matthew Goode did as much as they could with their one dimensional characters which was to be charming and sweet.Woody Allen has done some less than great movies in recent years, but now he just seems to be going through the motions. Where's the clever dialog, the deep character studies and the intriguing plots and subplots that are hallmarks of his better work?

Lucky man!,"Having avoided Woody Allen's last two films, and because of recommendation from a friend, we decided to give Mr. Allen another chance. With this new film, Mr. Allen seeks to regain his loyal fans by taking them for a ride to England, where probably most of the money for the picture was found. The results are mixed, but not a total failure. It's by no means, the great movie most people are telling us it is.Chris Wilton is a lucky man! As an old tennis player, he has had it. But like other men in his position, he finds a job in a tennis club as a pro. Since this is a place where the English upper classes go to, it's no surprise he meets Tom Hewett there. Chris has settled in London in order to take advantage of the cultural life there, something he has been lacking of. Tom is instrumental for introducing Chris, not only to the opera performance, but to his family, who accepts him as one of their own.Chris doesn't appear to be a social climber. It's just that he is at the right place, at the right time. The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for what will follow. An explanation is heard, about how in a tennis game, the ball that bounces over the top of the net will determine who wins the match. In the ironic twist of fate at the end of the movie, something similar happens, although not related to a tennis match.Mr. Allen has gathered an interesting cast of mainly English actors that do good work under his direction. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris, the lucky man who charms the pants of the Hewetts. Scarlett Johansson, in one of the sexiest parts she has played, makes a valuable contribution as the American aspiring actress. Emily Mortimer plays Chloe, who becomes the wife of Chris and his entry ticket into a world of money. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are seen as the older Hewetts. Matthew Goode appears as Tom. In minor roles we see the wonderful Margaret Tyzack in a pivoting role and James Nesbitt as a police detective.One of the best things in the film are the wonderful opera arias by Donizetti, Bizet, Rossini, and Verdi.

Brilliant (and I usually hate Woody Allen movies),"All this talk about ""Match Point"" being something completely different than anything Woody Allen has ever done, something fresh and surprising, it's true. Allen reinvents himself with this movie. There's no shaky camera, no jazz music and no frantic, quirky dialog. Allen's message is the same, but instead of playing the lovely, cute & clumsy neurotic-card like he did so often, this time he says what he wants to say in an earnest and compelling way. ""Match Point"" is highly sophisticated cinema without any pretensions (if you overlook the fact that all characters are so smart and educated they could have jumped right out of an Oscar Wilde play). I will admit that although most of Allen's earlier movies are not my cup of tea, objectively speaking some of them have been very important in their own right. It's all the more impressive that after all those movies that made Allen one of the most original filmmakers ever, he's able to redefine himself not only as a director, but also to come up with such a perfect, clever script. I won't go into detail about how gloriously Allen's framework of pictures and monologue works here. It's not too subtle, anyway. What I admire most is the way Allen always puts the events of the story in the foreground with the real, recurring message that our life is arbitrary without sense or meaning hidden between the lines. ""Match Point"" never bores you and at the same time it appeals to your intellect. How very rare a mixture like that has become these days!After all these years, Allen has become a master in modeling believable characters and situations. Needless to say that the acting is brilliant, too. Allen simply refuses to work with anyone but the best. Scarlett Johansson is everybody's darling right now and rightly so. Her eroticism is natural and her performance leaves nothing to be desired. The rest of the (mostly British) cast is just as great. It's good to see Johnathan Rhys-Meyers making a worthy ""comeback"" after he's already promised so much in ""Velvet Goldmine"".Well, what more can I say than that this movie has even convinced a guy like me who's always had a disliking for Woody Allen and his movies. ""Match Point"" is just too damn good to hold a grudge. Let me put it this way (and God, I wonder how many reviewers have already used that term): Game, Set & Match: Allen!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Crimes and misdemeanours, part II","What if I'd praise this film - which is about a traditional love triangle (a handsome man, a beautiful and passionate young woman, a sweet and care-taking less-young wife) - as original? Would anybody believe me? And what if I added that it explores the tormented doubts of a husband, facing a crisis fought by an affectionate wife giving him a ""choose a life""-Trainspotting-lifestyle on one side, and a lust affair, adding - again - a praise for its originality? Would anyone believe me? How many hundreds of films like this have already been written? Well, the first part of the film is all about this and, in fact, is NOT original at all. It is simply well filmed and directed and acted. And that's the strength of the story: the non-originality, the already-seen, which compel the spectator to wait for an equally non-original and obviously already seen twisted plot made up of divorces, break ups, etc etc. BUT the spectator is going to find something very different from the expected, and is thus trapped by an anguish which I'd never expect from a Woody Allen's film. He caught me by surprise.It's a film terrifically different from all his other works. A murder! Oh well, yes, there was ""Manhattan murder mystery"", but it was clearly a funny comedy. And there was ""Crimes and misdemeanours"", as tragic as it could be, which however threw a totally different ethical responsibility upon the author of the crime. Match Point is a film about luck, which wickedly determines whether or not a homicide shall be punished. A question of fraction of millimetres, in a wedding ring which hits a railing as well as a tennis ball hits the net.Technically, I had the impression that Woody took longer than usual in the ""introduction"" of the film, for the presentation of the characters. In the same way and time, I had the impression that he needed to ""introduce"" an unusually new character for him: London.As for the comic side, I'll cite Trainspotting again, because Woody chose its Ewen Bremner to give us one of the few tiny (and great) spots of comicity in Match Point.Enjoy the film - and good luck!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good. But..... (some kind of spoilers),"Before I launch into my diatribe about the last part of the movie, let me first say that 2/3rds of this movie is the best Woody Allen I've seen in a long time. Of course I'm partial to the comedies, and this is a serious movie from the start, I can't remember laughing once,still this a very good film. However I find it hard to believe what happens in the last third of the film, the main character just didn't seem like the kind of person who would commit the ultimate crime . The acting ranges from pretty inept Jonathan Rhys Rees Ruse (although Woody's script has to take most of the blame) to hemispherical brilliant- Scarlet Johannsen (again Woodrow's script can take a bow here). The suspense actually comes in the middle of the film and although it kind of builds to a climax, depending on your suspension of belief you'll either belief or not belief. That is the ques-ton. Whether it is notable in the mind blah blah bing bong.....",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A furtive tear,"As much as I have always appreciated Woody Allen comedies, I admit to liking more the dramas where he asks the tough questions. The brilliant ""Match Point,"" like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is one of those, and it's his best.Loosely based on ""A Place in the Sun,"" Allen's tough question is, ""Would you rather be good or lucky?"" ""Is there such a thing as luck?"" Many believe that people ""make their own luck."" But Allen's premise is that, when it's all over, luck plays a huge part in all of our lives. He uses the analogy of a tennis ball - when you serve a ball and it lands on the net, it can topple over to the other side, and you win, or fall on the same side, and you lose.What a perfect analogy to tell the story of Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former professional tennis player. He becomes the tennis teacher at a British club and meets Tom Hewett, a young man from a filthy rich family. Chris is embraced by Hewett's family and begins dating Tom's sister Chloe. Then he sees Tom's fiancé, Nola, played by Scarlett Johannson, and becomes obsessed with her.This is an amazing film - absolutely nothing happens for a while, and yet everything happens. The story is punctuated with old, scratchy Caruso records and operatic selections from ""Macbeth,"" ""Otello,"" and others. We watch the characters living their lives, including their work, romantic entanglements, and marital problems. We watch them evolve, grow happy or unhappy, contented or restless, all leading up to the point where something does happen. When it does, it's ferocious. The ending will knock your socks off. It goes nowhere you think it's going. The film manages to keep you constantly off-balance and misinterpreting what you think you're seeing.The last time I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he was giving a marvelous portrayal of Elvis Presley, despite the fact that his height and frame are somewhat slighter than the King's. A beautiful young man, he has an interior dialogue going throughout the film. We don't hear it; we see it on his face. Scarlet Johannson is gorgeous and sexy as Nola, a cool blond in the Lana Turner tradition who is the object of his desire. Of all the characters in the film, her character goes through the most change, and she's very effective.There are no easy answers to the questions Allen asks in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""Stardust Memories,"" ""Bullets over Broadway,"" and ""Match Point."" Allen leaves open what will happen emotionally as a result of the events of this film. But the verse of ""Una Furtiva Lagrima,"" (A secret tear) played several times during the film despite a bad skip in the recording means ""For just one moment the beating Of her hot pulse could be felt! With her sighing confounding Momentarily my sighs! Oh God, I shall expire; I can't ask for more."" Significantly, it is heard at the beginning of the film and at the end.Just remember - the record skips.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has everyone lost their senses?!!!,"I watched this film in Dublin. Where to begin, with criticism? Perhaps the first point to note is the atrociously stilted dialogue. Is that what was intended? Did Woody Allen think it was supposed to be funny/ironic? All I can say is that the few laughs that this movie did get were of a very uncertain nature; the audience--more often than not--didn't seem to know whether they laughing with the movie, or at it.The crime that occurs is so out of character that it is really quite absurd. But Roger Ebert says: ""Let us talk instead in terms of the underlying philosophical issues. To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness?"" Now, that really is making a silk purse out of a sow's ear!The critics who have praised this movie seem to me to have read far too much into it. It seems to me that the whole thing was a shaggy-dog story that led up to one big joke at the end, and it wasn't worth the wait as far as I was concerned. However it is clear that most reviewers in IMDb think otherwise. Has the world gone mad?!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Bounce of a Ball...,"There comes a point in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net. It bounces straight up in the air and, with a bit of luck, it falls your way. Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" explores that moment of luck and all the consequences of it. Is it all just a series of random events? Are some of us just luckier than others? Sometimes, the bounce we want is not the bounce we need.Woody Allen is an awkward barometer of taste. You either like his writing or you don't. But even his most loyal fans have been restless with his latest offerings, chomping at the bit for him to try something other than a Manhattan relationship comedy with a neurotic lead male and a fine young thing as his muse.""Match Point"" is exactly what his fans wanted... A break from the routine as he delves into film-noir, class distinction and romantic thriller genres, all the while delivering the same brilliant, pitch-perfect dialog that has come to define his work over the past thirty years.This film evokes that nervous laughter you feel when the tension is almost unbearable. It is paced so relentlessly toward doom that you just want to scream something at the screen to help the characters avoid their inevitable fate. At one point, when the actions of the lead character are at a boiling point, I was practically begging that character to reconsider.The screenplay is essentially a six character play. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro who meets a wealthy family while teaching at an upper-crust London country club. He soon drifts into a pleasant relationship with the daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer). There is nothing tremendously passionate about the two of them... It all just seems to fit.Chloe's brother Tom (Matthew Goode) is engaged to Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a voluptuous and sexy American who is extremely aware of the effect she has on the men around her. Her impact is immediately felt by Chris, and the sparks fly as they secretly rendezvous behind their wealthy loved one's backs.The final two characters are the stinking rich parents (Brian Cox & Penelope Wilton) of Chloe and Tom, who are virtually trying to buy the future happiness of their children.I won't detail the ingenious plot in much detail, but needless to say, relationships boil and cool, people leave and come back, suspicions are ignited and extinguished. And we simply watch as Chris tries to juggle it all with the sole aim of landing on his feet safely.It is a clever little story that will have your jaw dropped and your head scratched on more than one occasion. And the film does not compromise. It leaves us in the way a French thriller would... With more questions than we started. It is definitely a film that you will have fun discussing.Woody delivers his best film in years. He does it in a genre you won't expect. And he does it with a cast that is so acutely precise with every word, every undertone of innuendo, every movement and glance. This is easily one of the best ensembles of the year.""Match Point"" is not a film where you will find likable characters... Hardly anyone in the film comes out clean on the other side. More than anything, this film will have you questioning the bounce of a ball as the key to it all. Is life just a series of fortunate or unfortunate breaks? I suppose it depends on your point of view.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not the Point, Not the Game","God bless Woody.He drives me nuts.He told us his psychiatric diagnosis 25 years ago. He ""Zelig,"" someone who bends to the strongest influence he encounters. He's often able to become master of whatever tradition he falls into, though we always seem to judge him on some past project we like. We think we know the man: well, we know a few things. He wears Manhattan. He has a stuttering mask of indecision. He loves not women but how they slide between what is and what they wish for us and them.But as an artist, we know nothing. Everything is a new experience, a new adventure and even the framework for exploration or experimentation shifts so there is no way to describe what we have. Anyone who purports to misses the point. The man as an artist must be taken as the quantum blur surrounding the poles of what we have encountered.When he makes a film, it rarely matters as a film. Oh, some do. I would value ""Sweet and Lowdown"" and ""Annie Hall"" even if we had nothing else, and I would pay dearly to see the three hour mystery cut of ""Annie Hall."" But even those adventures pale when considering the vast, deep wander through cinematic ideas he's taken us.So when I sit through this mess, and wonder why, why could someone do something so mindless, so lacking in richness... I wonder what, is he dead already? This has no elaboration, no noir agency, no complicating perspective, no folding, passion. It isn't even what it shows, an ad hoc inventiveness to pleasure, contrived at the last minute. It does have some introspection on the unlikely existence of itself  accident.But it isn't accident. Its yet another street he's wandered down, another Tourette's utterance. It has no value in itself as a movie for me. It doesn't have to. Its another, different page in a life that has become a larger movie for me. And is there any better thing to say about a life as an artist?The lovely thing is that the films are essentially all most of us have about the man, and each can be used as a window into the others.One thing about each film is that it is a lover that he abandons, probably already on to the next one.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Match Point is also one of the most critical of social inequality, and Allen delivers a moral essay with a disturbing epilogue.","When you've been following for a long time, or are familiar with a long film career, as is the case with Woody Allen's, you may have already noticed a certain... or relapse of their level. Well, that's the fate that every filmmaker with more than thirty films under his belt will inevitably face. Hitchcock, Godard, Ford and Bergman say so (although the latter doesn't even have a film below good or average). Unfortunately, that was the path that the melancholy and humorous director/writer/actor had to face in his career. More behold, the filmmaker presented, Ponto Final: Match Point (or just Match Point), which proved to be one of his creative high points that he returns or another, still demonstrates to be able to do.In London, we meet Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an ambitious young ex-tennis player who has just started working as a tennis instructor at an elite club. There he meets and befriends Tom (Matthew Goode), a playboy who introduces Chris to his family of millionaires, the Hewetts. Chris begins to approach and date his younger sister, the kind young Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and gets a job at her father's contractor Alec (Brian Cox), quickly climbing the ladder he's longed for. Things get complicated when Chris meets and falls in love with Nola (Scarlett Johansson), Tom's sensual American fiancée, where they begin an extramarital affair, sparking a dangerous conflict.Demonstrating his more than recognized talent for the composition of complex and interesting characters, Woody Allen introduces us, in Match Point, to individuals of always dubious character: who are those people and what are their motivations? Chloe, for example, appears to be a sincere young woman who genuinely wants to help Chris fulfill his ambitions without forcing him to do something she doesn't like. But watch how she subtly leads him to take a job at one of her father's companies and how, seemingly without realizing it, she reveals that she's been monitoring his performance. And she notices how Tom, despite treating Chris with immense consideration, promptly dubs him ""Irish"", in an unconscious reminder that the former athlete belongs to a lower caste.This dubiousness, by the way, applies to the protagonist himself: initially, Chris sounds like a proud but good-natured young man: he wants to ""go up in life"", ""be somebody"", but he insists on paying the bill when he goes out with his friend. Millionaire and seems hesitant to use his newfound friendships as a stepping stone to high society. Gradually, however, we begin to notice certain inconsistencies in his behavior and begin to suspect that his interest in Dostoevsky, for example, has less to do with his cultural enrichment and more with an effort to impress his future father-in-law. And there's something carefully studied about the seemingly casual way he tells Chloe that he ""wishes I had more students,"" suggesting he's in financial trouble while maintaining the dignified demeanor of someone willing to work hard for money.Meanwhile, Nola, who at first comes across as a classic femme fatale, gradually turns out to be infinitely naiver and romantic than we might have guessed. She is aware of her own power of seduction, it is true (""Men think I would be something very special.""), but she is totally vulnerable and without self-control in front of Chris, behaving exactly like Anjelica Huston in front of Martin Landau in Crimes and Sins (and, let's face it, we'd normally expect a young, sophisticated, confident woman like Johannson to act quite differently from Huston's needy, relatively uncultured, middle-aged stewardess).Using dialogue as elegant windows into his characters' psyches, Allen once again displays his intelligence, for example, by illustrating the powerful Alec Hewett's (Cox) good character and concern for his family through small comments made by the latter, as when asking if his son, who was following him in another car, ""wasn't going too fast"", establishing the subject's personality in an economical way, which allows him to spend more time with the more complex figures in history. Also, note how, when talking to Nola about Chloe, Chris describes the latter as being ""very nice,"" an apparent compliment that, however, is clearly intended to put her down - something Nola notices immediately. In fact, the conversation between the couple of lovers in the scene in question represents a real and disputed tennis match: always in an elegant way, Chris expresses his interest in Nola, who rebuts him firmly, placing herself in a superior position in front of the boy. - who, even so, wins the duel only by questioning where the girl's confidence was during the test he had just taken and in which he had failed. Only a scene like this would justify the nomination of the Match Point script to any award in the category.However, Woody Allen's script reserves many more surprises for the viewer than just well-constructed dialogue. After investing 90 minutes in developing the story and building the characters, the director catches the viewer off guard by making an impactful genre twist, revealing much deeper and darker layers in those people's personalities. And, despite everything, the script was constructed with such delicacy that, when analyzed in retrospect, it is perfectly possible to perceive that Allen had been preparing himself from the beginning for that maneuver: when focusing on Chris reading Dostoevsky, for example, he didn't just want to reveal the character's ambition as he prepares for literary discussions with his future father-in-law, but it also plants the seed of later events in the plot (the same applies to a casual comment made by Nola about incidents in her building that, in addition to establish the girl's daily life, becomes more relevant when associated with other information). And how can you fail to be enchanted by the fantastic visual rhyme created by Woody Allen by combining the foreground of the film with another seen at the end of the second act, when a certain character throws something into the river (another reference, by the way, to the work by Dostoevsky)?Recreating key moments such as the main event of both the book and the movie, the murder. Occurring almost exactly identically: the death of the old woman; the alleged theft of the jewelry; almost caught by one of the neighboring residents; the young woman's death; the sudden escape bumping into people on the way out. Of course none of the actions occur for the same motivations as in the book, but the structure is the same. This already guarantees the film some ignorant comments as Allen copies from its influential author to assemble a scene or plot, as it no longer has any creative or thematic purpose, or pure ""recycling"" so to speak. But I couldn't disagree more.It is precisely in this recreation of the work through the film, and even in his intention to quote the author's name several times, among others, that a narrative gateway is created for Allen to bring together both the literary and cinematographic universes that influence him so much. This allows his themes to flourish in a subtle way, but easy to identify and analyze. An invitation to enter the universe of the plot that he creates here for the characters, making the audience feel the same feelings of anguish and internal despair that surround the psychologist of his protagonist. This also serves as a trigger for Allen to be able to address the Dostoevskian themes that fascinate him so much.Ponto Final: Match Point is a classic character drama, revisiting not only the most existentialist and nihilistic points of Woody Allen's filmography, but also the essence of the literary work on which he was inspired. The way the opera is allied to the script and the model, initially episodic, later shown as an entire act and then as a junction of decisive arias make the tape a new technical exercise for Allen, who, even after so long, was still experimenting with possibilities. Of how to tell a story within different standards. This is, without a doubt, one of his best.Ending in a brilliantly cynical way, Match Point indicates that, above all, Allen still remains a courageous filmmaker, who does not compromise with the public in order to improve the commercial prospects of his projects (indeed, whoever looks at it The two characters who appear in the final ten minutes of the screening are likely to be disappointed; those men lend themselves to satirical, social commentary and should not be viewed any other way). And it's quite likely that fans of the director will have a new conundrum to discuss for decades to come: the pregnancy of a certain character (did it really exist?). It's a perhaps silly, inconsequential, but no less fascinating detail of the script.Woody Allen is filming in London for the first time and his Oscar-nominated original screenplay pays homage to the philosophical and cerebral nobility of the British. Match Point is set in some of the most traditional tourist spots in the city and explores the mythical aristocratic opulence of London's high class, with the right to vast and opulent country houses, under operatic chords. Perhaps one of the director's most sensual works, Match Point is also one of the most critical of social inequality. In it, sexual seduction is one of the main weapons of social ascension, but it is the desire and attraction among the ""discontented"" that put them in danger. Allen delivers a moral essay with a disturbing epilogue.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best films of the year!,"Having just come out of the movie theater I am ready to declare that this is one of the best films of the year. Shot in London, the atmosphere feels very different than that set up in the rest of his films - even Melinda and Melinda, a very recent film and a personal favourite of mine - feels to have belonged to a different director. This was slightly off-putting for me in the beginning but as the film progressed I realised that Woody Allen has reached the point where he can produce any kind of masterpiece even if that means unbalancing the notion of what has been perceived and eagerly acclaimed as his ""style"". The dialogue is excellent for once more, the plot ingeniously conceived and developed. The theme of crime and punishment along with that of luck and its relation to life are both persistent throughout the film. A lot of wisdom and a lot of opera that helps build the tension.

Woody Allen Is A Serious Artist -- And We All Must Pay!,"A sleazy, blue collar tennis pro marries into a wealthy family -- only to risk it all for back-alley passion that swiftly turns to horror.Woody Allen is telling an old story. Not only does he borrow shamelessly from Dreiser's classic novel An American Tragedy, (1925) but from modern films like MASQUERADE (1988) and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999).Problem is, the cast and the script are not good enough to make the familiar material seem fresh, let alone gripping. When you watch THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, the lush Italian setting and the casual cool of Jude Law's ""Dickie Greenleaf"" really sell you on the idea that the good life is worth killing for. But in this movie, the rich family are such a one-dimensional collection of yawning British stereotypes it's impossible to imagine any poor boy being tempted -- let alone captivated -- by their listless pleasures and sleepy little lives.Then there's the hero. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a total Joe Blow. He fails to make this creepy little social climber even remotely interesting. When Matt Damon played Tom Ripley, he did a brilliant job of making Ripley seem sweet and helpless at first --so you could like him, and also so you could see why he reaches his breaking point and starts fighting back. Even Rob Lowe in MASQUERADE was able to summon up a certain easy cool. His gigolo was a rugged sailor, a true competitor, and he fell in love with his target for real. (Very romantic.) More than that, he was a guy who got off on thinking fast and fooling the rich folks. But Joe Blow can't do that. He has zero sexual allure, zero danger, no soul. Just a blank stare and a pout.Things only get worse when Scarlett Johanssen makes the scene. Not since Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were scorching up the screen in their STARS WARS abomination have two sulky young stars so utterly lacked any sexual fire or intelligence. The difference is that George Lucas never said he understood sexual passion. And he never built his stories around desire. But in MATCH POINT everything depends on the idea that Joe Blow is willing to throw away everything --and I mean EVERYTHING -- just for more hot sex with his secret girlfriend.Poor Scarlett Johannsen! She's not really that bad an actress. But she's in the hands of a director who is so old and tired and bored that he can't even begin to think about helping her create a character. Woody's idea of making a young woman ""sexy"" is to have her light up a cigarette. So disgusting! And worse than that, so out of date!Scarlett's Nola Rice is nothing but a plot contrivance. One minute she's a crude, trash-talking slut, a gold digger bragging that she can bag any man. Then suddenly she's a good girl, toiling away in a cozy little shop and aching for her man to come ""home"" to her instead of going back to his wife. Huh??!??! Did Woody even TRY to explain this character to Scarlett? I don't think so, because she looks really confused (and sleepy) all the time, like a young actress who's been partying a bit too hard while shooting overseas.At any rate, the movie all boils down to Joe Blow suddenly being so desperate and obsessed that he just has to kill someone. Now, the truth is he could have killed the ENTIRE CAST by the last half hour and the whole audience would have just turned over and snored. Or stood up and cheered. But there are a couple of surprise twists at the end -- worth seeing just for the way they make you think. But on an emotional level, they don't involve anything sexy or exciting, like a happy ending. Woody Allen is above that sort of thing.Woody Allen is a serious artist -- and we all must pay!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good surprise,"If you're going to see this movie expecting the story of a neurotic character and lots of laughs, you'll be disappointed. Match Point is Woody Allen trying something different with a great plot and script and a wonderful casting.I'm biased, OK. I've been a Woody Allen fan for years, although I haven't liked all his movies. In his late films I was missing the mood I loved about Crimes and Misdemeanors or Husbands and Wives, and Match Point recovers it in some way, even though it's a completely different movie.Another difference is the location. It felt strange to see an Allen movie where characters don't walk in Manhattan coming or going to a diner. Since I'm not British I can't tell if locations are good, but it sure looked very British high society to me. I mean, if it is cloudy and rainy 90% of the time and people play tennis and speak English with a strong British accent, where are you? And finally i'd like to mention how good actors are in this movie. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson have a intensity that fills the screen.

After Anything Else, Melenda and Melenda and now this there's no doubt Woody Allen is back making wonderful films and this is clearly his best one in decades. This certainly has Allen doing his Ingmar Bergman impersonation and he hits all the right marks with his direction, especially the love scenes, which are highly erotic without having to resort to nudity. The two stars do very good jobs especially Johansson who should have gotten an Oscar nomination. The first 2/3rds of the film aren't really anything special or different than films we've seen before but that final act is downright shocking and goes in directions you'll never expect.

"Yes to the plot, more character texture please!!","I have read some good and bad review and found them all very pertinent. The concepts of luck, social climbing, love and lust are clearly well articulated with beautiful imagery. This is something that most movies today lack and for this reason I think Match Point is a 'must-see movie.However, the characters, despite being played by good actors, are not given enough material for us to believe that they are real people.Chris is too polished from the very start for a person coming from a poor socio-economic background. His explanation for his love of opera seemed to be an afterthought, particularly as he is never seen speaking about this passion after/before the performances. Where are his friends and relatives? Not a single phone call to them or flashback.No one he could have invited to his wedding? The casual encounter with a tennis player is just not enough to place him and explain who he really is.Woody Allen, can you please develop female characters that are less stereotypical??
The scene where Nola and Tim start having sex at a party, or the breakfast talk about having sex with a thermometer are not believable at all!Overall the dynamics are badly explained between the parents-in-law and their children, between Tom and Nola and so on.

"Game, Set, and Match to Mr. Allen","Woody's first film outside New York is like a breath of fresh air. Here he revisits the dramatic landscape of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" with shades of ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""A Place in the Sun."" However, he masterfully blends all these familiar themes into something his very own, thanks to a clever script. Rhys Meyers, who played Elvis Presley earlier and certainly resembles him, is fine as a social-climbing tennis pro caught between two women. Johansson looks ravishing as the object of his affection and she gives a terrific performance as the other woman. In weaving his intriguing tale, Allen generates some suspenseful moments that would do Hitchcock proud.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Least Personal Allen Plays Smart,"Woody Allen has defined a genre that might well suit the writer's catharsis, a little bit more outrageous with Charlie Kauffman, in which characters digress into their feelings and avoid all kind of physical action. Woody used to depict in scene his alter ego to structure and open all what he has in mind in more than an intellectual recipe. Cinematographically in his sunset (or not so) he shines a smart, well crafted story about an ex-tennis player that is involved in the London elite as well in trouble and dead ends.His film may pass reliably as a true story, filmed in the moment as things are factual and the filming is just a witnessing in the story. He plays fairly well with that perspective: he makes it credible thanks to great, felt performances and a script that makes it's way through rigorous drafting to look natural and improvised. Allen here has the time to impose succulent in betweens and innuendos, fantastic metaphors and intelligent, thoughtful ramifications of the human condition. His cinematography is slow moving, yet smooth, just like drinking wine. Elitesque and superb. There is fire between the young couple of mains, where Woody tries to stay fresh no matter the years.""Match Point"" is Woody's most commercial film, and he defined him as his best. He may be proud all over his meditated script and his first rate direction, but maybe audience (us) will prefer his innovated, spicy and emotional older pictures.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Allen's best film ever. May be spoilers.,"It is extraordinary that a film maker as skilled and experienced as Woody Allen has after 36 years and some 40 movies as writer/director, made his Masterpiece. Hannah And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, Husbands And Wives, Annie Hall are undeniably superb, but with Match Point, Allen has risen to a very high level indeed.Two things immediately set this film apart from his others: He doesn't act in it, and he has chosen London--not his beloved New York or Paris--in which to unravel this story of steaming lust, lethal ambition, and numbing irony. Johnathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris Wilton, a tennis pro who will never reach the top and has thus insinuated himself into the upper-crust world of Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), daughter of a very successful business man (Brian Cox). Her brother has an American girlfriend, Nola, (a brilliant Scarlet Johansson) who is voluptuous, reckless and willful, and who is drawn to Chris. They have a brief fling, but the ambitious Chris goes on to marry Chloe and to take a position in her father's company. He's beyond his class but adapts quickly and has some success. Chloe badly wants to have a child but they have trouble conceiving. Nola, a budding actress, breaks up with Chloe's brother and disappears into her theatre world in London until a chance encounter with Chris leads to an entangled affair that leaves him desperate to find a way out. This is further complicated when Nola becomes pregnant. What ensues is intense, gripping, and bizarrely logical.Woody Allen has captured the louche flippancy and fluent ease of the rich and privileged while punctuating this tale with a dark undercurrent rarely seen in his films. There's a wonderful foreshadowing scene early on that resonates ironically in the fevered machinations of Chris to extricate himself from the Hell he has created. The script is seamless--not a word is out of place--and the music frames the story around visits to the opera. For once Allen forsakes vintage 30's jazz for passages from Verdi and Rossini. The settings and costumes are spot on and the pace of the film is impeccable. Brilliant editing.I think the writing and directing are Oscar caliber, as is Johansson's performance. I saw Match Point here in France. I'd like to be in New York when there will be (Nov. 29) a special screening at Lincoln Center with Allen fielding comments and questions from the audience. This should create quite a buzz and stir for old Woody. Imagine: at 70 years he's done a job that Hitchcock might envy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Luck and Deceit,"Greetings again from the darkness. Despite his lack of box office pop, Woody Allen has always been a terrific writer of relationship chaos. He also has recorded his love of New York City on film for the past 30 years. In what is his best work since ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and belonging in the same high class as ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall"", ""Match Point"" has Mr. Allen exploring these same relationship topics within his newly discovered Britain setting.With the recurring theme of luck (the word is used at least 11 times in the script), the film takes Chris, a former Irish tennis pro (""Bend it Like Beckham"" coach Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and tosses him into the upper crust of the British elite. Surprisingly enough, he fits right in. Not so surprisingly, he falls in love with wealth and its privileges. An Allen staple, the twists and turns of relationships and family life develop into quite a mess for our tennis boy. Married to, and adored by, rich girl Chloe (played exceedingly well by Emily Mortimer), Chris also falls hard under the spell of sultry, struggling American actress and seductress Nola, slightly overplayed by Scarlet Johansson. Some of the best scenes are the ones exhibiting the entire family, including Chris' in-laws played by Brian Cox (who is the new Gene Hackman - seemingly in half the movies released) and Penelope Wilton (""Pride and Prejudice"" ""Calendar Girls"") and a self-indulgent Matthew Goode (the chasing agent in ""Chasing Liberty""). Quite often these scenes occur right before and right after a passionate (way beyond the norm for Allen) tryst between Chris and Nola creating quite the tension for the viewers.The canvas of London is surprisingly similar to Manhattan as seen through the eye of Allen and this is quite a compliment. Another Allen trademark is his use of music, and opera is the call here. The blending of opera both visually and through the soundtrack provide the tempo and feel that Allen wants us to experience. An interesting side note is that Chris' driver is played by John Fortune, a British TV star.For those of us who love multi-layered stories and watching people attempt to dig themselves out of their own mess, ""Match Point"" is a gem. For those looking for any old fashioned Woody humor, head to the video store. This is a grown-up story with twists and turns and is very dark in nature, and I consider myself ""lucky"" to have seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Insightful, Intelligent, and What a Thrill (Especially the Ending)","When Woody Allen is in top shape, the man knows no fear. In ""Match Point"" he treats us to a tale that is supposed to teach us something by exploring the illicit adventures of a not so bright but lucky chap. He just happens to always be at the right place at the right time, and in most cases, he succeeds in spite of that force of nature played by Scarlet Johanson.In fact, part of the fun, is watching his journey through a mine field he creates himself. He knows what is best, and yet he surrenders himself to passions he understands but has little moral fiber to fight. This film takes to England and explores how the upper classes live, how they interact, and what they offer to people who get lucky to interact with them. Woody Allen subtly offers an insight into how breeding affects your social maneuvers. For example, he does wonders with the cast, and that's what makes Johanson's Nora so interesting and dangerous. She recalls Glenn Close's Alex in ""Fatal Attraction"". Is she a character that is too emotional for her own good? or Is she a victim of circumstances beyond her control? or Is she the victimizer? There is a very strong performance here, and it should come with a warning for this actress brings intense carnality to the screen. She is an object of desire, and she plays it to the limit.Rhys-Meyers gives a solid performance as the man who is able to move up in the world, with the approval and support of his newly found benefactors and a devoted wife. Along with Johanson, they keep the film going, and their interaction perfectly supports the tightness of Allen's script. It's through their history that we learn our lesson, and that lesson should be a point of contention between many members of the audience. It's a solid film, with much intelligence, much entertainment, and a return to greatness for a man who has explored the complexity of the human soul before, and who knows what weak creatures we are.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Slow paced but never boring,"A clever script, superb acting and expert direction ensures this very slow burner doesn't fizzle out half way through. Having said that the pivotal moment arrives kinda out of the blue and very late on in the movie. I can't help thinking if said pivotal moment was closer to the middle of proceedings and the aftermath taken a little more seriously the movie would've been better for it. I was also recommend this as a sexy thriller with some hot bonking action but the rumpy pumpy is all rather lame. Maybe I saw an edited version but there's certainly nothing here your maiden Aunt would blush at.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Realistic Feelings and Steady Suspense,"I'm deeply impressed with Allen's newest creation that is so painstakingly real and intense. This film creates a perfectly mimicked reality in which I hope I will never happen to live. There is no Hollywood softened plot and rationale, but real, fresh and dedicated acting. It is hard not to fall in love with Miss Johansson and I believe Chris Wilton when being torn. In general the psychological layer is very rich. Less epic and less ""funny"" than other films by W. Allen, the director's style still is persistent within the plot, i.e. the honest way of dealing with human feelings and actions. My favorite Allen along with Deconstructing Harry.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A decent Woody Allen film,"This story is about a man's love affairs and how it goes spinning out of control with the decisions the man makes and how sometimes luck can also play a bit part. I will say that Jonathan Rhys Meyers a amazing job playing the little weasel that uses his wit and charm to get what he wants and his character will probably stay with me no matter what different roles he may take, he was just that dislike able in the film cause he played the character so well. ""Match Point"" is a movie that takes a bit of time to get into it's clever territory with sophisticated characters study. I thought the performances were great although I really dislike Emily Mortimer cause of her cracking voice. It was cool to watch how sometimes luck can make difference in a person's life even if you don't believe in luck. This film is not a masterpiece, but a decent film. But the good dialogue, performance and plot will draw you in. The problem about this film is that it takes a lot of patience to get to any plot development.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gripping and suspenseful,More plot than I expect from a typical Woody Allen film and less charming but there was heaps of upper classic intrigue.

Do you believe in luck? you should.,"This review contains no spoilers. {{The man who said ""I'd rather be lucky than good"" saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose. }}. This was a quote from Match Point. I think I don't need to write anything else after this, this should get you some ideas about the film. This film starts as a romance/drama, then the thriller part comes in slowly. The film can be enjoyed on two levels, one is to enjoy it as simple femme-fatal story or the second is a philosophical view which the director intended it to be from the first shot of the film. The story takes some time to develop, but at the end of the film, you will be very happy you saw it. good ""luck"". enjoy the film.",,Anonymous,Romance
This torrid love affair left me very thirsty,"Pretty good for a Woody Allen movie, which is to say that I struggle through his stuff (even with the best of intentions) and this one managed to keep me hooked. Scarlett Johansson is (uber sexy) here and she and Jonathon Rhys Meyers are excellent together -smoking hot chemistry. I liked the entire extended cast and the London location.It's a bit of a slow burn to start, with tons of character development. The last hour makes up for it though, its very tense, surprising and brutal. I wasn't sure how ""that"" was going to play out -well done.A couple of things did annoy me; the ongoing score of opera music (that's just me) and the fact that the characters were always drinking something. I actually got quite distracted by this as they poured, stirred, raised and sipped their way through the dialogue. Water from a pitcher, a bottle, the tap. Tea, coffee, beer, champagne cocktails, G&T. It became an overused prop. One of the few Woody Allen movies I've made it through in its entirety though.

"""The innocent are sometimes slain to make way for grander schemes. You were collateral damage. "" - Chris Wilton (Jonathon Rhys Myers)","After a bundle of embarrassing movies, Woody Allen hits it out of the park with what is my opinion his best film, period. What it is about? Well, love, jealousy, envy, opportunism and survival. Chris Wilton (Jonathan Ryhs-Myers) is a Irish lower-class tennis instructor teaching the ultra-wealthy British to play tennis. He is also a major social climber. When he scores Chloe Hewitt Wilson (Emily Mortimer) who is the sweet and affectionate daughter of a extremely wealthy family. Within time Chris and her get married, but that's when everything changes. Chris gets introduced to Chloe's brother's fiancé Nola (Scarlett Johannson) and becomes obsessed. This will jeopardize everything he has. That's about all I will tell you about Woody Allen's latest erotic thriller that runs slow in the first hour but picks up tremendous pace in the final hour with an absolutely ingenious ending that Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling would be proud of.

Match point Movie Review,"The nature of luck is a very rewarding, and yet very deceptive concept. It can give one individual so much, or it can take more than what they bargained for. Director Woody Allen illustrates this vast un scientific concept with the example of Tennis as a good example. Through the well interpreted narration of the film's protagonist, Chris Wilton (Myers) we are given a more clear idea of how luck can work. In game of Tennis, the ball can go on either side of the fence, thus ending the game, and making a final result. The concept itself is more preferably displayed through the course of the film, and through the situations revolving around the characters themselves. The film begins with it's lead character Chris Wilton, a retired Tennis pro from Ireland has decided to take up a teaching position in a London Tennis Club, acquiring a very well priced apartment, as well a being given the chance to teach a very wealthy student Tom Hewitt (Goode). In time, Tom becomes closer friends with his new teacher, to inviting him to his families opera, out of their coincidental love for opera, thus furthering a good relation ship with Tom's parents. In Chris's favor, Tom's sister Chloe (Mortimer) takes a shine to Chris, opening numerous opportunities for him, a fancy executive positions at her dads companies, a relationship, and a much greater stand with her Parents, Alec and Eleanor in the act of holy matrimony. All the luck seems like it's been going in Chris's favor, only for him to rock the boat, by uncontrollably pursuing Tom's sexy fiancé, Nola Rice (Johansson), a girl who's lust for Chris as much as he does for her. In there sexually active love affair, their relationship faces it's ups and downs, as the matter of Whether Chris will leave his wife will ever happen, hence all his bull and stalling. Chris views his situation with much difficulty. One hand, a life with Chloe, he sees a frivolous life style beyond his own perceivable limitations, and on the other hand, a life with Nola means happiness, with the woman he truly loves, only to a future with who knows what kind of benefit. Christ luck becomes worse as Nola becomes pregnant, thus making his choice of action more clear. In the act of murder Chris, stains his soul further by not only ending Nola's life, but even shamelessly killing her neighbor, in the hopes of making his kills look untraceable. His luck seems bad at the call of the police for questioning, only to work in his favor, thus proving the concept of Luck to be neither pure nor tainted, but completely random. It even seemed like Chris's luck had turned for the worst, as the Detective was able to put together the puzzle that was Wilton's murders. Director Woody Allen has given viewers a very accurate depiction of how the very concept of luck can go in any situation, ignoring the moral traits most people would believe to go in effect. He just simply gave us a very basic situation, which then evolved into what turned out to be a tragic end for so many. All viewers would've enjoyed seeing Chris answer for his sins, thus suffering the most unfortunate luck possible for a man of his nature. However that is the way the world is. Things either can go good or bad for just about anybody, whether they are good or bad people, thus making none of them special in the nature of luck. I really enjoyed this film, and how its story focused on the very pathway it's protagonist was going. His life changing for the better from time to time, and thus getting worse for worse, and then getting better all together again. The very opera motivated themes represented the tragedy of the character, and the predicament of which his actions had led him to because despite proving to be cold hearted, Chris was still suffering inside, subjected forever to the torment of his sins. I would also like to say the Johansson's performance was unique, because although Nola may seem at first like a very insecure, and often struggling character, which is exactly the point of how Johansson portrayed her. She expressed both a strong emotion, as well displaying her desperate nature of her generally unconfident insecurity.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
masterpiece,"Criticism:
None! ...at least not a negative one. This film was the best Woody Allen in years, if not one of his masterpieces ever. Trills, drama and love story are skillfully mixed into a cocktail that tastes sugary sweet at first, then really grabs you in its mouthiness so that you can hardly get enough and then suddenly has a crisp finish, making it unforgettable.The audience can accurately empathise with every emotion the protogonists go through in the course of the plot. A mirror is thrust in front of one's eyes that I'm sure everyone has faced at one time or another, either faced or escaped with eyes closed. But there is no escape here. The driving components of daily life are staged in their contradictions through the cinematic twists and turns in the most authentic way...social advancement, sexual desire and economic striving.And there is one thing I must not forget now, the salt in the wonderful soup. Scarlett Johansson! She catapulted herself to one of the (few) greats in Hollywood at the time, a diva, and that only in a positive sense, in the one that creates parallels to the unforgettable ladies of film history, far away from the starlets who enter the stage every day and leave just as quickly...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Court in the Act,"The vague and vacuous title of my review very much resembles that of the film itself; Match Point. Within the context of this production, what exactly does it mean? So, yes, one of the leading characters was a former tennis pro but that seems about the only reference to the film name. Neither have I read any review or reference to the fact that this is all very bizarre. As for the movie itself, I have never been a fan of Woody Allen but the large part of this film is engrossing with greed, morals and attitude's of the monied classes very much to the fore. Towards the end there is an inexplicable act that doesn't in my opinion justify the angst that has led upto it. However jolly entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remake,"I am a huge Allen fan and own many of his movies and almost saw all of his movies (that's quite a lot!). Among them, there is the excellent 1989 movie ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", starring a wonderful Martin Landau and Angelica Houston.A user has written that ""Allen discovers new terrain"" with Matchpoint. Well, in which sense? Matchpoint has the same moral content and the basic plot is identical to the above 1989 movie.Do not get me wrong: No one more than Allen deserves (also) commercial success for his movies, something that did not quite happened since the mid 80ies. But I think if you like this one, it's probably because the cast corresponds to what 20ies now recognize to be ""actors"". So do not laud this and ignore other, much more important gems from this brilliant genius.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A+ entertainment,"Well, I just loved Match Point. The acting was superb throughout. Jonathan Ryhs Meyers & Scarlett Johanson played great against each other. Really every actor stayed right in character and there's no annoying acting moments. Tennis as a metaphor for chance. Opera & ballet & Dostovesky get the Woody Allen treatment, but NOT the heavy- handed campy once over that's in other his other movies. Here, he's serious. There is a development, toward the end of this movie, that was so very Un-Allen that I never thought it would happen.

Not a masterpiece but entertaining.,"An ex tennis player turned pro marries into a wealthy British family but has his eyes on his brother-in-law's girlfriend. You know this is going to be good from the start, but some reviewers here are suggesting that this is a masterpiece and frankly its not. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johannson are not convincing and some clever twists in the second half really save an otherwise slow film. The operatic themes throughout didn't work for me and were overdone. Perhaps the main problem lies in the fact that no one in the film is likable except for the father. Everyone else is so selfish and stupid. I could not muster up even a grain of sympathy for any of the characters and felt they deserved all they got. I actually hoped that they all might die in some terrible accident or similar tragedy in the end, but that never eventuated.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Flawlessly filmed, Intensely Subtle, a Tight, almost Ibsen-like Drama","Match Point (2005)Woody Allen's latest films, which I like a lot, are not overtly original. We are miles from Bananas, Stardust Memories, and Zelig. We are not even in the same room as other intimate dramas like Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters. Match Point almost feels like a perfectly executed exercise in making an ordinary film, but making it so well we are spellbound and willing. There is a feeling as you watch that something more should happen, and maybe that's the genius of it, when something more does happen and it isn't so outrageous after all. Except in the usual sense--outrageous for Allen, and for a few other special filmmakers, used to mean charting new territory.The movie is so finely balanced it's hard to find what to note in particular. But maybe, as a photographer, I'll start with the camera-work, not because it's stellar, but because it's invisible. And this invisibility is the film's trademark, some might say its only flaw. If you do watch the camera-work, though, you'll see no amazing light, no sweeping or swooping moving shots, no hand-held jitters, no black and white aura (all things Allen has used in the past). Instead, the visuals are in service to the story--superbly professional and subtle.Everyone and every thing is out to support the story. Remember, Woody Allen is a writer, and maybe a writer above all. His fascination with an innocent person doing something wrong--from cheating on his woman to murder--appears more frequently in his films, and he makes it so terribly real, and subtle, and vivid, it becomes a real shock on the screen. And yet a shock with coat and tie, just theatrical and polite enough to avoid being literally shocked. Instead we experience a kind of theater-shock, the surprise and delight (and dismay) at seeing the character do something shocking, beyond the fourth wall.This isn't meant to be double talk. I'm stressing how finely tuned the performances are woven together to enhance the basic events as a beautiful stage act. Yet it's on film, and filmed and directed with elegant subtlety. Three of Allen's most recent movies--Match Point, Vicki Christina Barcelona, and Cassandra's Dream--take a similar approach to life, crime, and infidelity, rooted in earlier films like his masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). By itself, it's a body or work to distinguish any director. I know people who dismiss many of Allen's films basically because they aren't what they expected, his middle period serious films like Another Woman (1988), for example, but that's a shame. He's still at it, in a more conventional vein, for sure, but brilliantly, memorably.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Woody, It Might Be Time to Go Out to Pasture...","A problematic film for long-time Woody Allen fans.Essentially, this is the Hallmark card version of Crimes and Misdemeanors (via An American Tragedy, A Place in the Sun, Room at the Top and many others) which provides as much sustenance as gorging on angel-food cake. There are so many miscalculations and misjudgements that the mind reels in the attempt to list them. For starters, how can a director as experienced and spoilt for choice as Woody Allen frame an entire film around a performer who can't act? Jonathan Rhys Meyers is so unsure of himself that even his accent isn't credible although he's only required to play an Irishman which, in reality, he is! It's logical that an aspirant attempting to ingratiate himself with the Upper Class (which he seems to manage in just a few seconds, at most) would purposely modify his accent to fit in but anyone with half an ear will be distracted by the strange melange that issues forth even in the earliest moments of the film. Put that together with the numerous pouts and bizarre facial ticks that Allen's camera devotedly captures (again, why so many long shots and close ups on a performer who can't deliver the goods?) which supposedly constitute for projection of deep inner conflict and you have something approximating an automaton being controlled via faulty wiring. This is a deeply embarrassing and misguided performance that some might see as mysterious or enigmatic but, to the perceptive viewer, remains woefully inadequate. Scarlett Johansson fares somewhat better by at least consistently sounding like the New Yorker that she is but the role does seem out of her current emotional depth. Allen's view of her character, at least, is the most three-dimensional in the film possibly because he is writing about things closer to home. The rest of the cast consist of reliable British actors who have severely underwritten and badly observed parts (Brian Cox's monotone father tends to grate, as does the ludicrously plummy brother and sister) or distracting cameos by well known TV performers who have seemingly wrangled themselves a bit of immortality by being in a Woody film.London itself is reduced to a cardboard cutout Manhattan-like island where people always bump into each other (whether it be in Mayfair shopping for Casmere jumpers or casually hanging out at the Tate Modern), and every move made includes the incorporation of some major landmark in the background. If Woody had decided to pay homage to Rene Clair's wonderful surrealist film 'Paris Qi Dort' (about a man who lives at the top of the Eiffel Tower) by having his main character find a great flat inside Big Ben, I wouldn't have been any less convinced.As for the dialogue, the less said the better. A major point (not much discussed in other reviews) is that, at over 2 hours, this is his longest film. He also, pretty much, has the least to say in it. It's a long way down from 'Another Woman' and his other idea rich 'serious' films which barely approached the 90 minute barrier. Possibly the only way to endure this particular turkey is to imagine it's a 'Love And Death' style comedy and that Woody is actually sending the whole thing up.Enthusiasts of Woody Allen's work will be severely shell-shocked to see how badly their idol has fallen, even in light of his post 'Sweet & Lowdown' (the last major work) output. Woody, please, either wait till you have something to say (and know how to say it) or take up gardening or something. Please!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Suspense from the master of kvetching,"Woody Allen surprises me with this, his best work in years. In fact, it doesn't feel like Woody at all, which I daresay is great praise for the master film maker, proving he still has ""it"".A masterful performance from Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who plays a truly less than likable character to say the least, yet captures the audience and draws one into his twisted life. Allen has masterfully directed and composed this film so that we share in the fun and also in the discomfort that comes when the tale of adultery begins to unfold. Subtle touches abound, hints that mislead you here and there a-plenty. Finally, the scoring of the film is brilliant, though other than opera buffs may not catch the clues. Setting mostly recorded songs and arias of the great tenor, Enrico Caruso, the lyrical content and the mood of the arias perfectly expand the mood of the film at the moment of action. skillfully returning to developing ""verses"" per se as the lyrics become even more appropriate is a very clever tool indeed. My best example is the recurring aria from ""L'elisir d'Amor"" (Una furtiva lagrima) sung almost painfully slowly by Caruso adds to the viewer's discomfort as the uncomfortable story develops.All in all, highly recommended and a very pleasant surprise!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Flawless Cheat,Being Lucky and Some Weird sex scenes","Story is about a poor boy who came to London for being a successful tennis player,instead he made a romantic,Criminal living. Allen did an outstanding job making the whole story about relationships of an Irish young man with 2 girls,one of them is his wife and the other got a crush on. I think these kind of romantic films should emphasize on the sex scenes which Match point did not,Match point was a PG 13 about life and sex for example when Chris(Jonathan Rhys Meyers)is Doing some massages to nola(Scarlett Johansson),Camera just goes for another angle and break down the mood of that particular scene. Being Lucky a is Prosedure which happened to Chris And i think that was the bright side of the movie because some parts of the screenplay had talked about it. There's a point which is not great,story begins with a Match point stuff in Tennis,it's kind of related to the movie at some point,although it's not. in my opinion The whole thing Ends up in Nonsense,I mean there is not any Moral fiber that avoids me or anyone else to do the same thing that Chris Was idiotically done.and one thing more is Chris and his wife were both boring and played unnaturally,Chloe was senseless and annoying. but in a general look that was the best that Allen could have done and I liked that.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great class analysis in a contemporary noir genre film,"Great film, mostly free of many of the Woody tics that turn off the non-fans. Woody goes to the UK with a story from a film noir enthusiast who's view of England comes from too many Jane Austen novels. At the surface, there is a classic love triangle with the other woman, but the setup of the class dimension gives the film its bite.Rhys Myers' character is the upwardly mobile Irish tennis pro finding his way into the jungle of the English upper class; the crux of the film is that his attempt to solve his romantic problems will end up being practically-motivated rather than achieved through finessing social relations, and we are left to the very end to find out whether or not this is his undoing.Rhys Myers is OK, Johansson brings the screen presence but the reason to watch the film is for the relatively tight plotting (by Allen standards) along with WA's always-excellent eye for the underlying dynamics of sexual attraction and obsession. Much to enjoy in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nontraditional and great because of it,"A Woody Allen film dealing with the meaning of wealth, the standards of living, lust and commitment. The story follows the live of a former tennis pro, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), as he gets to know a rich well-to-do Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris crawls into their lives and in no time at all Chloe is falling head over heels for him, even the father (Brian Cox) likes him and it'd seem that he is set for the rest of his life. And then complications occur as he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), who just so happens to be Tom's intended.Typical setup, but the execution and how the story pans out is anything but. Usually these types of drama try to depict the protagonist as a sympathetic figure. The film usually condemns their actions and indecisions to a certain degree, but they're generally normal, nice guys. Chris on the other hand starts out like that. He seems a bit lazy and aimless at first, nothing out of ordinary, but as the movie progresses, he starts to change, to evolve, to fight for the way of living he has grown accustomed to. And it's an utterly fascinating process, the likes of which I have not seen before.Because in all honesty, aside from the story, this film is nothing new. The characters are fairly normal, though they are played by capable actors and especially the differences between Chloe and Nola are brilliantly portrayed by Johansson and Mortimer. One a seductress, one a nice sweetheart. The filming is topnotch, though nothing extravagant, but it's the story and especially the third act that elevates this film above its peers. I was all set to hate this film by the end of the second act, but then it started. Can't spoil it for you, but remember to see this film through before you judge it.To whom would I recommend this? If you have grown tired of love triangles, if you cannot stand them at all, see this film. It's still a love triangle, but in a way you've never seen before.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen's Hitchcockian Masterpiece,"An inventive variation on Theodore Dreiser's classic 1925 ""An American Tragedy"" as terse and dramatic thriller set in millennial London. Allen's best non-comedic film. Far from a cinematic evocation of Dreiser's tragic saga of Gilded Age class tensions and social mobility conflict, but a highly effective social resonant thriller. In some wats more fully accomplished than George Steven's ""A Place in the Sun.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The work of a genius!,"Woody Allen is a true genius for creating a film this brave. It is a revelation, a film that becomes more unpredictable than you bare to think as it goes along. I certainly did not know how it would end, and I certainly did not think it's genre would change like it did. Never have I seen a film that does that. Woody Allen's screenplay was rich and filled with great dialogue and fascinating characters. Jonathan Rhys Meyers really great, and I do not want to say anything more than I have to, but his character really is something unique. Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance, and she proves she is the best actress out there under 30. I am waiting for her to finally get an Oscar nomination (she deserved one for this). Matthew Goode is becoming an actor I notice more and more. In Watchmen he was great, and in this he plays a completely different characters, he is very smooth and subtle. On a side note, Brian Cox seems to be the actor that is the most low-key, appearing in many films I have seen (but he is always playing a very small role). The film never has a very serious tone, and even when it's subject matter turns dark it stays with the same sort of subtle and light tone, which makes it even more intriguing. The only other film I have seem from Woody Allen was Vicky Cristina Barcelona, so it's second half surprised me. The themes Allen present are insightful, and he has created a true work of genius, which deserved the Oscar for Original Screenplay over Crash.",,Anonymous,Romance
Another Wonderful Woody Allen!,"I was misled by the trailer of Match Point, which overemphasises commercial elements, so that initially I decided not to see this film.Then I feel lucky that I have watched this film. It is actually essential Woody Allen: the protagonist driven by the surroundings, the absurd existing, the mismatch and the black humour. The interesting things are in the languages, a typical Woody's way to make the the unreasonable reality explainable. The originality is satisfying.The cast do their roles precisely, sometimes they look like incarnations of Woody himself. The music and the colour of the film place the story in a nostalgic atmosphere, yet coupled with the reference to a stark urban realities. These bring me a few broadened thoughts which I quite enjoy.In short, a rewarding watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite a good movie but...,"I think this movie is not bad at all. The filming is good, and so is the acting. However, the movie left me a little frustrated because of the lack of realism brought by the end of the plot. I guess that it was necessary for the story. Without that end, the movie would have been too ordinary and lack interest... But the end -I mean how the lead character reacted- is so unrealistic that I kept wondering what was going on in Chris Wilton's mind. What triggered him to do what he did? Did he really keep his peace of mind after what he did?This movie didn't get my complete adherence and that it why I give it a rating of 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amazing, A masterpiece","I went to see this film knowing the ending after being told by a friend, I didn't expect much as I have never been a huge Allen fan, but this blew me away, the way it was written was original and engaging, the music 'clicked' perfectly with the scenes and the cinematography and every performance was top notch and some performances such as Johanssons were the best I had seen from that actor. The script made me feel as if I was there and the actions taken by the characters were interesting and gripping. Allen deserves an Oscar for writing and directing and John Rhys-Meyers deserves an Oscar for his part, what the hell!!! Oscars for the whole cast and Allen!!! One of the best films I have EVER seen without a doubt!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Imagine Crimes and Misdemeanors with a Hitchockian flare and the cinematography of Manhattan...,"To no surprise, Woody Allen has once again created a classic, what is surprising is that the film is set in London.Allen's cinematography captures the city very well, similar to the way he filmed Manhattan. Allen, sets aside his comic mastermind and instead takes the audience into a crime drama through the eyes of a tennis pro who has just moved to London. After retiring as a touring professional, Chris Wilton (as Jonathan Rhys Meyers), has taken a job as a club professional at a prestigious tennis club in London. His friendship with a student will lead Chris into a life of aristocracy, love, lust, and sacrifice. Match Point is a fitting title to the story it tells and Woody Allen has certainly served up a film everyone will enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen Breaks the Serve,"Allen breaks a miserable dry spell with MATCH POINT. Since DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, of 1997, he very much earned the popular criticism of material regurgitation. He stepped outside of his comfort zone and outside of the United States, creating a crafty homage to Hitchcock.First of all, it was nice to see Allen working in London. Among working directors, he is the most capable of capturing the truth in a town. It would eventually come to full fruition in the recent MIDNIGHT IN Paris, but his love for orgiastic civilization translates to film just as well in London as it does in Manhattan.It was in stepping outside of his modus operandi that he pulls out of the rut, but so many of the trademarks are there. The usual preoccupation with fatalism and truth are pinned onto an amiable troupe of Upper Crust Brits. That is, except our protagonist. While Allen is not the only writer capable of successfully building a main character of such loathsome quality, he is the most fancy about it. Chris is played remarkably by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - a casting decision that quite possibly vaulted the picture from mediocrity to definition. His glib manipulation is, at first, difficult to understand. But by the end of MATCH POINT, we are the audience to his every thought. The deposition with the detectives is a fascinating example of filming the thoughts, not the words. We see into his self-loathing and it looks great.So much cannot be said for Johansson, whose struggling actress character was probably looked at with some irony by Allen. She is the archetypal Allen Sexy Nymphette. In a performance that begins with such intrigue and fantasy, it rapidly devolves into a schizomaniacal tour of her body and methods of anger. I don't blame this on Allen. I've yet to be impressed by her, and I am beginning to think that Hollywood feels the same way.Finally, it is worth noting how MATCH POINT is so much of a charming tip-of-the-hat in Hitchcock's direction. A witty use of Checkhov's Gun. A wedding ring MacGuffin. Allen succeeds admirably in imitating the shapes and structures of an inimitable force. MATCH POINT ends up being like a sissy backwards version of FRENZY with much more wit and character. Certainly not Allen's most monumental effort. And not one that demands much rewatching. But it broke perhaps the worst cycle of work by a respectable director. Too bad he didn't sustain the tradition of avoiding expectation.74.2",,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant and emotional film,"More often than not, I dislike Woody Allen's movies. Match Point, however, is a brilliant film. The ""un-Woody-Allenness"" of it that many notice in fact suits it very well. On some level, it's a serious - even disturbing - movie, considering what I felt is one of its main themes -- the unhappiness that lies ahead no matter what the life choice may be. Its somewhat stifling dialogs and acting are possibly intentional and therefore can be ""forgiven"". It's really made up of two films - the lust and affair drama, followed by a Dostoevsky roller-coaster - but it's remarkably consistent, as the deep emotional connection with the characters switches its focus, but does not wane.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good... yet stale.,"Allen's latest offering resembles a celluloid operatic tragedy - the point of which is very poignant; luck is a major player in all things, and the good/bad people involved do not always get what they deserve. Unfortunately, despite a capable cast and director, the execution was somewhat sloppy.The setup, although necessary, seemed overly long and stale; no doubt due to the flat, wooden dialogue that was spoken and made all the more unemotional by having our characters appear 'oh so very classically British' with their 'stiff upper lip' and what not, (although their class was pivotal to the plot). The way the dialogue was delivered, especially by 'Chris Wilton', was straight and obviously scripted - it was as if the characters were reading directly from a script.Things do get better in the last half-hour or so; tempers fray, emotions build and climax, and the ending is very clever indeed. This film is definitely worth going to watch, it will stay with you long after you leave the cinema, yet it is slightly flawed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"I'm an on again/off again fan of Woody Allen's work. I wouldn't say that I'm predisposed to liking his films. I've loved a few, hated some and moderately enjoyed others, while missing several all together. Regardless, the acting in his films does always seem to be exceptional.I just saw Match Point and it's brilliant. And, needless to say, has great performances. Ryhs-Myers and Johansson being the obvious stand-outs. It's immediately involving, has lot's of edge of your seat stuff and has several great twists, all of which are perfectly plausible. This film was masterfully executed. I reserved one star because it is a bit slow in a couple of places though the film as a whole more than compensates for this. Well worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
London no match for New York,"It's a little odd that for the time being at least Woody Allen has transferred his affection from New York to my home town, London. Following Match Point, he's well into his second London film (Scoop), and a third is said to be on the stocks. The point is, he may love London, but it's not clear that London or the UK generally loves him. Yes, they adore the classics, like Annie Hall and Manhatten; but they were never keen on his ""Bergman period"" efforts such as Interiors; and his latest offerings have generally been panned - I had to see and enjoy the bad taste of Hollywood Ending in Paris, as to date (late 2005) it's not been released in the UK.All the signs are that Match Point will be well received when it opens here early in 2006; but personally I wasn't too sure. (Again, I saw it in the French capital, which gets many English-language films before London, and whose cinema scene makes ours look provincial.) It seemed to me that Allen may have been mildly infected by whatever bug caused Robert Altman to make Gosford Park. His film is so, so English, with almost all the characters talking in posh accents, and living posh life-styles (apart from the stereotypically, cardboard police detectives); and if there was even one of Allens trade-mark wisecracks, I missed it.Sure, much of the milieu has to be high class, since a main theme of the film is how far a poorer (though not that poor) chap will go to climb the social ladder; but Allen might have shown a little of London's seamier and steamier side, to complement the series of shots of pristine tourist attractions such as the Tate Modern, South Bank arts complex, ""Gherkin"" office block, and Notting Hill. Overall, the film struck me as rather stilted and lifeless; and if it's Hitchcockian, it's the Hitch of Dial M for Murder.Nevertheless, the film is deftly made and watchable, with more than a few surprises along the way, and all the principles filling their roles adequately, though I wasn't entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as femme fatale. Incidentally, one of the odder pieces of casting is the comedy actor and TV star, John Fortune, as the almost non-speaking chauffeur, though I note he is uncredited on IMDb.Needless to say, since it is Woody Allen, it's a ""must see"" movie; but personally I hope for better from Scoop, and eventually would prefer to see him return to and do his work in the more familiar territory of Manhatten.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody at 70: Opera and Tennis,"Woody Allen's new film ""Match Point"" has five large themes, three of which are among my principal passions: opera, tennis, London, murder, and a thesis that sheer, dumb luck is not only the origin of life, but also its most decisive element.Except for a bit of a sag halfway through it, ""Match Point"" is one Allen's best films, a significant claim to make considering his involvement in the making of about as many movies as his age - an amazing accomplishment for Allen Konigsberg of Brooklyn, born on Dec. 1, 1935.""Match Point,"" about the spectacular rise and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""-like un-fall of a young tennis pro (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, in a career-making performance), opens and closes with Caruso singing ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" it contains a virtually nonstop series of opera excerpts, and its long climactic scene is accompanied by the finale of Verdi's ""Otello."" Why the switch from jazz to opera? ""The story is operatic,"" Allen has said. ""It deals with the kinds of things that opera is so often about: love and lust, passion and jealousy, betrayal and tragedyand, of course, the confluence of fate and luck.""Always excelling in casting (even in his many weaker films), Allen has outdone himself in ""Match Point"" - Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, Penelope Wilton, and others all turn in topnotch performances, almost all playing characters that are different from previous movie (if not stage) roles.Glory be: ""Match Point"" has no whining, no Woody-isms, it may be fully enjoyed by those who have developed a kind of allergy to Allen's increasingly bothersome mannerisms over the years. Almost uniquely among his films, this has neither him nor a ""Woody Allen character."" The tennis is so-so, but London (a new venue for New York-bound Allen) is marvelously real and alive. All this and lots of Caruso - what a treat!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent performances from all bar the leading man,"Match point is beautifully filmed and includes some exceptional character performances, especially from Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer, as well as some very entertaining twists. The ending does start to stretch plausibility but keeps you on the edge of your seat.Unfortunately Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performance is uncomfortable and stilted and his accent a little off. He clearly becomes more comfortable in his role as his character becomes more sinister however I found his performance in the first half very distracting.Despite this match point is definitely a film worth seeing hence the 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Match Point movie review,"Woody Allen's new film Match Point has received a lot of praise and accolades. Most of them are deserved. Most assuredly some of them are not.The movie is the story of the young protagonist, Chris, played by Jonathan Rhys-Myers coming into a world of privilege and circumstance after befriending Tom played by Matthew Goode. Chris begins to date Matthew's sister, Chloe, played by Emily Mortimer and is ushered into the family business. All goes well until he meets Tom's sultry fiancée, Nola, played by Scarlett Johansson. And that's all I'll say in direct respect to the plot.In general, the acting quality leaves something to be desired, though some of the actors give stellar performances. Emily Mortimer gives an amazing performance as the vulnerable and sympathetic Chloe. Matthew Goode also does a great job as the clueless brother, unaware of the storm brewing below the sanguine exterior of Chris. Unfortunately, the film's two biggest stars Rhys-Myers and Johansson, though emphatically beautiful and pleasing to the eye, give robotic performances. Both are unconvincing, delivering the dialogue which, at times, seems just barely memorized before shooting.The film is a little slow to start. The dialogue is not immediately engaging, but what the film lacks in performance is more than made up for in the writing of the screenplay and the cinematography. The film is visually striking from the opening shot. The interiors and exteriors and sumptuous and exquisite.And the screenplay is perhaps one of Allen's best, existentially brooding on the role of luck versus hard work in life. The film is essentially a meditation on which plays the greater role. The drama is heavily influenced by opera with its dramatic themes and plots. The majority of the score is primarily derived from various operas, which helps to enliven the performances when they are a little lacking. The operatic quality also influences the characters and tone of the drama. From the first opening notes, you know that this isn't light fare.The movie moves along at a steady pace and takes its time to unwind. At points, it seems that the movie is merely going through the necessary motions to move the plot along, but these moments are sporadic and short. The tension builds to the very end and just when you think it is over, it's not. The ultimate conclusion left me breathless and (literally) applauding Allen's cunning in creating a movie that glosses over current fixations and taps into more ancient dramas: infidelity, power, the lengths one will go to secure their position and privilege, and the consequences of our actions.I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in quality cinema. I hope that Allen receives at least a Golden Globe, if not an actual Oscar. I am aware of his reasons for using two of today's hottest stars who end up giving only mediocre performances--he wants money and recognition. Who doesn't? Hopefully, next time he can convince his actors to give better performances or just hire better actors, who just might not be as famous.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Effortless direction,"Something of a turning point in the career of the director perhaps. After being ignored in his home country for many years, this new film by Woody Allen is already (on release in Britain) nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Scarlett Johansson).It's a big change for Allen. Gone is the familiar Manhattan skyline, Allan doesn't appear once, there are none of his stuttering lines, NY is exchanged for London's South Bank, and the even the comedy is very between the lines, with nods to Dostoevsky and La Traviata.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays an ex tennis star now making a living as a coach at an exclusive club. There he becomes friends with wealthy socialite Tom and ends up marrying Tom's sister (played by the lovely Emily Mortimer). Except he has become smitten with Tom's fiancé, played by Scarlett Johansson, a failing American actress. Helped into the English upper classes, he is loathe to relinquish his lifestyle, even when he becomes bored with his wife. This is comedy in the Shakespearean sense, the whole story revolving around the importance of luck, yet it soon escalates into equally compelling tragedy.There are few recognisable Woody Allen characteristics - possibly the author's detachment from his subject matter - and he makes the mistake of letting one of the characters call her father 'Papa' (which I doubt if anyone in the English upper classes does these days) - but it does not quite descend to the out-and-out thriller we might have anticipated from the trailer. It retains its aloofness to become a meditation on the importance luck plays in the lives of everyone and whether it is more important to be 'lucky' than 'good.' The sexual eroticism - between Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson (who turns in yet another outstanding performance)- is unusual for Allen but, like the ensuing violence, is never allowed to detract from the cerebral content. It's a thought provoking study, but the question it poses is not exactly earth shattering.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Honest, shocking and very interesting","I saw this film last night and I really enjoyed it.It seemed to me to be a commentary on several things, one being luck and one being morality. Both of these things seemed to dictate quite a lot of the lives of the two main characters. On the one hand, it made it perfectly, brutally honestly clear that one's success in life depends quite a lot upon how lucky one is. While hard-work is necessary, one will not get far without being lucky enough to have a few doors opened to succeed. A beautiful illustration of this is drawn throughout the film using a tennis metaphor.Another point made seems to be that, no matter how lucky you are, when you go against your conscience, you set yourself up for eventual unhappiness, no matter how lucky you have been.I agree with the poster who said to go in without knowing much about the film. I've seen some early reviews that spoil quite a few things. Be warned that it is a long film and slow at times -- but worth it.If I had only a few words to describe it, I would say it was very honest, very shocking, very sad and very beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen,"I don't understand why people keep saying that his latest movies lacked some type of Woody Allen genius that was running through the veins of his other films. They are all spectacular. He didn't run into a dry spot creatively in the last few years. He's a genius and people seem to forget he knows what he is doing and no one who spends any time on this side could ever match him. People have said anything else and celebrity were lackluster movies. Celebrity was hilarious. Anything Else was only the beginning of Woody's new style, which I have no idea as to where it originated. Just some impromptu spout of imagination and all of a sudden he's movies have some of the best cinematography in film history. That was followed by Melinda which was just amazing. He isn't making movies in order for his audience to be on the edge of their seats. He is no panderer.Those films were both fantastic. And now match point.

"Woody Allen, still fizzling out","Admittedly, I had high hopes for this film after it rose to Allen's third ranking effort on IMDb's ratings. But ultimately though, I don't think this film is all that good. Like the rest of his later films the characters are flat and unappealing. For the first half of the movie we seem to just drift through the life of Chris seeing random episodes at a very ambiguous pace.I think Allen has always done this in his films, but in his great one's he has amazing character dynamic that makes them fun to watch. There was none of that here. And I also regret saying this, but, Scarlett Johansson cannot act. And I can't say much for Rhys-Meyers. I feel their awkward and off-key deliveries voided the movie of any graspable feelings. I could tell both were acting and so I couldn't figure out what kind of people the characters in the story actually were.I must give Allen credit for this fact: He has no other film like this. He definitely has explored to territory here in terms of the way he tells a story. The film has a seriousness I have't seen since Interiors, but it still can't even be compared to that. Though I felt Bergman was strongly echoed in this movie. I appreciate his ability after making a string of duplicates since the turn of the century to re-invent himself, I just wish the story would have been more powerful.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tales of the unexpected,"A bit surprising how fast Nola (Scarlett Johansson) is introduced at the very beginning of the movie. I found that the story develops with exactly the right pace and always keeps up a certain tension. In addition it always seems that a real story unfolds that at no point obviously leaves from reality into fiction. This movie does not need any kind of extreme exaggeration - must be ""typical"" British understatement. Together these elements build up a credibility of the occurring events that is in a way frightening. Any part of this movie could happen at any time. I give this movie a very high rating because few movies tend to inspire discussions after watching - this one does.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Getting what you want...but at the expense of true fulfillment,"Writer-director Woody Allen, so proficient in comedy, has also been comfortably at home in straight dramas, and ""Match Point"" is probably his meanest dramatic movie to date--and arguably his most polished. A young, well-heeled British executive, married but carrying on an affair with an American girl, finds himself in an unwinnable situation when his girlfriend tells him she's pregnant; she wants to have the baby, naturally, and stubbornly expects him to leave his wife (and, consequently, his cushy position in life). Allen doesn't view the participants in this deadly game as immoral; just the opposite, in fact. He sees the frailty of the human heart--and in the tug-of-war between love and lust--and uses this to paint a deliciously involving portrait of 'ordinary' lives turned inside-out by lies and deception caused by romantic indiscretion. The film gets you in the gut, although the concluding events, engineered to make Allen's point about getting one's way at the expense of others, are not especially convincing. The performers are nicely-attuned to the material and the narrative defies going over-the-top, which is remarkable considering where Allen takes the characters. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good movie weak story,"If you still remember Woody Allen's movies just forget it while watching this movie because it has nothing to do with his style or his favourite themata. We are thousands of miles away from a movie built along a series of witty, rich and vivid intellectual dialogues and monologues. We watch here only a serious psychological drama. It's doubtless a movie made with great mastery upon a weak and trite story. As a matter of fact we have already seen lots of movies and read lots of novels about the parvenu who climbs the social ladder by beginning to marry a tycoon's daughter and getting a good job in one of father-in-law's companies till his love affair with a woman out of his new acquired social ring comes to compromise everything, leading from a certain moment on to dangerous crossroads where dramatic choices must be quickly made. We remember for instance the excellent ""Room at the Top"" (1959) by Jack Clayton with Lawrence Harvey and Simone Signoret.

The Best Film of 2005,"Many will claim to be disappointed that this is not ""a Woody Allen movie."" Such is the remark of a lazy viewer. Nevertheless, it is a film made by a competent director who pointedly executes each element. The actors, all typecast, establish themselves early on in their respective parts; and from the beginning, the ball is in motion. What is a tennis game after all? A series of strokes that change the inertia of a ball. What is a match point? It's the play where the score is either reset to deuce, or upset making one player victorious. This one play is the thin thread between the end or another beginning.Chris (Rhys-Meyers) knows the rules of the tennis game and so he knows that every play in life rests in the hands of luck. And he is lucky, and arrogant enough to deem ""lucky"" substantial enough an identity. Nola (Johansson) is his pawn, and with a little luck, she is usable and disposable. And the kind but wealthy British family that Chris has infiltrated are also unlucky enough to be used by this tennis pro.Even though Chris is an adulterer, he is not ""a Woody Allen."" In fact, Woody Allen, as a character, is nowhere to be found. And what follows from that understanding is a fantasy: a fantasy in which luck rules, and if the protagonist is lucky, he can have it all. He gets his lust and greed fulfilled and he lives happily ever after, if...This is not a Woody Allen movie, but Woody Allen has crafted a perfect film. The dialogue hits every note, the actors play their games with each other, each with his or her own motivation toward a single prize, and the cinematography captures long and meaningful observations of their faces, thus their deepest thoughts and feelings. Watch Allen's other non-Allen movies like ""Another Woman"" and ponder the similarities to his hero's work, the films of Ingmar Bergman. Consider that the best work of a filmmaker may be the one from which he or she is able to extract his or her own ego. Think about what it felt like to see your first tennis match. Did you cringe in your seat wondering if the wind might blow luck in the other player's direction? Hats off to 2005 for a terrific year in cinema!

This is nothing like anything he has made before, or since, and is fantastic.Great plot. A slow-burner that starts as a harmless relationship drama and gets darker and deadlier the further it goes. This is not to say that it is dull to start off: even before it ramps up it is a great character study.Some excellent twists towards the end with a superb ending.

"Woody, go a different direction, like Manhattan.","I'd read some good reviews for Allen's new film and even seen a few friends who mildly suggested it. I was not prepared for the flat, slow, boring, by the numbers script, that Allen lays out in Match Point.It's as if a guy suddenly decided one day to write a show about 'rich people', but had never met one outside of a drawing room comedy. Allen simply has no interest in a film noir or erotic thriller or whatever you wish to call this trifle. The lighting is never moody, on the other hand, it's bright and sharply lit. The tension is certainly lacking in the acting. It all seems to be happening on a bad, old TV show. Wow are some people jumping up and down about the film? I think maybe the fact that Allen tells a story, albeit a very structured, limp one that he has no feeling for. It remeinds me of Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick couldn't or wouldn't shoot in NY, so he just built in the UK. Allen goes to the UK, but he might as well have stayed in NY. It's a crazy movie. The audience is always nine steps ahead of the doddering characters. What exactly is Brian Cox playing? He got rich by constantly giving away his money and having zero ability to gauge character? It's like a character in an earlier, funnier Allen film, suddenly forced to play it straight. In fact, the whole movie is like that, and wow, what a letdown that is.Allen was once one of the funniest men to ever make a movie. Now, like so many other directors, he's just plodding along, making dopey cardboard ones.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most amazing movie,"This movie is really amazingly poetic, wonderful dialogs, great shots, and beautiful story.As I left the theater, I was in a WOW state. In the theater I was in, an applause was heard directly after the last shot. Woody is once again a master story teller. He sticks to the basics of screen writing and creates a great setup-fall and strong characters who speak without speaking. Notorious for casting beautiful sensual women, Woody Allen movies are known for alluring the audience into a paradise world with a drop of insanity in the honey filled lake.

Great!,"I had no idea what to expect from a Woody Allen film but this was brilliant. It was not your typical love story. The twists were great and the was comedy perfect.I definitely give it a thumbs up. I loved the British accents. They were understandable. The script was so modern and realistic. Everything is authentic, nothing fake about this film. Who are these actors and why aren't they working more? The entire cast had a great chemistry that made the film work. The ending was definitely a surprise as was the entire plot. It unfolded with brilliance. The end justified the means. It started slow but I loved every minute of it. The settings were great, almost refreshing. I loved the foreign setting. The set design was awesome. But let's not forget the symbolism. This film is so metaphoric almost like poetry. It makes you think about karma and decisions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's most daring film,"This movie has many brilliant moments and ideas. But I think the best part of the movie is the first hour and 15 minutes. The romance of the first 90 minutes paved the way for what would be a violent and thrilling second half. Woody Allen shines in romance and storytelling, but that's also why I didn't find the last 30-40 minutes to be that compelling. When I saw that this movie was considered a 'Crime-Drama-Thriller' movie I got excited. Those are my favorite movies. But in reality its much more a 'Romance-Drama' than anything else. There is barely any crime, and you don't see much of it on screen. I almost wish Allen stuck with his guts and brought the story a different way and kept it in his Romance wheelhouse. Nevertheless, as any other Allen movie, it has great characters. And characters that you don't particular care to root for. That's always been one thing Woody Allen does best. He makes movies with humanized characters and that are very relatable to modern day problems going on with relationships. 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' and 'Blue Jasmine' are perfect examples of that. With 'Match Point' you don't know who to root for. In fact, I particularly liked Emily Mortimer's character much more than Scarlett Johansson's. Even the title character is quite annoying at times. But overall the film as a whole is very good. It's a really solid drama that could have been brilliant as a whole if the last 40 minutes could have stayed within the mood of the first 90 minutes. Still a very enjoyable movie. 7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb Film-Making,"""MatchPoint"" is film-making at its best. This is the triumphant return of Woody Allen to the forefront of America's best film directors after a drought of inferior films lasting several years. Smartly-paced, excellent script, beautiful art direction (London has never looked better) and wonderfully performed by a superb cast, this is Allen's finest film achievement in over twenty years.This ranks amongst Allen's top films (Manhattan, Interiors, Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters).When watching it there is not a scintilla of evidence that this is a film by Woody Allen but there is abundant evidence that this is a film by a master filmmaker.For its genre, they don't make films better than this!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unconvincing on every level,"In this film Woody Allen does for present day London roughly what Dick van Dyke did for cockney chimney sweeps in Mary Poppins - that is, strike an almost unending series of false notes. Jonathan Rhys Myers plays Chris Wilton, a tennis pro whose every gesture suggests privilege; we are asked to believe he comes from a poor Irish background. The Hewitts, the family with whom he becomes involved, do not work as individuals, and do not work as a family. So many little things aren't right. Mrs H dresses like a woman a couple of social classes below her, for example. The portrayal of business life is also a travesty. Mr H has the general demeanour of an antiques dealer, but the plot has him run a string of companies (called Hewitt Inc, though of course British firms are plcs) where he has no problems installing his son-in-law and giving him the sort of car and chauffeur that would not normally go to anyone below board level in a FTSE-100 firm - if then. Daughter Chloe simply sets up an art gallery in one of the smartest parts of London - Emily Mortimer who plays her and comes from this sort of milieu really should have known better.As for the plot, others have commented on its shortcomings. Still, however hard to believe, it did carry me through to the end. And some of the cast and settings were nice to look at, and the sound track wasn't unpleasant - though I couldn't really work out the justification for it. I can imagine at least two levels of awfulness worse than this, so I'll give it three out of ten. (Why, incidentally, is there no zero ranking?)",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
great movie!,"great movie, with an unexpected ending! i actually went to the movie because i heard its a tennis related movie and I'm a tennis player! but this movie offers so much more than that! great chemistry between the cast and the story was well organized and presented... i give props to Woody Allen! its a must see movie, for men and women! i love the fact that the movie wasn't predictable at any point, it made it more exciting all throughout, also the soundtrack was very well suited to all the scenes.

'Fatal Attraction' for the new millennium (sort of),"DIRECTOR/WRITER: Woody Allen. RELEASE DATE: January 20, 2006. GENRE: Psychological drama. RUNTIME: 2 hours, 5 minutes. LOCATIONS: London and the English countryside.THE PLOT: Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro from Ireland and Nola (Scarlett Johansson) a struggling sultry actress from Colorado; both are (unconscious?) social climbers attempting to marry into a rich English family. Chris marries Chloe (Emily Mortimer) even though he passionately lusts for Nola, the latter whom ultimately breaks from the family and the UK. When she returns to London Chris reignites their passion, which can only lead to tragedy. And only luck can save him.""Match Point"" is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all it's moronic trappings -- there's no quick editing, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, ""Match Point"" is movie-making based simply on good writing and cinematic storytelling. The first hour plays out like a nigh tedious drama but the second builds momentum like a snowball slowly morphing into an avalanche. Be forewarned, if you don't have the stomach for an hour of soap operatics avoid this movie. For those who do, however, ""Match Point"" is rewarding, unpredictable and original.Underpinning the drama is the theme of luck. The film starts out with a tennis ball hitting the top of the net; at that point the ball will fall on one side of the net or the other, depending solely on the luck of the player. At first, this seems unrelated to the story, but wait till the end and you'll see everything connect. It's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction much more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions.I sensed a somewhat sad emptiness in the characters; most of them are neither likable nor unlikable (although Chloe is super-sweet albeit naive), they're just human beings trying to find meaning and fulfillment despite their physical riches or lack thereof. Their innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of religious faith and they search for meaning in the secular world of Dostoevsky, Sophocles, the visual arts and Verdi's operas. Only the mother and main protagonist, Chris, come off unappealing; the mother is just annoyingly snobbish, whereas Chris is so blatantly selfish and flat (not to mention devious) I find it hard to believe any of the characters in the story would find him appealing, let alone worthy of marrying into the family and becoming a prominent part of the business. But this just reveals that they're out of touch with their ""spiritual compass.""What's ironic is I strangely found myself rooting for Chris in the final act, which doesn't make sense since I'm completely opposed to his (lack of) character and what he does (I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the film). This testifies to Mr. Allen's greatness as a filmmaker. Or maybe I temporarily rooted for him because, regardless of the outcome, I realize no one ultimately ""gets away"" with anything in life -- lucky or not.The love, I mean lust, scenes between Chris and Nola struck me as ultra-steamy and authentic. This is exactly how a man and woman in illicit passion would secretly go at it. Case in point: the 'rain scene' is potent. Needless to say, ""Match Point"" is a must for Scarlett Johansson fans.As to the ""Fatal Attraction"" reference: No, you don't have to worry about psycho slasher clichés. ""Match Point"" is smarter and more subtle than that.GRADE: A-***SPOILER ALERT***Someone offered this insight about the story: ""Tennis is a game designed by a creator with a set of rules. You win the point if the ball goes forward or lose the point if the ball falls back. The ring doesn't bounce forward across the other side and into the water and you immediately think Chris has lost the point and will be found out. But since life itself has no designer, and there are no true rules, it turns out that it was actually good luck for Chris because the ring was found by a bum with a history of petty theft and therefore he, not Chris, was thought to be the murderer.""While this is an intriguing insight and legitimate interpretation, it doesn't rule out a Creator or the fact that there are intrinsic moral laws in the physical universe. For instance, if there are no such laws why does Chris almost have a nervous breakdown after committing the murders? After all, if no such laws exist then it's impossible to break them and meaningless to be upset about it if you do. Why does he see non-literal ghosts of the victims? Obviously he broke an ironclad moral law and was now experiencing the guilt thereof. Yes, luck worked in his favor at the end of the story and this is in line with the insight of one of the wisest persons who ever lived: ""I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all"" (Ecclesiastes 9:11).Yet, this doesn't preclude the existence of God or that there will be a judgment day in the Supreme Court of the universe. As Christ said, ""There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.""Simply put, the idea that evil people ""get away"" with their crimes is an illusion.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dreiser via George Stevens and Woody Allen,"I scanned the comments and saw some references to Shakespeare and Greek tragedy, and I believe there was a glance at Dostoevsky, but it seems odd to me that no one noticed the obvious look-back to Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" or the play based on it, or the movie adaptation entitled ""A Place in the Sun"". But the plot, with minor variations, is basically right out of that source, commingled with a bit of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" (telegraphed in the film by Chris's reading). Allen has often been heavily allusive in his scripts, to Ingmar Bergman and others, but I can't recall any other of his movies where virtually the entire plot seemed borrowed and from a fairly obvious source. P.S. Apologies to Roland Zwick. Upon perusing the comments more thoroughly I see that he had called this movie Woddy Allen's version of Dreiser's AN American TRAGEDY some time ago. Sorry about that.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
My Comments on Match Point-Very good film,"If I didn't know this was directed by Woody Allen in advance i wouldn't have been able to tell from the movie. Although I'm not a WA aficionado, I do enjoy most of his films but this one, perhaps because it is not set in NY came across in a non-Woody way to me.I thought the acting was very good on all parts. Scarlett Johannson especially stood out with her fine performance. She seems to be nailing the femme fatal role these days as she's getting all of those types of parts.I don't like to give much away so I will just say that the plot moves along well, it is interesting & compelling. Some unexpected surprises.If you want a good drama with dark overtones & fine acting then I highly recommend this movie. ***The cinematography is quite lovely in this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining & thoughtful,"I haven't seen many of Woody Allen's movies, this was actually my third, after the classic Annie Hall & the more recent comic mystery Scoop, but i can already say that every single movie was entertaining & yet thoughtful from a certain angle, harmonizing the two is a difficult task for most story tellers, but Woody Allen does it with the ease of a maestro. The way the story builds, from innocence to sin & then an almost surreal sequence toward the end of the movie, is intriguing to watch. Its never predictable, even if anyone watches the movie knowing how it would end,they wouldn't really know or believe how it goes. Full entertainment, yet not cheap or conventional, neither is it over intellectualized. This is good cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Way too slow,"The story concept is a good one, and the ending is nicely twisted, but the plot moves way too slowly. Regrettably, most of the story is quite boring. The characters are not nearly complex enough to require the time devoted to their ""development."" Actually, they don't develop much at all. This movie has been described as ""Hitchcockian"" and the final act is indeed suspenseful, but Hitch would not have nearly put me to sleep for the first hour.Overall I would recommend this movie, but it is in no way a masterpiece and I would warn the viewer to resist giving up on it since the ending redeems the film. There is no doubt that this would be a far better movie if it was a half an hour shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Huge disappointment....,"I cannot believe that this film has gotten such positive reviews, at least here in Europe.Positive thoughts first: The acting is above average and the cinematography is nice. The film bears all the marks of an experienced director.But: The story is trivial to the point of being downright ridiculous! I had, of course, heard a lot about Woody Allen, but knew very little about his work. I expected an interesting, clever, challenging plot and was thoroughly disappointed. The story is about as interesting as your average Baywatch episode. An unhappy marriage, an affair bound to go wrong, jealousy, social class tensions and a weak main character are the ingredients in a storyline that offers very few surprises.I would claim that most people above the age of 20 has personal experience with most of the issues portrayed here.Granted, the ending is more colorful than the bulk of the movie, but unfortunately, I had lost all interest about halfway through.So why does everybody love this movie?

Within my top five best Fims,I am sorry but 10 is too low a score for this fantastic film. What a script! If ever Woody Allan gets depressed again he should read these comments and think again. Masterly - words are not enough. Matthew Goode - What a find. Fantastic presence on screen - should be the next James Bond - unfortunately I do not have a daughter - but if I had he could marry her tomorrow. The Cast throughout were beyond reproach. I have seen some good films in my time - but this was fabulous. Congratulations to all involved. Worthy of the highest praise. It is far too good to talk about the plot - just go and see it. I shall tell all my friends - this is the first time I have ever made a comment on line but believe me it is a pleasure to write.

"Finally, something DIFFERENT","I was so pleasantly surprised by this. I went with really low expectations, since I think Woody's recent (as in last 10 years) films have been horribly tired and half-hearted. Even the camera-work was beginning to look the same all the time,This is a Wooody Allen film without the clichéd old Woody Allen-isms, and a real pleasure to watch. London seems to have invigorated him. And, the plot is actually interesting - his most interesting since Crimes and Misdemeanors, I think.Emily Mortimer was particularly good as the wife.

Pretty good movie,"The movie moved really slowly at first and I started getting a little restless, but once it picked up the pace it made sense why the beginning moved so slowly. It was really setting up what was going to happen later.I am really glad that Woody Allen did a film noir. He did a great job. I love old Woody Allen movies, but he hasn't done anything spectacular in about twenty years. This movie was a breath of fresh air.Jonathan Rhys Meyers was decent...not great, but he did pull it off. Scarlett Johanssen is one of the most over-hyped actresses of the day. She didn't bring much to this role and her acting was so poor that I found it infuriating. She'll probably continue to get roles due to the fact that she's pretty, but she was definitely the weak point in the movie. Emily Mortimer was great in her role as Chloe. Completely underrated. The other supporting actors blew the two leads out of the water.I recommend the movie, but for the engaging storyline. If you want to see amazing theatrical performances you might not be very impressed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Allen is back, Marilyn Monroe too","I've been an Allen fan for many years. Like many others I was suspicious that their best years were gone. It's not true. The best Allen is back and renewed. All the elements that make a good film are here. The description of the characters, of the city, the music. All is really superb including the leading role of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, a great surprise and all the supporting roles. Emily Mortimer as the perfect wife is fantastic too. Scarlett Johansson deserves a commentary apart. What can I say about her. She is different interpreting a kind of Marilyn Monroe. Absolutely sexy but a looser. It's very remarkable how a 20 years old woman plays such a difficult role with such a maturity and power. Really incredible. The genius of Woody Allen achieving a kind of merge between Hitchcock and Bergman has to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good,"To put it simply, Match Point really surprised me. I normally am not a fan of Woody Allen's writing style (besides when he shines on dialouge, something hard not to love). I went into the theater expecting a film so annoyingly bad that I could joke about it later with friends. (I came to this conclusion after reading some summaries, tag-lines, and quotes.) Instead, I had the pleasure of seeing a movie with an array of relatable characters and situations along with a great ending.The overall story of the film makes it a definite must-see. What really turned me on to the story was the ending. Even if the rest of the story was bad, the ending would have made up for it. Even though the acting, dialouge, and shooting style were all boring and sub-par, I still consider this a great movie because of the ending.I admit that the acting and dialouge are bad. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers always seemed like he was about to cry regardless of the emotion of the scene. I have a bias against Scarlett Johansson (mostly because of the Island) that made it hard for her to be convincing to me. Both characters were rendered even worse by the bad dialouge which was either over-full of British colloquialisms or just hurriedly written.The cinematography was bland. It was very static in more ways than one. It was static as in still, without many notable moving shots. In addition, it was static as in unchanging, unreflective of the feeling a shot or scene was meant to convey. One part of the cinematography that I did like was that many of the close-ups were very sharply focused which helped to keep the attention on the words (the very poorly written words) of the characters. These didn't make up for the otherwise boring shooting style.Despite the technical and personnel flaws (I really enjoy phrasing it in this way), Match Point is still very much worth seeing because of the relatability of the story. The themes present are so universal that they overshadow the bad dialouge and acting. The movie also ends in an amazing way that has to be seen to be fully understood.If you don't get a chance to see this in the theater, you need to rent it and watch it with some friends with good senses of humor.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's Opera,"Well, after waiting for a year I finally saw it yesterday. I had not read any review or even watched the trailer so I didn't expect anything (by the way, forget the trailer, it has nothing to do with the mood of the movie).I found the music selection of the film (all Opera) was related to the structure and mood of the movie: passion, betrayals, murder, etc. Mr. Allen presents a movie which I think is different from the rest of his movies (or at least is not the typical Woody's film and not only because it has no one playing his part). Much more drama and thriller than comedy. I would consider it an evolution from Melinda & Melinda.It's not an easy movie, it is not easy for me to say how much I liked it, not yet, that's good. I would like to see it again. Great acting and remarkable photography by Remi Adefarasin.Not too many people have seen it, the ball has just hit the net and it's still flying.

disappointing,"A very slow paced story- the pace does allow detail, and thus perhaps better than average USA film, but here it is a little shallow, and a little laboured.The production is a bit careless. e.g. a lingering shot of a multi million dollar view from the happy couples apartment - shows a barge on the Thames that is stationary, (highly unlikely in real life).The story is a dark one, introspective, and perhaps a little pretentious. Woody gives us a clue when the main character reads Dostoevsky.Maybe a project to keep Woody occupied for a few months, but not a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has it dated itself?,"I can't recall the first time I saw this but I believe it was close to its original release date.

It actually boggles me that this was / is Woody Allen's favorite film he ever made.I'm not one to say what's what because these people are doing and I'm just writing critique..... but that's also what this aspect of the app is for.I found ALL of the acting to be awful, and I do believe a lot of it had to do with cadence, timing, and acting. The acting chemistry for all of the characters was not good. I didn't believe any of the ""love"" conversations. It felt like a B acting class.The story could have been better and the acting phenomenally more so. That's my synopsis.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
wow,"On Thursday January 12th my mom brother and I decided to go to a Double header of movies first we went to see Rumor has it and then to the movie Match Point. After seeing the trailers and previews for Match Point I could have cared less whether or not I saw it because (A) It was rated R and rated R could mean horror and I don't handle horror very well and (B) because it thought it was going to be a stuck up, stuffy,arrogant tennis movie(eww) not my kind of movie. But i decided to see it anyway. I am so glad I did. Match point starts out as a tennis ball going back and forth over the net and the narrator saying something to the effect of how it is usually more import to be lucky then be good because you and have lots of talent but without lucky you will have a hard time going anywhere just then the ball hits the net and goes up in the air and the ball could got over the net for a point and win or it could fall and you lose the match there it is up to luck the ball fall to the other side of the net and luck went the shooters way. Now I wont spoil the movie because it would be a shame for you to know what happiness going into the movie but lets just say being lucky will come into play again in a BIG way later in the movie! One thing I loved about this movie is that it kept you guessing the whole way. Another thing i loved it the movies ""Unperiditcability"", and how you think luck went against Chris(the main character) but we find out that luck couldn't have been more on his side. It turns out the movie has really nothing to do with tennis with the exception of a few scenes where the characters are hitting the ball back and forth or and occasional reference to going to play a tennis after work or something but thats about it. There is a famous saying "" you can't judge a book by its cover"" now that is true about 30% of the time for me for example If i see a book's with a picture of an old man lying out for his teeth on the cover of a book and the title is the autobiography of Bill Clinton I GUARANTEE you i wont like it so there for i just judged a book by its cover and in this case i was right(the 70%).The title Match point is part if the 30% that i agree with the statement this title (Match Point) does this movie NO JUSTICE. When I Hear the title Match point and you look at the cover I would think this movie is about tennis and it really wasn't.This movie was a suspenseful, action packed, thriller and when i hear match point it implies none of those. So pay no attention to the title when considering going to see this movie.After you see the movie Match Point you will have no choice but to agree with me when I saw that this movie was by far the best Woody Allen movie EVER!Kelly (age:14)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More of a double bagel,"Only tennis fans will get that line, but then this film uses tennis, both as a minor plot point, and as a metaphor for life's unique twists and turns. In fact, the whole premise of this film is that so much of what happens to us happens by complete chance that it is much better to be lucky than good, a phrase no small number of tennis players and commentators have used over the years.""Match Point,"" Woody Allen's new film, has gotten hailed by some critics as a return to form and by others for breaking new ground, at least for Woody. Writing for once not about neurotic Manhattanites, Allen this time has moved his serious comedy of manners to England, where it belongs. The plot, in a nutshell is this, failed and somewhat lazy tennis pro Chris Wilton, through a number of strokes of luck, falls in with a very wealthy family that takes a shine to him. Before long, he's headed to the alter with the family's pretty, charming, but slightly patronizing daughter, and also on his way to a new career as a pampered corporate executive, although exactly what business he is in never seems to be spelled out.That's pretty much the story for the first half of the movie, nothing but dumb luck taking the tennis pro, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, to the top, at least of the corporate rankings. Where things start to get sticky is when he falls for the girlfriend of the son of the family, an American actress named Nola. He even has a one afternoon stand with her, boffing her in a wheat field of all places in the middle of a heavy rain storm. But he goes ahead and marries the rich girl anyway, but then his brother-in-law dumps Nola and Chris finds himself obsessed with her. That leads to lies, deceptions and the finally, a major crime and then some.First, lets deal with the acting. Rhys Meyers is fine as the ex-tennis pro, although not exactly dynamic. But then, his part doesn't call for it. Had he been depicted as the poor boy from Ireland who fought and maneuvered and clawed his way into the upper ranks of London society, it would have been a much more interesting film. Instead, he's depicted as a guy who was too lazy for the travel and hard work of the ATP tennis tour, so he becomes a teaching pro and the world just becomes his oyster. Again, that's the premise of the film and it might even be true in some rare cases, but it is not particularly exciting to watch on screen. It's also all been done better before, specifically in George Stevens version of ""An American Tragedy,"" which was released about 1950 as ""A Place in the Sun."" In ""Match Point,"" there is nobody to cheer for, because the central character is not only a less than admirable character, but he's also basically a reactive, rather than an active character. Luck may exist, but it isn't all that interesting to watch as it unfolds.Supporting character Mathew Goode is good and Emily Mortimer in some ways delivers the best performance of the film as Chris' spoiled rotten, wife. Then comes the matter of the highly talented Scarlett Johansson as Nola, the American actress who for some unexplained reason, thinks London is the center of the film world. Even after being dumped by her boyfriend, she keeps coming back to England. Never mind New York, or, dare we say the word, Hollywood, she thinks all the acting jobs are in England.Johansson delivers one of her weakest performances in this film, starting off fairly strong, but playing the same note throughout the film. And when you think about it, her cynicism never really rings true from the beginning. Why would a girl about to marry into such a wealthy family be so negative all the time. Couldn't an actress do a little more to win over the skeptical mother-in-law?********************spoiler alert*****************Then comes the big finish, in which Chris, who has had a torrid affair with Nola, finds out she is preggers and is about to blow his cover. So he shotguns both her and her neighbor to death and tries to make it look like a burglary gone bad. No, you didn't misread this. That's what happens. And as improbable as that is, the story gets worse. The subsequent police investigation of a particularly brutal double homicide quickly clears Chris. Even though there is enough evidence to make this a case right out of Detective 101, the cops just let him go. Apparently in London, no autopsies are performed on the bodies of murder victims, which of course would have shown that Nola was pregnant and of course, Chris was the main suspect. Secondly, even after he admits to the police he was having an affair with Nola, they never ask about his alibi for the time of the crime nor apparently make any effort to check it out.I would guess the Bobbies never solved a murder case, which must come as something of a surprise to every English detective from Sherlock Holmes to Robbie Coltrane's character in ""Cracker.""At any rate, I don't think Woody Allen is back and I don't think he made his case for everything being all about luck. I didn't feel lucky wasting my time in this film.",,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie I have seen in a long time,"This is the best movie I have seen in a long time, and I have been seeing a lot of movies lately, both new and old. It's riveting- I was chewing my fingernails throughout the entire second half and so was my friend.The movie is a real surprise considering Allen's recent offerings.

Please go see it immediately.If you're not a Woody Allen fan, and I'm not crazy about most of his films either, I would see this film anyway...you won't be disappointed.

Bum note,"This film is very funny, but most of the humour derives from Allen's ignorance of British culture and mores and was presumably unintended by him. You wonder why his British actors didn't intervene to save the script from some of its worst howlers. Nobody ever refers to the Royal Opera House Covent Garden as 'The Royal,' and the operas that are performed there are not accompanied by a piano - presumably the budget for the film did not extend to an orchestra? It's also very unlikely that the patrons of the opera house would be seen dead at an Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical, as his productions are considered the height of naffness amongst most London classical music lovers, especially ones who read Dostoyevsky. Either Lloyd-Webbers's company has coughed up the money for a product placement or he has been given this free publicity because Allen thinks American audiences will know who he is. As for the holes in the plot...others have already done justice to them.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Luck, in all its glory","Match Point is the story of luck in our lives, and how it can alter any outcome so easily. The first line of the film says: ""The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life."" And so the film is.The brilliance of this film was unexpected, even though I do take pride in saying that I have loved EVERY Woody film and have seen all of them while owning most. My two cents: don't read reviews, go in not knowing a thing. It is too brilliant to be spoiled by outside minds. See it for what it is and be blown away. The shock and heartbreak and laughter and power go along way with this one. Don't be surprised if it takes home the Best Picture win this year, for it is Woody's finest accomplishment since Deconstructing Harry, and on a completely different level.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's best work in years.,"Match Point is about as good as a Jilted Lover / Fatal Attraction style movie could ever hope to be. It took the genre, and achieved its goals with remarkable mastery. I WISH that Hollywood producers and directors would take a page from Woody's book.Moral? There is no justice. There is chaos. Events occur, and we might be lucky enough to nudge them one way or another, but ultimately we are at the mercy of life in all its complexity. And in the end, you might just catch a break and everything will work out to your advantage. Or you might not catch that break. And everything that you did to prepare comes down to that moment - that chance - whether the ball bounces over the net or back.Allen writes dialog like no other, and this movie displayed his talents eloquently. Mixed with his masterful direction, he controlled this story completely, trickling out the character and situation development so slowly, and with such care, as to leave you constantly hungry for the next moment. And by the way the movie crawls, but wonderfully. How can it be so suspenseful?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Ripley. Not Gosford.  Not very good.,"Woody Allen may understand the accents and cadences of life in Manhattan but he sure as hell doesn't understand London. This film needs a good script editor, preferably someone who understands how the moneyed English classes act, think and speak. The overall effect is lumbering and at times, laughable.I've never been convinced by Jonathan R-M and here he is not quite right as a Ripley-lite character except in his relationship with the wonderful Scarlett J who is by far the best thing in the film.The overall look is like a 60s film, full of London buses, minis and Kings Road chic. Here we get the minis on every street (heavy product placement). All that was missing was a friendly uniformed policeman, a London cabbie and a Pearly King and Queen.This doesn't quite hit the depths of Sliding Doors (Jeopardy!) but it makes Austin Powers's view of London look very sophisticated and three dimensional.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not even worth a DVD rental,"The only reason Allen continues to be able to fund his so-called movies is because there are New Yorkers who continue to see his movies out of pity for the loss of his supposed ""genius,"" or they are new to the City and feel that an Allen movie is the obligatory trial by fire to becoming a bona fide Gothamite.Saw Matchpoint last night in a packed theater and was absolutely astounded that anyone would think this film had any originality. It was like a glossy regurgitation of a film major's senior project, which only family and friends are forced to endure.It was lamentably long and so predictable to be excruciating. If I wasn't sitting in the middle of the row, I would have left the movie. Allen managed to capture English eccentricities with the capital U of Mitford sisters' fame, which made the two hour (???) torture just barely palatable (immediately offset by the fact that I had paid $11 for this drivel).Matchputrid will now be my litmus test to find the pretentious bores hiding behind their pseudo-intellect and their gushing declarations that Allen and, especially, his newest film are why New York is the center of their sad universe.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Almost all great natural performances, wonderfully written and unnoticeably directed.","I liked it from the opening moment, I really liked the titles before the movie, it was sort of a sign that this is different from the other movies you're watching, this harks back. The short introduction after this starts off the film nicely, and ties in much later on. It gives a little overview of what the film is about and how luck plays through our lives more than anything. Simply filmed and simply written, and yet it has a great impact both then, and retrospectively.That was it, I started to like the movie already, and then Rhys-Meyers (Wilton) began talking and I felt my face screw up involuntarily. His acting voice was stilted and seemed very nervous, it just didn't sit right at all and gave quite an unnatural performance through the first half of the movie where emotions are checked and played low. It had more effect than just an annoyance though and for much of that first half I was continually pulled out of the movie because of the performance, yet there were performances that grabbed me by the throat and pulled me right in.Johansson (Rice) doesn't start off that strong, she gives a plain but good performance, it's really in the latter half of the film that her character turns around and becomes impassioned, giving some depth to her performance. She is undoubtedly a great actress.Mortimer, Goode, Cox and Wilton provide the entire Hewett family which Wilton slowly becomes a part of, and they all provide such real and utterly believable performances.Something I noticed about the entire cast, apart from Rhys-Meyers, is their natural performance and well delivered lines. For these performances just seemed so realistic that you are drawn into them and into the heart of this family without any difficulty. It's even in subtle lines and gestures made throughout the movie as the family members and friends interact with each other, the dialogue is natural and flowing with characters often talking over each other as in real life. Throughout the movie there's perhaps only one line and one scene where the feeling was dropped for me, other than Rhys-Meyers first half performance of course.Yet when the movie progresses and the mood changes, Rhys-Meyers starts to come to life and the stilted and awkward delivery fades in favour of a confused, bored and childish man. A man filled with more emotion and passion than previously seen, and it's here where we really begin to see the driving force of the movie and where I felt myself becoming more and more impatient and anxious as to how events would turn. In fact I wouldn't be stretching to say that I felt a growing dread, particularly when the family were together.Wilton happens into the Hewett family and becomes a part of it, entering into a rich life in all aspects of the word. He is very privileged and becomes very accustomed to it. However something is either missing from his relationship with his wife, or he's merely wanting what he doesn't have, whichever is the real reason he becomes a passionate affair which spirals out of control.It's during this affair where I felt the writing, direction and the performances pull together superbly and gave me these particular feelings. If I was to be in an affair I can imagine that it would be exactly like this (to a point in the story obviously) and you can imagine the conversations, phonecalls, confrontations, lies and hard choices being almost exactly as they are on screen. I totally believed in what I was watching at this point. When the family met together with Winton carrying on the deceit, often swapping the role of husband with lover and moving directly to a scene of a clandestine meeting, those feelings of impatience, anxiousness and dread built within me.Somehow I engaged with his character, despite the earlier negative feelings to the performance, and felt as trapped and panicked as he did. Then when the family were together I realised I had fallen into the bond of the family, and with the fantastic performance of Mortimer as his wife, making me feel nervous and concerned about what would happen to them and how they could be hurt if the affair was made public.There are some other very good smaller roles here from British actors that you wouldn't have expected either. Some of these were surprising to see, and all gave very good performances, albeit briefly.The ending is very interesting, and takes a very strange turn. Luckily there's not much notice of this and gives you a nice surprise, at which point the movie does take a different turn. It's through this ending that the opening introduction returns bringing back the notion of luck and how it might, or might not, turn against you.A couple of scenes here nudged my belief in the character of Wilton slightly through Rhys-Meyers performance and lines, however it wasn't enough to damage the end of the movie which is decidedly different and quite bold in it's final moments.Throughout the movie, at key points, Allen utilises arias as score and also scene transitions, and in the second half these moments really come into their own when you do start to feel you are watching an operatic tragedy. It's here where I do feel that this style came through more as a storytelling device than a background score.Overall I would recommend this movie, despite a feeling of the first half being too long and of the negative aspects Rhys-Meyers performance, it's an engrossing and interesting movie, one which does manage to engage and affect you right till the closing scene. Performances in the film are very strong, and had me dragged right into the movie into the minds of the characters, all except Rhys-Meyers who I found struggled with his performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Film,"Best Woody Allen film ever! Even if you're not a Woody fan you'll be totally immersed in this film. I saw it with someone who doesn't particularly enjoy Woody's films and at the end he gave it a ten out of ten. It's nothing to do with New York angst and introspective cerebral activity. It's a good involving and exciting story with a beginning, middle and end.It's set in London which I feel very pleased about, being a Londoner and all, even though I now live in France (why, I hear all you Americans say).Great supporting cast - I almost didn't recognise Brian Cox as he has lost so much weight and Penelope Wilton - as our hero's mother in law - is as impeccable as ever.See this film - you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Allen film since Crimes and Misdemeanors,"I'm amazed at how much hate this movie has inspired from people. If I had to guess, I'd say it's from either a. Too high of expectations or b. It's becoming hip to say that Woody Allen is over the hill. While Allen's films haven't been as strong the last few years, its ridiculous to think that he's lost it, and if you want proof check out Sweet and Lowdown or Melinda and Melinda. That said, to those still willing to give the Woodman the benefit of a doubt, Match Point is his absolute best in years, probably his overall strongest movie since that masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors (Or at least since Bullets Over Broadway). The plot concerns a young former tennis player who manages to slink his way into a very wealthy British family, getting himself a cushy job, a beautiful wife, and a lavish lifestyle to boot. Despite the fact that he's achieved so much, the young man gets bored quickly, and for more excitement he enters into an affair with his brother-in-law's former fiancé. Things quickly go wrong though, and soon the man's comfortable and secure lifestyle is thrown into jeopardy. In the hands of another director, this may have turned into another Fatal Attraction ripoff. Woody is too mature a filmmaker for that type of thing. Revisiting themes from Crimes and Misdemeanors, Woody again examines how one who has achieved an ideal lifestyle will react to the threat of losing it all, even resorting to murder. Allen also takes it one step further, by examining just how much luck determines our fate in life. Overall, a great film with wonderful performances all around. Just be careful not to come into it with the wrong attitude, or you may end up like some of the other posters on this site.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Misdeamanor, surely","The casting is excellent both for the main actors and for the supporting role. Chris Wilton almost never smiles, thorn and dramatic figure. He discovers that he has a dark side of this personality which ruins the unbelievable luck that his other personality attracts. Nola Rice puts a brave face on the fact that she inspires only lust and not love, until she cannot take it any longer. This a film about discovering who you really are. As in Dostoievsky's story, and because he escapes justice from the humans, whatever he does, Wilton knows he never find any peace: this is the worst of the punishment because he understands he will be confronted with what he did every day of his life on earth, and beyond.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of my Woody Allen favorites,"Woody Allen is amazing in the sense that he writes the same story for decades with slight discrepancies and varying plot twists. Therefore it is no surprise that once in a while these stories would resonate with any viewer. In the case the viewers have the patience to watch them all, that is.Anyhow, Match Point is one of my favorite Woody Allen movies. For some reason it struck a chord, whether it was the circumstances i was in or the situation it depicted.At the time i was interested in business in a broad academic sense of the word. An the fact that a business degree might merely be a ticket to ride the train of the big bucks has been underlined by the movie. The main protagonist enters that world due the fact that someone with a position liked him, not because he has any knowledge about anything relevant.The impending global financial crisis that ensued a couple of years after this movie was one of those moments where viewers might even claim how Woody Allen predicted it all.On a more basic level, the sexual tension between Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and his ambivalence towards Emily Mortimer were depicted amazingly. Otherwise some thoughts on crime and punishment are showcased, a somewhat omnipresent motif in Woody Allen's work.To sum it all up, if you like the movies by the same author, you'd like this one. Otherwise you might be looking for another movie...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A little long; a bit too much opera, but absolutely worth it","Match Point is an excellent new film from Woody Allen. While not exactly a classic on the level of some of 70's-80's run of films, this one will surely stand out among much of his recent output.The setup is pure Woody -- a love triangle where the protagonist falls for his fiancée's brother's fiancée. Like a train wreck, we cannot turn away as we watch Chris, a former tennis pro hurtling towards his destiny. His fate, brought about by his own passion-clouded choices winds up being one in which he eventually must choose between staying married to the woman who is ""cute"", ""nice"", sensible, and most importantly, filthy rich and (along with her Daddy who employs him) helping provide him with an affluent lifestyle he could hardly afford otherwise; or escape from his marriage to be with the ""other woman"" that he can hardly contain his passion for.As the latest in Woody's long line of ""femme fatales"", Scarlett Johansson certainly fits the bill in this film. Clearly, Woody relishes having her on camera, which lovingly lingers over her features; and while she smolders in many scenes, she never quite ignites in any of them. In fact, she seems to be the only character who exhibits any passion at all in this screenplay -- most other characters barely show any emotion (though this might be a reflection of Woody's depiction of the Brits, who are notorious for keeping their emotions bottled up).Set in London, this film is a first for Woody, since nearly his entire output has been set in Manhattan, and (as it's often been pointed out) New York City is often as much a character in his films as any of the actors are. London does seem to play a similar role as New York City has in the past for Woody here -- he seemed to enjoy playing the tourist, taking us to a number of well-known tourist locations (including a key scene in the Tate Gallery).Similarly, another signature of Woody Allen -- the great classic jazz that he features in the soundtrack (probably related to his vision of classic New York City, whose history is inextricable from jazz history) has been supplanted with a soundtrack stacked from beginning to end with classic opera music (I guess Mr. Allen must similarly equate London with opera?). In fact, the opera soundtrack is featured in an extremely prominent manner in most of the key scenes. Personally, I felt like he went overboard in his use of opera music -- I'm not much of a fan, and while I can appreciate others' enjoyment of it; it's just not to my taste.My only real complaint was that the movie was significantly longer than most of Woody's films, and did get a touch tedious in the middle (Scarlett's character Nola has a number of repetitious scenes) before a major plot twist shifted things into high gear. A few nips and tucks (along with a little less opera) would have made for a sublime movie with a bit faster pacing and could probably be done without losing any narrative flow.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"MATCH POINT...A London Thriller, but is it really a game???","MATCH POINT takes Woody Allen in a new direction in his films and presents a London setting that is out of this world. Exterior locations add to the suspense which continues to build in the film, and the use of interiors with rich set decorations and the flat that overlooks the Thames really add to the luxe look of MATCH POINT.A tremendous cast headed by the talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as Chris, and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson as Nola, drive MATCH POINT to its exciting conclusion. My only regret with the film is that I wish I could have liked the characters more, and had more empathy with their individual journeys. They came off as a bit too posh, spoiled and hedonistic in which Rhys Meyers character offers the final conclusion to this MATCH POINT.

Why you should and shouldn't see Match Point,"Chris (Rhys Meyers) seems then to be caught between passion (is this love?) for Nola (Johansson); and affection (or is this love?) for Chloe (Mortimer) and the comfort, safety and status of membership in the Hewett clan that comes with her. I say seems, because for most of the film we don't know what he's thinking. We see him with Chloe and with Nola, but we wonder what he feels as opposed to what he thinks each of them wants to hear.Woody Allen is no stranger to navel-gazing characters trying to figure out what they really want, but Match Point is a departure for him: if there are other films by Allen that take dark turns into Hitchcockian deception and betrayal, I haven't seen them. It's well done--as clever as some of the rotund master's films--and executed with style.Why you should see it: You like Hitchcock's films, but you've seen them all and Hitchcock died years ago, so you'll settle for Hitchcockian films.Why you shouldn't see it: There's no nudity and no blood on camera.

"Luck and Fate at an Unlikely Crossroads in an Elegant, Crafty Movie by Woody Allen","While it's true that Woody Allen has had an erratic record as a filmmaker of late, there are definite pleasures to be had from his recent work such as 1999's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", 2000's ""Small Time Crooks"" and 2005's ""Melinda and Melinda"". However, what makes 2005's ""Match Point"" different from the usual Allen product is that it is an incessantly addictive film ripe with melodrama and suspense with little of Allen's angst-driven comedy. There are elements that will remind long-time Allen aficionados of 1989's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and 1993's ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", but at the same time, the film seems also inspired by Anthony Minghella's 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", George Stevens's 1951 ""A Place in the Sun"" based on Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"", and Adrian Lyne's 1987 ""Fatal Attraction"".Set in contemporary London, a first for Allen, the intricate plot focuses on a failed pro tennis player, Chris Wilton, who lands a rather cushy job as a coach at a fancy private club. Through sheer luck - a consistent theme throughout for Chris - he befriends wealthy Tom Hewett and by way of an evening in the family's opera box, begins dating his guileless sister Chloe. Insinuating himself into the family with ease, including securing a nice job at one of the companies owned by Tom and Chloe's father, Chris becomes obsessed with Nola Rice, Tom's seductive American fiancée, a failing actress of whom Tom and Chloe's mother vehemently disapproves. How they all intertwine is what makes up most of the action, and the story works like an ever-tightening noose around Chris's actions. Even though it plays out like a smart thriller, Allen brings a decidedly fatalistic tone that introduces greater issues of fate, retribution and justice. The themes don't weigh the film down unnecessarily, and in fact, the film's last half-hour brings all the higher-level issues together in a way that makes the conclusion resonate with unpredictable force.As Chris, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers brings an effectively opaque manner to his character that makes him neither sympathetic nor villainous but rather leaves him precariously off-balance to the viewer. It's a smartly rendered performance that teeters toward the predictable only toward the very end. Although her first scene at the ping-pong table seems a bit excessive in introducing her character, Scarlett Johansson plays Nola with sensual fervor and palpable emotionalism, especially as her character spirals into darker psychological territory. Their scenes together are surprisingly carnal for an Allen film. Since they carry out the greater themes of moral vacuity, the remaining actors seem to be there simply to support the other end of the spectrum though not in predictable ways. For example, Emily Mortimer manages to play the unsuspecting Chloe not as a victim but as someone unwilling to confront her own unhappiness given her aggressive and rather selfish desire to become pregnant.As embodied expertly by Brian Cox as the overly generous father, Penelope Wilton as the overbearing mother and Matthew Goode as carefree Tom, the rest of the Hewett family are equally clueless about what is going on around them. However, that's exactly Allen's point in his parable-like script as he makes shrewd observations about the power of luck and our profound inability to control our destinies in making one's way toward a desired life. In a manner that recalls Gordon Willis's work in Allen's ""Interiors"", Remi Adefarasin lends an immaculately cool sheen to the cinematography, and the upscale world among the London social elite is captured almost too adroitly with Jim Clay's manicured production design and Caroline Smith's tasteful set decorations. In place of his usual jazz-infused soundtrack, Allen uses old opera recordings of Caruso singing Bizet, Donizetti, Rossini and especially Verdi as a smartly evocative background. This is strong work from film auteur Allen well worth viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely BRILLIANT,"This film is so tremendous that anyone who dares sneak in a spoiler should be summarily shot! Woody Allen, despite his widely published indisgressions, is a genius to have written and directed this most potent story of how luck plays such an important part of our lives. I sat there mesmerized for the entire 124 minutes, intoxicated by the ingenious story that builds and builds and has the type of crescendo conclusion to knock one out of his seat.

It contains every element of a super super flick. Great story, superb acting and an ending that, as I mentioned, will knock one out of his seat.

A poor central performance,Woody Allen at his worst I'm afraid. The main problem with this film is the unconvincing central performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers - and you would have thought a director of Allen's stature could have coaxed a better performance than this. Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer are good but wasted next to Meyers who seems to be trying to be the kind of Englishmen Americans imagine rather than going for any veracity.The plot itself works in that disjointed way Hollywood deals with time and has some merit with the final scenes at least raisng the interest but the changes in tone make the film inconsistent - an odd mix of uptight stage play and supposed thriller.If you want a dark treatment of relationships over time you would be much better off going for Closer.Disappointing.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Held My Interest Throughout,"This is easily Woody Allen's best film in years.....in spite of (and maybe because of) being his least typically ""Woody Allen"" picture. Perhaps filming in London gave him a different perspective. It reminded me of ""Room at the Top"", several Hitchcock films and Allen's own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"". So many movie plots today are formula. You know the entire story after seeing the preview. ""Match Point"" kept me guessing until the end. There are so many ways the story could have gone or could have ended. The characters are all believable and intelligent..some of them clueless but believable. Performances are excellent all around.

Outstanding!,"""The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life.""Those words, spoken in the opening narration, are the premise for Woody Allen's powerful thriller ""Match Point."" Everything that happens in the film is based on luck, whether good or bad, and how the characters respond to it.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a retired tennis pro who gets a job teaching tennis at a posh country club in London. There he meets rich kid Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), and they become fast friends. Chris falls for Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), but then he meets Tom's fiancée, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson), and an affair begins.To say more would be unfair, but let's leave it at saying that Allen knows what our expectations are, and plays them against us.""Match Point"" demands patience, and for the first hour, is rather slow moving. However, this allows us to intimately know the characters. But more importantly, it allows Allen to pull us in without us really noticing. Allen sets the stage early, but he turns the wheels ever so slightly, so that by the time the film really gets going, we're completely hooked without realizing that Allen was drawing us into his web.The acting is the most crucial part of the film. Woody Allen creates complete, three-dimensional characters on paper, but it's up to the actors to bring them to life. Fortunately, Allen has gathered a first-rate cast that is more than up to the task. Scarlett Johannson continues to impress as the seductive but unstable Nola. Nola could have been a one note plot contrivance, but with Johannson's performance (helped along by Allen's brilliant script), Nola is refreshingly real. Emily Mortimer is one of the most underrated actresses living today, but thankfully her performance in ""Match Point"" changed that. Chloe is an optimist who is completely in love with Chris, but she is completely oblivious to her husband's extracurricular activities. Matthew Goode shines as the immensely likable, but unintentionally snobbish Tom. It's no surprise that Chris would take a liking to him. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton offer solid supporting turns as well, though their characters are strictly supplementary.But this film belongs to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He got his break playing the soccer coach in the international hit ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" but here he is allowed to display his true range, and his performance is superb. He may not be present in every scene, but the whole film revolves around him and the decisions he makes; some of them are beyond his control, but others determine the course of events. This is a man who is held hostage by the decisions he makes, and desperately tries to find a way out from the unforeseen consequences. It is always a risky endeavor to have a single actor to carry the film, but Rhys-Meyers is more than up to the task. It is appalling that his work was unrecognized by any of the major awards.This is the first Woody Allen film I've seen. Apparently, Allen is known for his comedies, but if anything, ""Match Point"" proves that when it comes to film-making, Allen has considerable versatility. His script is brilliant, and his direction is not far behind. He is a master of developing characters, but some of the scenes are cut a little too abruptly. However, these are small blemishes on an otherwise superb production.""Match Point"" demands a lot from the viewer. But if you're willing to give it a chance, it will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointed,"Was I the only person who was disappointed in this film? The movie is such an obvious attempt to recapture the narrative and sexual tension of ""A Place in the Sun"" that I am surprised Woody Allen got away with it. The scene around the ping-pong table in the beginning (by the way, how many British aristo families play ping-pong?)is a weak imitation of Montgomery Clift and Liz Taylor around the billiards table.Woody Allen is free to cannibalize his own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" but George Stevens (director of ""Place"") and Theodore Dreiser (author of ""An American Tragedy"" -- the book on which ""Place"" was based)are probably spinning.Also, the film is about 30 minutes too long. If Meyer's cell phone went off one more time, or if Johannson screamed ""But you said you were going to tell her!"" once more, I was gonna scream.",,Anonymous,Romance
Some negative marks,"Since all the comments here have been very positive - and you may read those splendid reviews first - let me give a few negative marks that I'm surprised few people seem to have given.It is difficult to believe Rhys-Myers' personage is capable of deluding his allegedly intelligent wife, while keeping his lover hanging on the telephone. You wouldn't give him that credit. - It is even harder to believe he has been a professional tennis player, holding his own against Agassi or Henman. His being a pro player wasn't necessary for the plot, so I wonder why they insisted on having him display his mediocre tennis skills. - While the movie does a very good job in giving us the feeling of boredom and superficiality that govern the posh atmosphere he's gotten into, several scenes take simply too long. - Finally, I couldn't bear with the tension building and hardly ever resolving, but that may be a strong point of the movie as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
!!Chapeau!!,"I watched this movie yesterday and after a night I am still impressed, which usually is a great gauge for me to rate a movie.The highlight first: The ""Ring-scene"" is an outstanding cinematic moment, including my personal reactions and thoughts about it in this second. I will never forget this.Of course the movie is not perfect. Scarlett is probably not the most impressing cast for her role, because after her impressive opening scene, she acted a bit shallow and predictable. Also it has some few boring minutes in the middle, which are by far outbalanced by 98% of the rest.Thank you Woody for this impressive entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Help!  I need a spoiler!,"I went to the late late show last night and HAD to leave the theater thereby missing what happens after they read in the papers that Nola was murdered, I saw up to when Chris looks at the tennis bag behind a column near the dining area. Someone please tell me what happens after?????Also was anybody else upset to see the movie go the way it did? And was anybody annoyed at how Chloe was portrayed so unaware of her husbands whereabouts? And you know the father although well meaning must have had some doubts about Chris straying which is why he kept adding the responsibility to tie him down further with the things he became accustomed to.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would you rather be lucky or good?,"This movie took me by surprise. I'm a big Scarlett Johansson fan so I figured I'd see a nice little Woody Allen comedy drama with Scarlett being as sexy as one role could contain -- and I got that -- but there are so many more layers that continue to pile up as the movie goes on. Once the real action starts -- or perhaps I should say the real suspense -- it never lets up and it kept me quite literally on the edge of my seat.On the other hand the movie is really quite funny. From the simple jokes -- like the confusion between ""Wok"" and ""Work"" which seems designed for English speaking audiences outside of Britain -- to the more intelligent jokes which can only be understood properly with an overarching view of the entire situation -- like the ""Powerful serve"" line, which is as funny as it is because of the complexity of which Chloe is totally unaware.Just let yourself fall into the traps each character (particularly the four main characters) sets for themselves and your bound to get lost in the little world Allen has set up. Every shot is beautiful and a witty comment on its own so if you're open to it you will enjoy this movie as much as I do. I am waiting (quite impatiently) for someone I know to see this movie so I can discuss each scene for hours and hours -- the complexity in their faces alone! Oh my, go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smooth but Shallow; Exists to Serve Its Trick Ending,"""Match Point"" is smooth but shallow; its main reason for existing seems to be its trick ending.The trick ending is interesting, but it would have been more satisfying had it come at the end of an hour-long television mystery, rather than a feature length film, which should have, but didn't, delivered more depth and range.""Match Point"" consists mostly of shots of attractive, well dressed, upper class Londoners having polite conversations in stunning London apartments, cozy country estates, restaurants, and upscale art galleries.This is all very well done. It's smooth and slick. Fine direction, naturalistic script, perfect sets.Jonathan Rhys Meyers is first rate. His charisma, complexity, and star power, and his combination of tender, young, humanity and brutal contempt, brought to mind Laurence Harvey in ""Room at the Top."" If you want a voluptuous temptress who will threaten a marriage and slide from irresistibly attractive to shrill and creepy, you couldn't do better than Scarlett Johanssonn.There is extramarital sex, handled very discretely. We've seen this material -- man cheats on wife and begins to panic -- many times before. The movie really needed to treat it in a new way to really come to life, and it didn't.Near the end, a murder is committed, and the film attempts to address issues of human character, destiny, and meaning. Here the film falls short.I won't reveal any spoilers here, and I won't reveal the trick endings. I will, though, talk a bit about the murder and the murderer.I didn't believe that the character that the movie created would commit the murder he committed. The film is bumblingly obvious in its efforts to set this character up as a highly ethical, very decent, young man. He reads great literature; he insists on picking up the tab at lunch.Otherwise, he's a bit of a cypher; we really don't know anything else about him, except that he's a highly ethical, very decent, young man.In other words, the script uses him as a plot device. When the script wants him to be decent and ethical, he is made to appear decent and ethical in painfully obvious ways. When the script needs him to commit a murder, he commits a murder. The script wants to shock us, and so it creates this unlikely about-face.The script wants us to believe that any one of us could commit this same murder. Baloney. I will no more commit a murder like this than I will be president someday, and neither will you.The murderer's friends and family also make the film completely unbelievable.The murderer begins acting strangely. His behavior would set off alarms in the most simpleminded of people. And, yet, though the murderer is surrounded by very, very sharp and successful international businessmen, people who make millions before breakfast, they *never suspect* his heavy sweating, his sudden, unexplained departures, transparent lies, emotional outbursts, twisted schemes, etc.The script wants us to believe that any of us could be a murderer without our peers realizing it. It never makes this idea believable.The script wants us to believe that the murderer believes that committing a murder is his only route. But everyone in the murderer's world supports him, loves him, forgives him, dotes on him. He is handed money, and jobs, and love, and forgiveness. In that environment, it would be much easier for the murderer to solve his problems by any route *except* murder.""Match Point"" is just not believable. Thanks to tabloid television, we've all had murderers in our living rooms. The murder committed here bears some resemblance to the Scott Peterson murder.Thanks to the years-long, multimedia, dissection of Scott Peterson, and other murderers', characters, we know more about murder, and murderers. We know about their narcissism, and their bizarre warning signs. None of that insight has been incorporated into ""Match Point."" Ultimately, in spite of its slick and professional sheen, ""Match Point"" is hackneyed, unbelievable, and boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow.,"I Just saw the movie MATCH POINT. The movie absolutely shook me to the core. It was the complete opposite of the film CRASH. (which I thought was overrated). The movie got me thinking that things DON'T happen for a reason. I hope this is not true, but it sure got me thinking. Maybe , that we as human beings operate on impulse, ambivalence and random luck. The lesson I have learned from Match Point is to listen to your heart in a rational manner, not an impulsive manner. Also, if you have good luck in your life, recognize it,!!! Because luck is completely random. ........ G-d I hope that things DO happen for a reason, I hope ,I hope!......... but after seeing this film maybe they don't!!!! ?

Good film; too bad it has an unnecessary anti-Christian remark,"I haven't seen a Wood Allen movie in years; I guess it's my personal protest against his affair (and marriage?) to Mia Farrow's adopted daughter. I've always thought that Allen is a sick man; but, no doubt he's also quite talented.This movie is a bit slow, but offers some interesting twists. The movie starts by referring to one rather being lucky than good, and no doubt our main character reveals on multiple occasions how luck can be quite beneficial.The one thing I didn't like was a totally unnecessary anti-Christian remark: at dinner, a remark is made about someone loosing their legs and then finding Jesus; the response was that it wasn't a fair trade, and laughter followed (from the characters, not the audience, fortunately). Why? Woody Allen, who is SO sensitive about being a Jew, can inject an anti-Christian comment, that was (a) unnecessary, (b) served no purpose), and (c) was offensive in what otherwise is a decent movie. Fortunately, it was the only such remark, but I guess just reinforces the fact that Woody is, I guess, anti-Christian. The only answer I can come up with.Would I recommend the movie? Yes, it was quite good (I gave it a 7). And, offers a lot to reflect upon following it, which I quite enjoy. Too bad his anti-Christian sentiments had to be revealed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
So disappointing!,"As a long time Woody Allen addict, I never thought I would complain that he had made a bad movie, but sadly that day has arrived. I heard him interviewed on the BBC saying how easy it had been to relocate from his familiar territory in New York and the Hamptons to London and the Home Counties, and I suspect that is where the problem lies. He has delivered a shallow, picture postcard view of England, and an outsider's half-baked idea of social class in England. As a Londoner, I say that if he would stick to the NY settings he knows so intimately, we Brits would continue flocking to his movies and loving them. What's worse (and probably connected to the first problem) the acting and direction feel painfully slow and stilted. And why, in the scenes at the Opera House, were the performances accompanied by a piano, not an orchestra? Would the budget not stretch to paying the orchestra? A trivial point, perhaps, but it distracted me. Redeeming points: a nice performance by the lovely Scarlett Johansson and an interesting plot twist towards the end. But I have rarely left a cinema feeling so deflated!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A new kind of Allen,"If you like production of Woody Allen you will fall in love with ""Match Point""! I'm a big fan of Allen. His films contains so much ironic humor and great dialog that you cannot help but admire this 70-year-old funny little man.I was surprised after seen ""Match Point"" because it represent a different kind of Allen. The irony was there but instead of raving comedy he gave us some completely different. ""Match Point"" is a story about love, passion and coincidence. Ex-tennis professional Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Myers) gets caught up with intriguing affair with his brothers bride Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). New heat is more interesting than his life with his wife Chloe (doll-faced Emily Mortimer. The passion becomes so powerful and overwhelming that it will have a huge impact on what will happen next.The film is a different kind of Woody Allen because his known set Manhattan/New York has changed to rainy London. Allen expands his views, and the result is one working combination of new locations charm and variety. That fact made ""Match Point"" even more likable.After 70's and 80's strut with great actors like Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest and his ex-spouse Mia Farrow it is a blessing to see Allen directing rising young stars. We have seen Diane Keaton's face so many times in his older production that it is fantastic to see that he haven't lost his touch with younger stars either.The end of the film was so striking that we laughed and could not believe the irony of being at right place at the right time. Ball is definitely back at this old saxophonist's court! What a work of art! Match point!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Breathtaking, Surprising","The first time I watched Match Point I found Jonathan Rhys-Meyers too cool, too unemotional, but the second and third times I watched the film the grand subtleties of his performance became more evident. He does appear aloof, too smooth, always spot on with the correct response...but the cracks in his polish show through more and more until the climax of the film where he reveals his inner life before smoothing it over again. He shows great promise for the future as a top actor. He is, of course, stunningly attractive, is everyone else in the film. The visual control and setting are masterful and surprisingly different from Allen's previous work. He displays an astounding degree of departure from his familiar style in a highly successful way. There were traces of comedy throughout but they were displayed through the characters' English humor rather than by situation or dialog. The story line if fantastic as well - the script is as polished as a diamond bracelet. Quite the powerhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Only a partial success but still interesting and engaging on the whole,"Chris Wilton is a former tennis pro, who was a regular on the circuit but never really good enough to get anywhere in the game. He retires into a coaching job at a club and meets the wealthy Tom Hewitt. Through him he meets Tom's sister Chloe and also Tom's American fiancé Nola. The latter he finds sexual exciting and dangerous while the former he finds ""nice"" but available. With Eleanor by his side Tom finds opportunity and advantage entering his life and it is a matter of time before he marries her, while also starting an ill-judged affair with Nola.It is fashionable to moan about Woody Allen's output over the last few years and this is perhaps understandable but for me Match Point is a commendable, if not perfect, film from him that doesn't sit with his usual genre. There is no laughs to be had here, no character for Allen or even a character like Allen but it is similar in regards its exploration of love, lust and money. The setting in the English upper classes makes for a cold setting that suits the relationships, which are as much about position and breeding as about genuine love. In this regard the film is engaging as we not only have a love triangle plot but we have questions of what we would do, the power of those at the top, the desire to stay on top and the practicality of relationships. It is longer than his normal work but Allen has no problem filling it with material that I was surprised to find him wholly responsible for writing.It is not perfect of course and the very cold edge does mean that the fire of passion at the end might leave some viewers disbelieving. Likewise the speed with which it is all sown up might seem all a bit convenient to some, even if I felt it a fitter comment on the nature of power. The cast mostly work well with the material despite the fact that I personally don't care much for either of the leads. Meyers is suitably conflicted between lifestyle and love. I did feel his range was limited though and did think that someone better could easily have been cast. Likewise with Johansson, who is very playful and does pretty well with the later emotion but yet never made me shake the idea that she is here due to her fame not her talent. Mortimer is solid as is Goode, Cox and Wilton; although mentioning the last two leads me to mention that the film also contains minor turns from Kaye, Fortune, Salmon, Bremner and Nesbitt  none of whom are ""bad"" but their presence was a distraction that the film could have done without and I have no idea why so many famous faces were cast in minor roles; Allen might as well as set off bangers and fireworks at each showing if he wanted to distract the audience that much!Anyway, despite this and the cold, slow pace, the film is engaging and interesting in its themes. In terms of story it doesn't totally work towards the end but up till then it is questioning and interesting. Not to everyone's taste and only a partial success but good to see Allen expanding himself and doing interesting work.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Different from usual Woody Allen, well-made, but bland","The movie is apparently written and directed by Woody Allen. It did seem rather different from anything else I've watched of his; somehow it brought the Hitchock Presents short film series to mind in how they seemed to be have been made with Hitchock's advice, but without him being very much involved personally. This could be an explanation, or perhaps WA is exploring new directions - or possibly he did this kind of thing before in a movie that have not seen.The movie is paced amazingly well - the visuals are not breathtaking, but they are not the important point. The important point is the characters. The acting is great throughout, and although perhaps we see too much of the protagonist altogether, the supporting cast never fails to deliver and come off as truly genuine and complete characters.The following, why not directly spoilery, will help you guess at some events before their occurrence.The story is reminiscent of Crime and Punishment in some ways, with the obligatory Dostoyevsky references and heavy opera music. It is extremely easy to follow as everything is relatively subtly hinted before hand. The climax to the actual crime follows a pattern: the protagonist just keeps on going, saying: I decide I want to do A. To do that, I'll have to do X. So he does it. When circumstances change, he never considers maybe doing something other than A instead. A is what he had decided to do, and A is what he will keep on doing.There is a brief passage in the movie where he discusses whether he wants to continue with A or not - and from this discussion he immediately realises that he is going to continue with A. And when something gets in his way, he will stop at nothing. And thus the crime is committed.The inexorable progression towards the perpetration of this crime mystifies me completely. The character's actions were simply not believable. This is not a problem with the acting, but with the script. And with a story centered around 'real' characters rathern than space/action heroes, one expects a certain realism for character motivation and plot development. Unfortunately, this was completely lacking in this movie.So: pacing, acting, music, all excellent. But plot? Abysmal.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Match Point"" is Hitchcock-cum-Dostoyevsky and fantastic new territory for Woody Allen.","""Crime and Punishment"" is familiar stomping ground for Woody Allen, but every other element to ""Match Point"" is foreign. The setting, London, is literally foreign and the melodrama built into a domestic thriller is equally new for Allen. The subject matter of infidelity, highly reminiscent on ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" is typical Allen, however, and his new spin on it incredibly satisfying.The film has been criticized for its setting and Allen's poor representation of Londoners. While the depiction of the locals and the locale is indeed clichéd, Allen has no interest in portraying realism in this film. Hitchcock is notorious for saying, ""Reality is something that none of us can stand, at any time,"" and Allen runs with this idea from Chris Wilton's (Jonathan Rhys Myers) ridiculous Lacoste and Ralph Lauren attire to his wife's (Emily Mortimer) painfully yuppie fanaticism with hideous art. There are no double-decker buses, but everyone rides in black cabs. The viewer should not despair at the dubious placement of the Houses of Parliament across from Wilton's flat; it is all part of Allen's way of playing with our expectations and sense of justice.The entire Hewett family is just a piece of the scenery. They are as flat as can be (although they are entertaining to watch). They serve to make us identify with and like the enormously unlikable Chris Wilton. The only other developed character is Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), whom, significantly, we first see playing table tennis against former tennis pro Wilton. Her white dress hardly indicates innocence as it recalls Lana Turner's dress in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" She is the American blonde femme fatale, but clearly outclassed at the ping-pong table. What are we to expect? Allen is surprisingly deft with his command of a thriller. He avoids cheap ploys standard to infidelity flicks. The suspense does not come from Chloe's (Wilton's wife) growing suspicion. In fact, Allen's script hardly contains any suspicion on the part of the Hewetts. Standard to suspense movies is the waxing and waning of tension through situations where the lovers could get caught. For instance, when Chris and Nola kiss outside of the box at the opera, the viewer expects someone to come out or expects them to have to explain their absence in some way. Instead, the film cuts before any resolution is offered, leaving the tension high. Similarly, after Nola and Chris allow their passions to best them in rain on the countryside, the viewer wonders how they will explain their sopping and muddy clothes to the Hewetts. We can only assume that Hewetts are as fantastically naïve as the film skips any possible confrontation and cuts to another day and scene entirely. The viewer is allowed no reprieve from the tension as Chris continues to commit daring acts of stupidity and infidelity. Due to the lack of other developed characters, we must root for him and like him despite his slimy nature.The only hope the viewer has for Chris is Allen's initial metaphor of luck. As adept at cheating as Chris may be, he admits that there are moments where luck could take him either way, to salvation or damnation. Playing over his sexual romps is incessant opera music, following his view of life as a great tragedy with no god, only pure chance. The opera music serves as another tool for making the entire story unreal enough into which we may immerse ourselves. In a film as godless and lacking in morals as ""Match Point,"" only the surreal would allow us to selfishly hope for Chris's well-being simply so that our nerves can take a break from his skulking.It is unfortunate that to praise the best part of the film is to spoil the third act. To do the most justice (a significantly poor word to use for this film), one can only say that the ending is sadistically satisfying. To have an ending as deliciously godless, amoral, and simultaneously satisfying as the culmination of ""Match Point""can only be attributed to Woody Allen's skill at moving into new territory with one of best movies of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen Must Never Die,"Having just returned from an afternoon screening of the latest Woody Allen film, all I can say is that I am in awe. In awe of a man, who after more than thirty years of film-making is still able to be so original, so poignant, so powerful, and so creative. Now into his seventies Woody has either written, directed or stared in (usually all three) a movie virtually ever year since 1969's 'Take The Money and Run' and with his latest 'Match Point' finally arriving in theaters he shows no signs of slowing down his prolific pace of unparalleled creativity as his latest project is undoubtedly his best in years.The story revolves around an affluent British family and their particularly ambitious new son in-law. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a retired tennis pro who's recently taken a position as an instructor at one of London's most exclusive Country clubs. It is at this post that he meets and befriends Tom (Matthew Goode) a young executive in his father's highly successful London based business (the nature of which is never revealed). Tom introduces Chris to the high life, a world of garden parties and opera, a world Chris has dreamed of but has always been forced to view it from the outside like so many window displays that line Savell Row, Chris' new favorite shopping district. All seems to be running according to plan, Chris meets Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and the two hit it off, sparking a relationship that comes with a promising new career in the family business attached, when on a cloudy British afternoon Chris meets Nola (Scarlet Johansson) a struggling American actress from Boulder, Colorado who also happens to be Tom's fiancé. The two are instantly and irrevocably attracted to one another and begin to run into each other around London, each visit bringing an increased sexual tension until a countryside tryst confirms what both had suspected. Soon however, what they had falls apart as Nola doesn't wish to continue their deceitful liaisons. Eventually Tom and Nola end their engagement and Nola seems to disappear forcing Chris to settle into his perfect life, that is until a chance meeting at an art gallery drives the two to resume their ill-fated relationship, a relationship that will eventually prove deadly.'Match Point' marks a return for Allen to the thematic ideas he's explored in previous outings such as 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Hannah and Her Sisters,' themes of lust, rejection, deceit and most of all luck. The theme of chance and opportunity is a common one throughout Woody's films but he had yet to attacked this topic with such fervor and brilliance. Let's not forget to mention suspense, Allen comes closer to Hitchcock than he or any other director of recent years has ever been able to, I guarantee you will spend the last twenty minutes of this film on no more that the edge of your seat.Woody Allen is back in fine form, better than we've seen him a few years, there's no denying it, and I am personally begging you to do yourself a favor and join him at the theater; you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"MATCH POINT (Woody Allen, 2005) ***","I wouldn't say that I'm Woody's biggest fan but, along the years, I've found his writing to be of a consistently high quality. As I was watching this film, I felt guilty of having neglected his recent work - the last Allen title I've watched is SWEET AND LOWDOWN (1999) and, in all, I still have to catch up with 14 of his pictures! - but, by the end of it, I reconfirmed my opinion that his work needs to be taken in small doses...Considering the praise heaped upon MATCH POINT, many claiming it to be some kind of (belated) turning point in Allen's career, I didn't quite know what to expect. However, when I watched the film I was relieved - but, at the same time, disappointed - to discover that it's nothing if not the old Woody all over again! While I wouldn't quite call his films boring, the relentless barrage of cultural name-dropping in historical/fashionable surroundings - more than his Bergmanesque study of male/female relationships and their neuroses (which is not as pronounced here as in some of his earlier, more austere work anyway) - is decidedly exasperating...and, in the case of this particular film, is further augmented by the posh lifestyle of the characters and the dreary London setting. Besides, listening to Allen's distinctive dialogue being delivered with a British accent proved quite unreal and took some getting used to!Anyway, what made the film for me was the presence - in both senses - of Scarlett Johannson: not only is she breath-taking to look at (I was extremely lucky to get to see her, and even attended two Press Conferences she did, at the 2004 Venice Film Festival!) but her tackling of the difficult role - as was the case with LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) - was outstanding, and knowledgeable beyond her years; I've watched only two of the performances nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but I can't help feeling that she has been snubbed (and that's twice already!).As for the much-touted final third which turns the film, unexpectedly, into a thriller (not a first for Woody, by the way): Allen directs these scenes like a pro, even taking care to include elements of black comedy and capping all with a devastatingly ironic ending. Bravo! Well, even if the film is not up to the standards of his best serious work (alas, only the first of them has received more than one viewing from me!) - ANNIE HALL (1977), MANHATTAN (1979), HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) and HUSBANDS AND WIVES (1992) - writing these comments just now has all of a sudden put me in the mood for more of the director's films: I do have four on VHS (though both my VCRs are currently out-of-order!) but, then, my local DVD outlet carries most of his recent work...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jonathan Rhys Meyers & Scarlett Johansson were very good in their roles, it was so convincing that they really loved each other. The locations were very well chosen.As the story unfolds, it became very gripping and kept me in suspense. Who would have thought the lovely Jonathan Rhys Meyers would have done such a thing?

Could this be Woody Allen's Best Work?,"Chris is a former tennis pro who gives it up to teach at an exclusive club. The club owner's daughter falls for him and a romance blooms. Unfortunately, things are not that simple: his passion is for another woman, a struggling American actress.This is not your traditional Woody Allen film. The man himself does not appear, the humor is toned down to the point of being non-existent, and the verbose vocabulary Allen often employs is not to be found. We are also placed squarely in upper class London, not the usual stomping grounds of Manhattan. Indeed, there is little here to suggest an Allen film at all.The closest we come to any obvious intellectual subtext is early on we see a copy of the ""Cambridge Companion to Dostoevsky"", something that comes into play later on, with Chris invoking the spirit of Raskolnikov. What is the significance of ""The Motorcycle Diaries""? Do the operas they take in tell a parallel story? If so, and I would not be surprised, this was clearly over my head.There is a dichotomy of ""luck"" and ""faith"", with the protagonist preferring the former and abandoning the latter. The concept of faith does not come up often, but luck sneaks in every now and then, and could be said to play a crucial role at a few points, twisting the plot is unforeseen directions. Indeed, if you watch the first hour and do not understand the high praise this film gets, keep watching. The sharp divergence in the second half will keep you glued to your seat -- this is tension at its very best.There is a second dichotomy of stability and passion. Clearly, being involved with the boss's daughter has a certain appeal. Wealth, connections and not a care in the world. But the sex is ""mechanical"" with such non-arousing comments as, ""I want you to make me pregnant."" The foreigner is something exotic (literally), unpredictable, and enticing. Is love grounded in passion or something else? Who knows? But passion is a strong force on man.There could have been a social message about class. Chris is clearly from a lower class background in Ireland, and through hard work and diligence has worked his way up to the good graces of the upper class with their tennis, opera and exclusive clubs. Nola is also from the lower class, with a hard-drinking mother, but she hides it well. Yet these class distinctions never seem to come to a head -- the same story could have been told any time in any place. It is, above all, a parable of fidelity.Ironically, even though not a comedy, this ranks among Woody Allen's best work. The story is strong, unique and looks sharp. We can feel sympathetic with Chris while simultaneously despising him. And Scarlett Johannsen looks sexier here than any other film I can think of, which is a feat in itself. Solid script, directing, acting and more... this truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Sleek Departure for Woody Allen,"This is a really well done Woody Allen movie about a British Tennis pro whose life and social circle becomes fascinated by his interest in a beautiful, young American. Scarlett Johansson is perfect in this role. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is great in the starring role. This film is a usual departure for Allen in that it takes place in London, as opposed to NYC. This film is on the more serious pallet, Allen. It is not comedic. Regardless, it is a good look at how an affinity for the opposite sex can, sometimes, become so overwhelming that it becomes such a strong fixation that it derails other aspects of one's life.

Almost perfect,"Woody Allen, who has been struggling in his most recent films, is in top form here, aided by sterling performances from his leads as described in all the other reviews here. He manages to capture London and the upper crust perfectly for the bulk of his intended audience: Americans.He loses two stars for two reasons: a sluggish 'first act,' which often drags and violates one of the principal dicta in film-making: move as far forward into the action as possible--any sensible audience will 'know' what brought us to where we are; the second reason is that (and Woody Allen must have known this) some of the film was apparently shot for television, with 'talking heads' that loom fifteen feet tall on the theatre screen and overwhelm the viewer. On the home screen, this would be in acceptable scale but on the big screen it's overpowering.This would have been a perfect 10 had it been a 90-minute film. As it is, it's remarkably good and speaks excellently to Allen's sensitivity to British culture and behaviour, and his mastery over nuanced plot details.Jonathan Rhys-Davies is magnetically watchable as he processes the realities around him, conveying emotion and meaning even when not saying anything (a good test for acting skill). It might have made him more credible as one who had come from a humble Irish background had he used the slightest hint of an Irish accent, but that's not a serious criticism except for the accent-aware (guilty as charged, m'lud).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Solid,"Great acting and good characters despite not always seeing all interactions between them, subtle reminders in discussions establishes that quite well and efficiently. The main protagonist is likeable for most of the movie, but often avoids expressing their emotions and imminent actions. This served the story very well, but not to better connect with the character.There is plenty of clever references to earlier parts of the movie scattered throughout the movie. The story is well set up and progressed very well til the end - where it became really suspenseful until the end credits. The only issue with the story is the time-frame. This will remain unknown, and may cause confusion as events constantly come as surprises.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing of Woody Allen in This Movie,"It's not just that Woody isn't in it. There is no humor in ""Match Point"" and -- although I've not seen everything Woody has ever done -- nothing that connects it to the rest of his ouvre. This is a conventional adultery-leading-to-murder film, not the worst of its type but far from the best. If you like Scarlett Johansson (and I do), here's an opportunity to see a good deal of her body, and you also get to see another aspect of her acting talent (in an essentially undemanding role). Johansson may be Woody's latest muse but, if so, he did not succeed in creating a story worthy of her talents or, for that matter, an especially interesting character for her to play. When the great critic in the sky writes down a final verdict on Woody Allen's career, ""Match Point"" will be down near the bottom of the list of his achievements.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Echoes of Highsmith and Dostoyevsky,"Match Point has certainly inspired numerous comments here. So many, in fact, that I didn't have the energy to read but just a few. Generally I think that it's a very good movie, maybe not great though, but something different from what one has come to expect from Woody Allen.In a film as good as this, there is one thing that is quite ridiculous (although of no importance to the plot or the film in general): we are told that Tom's father donates generously to the Royal opera House, but twice we see the protagonists at performances accompanied by piano! Has the orchestra gone on strike or is the generosity of Tom's father still too modest in scale? In the third performance the orchestra is already present.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It is not a comedy and it does not take place in New York, but it is really good.","In 'Match Point' Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Alexander and Bend It Like Beckham) plays Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro who wants more out of life. He seems to be on the right path. He finds a rich girl to marry, who (as well as her family) adores him. His father-in-law gives him a good job with lots of opportunity. Chris seems to have it made. That is, until he meets his brother-in-laws fiancée (Scarlett Johansson). Will he risk everything for a woman that rocks his world? This movie is a little different than what we have seen recently from Woody Allen (writer/director). It is not a comedy and it does not take place in New York, but it is really good. Without ruining the ending, it embodies Wilton's view on life and probably Allen's as well. That is, luck has a lot to do with it. If you see this movie, you will know what I mean.I like the performances of both Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer (Formula 51 and Lovely & Amazing). Mortimer is truly brilliant as Wilton's wife, I think she is really underrated.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So some say this is a masterpiece...,"Normally, I don't appreciate commenting on other users' comments (it has the smack of arrogance), but in this case I frankly must say that if you consider this one of Woody Allen's masterpieces then you haven't seen many of his movies so far.I agree that ""Match Point"" is better than ""Melinda and Melinda"" (though that wouldn't be much of a compliment on its own), and I wouldn't even complain too much about the all too obvious flaws: its clumsy dialogue and threadbare characters, the horrible (yes: horrible!) use of soundtrack music (scratchy opera tunes which reveal absolutely no connection with the on-screen action whatsoever, nor do they comment on it in an especially subtle manner - you get the impression that Mr. Allen just wanted to show us what an exquisite connoisseur he thinks he is), the cliché settings or the length of the movie (at least 30 minutes too long).What I really DO complain about is that Woody Allen has made far, far superior films in the past dealing with related topics. Just watch ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", for instance, and you'll instantly know what I mean.",,Anonymous,Romance
"not exactly love, is it...","MP is a riff on A PLACE IN THE SUN. I saw SCOOP and NOTES ON A SCANDAL in October 2006 before I saw MATCH POINT tonight Dec 26 2006. ... Each have something in common with the other. As MATCH POINT was produced first and SCOOP secondly I find that SCOOP is a disgrace, out takes from MATCH POINT like some home movie fun project Allen decided to make for himself whilst still in London with a crew and Scarlett Johanssen. SCOOP now seems more reprehensible than when I first saw it 2 months ago . I also now can see how NOTES ON A SCANDAL came about given the acclaim and perfected London based thriller deception both MATCH and NOTES share. Generally one can see a theme in productions that feed from another's success; remember all the supernatural films that followed THE SIXTH SENSE.... even a copycat one with Cate Blanchett (some forgettable thing called THE GIFT set in a swamp in Louisiana and with Giovanni Ribisi).... now she has one like MATCH POINT called NOTES ON A SCANDAL. Friends told me for 12 months to see MATCH POINT and now seeing it as described above makes for reflection of production that I find rather predictable, a line of films I would otherwise not have linked. Lots of other comments here will explain the story and their own take but all I want to acclaim is three things: it is an excellent thriller with a moral and ethical dilemma that allows fate to take the lead... and I like that very much. also: thank God someone has finally given Jonathan Rhys-Meyers a truly decent great role; he deserves it and I have been interested in his career since VELVET GOLDMINE waiting for someone of note to actually showcase his considerable talents. MI3 and the interest of Tom Cruise does not count. .....and finally: the superbly written character of Chloe, the wife to Chris... what a great role and what a superb clean kind humane female part. I really cared for her character. MATCH POINT is a great film; well written, perfectly cast, supremely suspenseful .... terrifying actually....and not tidy...... reflecting life properly. But when and if you bother seeing the stupid tedious boring self indulgent thin SCOOP it will erase again whatever goodwill MATCH POINT allowed you to have for Allen at this late stage.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Scarlet Johansson rules!!,This movie is a must watch. It has a simple story line about extra- marital affair/infidelity but the things that make this one worth watching are the superb acting by Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers plus the intense atmosphere throughout. This movie is beautifully written and wonderfully acted. Something that is also a main plot of the story but which we don't realize at the start is the importance of 'Luck' in our lives. This movie tells us about the bitter reality about 'Luck' and shows a very realistic approach towards life and unveils its bitter truths.I totally enjoyed it...a must watch!!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I expected much more,"I watched this movie now. It's good, but essentially nothing special. It was most surprising to me that I could never assume that this film has anything to do with Woody Allen. A completely different style, incompatible with him, his thoughts and eternal motifs such as debates about God and religion in general, life, and especially death. 
Particularly interesting is the soundtrack, it was nice to listen to the famous opera aria, above all ""Una furtiva lacrima"" aria from the opera ""Love Beverage"" by Gaetan Donizetti, which appears several times, and the recording is from the record of Enrico Caruso. 
The treatment of motives from the world literature ""Crime and Punishment"" by Dostoyevsky and ""American Tragedy"" by Theodore Drajzer, gave a certain stamp to the film, the acting of the main actors is good, but ... there is something that was not convincing me at all. Say again, it's a good movie, but I expected much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Compelling,"Going through the abundant and recently updated collection of my mother's DVDs, fighting to stave off boredom, passing the many titles I'd seen before and the ones I didn't want to see, I came across Match Point. I didn't know anything about it, but seeing that it had the endlessly sensual Scarlett I thought that even if the film itself was a loss I'd have something to watch. Oh, and the rundown on the back sounded interesting enough. I've only just discovered who the director is, and it's been quite some time since I've seen it. My painfully clear lack of attention to detail aside (and please don't take that as a reflection of my comments, it's there when it counts), I liked this film a lot. Well acted, well scripted, well shot and quite thought-provoking. The story is believable when it needs to be, the plot builds perfectly and the characters are real, well developed and likable. Rhys Meyers does brilliantly as a suitably self-confident prat (almost annoyingly so at times, which adds to his character's depth) and is great at conveying the fact that his character is cool and always in control, even when things start going to hell. If you didn't follow the actions and behaviour of his character from start to finish, you'd think he knows instinctively how to handle any situation and it's only through the ending that we're shown why, and what a great ending it is. Unexpected, definitely. Implausible, certainly, as some of the other comments have pointed out as a negative, but for me that just makes it better. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
not Woody's best but still good.,I don't think there is grey area with woody people seem to either love him or loathe him. I think he has done some excellent films I also think he's done some bad ones. I've heard people say that match point falls into the bad section but I disagree. I think that relocating to London from his usual Manhattan backdrop has invigorated him. With a typically sharp script its business as usual for woody and although the acting is mediocre it doesn't seem to spoil it too much. There is a great twist at the end and recognisable places in the locations. We are presented with age-old dilemmas about love and loss to deal with and once a conundrum is set up the audience is challenged to see themselves in the characters and realise the situations that we as flawed humans can get ourselves into. Of course this being a film it may not pan out as it would in real life but the basis is the same. Shot in his own unique style and injected with operatic background music match point is the first of a supposed trilogy set in our fine capital and on the basis of this I look forward to the next few outings from one of my favourite directors,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best of Allen,"I'm very fond of Woody Allen films. Even when he's sloppy, it's still a good film. But this one wasn't sloppy. It begins with the familiar plot- A man, whose destined to marry another woman, falls in love with his friend's fiancée. Only, the story goes deeper and deeper and creates a great suspense and interest. It isn't rare for an Allen's character to get involved in a mixed up situation. Only Allen can make a brilliant story out of it. I found the acting a little bit ""almost"", but the directing is, as usual, very good. In the end, I loved the turning of events and the well-written screenplay! Woody Allen does it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dull, Prententious ... Classic Latter-Day Woody Allen","First of all, I'm sick of WA's obsession with upper-class people and the life he thinks they should lead. As is typical in his movies, the characters in MP exist in some weird never-never land untouched by popular culture. Here we have a group of 4 affluent urban people in their 20's, but none of them ever go to a club, watch a football match, listen to music less than 100 years old or, apparently, watch television or go to movies that aren't French. Even the bars and restaurants they frequent are stuffy rather than trendy and modern.It's not that I disdain high culture or particularly love modern pop culture or trendiness - often the reverse; but, c'mon on, nobody under 50 nowadays leads this rarified a life, let alone a group of young, wealthy, pretty Londoners. It makes the characters less believable and less sympathetic to portray them as being so remote from the cultural universe the rest of us inhabit.Secondly, Chris' character is flat and uninteresting because we don't know about enough about him to understand or care about his motives. If he was a poor boy, how did he come by the posh accent? (If that is indeed a posh accent; JRM's mode of speech was so stilted it was hard to tell.) Is it put on? Has he always been a climber, aiming to marry a rich girl, or did he just happen to fall into the company of these rich people and like what he found? Who cares? If WA was trying a make a point or build a story around class differences, he failed - there is not enough conflict and contract between the characters to work on that level.Overall, although Match Point was pretty look at, by the last half-hour I was peering at my watch, anxious to get out.",,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen hits new territory and returns with a brilliant film in the can.,"When i first picked this movie out on Netflicks honestly i thought it wasn't going to be very good. You know, i thought it was going to be territory a director like Woody Allen wouldn't be able to handle. When i started watching it, the first 30 min or so i still wasn't convinced it was worth it. But as the story went on and the plot started to build momentum, my mind went from completely ready to dislike this movie to running out to the store and buying it. Now when i look back about my first opinion of this movie, i feel like i should slap myself. Who am i to judge the legendary Woody Allen. There is no territory Woody Allen wouldn't be able to handle. Match Point is a sexy, slick, and a refreshingly new style for Allen. It shows that luck plays a bigger part of our lives then we think.

Broken English,"OK, so Woody Allen's worst is better than most people's best, but this is drivel. Perhaps he thinks posh Brits speak like Noel Coward characters, but apart from Matthew Goode as Tom and Emily Mortimer as Chloe, none of the main characters sounded like real people. Thank goodness for Ewen Bremner and James Nesbit's appearances in the final section - they managed to bring something vaguely normal to proceedings. I would have thought Woody Allen knows enough about London to know how not to make a film look like low-rent Richard Curtis, but perhaps 'Notting Hill' and 'Love Actually' are his source material. Would it have been too much trouble to employ someone to work as a language consultant to make the dialogue sound like something other than a bad translation of Ibsen? Was the ridiculous first encounter between Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers meant to sound like an an out-take from a 40s film noir? Perhaps, to use that favourite Hollywood catch-all excuse, Allen is being ironic. No, to use a truly British phrase, he is just being a bit rubbish.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Only 543 votes ???,"There are more votes for Michael Haneke's ""Caché"", which came out only one or two weeks ago !!!!How can Woody Allen be a virtual stranger in his own country to such an extent ??? How can someone setting ALL his film plots in *New York* for thirty years get so little interest in his own country - and be a *Superstar* in Europe?Unless the film just came out *days* ago in the United States (in which case my above comments would look very silly, I admit it...) - well, this is a complete mystery to me!I haven't seen the movie yet, you might have guessed, but I strongly suspect I will like it (especially as so many people are referring to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" to describe it, which was one of his last great movies, if not the very last). I have a very soft spot for Mrs. Johanssen as well...(Edit: I have learned in the meantime, reading one of the threads about the movie (below), that Allen's films are hardly being shown in the U.S. *at all*. That explains the few votes, but is quite sad an stupid as well, knowing one of the main factors for it is his affair with his adoptive daughter. Now, I don't approve of this, neither did I appreciate it very much when I first heard about it.

Gripping but disturbing,"I went to the cineplex, bought a ticket for a movie and then realized that I was too early for its start. With about 30 minutes to kill, I went into see the start of ""Matchpoint"". I knew it was a Woody Allen movie and while I don't hate Woody Allen, I'm not a die-hard fan either. I prefer his early comedies, and I tend to rent his movies on DVD when nothing else seems good. So, by watching the start, I thought I'd get a sense of the movie to decide whether it would be a later rental. I looked at my watch as the 30 minute mark ticked by and decided to stay for the rest of ""Matchpoint"". The other movie will get the financial credit from my ticket purchase, but Woody Allen gets the artistic credit. ""Matchpoint"" is good, but disturbing. After watching it, and as I walked out of the cinema, I was almost angry with myself for having stayed. It's too disturbing.The script was originally written for Long Island but then it got transferred to London. In my view, this makes for a better movie. The cold phlegmatism of class-obsessed England gives a critical twist to the story. True, this opens the movie to the expected quibbles about accents, origins, habits, expressions, country houses and so on. In a sense, the Brits who make such criticisms are just proving the truth of the film's context. The script has also been compared to ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"". In my opinion, the characters in ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" openly reflected on their actions. In ""Matchpoint"", any reflection is much, much more subtle. This is Dostoievski territory.Truth be told, Woody Allen on a bad day is better than most filmmakers on their best days. In ""Matchpoint"", you are in the hands of a master. Since ""Matchpoint"" puts an American character into a British setting, I suggest that you compare it with ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" or even ""Wimbledon"". Woody Allen puts them all to shame, but in a very disturbing way.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unquestionably the best of Allen's London Films,"The first of four flicks made in the UK and easily the best of them. Highly esteemed by the auteur, and there is no meaner critic of Woody Allen films than Allen himself. In a BFI on stage interview with Mark Kermode - previously viewable on Youtube but latterly (sinisterly?) deleted from the BFI's channel - Allen positively urges the theatre audience to go and see it. 'You'll like it, you;ll have a good time.'This is a crime and punishment drama, one that for hypercritical Allen supersedes his much admired movie of the 1980s, Crimes and Misdemeanors. Allen disdained the comparison when it was offered by Kermode, but he did say that he would have liked to do Crimes without the funny, lighter storyline, the one involving himself and Alan Alda, and which served as a counterpoint to the main drama involving Martin Landau. Well, he got his chance with Match Point which is 98% comedy free. Allen's confidence in the movie stems from the excellent performances given by the entire cast. He also approved the overcast weather which so suited his melancholic disposition.Some British critics sneered at Match Point, claiming Allen didn't know how to write British vernacular (the original version was set in North America). No such whinges from the US critics and audiences who enjoyed the movie. For my part I have no problem with Allen's dialogue, at least I don't find anything unidiomatic in it. On the whole I enjoy Match Point, but I will say that it almost outstays its welcome (it's Allen's longest movie), that Jonathan Rhys Meyers' performance has an oddly fey quality to it which borders upon irritating, that as a music lover I can't help noticing the lack of an orchestra in the opera sequences, and that finally Match Point can't escape the fundamental problem which afflicts all of Woody's crime dramas. What is that problem you ask. I'll tell you. This kind of writing simply isn't Allen's forte. He achieves a certain competence in it, but he doesn't have the panache to really sell it. He'd be better off seasoning it a little with some macabre humour, for if there's one thing Woody can do it's humour.Definitely worth seeing, much like the Giants' Causeway, but as Dr Johnson said of that one, not worth going to see. Lucky you don't need to: a rental will do just fine.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's about getting more and more involved in something you can't control. Or don't want to control, until it's too late and there's only a final solution.This is again Scarlett Johansson's movie. She is an actress with so much depths already, at her young age, that you are astonished. Without her you wouldn't be that interested, because the problem with Allen's films, is that they usually deal only with rich people's problems. This story couldn't have been made in this way... maybe in no way...if it was about working class men.Still, there is much to be found here for all of us. Mostly because of the life that Johansson brings into it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen does Dostoyevsky in London,"I've always admired Woody Allen. The sheer number of great films he's made - Hannah and her Sisters, Manhattan, Midsummer Nights Sex Comedy, Everything you Wanted to Know About Sex, Manhattan Murder Mystery etc. Although some of his newer films weren't totally up to speed, I wanted them to be successful (not in the financial sense, but critically).Match Point is Allen's first film in years to be not only critically but also financially successful. He didn't act in it and its not even a comedy and no its not set in Manhattan. This is a thriller. The lead is an ambitious Irish tennis player who chose not to turn tennis pro and moved to London instead. He gets involved with the only daughter of an upper-upper class businessman (the excellent Brian Cox) who can give a son-in-law a great career. He also falls in love with the businessman's son's fiancée - a struggling American actress played by Scarlet Johannsen (oh she's hot!). I won't say more about the plot and no its nothing like Hannah and her Sisters. Instead, it is partially based on Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.I liked the London photography, the artwork and the Enrique Caruso opera piece which was used to great effect. The first scene with Jonathan Rhys-Myer and Scarlet is great. The verbal play reminded me of Bogart and Bacall. But none of their later scenes except the one in the café had that writing spark - less style and more realism which was a little jarring. I also felt Meyers was not a very good lead and acted poorly in several scenes. Emily Mortimer does a good job as Meyer's girlfriend.I would recommend this as a good but not perfect film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Match Point,"Declining tennis pro ""Wilton"" (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is looking for a job at a swanky London club teaching the well-healed folks like ""Tom"" (Matthew Goode) and his sister ""Chloe"" (Emily Mortimer) to whom, after a rather brief courtship, he ultimately gets married. He gets used to her standard of living but isn't really that enamoured of the woman herself. That scenario only worsens when he meets budding actress ""Nola"" (Scarlett Johansson) - who was dating ""Tom"" and they start to have an affair. With his wife determined to start a family and a mistress who is becoming increasingly obsessive, poor old ""Wilton"" must resort to some desperate measures! What possessed Wood Allen to cast JRM here? He's so wooden he makes Victor Mature look animated. Sure, he's got the eye-candy look but as an actor he's terrible. Luckily, that's more than compensated for by strong efforts from Johansson and from Mortimer who both manage their roles with considerably greater aplomb. The former illustrates her journey from independently minded woman to a frenetically preoccupied one quite convincingly as the story develops, and Mortimer likewise conveys something of the visceral and turbulent nature of aspiring motherhood. It takes a look at the lives of the offspring of the wealthy in a slightly less procedural fashion, too. The benign parents - Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton - are not your stereotypically doting parents, they expect him to work for his new found riches and she, especially, tends to speak as she finds. The denouement is my kind of conclusion, even if it is a little on the far-fetched side, and there's a degree of concluding satisfaction to be had here that I quite enjoyed. I'm still not sure why she didn't marry ""Tom"" though!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I tried watching Annie Hall, never came around to watching it, because it looked so lame and old-fashioned for me but one of the other reasons was that I wasn't too keen on watching a grandma and a grandpa having sex. When Match Point came out (get it) along with it's favorable reviews and a hot young cast, that included Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson, I decided to finally watch his latest film.The films is, from my point of view, about the two LL's: Love and Luck. It uses tennis as an example of luck and throughout the movie, at the beginning, the middle, and at the end, it references luck as a tennis ball that has tipped the net in the middle and which side will it land in: your opponents or back into your own. It uses love like any other Woody Allen movie.... Apart from the two LL's, Woody Allen is also pursuing Adultery and murder. And if mix that with the two LL's the result can be pretty entertaining and mesmerizing. The film also proved that Woody Allen is not as boring as I say he is and that consensus will live with me until he makes another Annie Hall. The performances by Johansson and Meyers are terrific and they are probably the best actors of the new generation. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays an intriguing ex-tennis payer who falls for a friends sister and then he meets another girl who he thinks is his true love. Scarlett Johansson plays a hot Blondie who smokes often and is a sex symbol in Chris Wilton's life (Meyers). The performances from both of them is something to remember because they plays their role convincingly well. Brian Cox is also a respected actor in this film and even though his role isn't as important as Johasson's or Meyers, he is still good to see. The story is slow at the beginning but then eventually, when it starts reaching its climax, things heat up and the twist at the end of the film was a bit of a surprise but all that tension and suspense led up to nothing. It would have been better if the ending was different than the one used in the theatrical version. The character development was just perfect because during the movie you become attached to the characters so much that you want a happy ending to take place. But Match Point, to everyone who sees it, purposely did what it did at the end to make your blood boil. The film should be recommended to anyone who hates the genre romance/suspense but wants to start getting into because Match Point is one of the rare films that define both of the genres. The film isn't Oscar worthy but.....(sigh)...the performances are so good.Chris, a recently retired tennis player, requests work like instructor in a London select club, there he knows and friendship begins with Tom Hewett who is member of an English wealthy family, Chris is a youth with luck, Chloe sister of Tom falls in love with Chris who takes advantage of this. On the other hand, Nola, an American sensual actress of little mount, girlfriend of Tom, knows Chris in a family party and the Irishman immediately is attracted by the beauty of the actress. Different to Nola's fate, Chris is well accepted in the Hewett's family and has the fortune of sympathizing with Mr. Alec Hewett who uses their influence to place young Chris in an executive position. Chris marries this way Chloe, Tom breaks up suddenly with Nola and he marries a youth of his class. Then Chris looks for Nola laboriously, and he revives the passion that feels for the American, this way Chris is amid an enormous pressure, coming from the work, of his relationship with Nola and of his wife's necessity of having a son. Finally, Nola leaves pregnant and she begins to press Chris so that he abandons Chloe, the retired tennis player has to make a difficult decision that will take him to extreme situations and a fatal destination for the young actress. Again the random, the good luck, allows Chris to stay free of this difficult situation, again the ball hits in the net and it falls in the rival's land.The music going along with this movie is what you would expect and that is slow, enjoyable, and thrillingly clever. The film is flawless apart from the ending and I hope everyone thinks the way I do. Now, I'll be heading off to my local video store.....here I come Match Point...""Over and Out."" 24 April 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a hymn to the superficiality of  happiness,"Match Point portrays in a very beautiful manner that love and passion in life usually flourish against logic and out of proportion. This is what makes the hero of this movie a tragic person, someone who can get by in life using Socrate's saying ""the saddest thing in life is to be born"". Personally,what i really liked about this film was Allen's mastery of playing games with his audience's minds, compelling them to take compassion on a person that is about to give up any moral principle to preserve his superficial happiness. This is a high level of cinematography, very appealing to to those who get absorbed by a riveting plot. Also highly recommended to those who consider visual effects or stories without any grip on reality as definite no-nos.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
MATCH POINT : An Awful Performance From Rhys-Meyers Damages The Entire Film...,"MATCH POINTAs such an avid film fanatic, it's amazing that it's taken me this long to ever see a Woody Allen film in it's entirety (sp?). Aside from bits and pieces of ALICE, ANNIE HALL, and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY I have never seen Allen's work. Odd that the first film of his I see, MATCH POINT, is deemed as a big change of pace for him.The film is a very elegantly crafted romantic sex-thriller. It is rich with analogies and symbolism that are obvious enough for the audience to pick up on, but not overtly blatant. The symbolism/message of that first tennis match is well maintained throughout the film with a subtle, gleaning style well managed by Allen.I enjoyed the concept in the script, and thought that London was filmed beautifully. Allen made brilliant use of the scenery, with London coming across as a sophisticated New York.However, a main weakness in this film is the disappointing performance of it's leading actor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. A charismatic and talented star who has exhibited potential in his previous films... Rhys-Meyers comes up noticeably short here. His performance is monotone, and all surface. He plays Chris, an ex pro-tennis player who is now entering high society through his relationship with Chloe (Emily Mortimer). However, as he becomes more and more comfortable living the comfortable life, he becomes less and less fulfilled by marriage. He seeks out a passionate affair with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansen) and struggles to continue getting everything he wants.Though we see that he is torn between a comfortable/luxurious life and the passionate one he has on the side, Rhys-Meyers does little to emphasize this. He seduces when he needs to seduce, he cries when he needs to cry, and he yells when he needs to yell. But I never noticed a constant tone of a man torn and tormented by his own greed. It just seemed Meyers didn't bring enough to the table here. The performance is especially terrible in the opening scenes. This is where Rhys-Meyers has the chance to establish the man Chris is aside from all the situations he is in later in the film... but Meyers delivers nothing but monotone and empty lines.Thankfully the film has some life pumped into it every time it's leading females are on-screen. MATCH POINT features strong performances from Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johansenn as the two sides of womanhood that men truly desire... comfort and mystery. Mortimer's Chloe is a less explosive role, b/c she's never given much to react to. However, Mortimer fills her with an ignorant optimism and love that remains endearing. She is subtly suspicious when the affair is obvious, but realistically lied to by a conniving husband.Johannsen has received most of the acclaim and buzz surrounding MATCH POINT... and it is not entirely unwarranted. She energizes the screen every time she appears (thankfully keeping the audience interested while Meyer's stands there)... and her sexual allure has never been more compelling. She also manages to keep Nola entirely sympathetic. Johannsen's first few scenes had me wary, and I found her initial deliveries to be as monotone as Meyers... however, from the moment Nola has a few drinks with Chris after a failed audition, Johannsen is spot on.Overall, it's an intriguing film... and it kept me interested for it's 2 hour running time. However, it suffers from an awful leading performance, some plot holes in it's conclusion, and a truly unlikeable and despicable male lead. Perhaps Chris could have been a more sympathetic and tolerable character had he been played by an actor with more talent... but as is, I never once liked the character of Chris. As a matter of fact, I loathed him. My word of choice upon leaving the theatre was ""douchebag""... and neither Allen's writing or Rhys-Meyer's performance was able to elevate the character.For me, MATCH POINT is an interesting film with a terribly handled leading male... and in the end, though the film is interesting, it is far from perfect. I left in a bad mood, and I don't think that was completely necessary. Some additional balancing of Chris' motivations from a directorial viewpoint (Woody Allen) and recasting Chris (kick Rhys-Meyers to the curb on this one)... and MATCH POINT could have been great. As is...... C- ...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gripping Character Study,"Make no mistake, Chris is the villain through and through, but in understanding and rooting for him, we realize that there's a Chris in all of us. This movie explores how much a person can embrace their inner Chris when the situation demands it.It also delves into how most of us inevitably prioritize self-interest over our stated morals and how we rationalize those choices.The movie is very well written and shot, offering a breath of fresh air in an often over-explored genre. The characters feel authentic and lived-in throughout. Few clichés are used, and the film avoids unnecessary sympathy.Minor details are meticulously considered, and the foreshadowing is executed perfectly.I watched this movie after reading reviews comparing it to ""Challengers"" (2024). Safe to say, those reviewers missed the mark. There are no real similarities, and this film is vastly superior overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"interesting, sometimes boring","Chris is an ex-professional tennis player who starts training a rich British guy. As her sister fells in love to Chris, his style of life rises up. However, Chris is in love to his sister-in-law, Nola, so they start a hot romance. As she wants to make everybody to know it, Chris decides to take drastic measures to avoid it. In this film, Allen thinks about luck and its influence in life by telling us a history of a greed man that rises, as he has luck. There we can see his goals and his fears (surprisingly good acting of Rhys Meyers) and his relationships with all the family. It is also compulsory to remark the good paper of Scarlet Johansson (Nola) as a femme-fatal, in which she shows how good actress she is. The history is curious and the directing is good: all scenes are important, any empty one, well build characters (Woody Allen is a great director, he know to make things well). On the other hand, I've missed Allen's sense of humour, most of the movie, though interesting, is quite boring, as we watch all the serious moments in Chris' life, the main problem is that the main character is not very charismatic and some moments, though needed, are quite moment. Probably the most realistic Allen's film in a long time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen presents... a whole new kind of depressing film-making!,"Woody Allen himself has said this is perhaps the best film he has ever made. And surely, this is one of Woody Allen's more notable films, a stand-out entry in his canon if only for the fact that it is so much darker than anything else he previously directed (save for possibly his best work, ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""). The serious material and location also break the typical Woody Allen rhythm of bittersweet comedic romance in New York City. Instead, this film takes place amongst the elite upper classes of London (which Woody unfortunately does not have the background to explore or present with a local's expertise) and investigates social climbing, nepotist opportunism and impractical lustful obsession.The plot involves a mild-mannered amateur tennis pro named Chris (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who looks like a splicing of Joaquin Phoenix and Ewan MacGregor) who works his way into the London upper classes by kindling a friendship with one of his male clients. The same client has a fiancée, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannsen) with whom Chris develops an unhealthy obsession. Scarlett Johannsen seems to be Woody's current eye-candy muse, the clumsily acting starlet of his recent movies. This is the first Allen movie to feature Scarlett, and while she's much better cast here than in almost any other film she's been in, she is still a mediocre actress.The performances and dialog are all above average (again, save for Scarlett and the fact that I don't know what passes for quality English dialog, hee hee!) and the cinematography is clean and pristine. So are most of the locations actually, often bright, clean and spacious -- in vivid contrast to the nature of the plot. In fact, some of the interior locations of this movie are reminiscent of the futuristic, super-silly sets of Allen's early ""Sleeper"". The difference is that the sets here are create an ominous atmosphere (almost like a Poe story, sans the macabre decadence).As a film this holds together really well, but is incredibly depressing and somewhat self-important. There are some surprises and twists left open to interpretation, but the open-ended nature of some portions of it make it depressingly realistic. As a drama and suspense piece it is one of the best for it's professional inspiration, painless pacing (despite the slow plot development) and manages to be one of Woody's more notable films.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen in 2005,"There was a time when Woody Allen could get away with anything he did, no matter how failed it was. Audiences as well as critics adored him and his cinema, for undeniable masterpieces as ""Manhattan"", ""Annie Hall"", and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and favorites as ""Sleeper"", ""Broadway Danny Rose"","" Radio Days"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" or ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"". But things have changed, and even if repeating himself is a sign of authorship, it seems he has few new things to say. This is a reflection on luck, but the complications of the plot are resolved with resources from ""Crimes..."" that worked very well in 1989, but this time they seem preposterous, while the Bergmanesque ghosts are an easy way out to the complications he concocted. As Scorsese, he is a good director, and both craft fine products. But quite often today they seem pointless.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A darker but mesmerizing Allen film, with an outstanding cast.","Chris - Jonathan Rhys Meyers - is an Irish pro tennis player who has finally left the circuit.

Austin Movie Show review - best Woody Allen yet!,"Some people are so gorgeous that it hurts to look at them. That's Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in a nutshell. The beyond-sexy blue-eyed Irish heart throb plays Chris Wilton, the luckiest boy in London, in Woody Allen's Golden Globe nominated film, ""Match Point."" Chris is a tennis instructor at a posh tennis club in London. Rubbing elbows with London's elite on a daily basis leads Chris to a wealthy wife and a cushy job in the family business. His life would've been perfect if he hadn't pursued a dangerous affair with a gorgeous, but unstable, struggling American actress named Nola (as much as I dislike Scarlett Johansson, I have to admit that she fit the part perfectly). I've never been a Woody Allen fan, but ""Match Point"" smacks you in the face when you least expect it. In one second it goes from sexy drama to psychodrama, and there is never a dull moment. London has never looked better, and neither has a Woody Allen film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Believe It Or Not, This Is a Perfect Movie, Demonstrating Allen's Unpredictability At This Age...","One of the most underrated films of all time, this is Allen's come back to glory, and what kind of glory are we talking about?This film, as I mentioned in the title, is simply perfect. The main actors give the performance of their careers and the supporting ones give their all to make the whole project work.I'm young, and I got my young friends. They told me Scarlett is the sexiest woman in the world after watching this movie, so fascinated at her lips that they forgot the story of the movie, but I only went close to being distracted once (in the ping-pong scene), other than that I was stunned by her interpretation of the role. When I saw her first some years ago, I expected her to become another flesh-actress like Jessica Alba, but now I'm convinced she's the new Angelina Jolie, a great talent whose acting abilities outshine her looks.And Rhys Meyers, WOW! Did you expect it? I didn't after seeing his last not-bad works. I saw myself in him, exactly the way I might cry or act in times of anxiety or being distant, so I assume he was so natural and believable as a confident boy whose intellect beats his desire and emotions, who finally makes a devastating decision.Oh, and Allen's screenplay, what can I say? It's the first time that it occurs to me, after watching almost 2000 movies, that I see the lover kill the wild sex doll instead of the innocent woman, and that's an achievement. The twists are extraordinary in this title, a fact that makes it all the more exciting and surprising.One also mustn't forget to praise the top class cinematography and greater than that, the editing. The sequences are so coherent and fluid I can't remember when I last saw something equal, let alone better.About the Philosophy of the film, I guess this should be one of those of which each person will pay attention to one of the aspects. Until the very moment he squeezed the trigger I couldn't believe my eyes, and that was the moment that I found out this isn't an ordinary thriller of poor & rich, but a genius mix of many meanings.Allen is a marvel, does anyone acclaim him the way he deserves? He's written and directed in all and acted in a majority of his 40 movies, isn't this an unbelievable accomplishment? Are the world and its residents aware of a little four-eye guy who's not a fast-talking clichéd clown, but a rare living treasure who offers one fine movie every year and a masterpiece once in a while? Why?This must have competed with ""Crash"" in the Academy awards for best picture, screenplay and other categories, and I believe the actors were quite good enough to challenge Seymour Hoffman and Witherspoon in the acting category.Watch this movie twice, because at the first sight you'll be shocked by the ending and will forget the details of the first one and a half hour, so a review is needed. And after finishing the second time and figuring out all the little things and angles in the lead-up, you'll put it into your top ten of all time.Trust me on that one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun And Kind Of Different,"MATCH POINTS certainly has its fun moments. It has some really great ones. Overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's good enough. And it's different compared to much of Allen's works. The guy keeps cranking out movies year after year, but he's really branched out lately, making more films in Europe; in Spain or the UK, wherever he can get financing.That's part of what makes this film so good, is that it's a Woody Allen film set overseas. The story is great too, of course, as is the acting from some really talented stars. I've heard, however, that they didn't like the film so much over there. I think the uninformed dialog sounded weird to their ears. That makes sense, but I didn't know any better, so enjoyed it. Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Woodman Goes Out On A Limb,"I'm a huge follower of Woody's work, from the very beginning (even got to meet him in his Play It Again Sam Broadway dressing room in NYC a long time back). Some of his movies are disappointing, but most of them have delighted me, even the more serious ones, like Interiors and C&M. This one is a real departure of sorts, not necessarily in the subject matter but rather in the execution. Gone are the nauseating jumpy camera moves from Husbands & Wives (which I liked nonetheless, what can I tell ya), gone are the snappy one-liners, gone is the jazzy soundtrack, gone is his beloved New York City. Instead, we get slow, subtle panning shots, arch dialogue with hardly any obvious humor to them, an opera soundtrack, and London, of all places. It works, though, this noir-ish concoction; it lures you in, sweeps you along and then it turns the screws in a most surprising way, leaving the viewer - this viewer, anyway - entirely jaw-dropped.This is a thought-provoking work that no doubt has precipitated many philosophical discussions, and for that alone it's a winner. Not quite perfect, however - some of the dialog feels a little phony, the opera gets a little bit much in places, and some of the plot points are a tad heavy-handed. I forgive Woody for this. The Big Question is (aside from the question of karma): can his leading character in the movie genuinely forgive himself for what he does, in the name of 'survival'?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Seamless Convergence of Philosophical Matters and Unfaltering Emotional Experience,"Match Point, an utterly absorbing and stimulatingly tight experience, seems to imply that you can just commit any horrible deed you want and get away with it, but really, we have to accept that life is arbitrary and existence is indiscriminate, often an insignificant and dismal experience with no purpose, and that love relationships are exceedingly arduous, and that in spite of everything we need to stumble on a way to not only survive but lead an honest and gratifying life. Many interpret that what the film is saying is that anything goes, but I think it essentially poses the matters: given an impossible situation in which we're all alone, how does a certain individual persevere, or even why should he choose to persevere? Sure enough, the choice is hardwired into him, and us. Spiritual people don't want to allow the truth that cancels out their myth. And if it is an arbitrary life, they're bust.There are masses of us who choose to lead totally self-interested, careless lives. They feel, because nothing signifies any absolutes and one can prospectively get away with anything, they will. But one can also make the choice that we're alive, other people are alive, we're all hanging by the same interdependent threads and we've got to try to make it as honorable as we can for ourselves and everybody. This is why Match Point's story makes such perfect sense to me, because this is so much more virtuous and even much more Christian. If you accept the uncomfortable reality of human life and choose to be an honorable person despite it instead of living in denial that there's going to be some sacred prize or some penalty, it feels more sincerely dignified. If there's a prize or penalty and you act well, then you're acting well not out of such selfless intentions, the same professed ""Christian"" intentions.The lack of God in the universe matters, however. It's a shame, and yet just when you can acknowledge that, ironically, can you then continue to lead what people call a Christian life, namely an honest, just life. You can only truly lead it if you recognize what you're up against at the outset and shuck off all the fabrications that lead you to make choices in life that you're making not truly for honorable reasons but for securing a nest egg in the next world.Match Point is a millennial fable about class, the unpredictable reversals of destiny, the base thirst for gaining access to the social echelons, and living with skeletons in the closet. And this shifty fable of social luxury merges Allen's droll scripting with the puzzlement and difficulty of making such crucial life choices. Our main character likes the easy life he's married into but is claustrophobic. He's a character who gives us no traditional, conventional or ethical reason to care about him, but we follow him and hope that he gets what he wants. It's not that what he wants is bad, it's that it's a shame that that's what he wants. But this is his life at thispoint. This is all he, and we, have. What difference does the outside world's morality make if the outside world has no bearing on his truest feelings and doings.It's a silky ethical dilemma, well thought out to its very last shot. Much of the story's friction grows from the expectation that our man will soon be exposed. This genre anticipation is generally gratified in stories concerning infidelity, deceit or higher crimes. Also, not that this is by any means one of his comic efforts, Allen also draws on the British setting to infuse a dormant sort of social satire technically reminiscent of a comedy of manners, which also brings the convention of a class impostor. Allen outwits the anticipated finale by having the decisive clincher work opposite its conventional purpose as the straw in the wind.It's this understatedly amusing and roguish attitude merged with such an acutely urbane and stately atmosphere that makes Match Point not actually a homecoming to form for Woody Allen but one of growth: an elegant piece of gliding camera movements, artfully composed shots and seamless edits. He gives conceptions of his characters and tensions with palpable sharpness. But honestly, Match Point is a story intended more to demonstrate a line of reasoning than to observe a societal situation or a certain cast of characters. It is one of the very few film experiences that is at once an object of scholarship---an exemplary merged perspective of the contemporary cultural and environmental situation as a psychological and anthropological school of thought---as well as a seamlessly inflected emotional experience---insatiably carnal abandon, crossed with the pervasive social pressure for gaining right of entry to privilege and money, and living with shameful secrets you can never, ever, share or confess to anyone, that you must carry with you to your grave, when you cease to exist.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Match Point (2005) ***,"A young Irish tennis instructor marries a woman he's not very much in love with to gain prominence through her family, but begins to have a fling with an American girl (Scarlett Johansson) and then a real dilemma he has to contend with. This glorified Woody Allen film really lived up to its hype. All I figured going in was that it was going to be a love story with a boring tennis backdrop, but I got a lot more than I bargained for, especially with the wild direction things took later in the story ... I never expected it.I loved the camera work here, a lot of really beautiful cinematic touches. It helped a lot that the story takes place in England, which is a much-welcome break from Allen's typical Manhattan scenarios and affords an opportunity for some very nice scenic touches. The sex scenes are hot and steamy, and it's a credit to Allen that he manages to make them so exciting even without resorting to showing blatant nudity.Scarlett Johansson is physically beautiful, but she leaves something to be desired for me in the acting department, at least during the first half (she got better later). The real star of the piece is Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the tennis pro whose life is in turmoil. He's just superb and runs the gamut with a varying degree of emotions in a multi-layered character. And I'm glad there wasn't too much tennis in this! I had feared the worst on that score from the start. This is a great achievement for Woody Allen, one of the best films he's ever done, and a triumph he needed in recent years. It's so different from most of his other movies. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film could have been great!,"Match Point is a wonderful story that is expertly filmed and told but is marred somewhat by some corny dialogue and a central passionate affair that fails to truly convince.I am a huge fan of Scarlett Johansson ever since her wonderful understated performance in Lost in Translation.She gave similar very good performances in Love song for Bobby Long and In Good Company.However,this role called for a much larger emotional range(Obsession,lust,anger etc..) and I feel she comes up short. Similarly, Jonathan Rhys Meyers fails to convey the emotional nuances of his character.As such the fire of their affair is not convincing. Indeed, I had the feeling they didn't really get along.Adding to this were some awfully mundane interchanges(the table tennis scene made me cringe).Overall though, this is a wonderful story and a masterful plot with great twists and turns.The support cast is excellent and the locations and photography are stunning.In the end however, I was left feeling that with a more inspired casting of the leads(say Naomi Watts and Jude Law)who could exhibit more emotional range, as well as some minor writing changes,could have turned a good film into a a great psychodrama/thriller of Double Indemnity proportions.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Match Point"" is a taut, compelling, and darkly dramatic suspense film.","I read that ""Match Point"" is Mr. Allen's favorite of his own films, and while I agree that this film is one of the best non-comedic dramatic films I have seen by any writer or director, it did not have the joyous humor of ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"", which is currently my overall favorite film by Allen.Of course, it is really not fair to compare a tense, film-noir style psychodrama like ""Match Point"" against a hilarious love quadrangle like ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"". Both films have fully-developed characters, and intricate, interesting plots, with strong philosophical undercurrents. Both are masterpieces of film writing and directing. Both are must-see films for any lover of great films.But a riotous love comedy, like ""Barcelona"", leaves you feeling happy, having laughed hard for many minutes, and reflective of deeper philosophical questions raised by the film. A great film-noir suspense film, like ""Match Point"", also raises important philosophical questions, but necessarily leaves the viewer in a more somber, saddened mood.This is why Woody Allen will always be loved more for his comedies than for his dramas.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

He cares only for himself and the benefits he can gain from his relationship with others. This film left me with a terrible, empty feeling. The ending was depressing, not pleasant at all.

A must watch - who knew Woody had it in him?,Woody Allen is so versatile that he has written and directed an almost perfect drama thriller. I don't even see his usual neurotic dialog or characters. What you get is a totally convincing and entirely engrossing movie.Jonathan Rhys Meyers acts superbly and you really feel his anxiety. Scarlett is very suited to the role and perfectly annoying at the same time. I'm so glad Woody has taken on London. You get the best of Polanski realism and detail and Hitchcock like enjoyability and pleasant non gory tension. But the best aspect is how he makes you feel so much on the side of the central figure played by Rhys Meyers.A must watch. It's one of those you want to watch again for the detail. Just loved this dark fable and the vintage operatic score.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
""" I just want him to be lucky"".","Match Point deals with former tennis player and social climber ( Rhys- Meyers) relationship with his fiancée come wife (Mortimer) and mistress ( Johansen) who happens to be the ex of his brother in law ( Goode). There is a very real and authentic feel to the film and realistic and crackling dialogue. The movie explores the ideas of wealth, murder, and lust but what puts it ahead of most others is the way it also examines the idea of ""chance"". The movie carefully threads the idea that luck is more critical to success than people care to believe. The film has a thriller feel, especially with Rhys- Meyers juggling the two women and this results in a shocking plan and conclusion. The film is wrapped up perhaps a bit too abruptly but is nevertheless satisfyingly ended. The acting by all is top notch including support acts Cox ( father in law and boss), Wilton ( mother in law) and Nesbit ( detective). One of Allen's better outings . A must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A change of environment proves lucky for Woody Allen,"Every film that Woody Allen releases is automatically a point of interest for me, especially when the film in question has won itself a lot of favourable reviews. Match Point sees Allen in new territory as his beloved New York has been swapped for London, England. Despite this relocation, however, Match Point is still very clearly a Woody Allen film. The film is mostly a romantic drama, but as the story moves forward; thriller elements start to creep through, and best of all we get a very potent streak of black humour to round things off. The plot typically features the central character in turmoil. We are introduced to former tennis star turned coach, Chris Wilton. He's looking for a meaning to his life and wants to do something different from tennis. After meeting a man named Tom, Chris finds himself the object of Tom's sister Chloe's affections. However, our tennis star has his eyes on Tom's finance; Nola. After having an affair with Nola, Chris finds himself at decision-making time. Because as we all know; you can't have two women for long.The film starts off with a sequence in which the protagonist tells us about a tennis ball hitting the top of a net during a game. If it carries on going, your luck is in; but if it falls back, it isn't. Woody Allen keeps this luck theme going throughout the film, and the way that he harks back to the opening scene towards the end of the film is just great. Being from the UK myself, I was interested to see how Allen would handle the London setting. I've got to say, however, that I'm a bit upset about the fact that he has decided to set the film in the upper crust of society. It's not so difficult for me to relate to upper class New York because I'm not from America; but as far as I'm concerned, the environment seen in this film doesn't really exist...but at least the English characters have English accents. The acting is fine, with Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing well in the lead role and hitting all the right notes as his character changes his stripes later on. Scarlett Johansson is his opposite number and delivers an emotional portrayal as the put-upon mistress, while Emily Mortimer is suitably posh to round off the central threesome. I loved the way the tale climaxes and I'm glad that Allen didn't continue along the lines that many films of this nature are happy to stay between. Overall, I can't say that this is Allen's best effort; but it's a very good one, and the director has been showing good consistency over the last few years.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A place in the sun across the channel.,"Woody Allen is treading down a familiar path. Lower class boy meets rich girl, and uses her to get ahead, but is sidetracked along the way by his libido. The question is can Allen do the subject as well, or better than it's forebears. Two movies come to mind: ""A place in the Sun,"" and ""Room at the top."" Both are classics, the first an American version of Dreiser's: ""An American tragedy,"" starring Montgomery Clift. The second a gritty British version starring Laurence Harvey as the unforgettable Joe Lampton. The answer is: no, not by a long shot!A tennis pro (Myers), at a posh British Country club, gets invited by one of his clients to the Opera with his rich family. Our hero meets the client's sister, and she takes a romantic interest in him. Our hero sees his opportunity and let's it take him where it can do him the most good, which is out of Tennis and into the boardroom.Allen chooses to go softly and slowly into this story, and it takes awhile for the story to get under one's skin. That moment is the arrival of Scarlett Johansen, his girlfriend's, brother's, fiancée; and our hero's immediate beeline towards her. Now we know that he isn't simply trying to get ahead, he is trying to have it all, and in so doing the only question left unanswered is how self destructive are his demons? Allen wrote the screenplay as well as directed, often a difficult combination to pull off. But then, that is his métier! The problem I had with the script is that too often we can see the actor's struggling to make the words come out naturally. Johansen struggles the most, perhaps because she is not a great actress, or perhaps because Allen gives her lines that are more in place on stage.Meyers struggles as well, in part because he is surrounded by more accomplished British professionals, and in part because he is not really up for the kind of nuanced performance required of him. But ultimately the main fault is Allen's, because he wants to give us a movie about the pit falls of ambition, and all we get is a rather mediocre morality play. In the end Meyer's character is not nearly as dangerous as Joe Lampton, nor as tragic as Clift's. So what he leaves us with is a nice little twist at the end, that somehow manages to come off too easily and too patly.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shoot The Pianist,"Having run out of backers in the USA, Woody Allen came to England to shoot this film for the BBC. Maybe his paymasters influenced the treatment because this film turns out to be exactly like the sort of pap that the BBC serves up every every night of the week and particularly on Sundays. After a hard week's work you let your brain have an early night and settle down to watch a BBC drama with implausible plotting and cardboard characters inhabiting an English middle-class never-never land. One is tempted to think that Woody is having a joke at his paymasters' expense but that is probably being too charitable.Some critics have complained about the wooden acting but, again, it is no worse than you see on British television. Anyway, the dialogue is so implausible that it is best delivered by mediocre actors. Saddest for me was seeing the embarrassment of a great actor, Brian Cox, having to deliver lines such as ""He's right Helen  I think you've had one too many G and Ts"".The theme is loosely based on the plot of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. In fact we see the protagonist Chris reading this novel early on in the film. It reminds me that one of Woody's greatest films, Crimes and Misdemeanours also took the Dostoevsky novel as its starting point. What really upsets me, seeing this phony film, is the thought that, maybe, all Woody's wonderful Manhatten-set films are equally phony and I only think they sound authentic from my ignorant English viewpoint. That gets me thinking that, maybe, many of the masterpieces of world cinema that I so admire are phony too. It's a sobering thought. Woody has a lot to answer for.Plenty of other reviewers have given examples of Woody's ignorance of all things English in making this film so I will end with just one. On several occasions we see our middle class family in their box at Covent Garden and twice we get a glimpse of the performance on stage, of La Traviata and Rigoletto. On both these occasions, the opera is accompanied solely by a badly played piano. I know British opera houses are a bit strapped for cash but I have never heard of one having to put on an opera without an orchestra.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Smart, tense, but not quite 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'","Intelligent, tense, frosty drama with thriller overtones.It's very good, but three things hold it back from being flat out terrific: 1) Scarlett Johanssen is fair in a role that needed somebody great. She's sexy all right, but there's a necessary layer of complexity missing. 2) There are some big logic holes in the last 1/3 that rely on us buying a lot of coincidence and 3) Allen has basically already made the same film much more deeply and inventively in Crimes and Misdemeanors.Still, for all it's flaws, one of the better and more interesting films of 2005.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Crimes & Misdemeanors Revisited,"Woody Allen has a gift. He is able to make the most mundane of movies interesting by simply adding in an extra layer for viewers to ponder. No matter how lengthy certain scenes, even if the first hour is bereft of any major revelations, Allen has a knack of implanting an engaging idea in the first few minutes of film, and keeping the viewer glued to the screen, waiting for the root idea to germinate into an awe-inspiring finale. While critics have blasted the director for regurgitating the same ideas over the years, Match Point proves that an old idea can be injected with new life, brought back from the dead to create a new and exciting experience. Ditching the usual New York locale, Woody Allen takes on London in what is definitely one of his greatest works.Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Bend It Like Beckham) plays Chris Wilton, a man of Irish descent come to London to work as a tennis trainer for company bigwigs. Of modest wealth, Chris quickly makes it big as he starts to date a rich executive's daughter and is soon asked to work in the company. His new family treats him very well, and has seemed to settle into a luxurious and safe life. This sense of balance is disrupted upon the arrival of American Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a sultry wannabe-actress dating a member of the family. What follows is a classic Woody Allen affair scenario, filled with close calls and sexy encounters, soul-searching and the rest. It is in this first portion of the film where viewers familiar with Allen's work are likely to roll their eyes in knowing boredom. Thankfully, the first few minutes of film introduce a wild card: in the game of tennis, when the ball hits the net, there is a moment of time in which the ball could fall either backwards or forwards; luck decides what course the ball will take. It is this simple idea that makes the first hour more endurable, that creates a need to know where the equation gets plugged in.Woody Allen makes an excellent move after the lengthy setup sequences. While the affair scenario sparks a quiet interest in the viewer who is constantly waiting for the punchline, Allen makes a twist that changes the entire feel and emotion of the film. The twist is poignant; I found myself glued to my seat in utter confusion, aghast at the turn of events, until the very end of the film where it twists once again to create one of the most satisfying conclusions of any recent movie. The one-two punch breaks the fabric of the typical Allen affair film, and with the usual Shakespearean & Dostoevskian overtones, Match Point ends up being one of the most overlooked films of 2005 and signals another classic for Woody Allen's extensive portfolio. We should count ourselves lucky that there are direct-to-screen filmmakers of his quality still in circulation. (9/10 Excellent)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Allen Character in Disguise?,"A talented young Irish tennis professional moves to London and obtains a position at an exclusive tennis club, makes friends with a wealthy member, becomes romantically involved with the member's sister, and then becomes sexually involved with the member's fiancé. The story in nothing new, but it is written and produced with great panache by Woody Allen.Roger Ebert in his review says, ""often he uses a Woody Figure (preferably played by himself) as the hero. Match Point contains no one like Woody Allen "" I find that statement ironic for, as I watched the film, I was thinking that the main character - skillfully played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - is a Woody Allen hero. The only difference is that, in most of Allen's films, the lead character is a somewhat neurotic Jewish man lost in a world of Gentiles whereas in Match Point, the lead character is a somewhat neurotic poor Irishman lost in a world of Englishmen. None-the-less, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perfect for the part of Chris Wilton in the film because he has the ability to appear in many different guises from an innocent boy-like man to the incarnation of pure evil, and the complex character of Wilton offers that full range to the actor. Meyers' acting and Allen's writing and direction keeps you wandering as to the fate of this character all the way to the end of the film.Scarlett Johansson plays Nola Rice, the object of Chris Wilton's adulterous desire, and she is beautiful in both physical appearance and acting skill in the part. Again, we are shown a person whose diverse emotions make her seem a different person at various times in the film.Most of us wear our masks and adjust our behaviors according to our needs and the situation, but the characters in Match Point - particularly the two major characters - have honed that skill to absolute perfection. As Mr. Ebert also states, ""each and every character is rotten"" I didn't find them all totally rotten - some are just a little on the gamey side. Without likable or admirable characters, the captivation and brilliance of the film is that Woody Allen has given us these people, shown us what they do, and then lets us see the realistic - not moralistic - results.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Clever, Modern interpretation of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.","Easily one of the best films Woody Allen has created in quite a long time. He's finally decided to take the scene somewhere else, besides the streets of New York City. He adds a new flair and taste to this film by placing it in London. You'd almost not know it was a Woody Allen film. I don't know if this is him being somewhat experimental or if it's just his way of trying to make an excellent interpretation without destroying it by injecting to much ""Woody"". Whatever it is, it works, and this was quite a good film.The first 75% percent of the movie is dedicated to learning who the characters are and is a little boring, until you start getting closer and closer to the characters. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Raskolnikov in this movie, and I wasn't too stunned with his acting. I found him quite dull, not very emotional. His acting stumbled in certain important scenes and he was very blunt at times when he needed to be more refined. He is a young actor however and wasn't that horrible enough to ruin the entire movie. Scarlett Johansson, meanwhile plays the beautiful and promiscuous Nola Rice. In Crime and Punishment Nola's character would probably relate the most to Alyona Ivanovna. She was very sexy, but other then that there was no sparkle in her acting either.The last 20-30 minutes of the movie is where things really start to heat up and where the parallels between ""Match Point"" and ""Crime and Punishment"" become more obvious. Just like the book we get into a deep examination of morality, and if crime is ever a solution to any problems you may face. Woody Allen pays homage to the genius, Fyodor Dostoevsky, in one brief scene where we see Jonathan Rhys Meyers reading Crime and Punishment. Beyoned the scope of Crime and Punishment however, this movie also examines fidelity, and monogamy.It's not an exact 100% copy of the events that occur in Crime and Punishment but the parallels are easily seen if you have read the book. It's a clever modern interpretation, and it works. Even though the acting is a little weak, the story is clever, and the philosophical questions asked are interesting.

The old master still has some tricks up his sleeves.,"The first of his 'unofficial' London trilogy, Woody Allen's Match Point is later followed by Scoop (2006) and Cassandra's Dream (2007), both of which are unrelated to Match Point or to one another other than that they are set in Britain's capital. Critically-acclaimed and considered to be the director's best in a long while, Match Point does not feel like a traditional Allen picture (e.g. the use of British accents, and the lack of the director's 'voice'). Gone also are the witty, neurotic lines of humor and its tragicomic characters.The 1970s and 1980s have seen the Oscar-winning writer-director make one excellent film after another. But a 1990s and early 2000s 'slump' sees him make only an occasional decent picture amid average ones. Match Point is the result of the American filmmaking legend looking into the mirror and realizing a change of formula is essential to keep up with the times. Allen reinvents himself in a surprisingly assured take on the low-key crime-thriller genre camouflaged by a dominant romantic drama that deals with marriage, extramarital affairs, love and lust.The film consists of three principal characters: Chris, Chloe, and Nola. Chris, a hardworking but poor tennis instructor, marries Chloe and is set up for life because his father-in-law is wealthy and has given him a key corporate position in his company. However, Chris' true passion lies with Nola, his brother-in-law's sensuous and insecure fiancée who is struggling as an actress. As Chris gets deeper into his affair with Nola, the latter becomes unpredictable and overpowering, and later becomes a source of tension and frustration for Chris who turns increasingly paranoid to the thought of being exposed.Match Point features sharp analytical writing which conveys very realistically the emotional and psychological states of mind of each major character, especially that of Chris and Nola. The most affecting display comes from Scarlett Johansson whose tortured performance as Nola earns her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. At the beginning, Allen theorizes that when the tennis ball hits the top of the net, with a bit of luck it will drop on your opponent's side and you win. A similar scenario is further explored during the final quarter of the film where luck plays a huge role in determining the fates of people.In an unexpected (and chilling) turn of events near the finale, Allen shows us his skill in misdirection. Up to that point, we are led to believe that we know how the film is going to end, but the old master still has some tricks up his sleeves. His near-brilliant sleigh of hand elevates Match Point to something more than just a decent drama. There are some situational flaws though, which on hindsight could have embarrassed Allen because if the viewer is discerning enough, he or she could see that there are loopholes in the execution of that misdirection sequence. Fortunately for Allen, the ball lands away from him.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
American Psycho Meets Pink Panther,"This is a movie about a schmuck with all the luck. It is somewhat of a drag to watch the first three quarters of the movie about some snotty rich English family with all those money and connections.You are advised to fast-forward if you just can't stand that part and just press Play whenever you see Nola Rice. Basically that is what I did to drag my own corpse of lifeless body to go through the entire torture chamber. Honestly, the movie could be edited out that rich welfare estate. But still, this would not hurt a movie, much like those porn movie where you have to fast forward also!Basically you will be just as stupid before you came into the theater as you do when you leave it. Therefore it is my point to you to just enjoy the ride. The most important segment of the film that could turn you belly up in rating this movie from ""decent"" to one ""of art"" is perhaps Nola Rice demands and the Irish cops! The Pink Panther of comedy near the end is the part at least I enjoy the most, it is a comedy of errors, and no doubt, it is probably Inspector Clouseau's wet dream!I thoroughly enjoyed this incompetent cops as funny and refreshing as the Edward Blake's Pink Panther movies. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I press replay at least 4 times and thoroughly enjoyed that segment! I laughed - a rarity these days when you watch a serious drama! Something that only Woody Allen genius could show!You are strongly advised to make up your own ending and decide yourself, if faced with a paradox of getting Passionate love with Nola Rice and a Rich Wealthy wife, when faced with such choice who would you choose yourself. This movie is not going to answer this and I strongly advised NOT to cheat on such exams!For me - my answer is a simple one: Perhaps I would either convert (or proclaim my life long secret to my wife that ) my religion is of Islamic or a Mormon faith, either way, I can get more than one wife! Again not an answer either! The same silly things you would get from the movie, but the big differences is that I am an unknown, and Woody Allen is an established director. Hmmm. Some people just have all the luck, which goes to tell you what this movie is all about!Enjoy yourself, don't take this movie seriously.

The ball is in your court 8/10,"Match Point is another well achieved and beautiful film by the master himself: Woody Allen. Although throughout watching it I've noticed it is written differently.In all of Allen's movies there is a smart sort of writing, his movies have different types of dialogue composed by smart - ass comments, catchy lines and remarks every once in a while. If you've seen ""Annie Hall"" or ""A Rainy Day in New York"" you've noticed how the characters throw remarks at each other during their dialogue. In Match Point the dialogue is way more simple, stays clear and subtle.The story is as Allen as you would expect: A man who's married to his friend's sister falls in love with his friend's fiance. Quite a generic story for a Allen movie. The movie offers two possible ways it would end: either the main character Chris Wilton (Johnathan Ryhs Myers) loses his job and reputation but lives with Nola (Scarlett Johansson) or he breaks up with Nola and stays in his comfortable life and regrets it for his life (which is the case in many of Allen's films). I admit I'm a bit surprised by the way Chris chooses to act near the end of the film, and of course he is saved from punishment but lives to regret the life he's chosen (as I anticipated will happen in the end).The monolog Chris gives at the start of the film is another lesson for life, the speech about the tennis ball hitting the net and either falling on your side or the opponent's side. The same speech is reflected in the end of the film and showcases chris's luck. Amplifying how in life you should have luck on your side as well as success.Beautiful film, great filming and colors mixed to captivate the lovely tone of the movie.

A good film--but no masterpiece,A Woody Allen film shot in London! An retired Irish tennis star Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) quits the circuit and takes a job teaching rich people how to play. He becomes friends with VERY rich Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and starts romancing his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Then he meets Tom's girlfriend Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and falls in lust for her...This isn't a comedy. It's a very grim tale of adultery. This has been praised as a comeback for Woody Allen--his last few films have been laugh less comedies. It's also been described as a masterpiece. It is good but not THAT good.To be totally honest I don't understand why this is being praised so much. The story is downbeat and moves VERY slowly (this film could easily lose 20 minutes). The affair between Chris and Nola comes out of nowhere--I never believed it for one second. Nola comes off as shrill and having no idea what she wants out of life. Her character is very unlikable--you wonder what Chris sees in her. The film really falls apart during the ending. Nola acts seriously deranged and Chris goes WAY too far. I also saw the resolution coming from a mile away. Also Allen has no feeling at all on how to shoot London. In his New York films you got a real sense of the city--not here in London. Also ALL the characters (with the exception of Nola) are nice--all the time. They're TOO nice. I didn't believe them for one second.The acting really carries this film. Meyers is drop dead handsome and very good in his role. Goode and Mortimer are also good. I didn't like Johansson but that's mostly because of her character.So I don't really like this film but I don't hate it. I was fairly entertained and it was OK. I give it a 7 and that's mostly because of the acting.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Survival of the Luckiest...,"And I thought ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" was cynical because it established the triumph of reason over heart, ""March Point"" is even worse, because Allen finds something more valuable than reason: luck.Speaking of reason, there is a reason why Woody Allen is such a prolific filmmaker, none of his films look for profitability or critical acclaim, he makes what he thinks is good, and it's enough (we're talking of the director who didn't show up in the Oscars when ""Annie Hall"" won the Best Picture Oscar) but it takes many good films to reach once or twice a decade, the 'Nirvana'. Some Allen's movies hit the perfect chord and are so impressively flawless that they always make you feel like you've seen nothing of Allen yet.Out of the forty-something movies he made, I have certainly watched three dozens and well, I wasn't prepared by how good ""Match Point"" would be. Even halfway through the film, I didn't know where it was going, but near the third act, I knew I was watching a Woody Allen film with capital A. The ending made me realize it was more serious than that, it was probably one of his best. I had to watch it a second time then a third time, and I maintain that it's one of his best, and for two reasons.On a technical level (to get through it), this is a film that is flawlessly acted and scenes flow with such fluidity that when you see it again, you can see that there's no detail that doesn't play a pivotal role, yet without its inclusion feeling contrived or artificial. The second aspect is the way the ending makes the beginning's point, the film has a message to tell from the story and it's not until the last five minutes that we realize how brilliantly Allen toyed with our expectations, making the point we expected him to make but not as we thought.I will get back to the story because being too talkative about the ending might spoil the surprise. The film is about an Irish tennis teacher Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a young man with dashing good looks who gets a job in an English country club. He meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), they exchange a few words about music, earning him an immediate invitation to an Opera concert. Tom comes from a rich family (the father, played by Brian Cox ""own"" companies) and they seem to like Chris, and the daughter, Chloe (Emily Mortimer) instantly falls in love with him. He gets Chloe and a job in Daddy's company as collateral gift. This is like Cinderella story in speed motion.And there's no catch actually, this is no Faustian pact of anything of that sort, Chris has basically everything a sensitive man would look for, especially one of his background, a steady job, a loving and pretty wife and money, so Chris is the one who looks for trouble. He meets Nora, Tom's fiancée, a sexy aspiring actress, and it's not love but lust-at-first-sight, Chris is invaded by an immediate and intense desire to possess her. And since their luscious interactions behind the ping pong table, we know it's a matter of time before they succumb to the call of lust, catalyzed by anger, booze and rain.But this sexual intercourse has only intensified his appetite. The situation gets tricky when he realizes he can't renounce his lifestyle either. This is not the Cornelian conflict between duty and passion, but between greed and sex, the two drivers of society. In a way, Chris is the pure embodiment of modernity in its most pervert form, like when he marries Chloe and gets Nora pregnant. I already had feelings of déjà vu but the pregnancy subplot immediately reminded me of a classic of American Cinema ""A Place in the Sun"". Yet the film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, maybe it's a way to acknowledge that the ""American Tragedy"" classic is a universal story with infinite variations.Allen also seems to have borrowed elements from his critically acclaimed ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", which featured a similar situation but was more about religion, moral and the dilemma between reason and conscience. In ""Match Point"", Woody chooses a different angle, a sort of existential tennis match between work and luck. The film opens with the sight of a tennis ball swinging back and forth like so many up and downs that life has to provide and then the ball hits the net and bounce, it's all about the side of the court it will fall in: one means victory, another means defeat.Life is as simple as that and I'm in total agreement because I used to believe in chronically bad luck, on being screwed, but I realized life was made through a few hit-or-miss moments and all the hard work of the world can see its effect canceled if you make the wrong move at the wrong time, sometimes you're lucky, sometimes not but never underestimate the potentiality of luck within the bad luck. Woody Allen who loved to play or portray unlucky schmucks caught in the midst of modernity, focuses here in the case of a particularly lucky character and we wait for the moment it changes. Maybe this is why it doesn't feel like an Allen film, but I'm not even sure there's such a thing as a typical Allen film.I had just seen a masterpiece about 'bad luck' called ""A Serious Man"" and now I have its polar opposite with ""Match Point"". The two movies have interesting things to say about the way we control our own fates, whether under the direction of God or hazard, which also echoes the religious undertones of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", but someone said ""Hazard is the anonymous way to call God"", sometimes, it might be the anonymous way to call the devil as well, and I will say no more.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I love Woody Allen films, but...","First of all, let me state for the record that I am a big Woody Allen fan, and that I totally disagree with the critics who have highly praised this film. Maybe this is just me 'not able to understand', but this was in my opinion just an ordinary film that any decent director could have made, not something worthy of Woody Allen.I think that for Woody Allen to be filming outside urban New York is like Samson going into a fight with his hair cut. It just isn't there, that something that has made most Woody Allen movies so exceptional. In general I believe that it has been a while since Woody Allen has made a film worthy of his greatness.

Exquisitely crafted drama-thriller by Woody,"A match point is, in tennis, the final point needed to win a game. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) points out to us early on that this point is more decided to random chance than anything else, as are most occurrences in the world - and that one little detail can determine your fate, if you're lucky or unlucky. Match Point (2005) is a film constructed almost solely on luck, exquisitely balancing on tiptoes throughout and sometimes being unbearably exciting because of it.""I don't fool myself that I've gotten used to a certain kind of living.""So says Chris, who is living a comfortable life with his extraordinarily well-off wife, enjoying the luxury and stability that her family affords him. What takes him and shakes him off this balance--off his stable tiptoes--is the beautiful Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) and the two engage in a romantic affair that Chris struggles to hide from his wife.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers successfully captures the inner turmoil of his character and being in every scene of the film, we truly sympathise with him and I found myself totally engrossed in his struggle to juggle two women and all the problems that this brought with it. Scarlett Johansson is a mediocre actress here at best, delivering her dynamic Woody Allen-written lines with less conviction and less subtlety than the rest of the cast - but it is her gorgeous looks that propel the film because, in truth, this is all that is needed of her character as 'the other woman'.Match Point spirals into a complex story by Woody Allen, but it is extremely well-crafted, paying great attention to little details and dialogue. It is seductive without playing too much on sex, as the trailer suggests. The long-drawn scenes were all compelling to watch and felt swift and poignant. I loved nearly everything about it, except for the tedious opera music that was playing in the background - it felt as though that device had already been used, and probably by Woody Allen himself.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nonsensical Thriller,"Ridiculous thriller with an entirely unconvincing feel. I haven't lived in London for some time but it's nothing like the city in this movie. It reminds me of Hitchcock's late film Frenzy, also set in London, but a London that hadn't existed since the 30s. And the plot! None of it holds together for a moment. Who are these rich people? They don't behave like aristos. They don't talk like them. Are they nouveau riche? But they have the habits of old money. Or at least the pretensions. And how can an American actress be working in the UK? The union wouldn't let her. She seems to support herself effortlessly on one commercial? Do you know what that would pay? And JRD is just not up to it. Perhaps not his fault. The acting is never anything but functional. And all the opera malarkey is only there to add a specious gloss of culture and scale.A dismal little film. I was only thankful he wasn't in it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen's Surefooted Noir,"Some delightful things are happening in Woody Allen's new movie and, even though there are points of similarity with previous films in the septuagenarian's filmography, this is a red-blooded, raw, and--yes--refreshing addition to his cannon.It was always questionable whether Allen's blend of comedy and drama (even tragedy) was effective or legitimate in a filmic sense. He did great WOODY ALLEN movies, didn't he? And no one was particularly dazzled by the ambitious filmmaker's sleight of hand. His ""thesis"" was never accepted by the filmgoing public as completely valid...even early in his career, starting with the Bergman pastische, INTERIORS, in 1977; the desire of the director to wear masks and disguise his work or dress it up were always--at once--recognized as posing. Eventually, the hallmark dramedy of Allen's peculiar variety became all his own. This was best exemplified by 1989's CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, where the balance was, in fact, perfect, and Allen's weighty moralizing was leavened with fey one-liners and sight gags.Which brings us to MATCH POINT. This is Allen's most confident and controlled direction since (at least)1999's SWEET AND LOWDOWN and, like its closest cousin, CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, MATCH POINT again asks whether morality and human desire are acquaintances....or complete strangers.Allen's first grace note is placing the story in modern London, and cinephiles cannot help but remember that Hitchcock, in the twilight of his career, returned to London for the salacious murder-mystery of FRENZY. The analogy is apt since Allen firmly inhabits the other Master's realm of suspense, leaving the viewer to wonder if Allen's best amalgam of comedy and tragedy resides here... in a resurrected brand of film noir: both highly artificial and heightened in its store of cinematic effects. There are also echoes of Patricia Highsmith (Hitch's collaborator on STRANGERS ON A TRAIN), particularly in the chance meeting of two attractive young men, the motif of tennis (Hitchcock again), and in Chris Wilton's dark, rather Ripley-like anti-hero (Highsmith).Allen's second success is in the writing and casting of Chris Wilton: a vain, selfish, greedy, and overly-ambitious young man (just as those great 1960's and '70's film anti-heroes used to be!) played with surly abandon by a post-Elvis Jonathan Rhys Meyers. His work is engaging and spirited, and there's an animal-like cunning there reminiscent of a young Malcolm McDowell. Because Allen makes Wilton our protagonist and point of identification, we have no choice but to root for one of the coldest users to come our way since Highsmith's Ripley. This is not pure noir since there is little redeeming in Chris, but the structure (no spoilers!) closely follows all the convolutions of a noir where our young, morally-compromised, ""hero"" gets himself into a mess, tries to extract himself, and gets in even deeper as a result. How Allen ends the film is one of the confident masterstrokes which makes MATCH POINT such an engaging entertainment. (I saw it in a crowded theater and the audible gasps of appreciation at its suspense were the highest compliment that can be paid a director.)Along the way we have wonderful character performances by Emily Mortimer as the clueless fiancée, Brian Cox as the benevolent papa, and a pair of sterling comic performances by Ewen Bremner and James Nesbitt as the clever detectives. (Even Scarlett Johanssen provides the right notes in her portrayal of Nola.) It's all well-blended with the sort of location detail that enhanced many New York-based Allen movies, as well as a moody soundtrack soaring with the arias of Verdi. The dialogue, even spoken by British accents, doesn't entirely lose Allen's resonances, but this is a small complaint, and one of no great importance, in the tight unfolding of this suspenseful noir story.This was the right movie for Allen to make at this point in his career. He comes to the material as both a film fan, and as a proved auteur, who can use reliable cinematic effects to create a true suspense highlight in a long and already-impressive filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Excellent Film that almost no one will actually want to see.,"* * * ½ Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), a young but retired pro tennis player who now teaches the sport has a romantic spark with Chloe (Emily Mortimer), the sister of one of his clients, Tom (Matthew Goode). She falls deeply for him, and he kind of does for her until he meets Tom's fiancée, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), with whom he becomes obsessed. He eventually marries Chloe anyway, but goes on a reckless path that will take him down a more tragic hole than he ever imagined.This London-set Woody Allen thriller --- woah, woah woah, wait a second. Woody Allen thriller?! A Woody Allen film set in London?! The world must be coming to an end.Of course, I didn't laugh all that often during his films anyway, but I digress.Actually, it's a cold, dark, realistic, slowly-paced (a little too slow) character drama that turns into a heck of a thriller in the last third. For the first part, Allen keeps the relationships utterly believable. Never once does the film get soap opera-ish, melodramatic, or less than three-dimensional. And because of the total realism and the passions the characters show, it's involving in spite of its cold harshness. Rhys-Meyers and Johannson are both superb, perfectly showing ever facet of their characters and completely disappearing into them. The supporting cast does the same.And then, it twists into an absolutely riviting, heart-pounding thriller. Allen the writer gives Allen the director something to play with, and he does it brilliantly. The climactic scene is one of the most intense moments ever filmed in spite of how low-key it is. It's really stunning.And both parts --- the drama and the thriller --- are a series of emotional punches to both the head and the heart. In short, in spite of the film's flaws (primarily it's slightly too-slow pace), it's a truly excellent film.And, now that I've praised it like nothing else, I'm going to tell you that you probably don't want to watch it.Why? Because it really is a slow, realistic, super-art house flick. If it isn't your kind of film, stay away. It's only kind of my sort of film, and I really liked it, but I'm more open to this kind of film than most people.And, because it's one of those films where the point is that there is no point in life, it's completely unsatisfying unless you are totally cynical.(Now, from Allen's worldview, that's a totally logical conclusion. I don't agree, but we the world very differently, and this shows that he's very observant about the way the world works.) And Woody Allen fans won't like it, at least not if they're expecting an Allen film. It's dead serious. There's practically no humor whatsoever (appropriately).So, anyway, it's an excellent movie that, chances are, you do not want to see. But if you like deadly-serious films that take a lot of patience and effort to watch but reward that patience with powerful emotional responses and stomach-churning suspense, you should love it.As for the other 99.9% of you out there, run, don't walk, in the opposite direction from the film. You will fall asleep, miss the good parts, and your snoring will create enemies out of everyone else in the theater.Both of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No it's not a masterpiece, it's just okay.","I read somewhere someone pretending Match Point is a masterpiece. Well let's just not exagerate please, it's certainly not a masterpiece, far from it. The first part is really slow and a bit boring if I have to be honest. There is of course a sexual tension whenever Scarlett Johansson enters a room, for that she's just too beautiful and elegant, so you could say she has a major part in the success this movie has. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' character adds to the tension by it's obsession with Scarlett Johansson. The story is watchable but a bit more thrilling moments would have been better. I'm not a huge fan of Woody Allen and it's not this movie that's going to change my mind. It isn't bad though, but nothing that I will remember.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Best movie of 2005, hands down","The perfectly fine Crash may have taken the Oscar, and equally good Brokeback Mountain most other awards, but I would say that Woody Allen's first London film was without a shadow of a doubt the best one I saw last year. It is one of the very best Allen has ever made, and that's saying a lot given the man's impressive record. It just kept me constantly on the edge of my seat, asking ""will he or won't he?"" at every turn, at every situation and every decision that the despicable character Chris Wilton had to face (and the terrible thing was that I'm pretty sure myself I would not be able to resist the temptation posed by Scarlett Johansson's ravishing beauty, so I couldn't help but empathize with his predicament a bit...). And the ending. Oh my God. What an ending. I didn't see that coming and it was fantastically clever. The film really drove the (very real) point home of how luck plays such a part in everybody's lives...The only weak link in this masterpiece was Jonathan Rhys Meyers's performance; I found him flat and at times not quite believable in his delivery. My girlfriend suggested that this might be due to his efforts not to speak with his Irish accent, and it might be true, for he speaks with an English accent (which is weird, because his character is supposed to be Irish!). This minor glitch is what reduces my grade for the movie to a 9 instead of a perfect 10, but it is minor enough for me to still consider it a masterpiece and recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Average Joe's review - more interesting than entertaining.,"MATCH POINT - written & directed by Woody AllenThis movie is set in London, and has the style of a foreign film. While I understood beforehand that this was a romantic drama, those expecting some of trademark Allen's humor throughout this movie will be disappointed. There is none. What does this movie offer? There is Scarlett Johansson's voluptuous presence, playing an aspiring actress from Boulder, Colorado. And for those with enough patience, there is some romantic intrigue to resolve.Unfortunately, for most of the American public, without a generous curiosity for upper class British style, these character's dialogue is very cold, dry, and emotionless. Even Johansson's character seems to be a bit overdone in this regard until deep into the film, and to criticize Allen, some of the early romantic repartee seems forced and flounders a bit.Which makes one wonder what Allen's motivation for making this film was. Most Americans have no access to or knowledge of upper crust British society - could Allen could be condemning their detached and aloof style with this film? These British characters are generally sedated throughout and seems entirely oblivious to current events.The focus of the drama, an Irish, former tennis pro named Chris, seems a bit too wrapped up in his chauvinist understanding of philosophy and literature to see the situation he is wrapped up in straight. Women too have the ability to have absorbed the wisdom of philosophy by this, the 21st century, and have a good amount of common sense in general, and Chris unfortunately tries to make all the decisions in this own head without relying on anyone else. The passion implied by his humble past sets up the drama for the film.(Note: one must be alert to notice the scene early in the film when it is mentioned the one and only time that tennis was a way of escape for him from poverty, especially as his manner and speech are on par with any of the upper class company he keeps.)Ultimately I doubt most of the American public would be able to stand how robotic the speech of these Brits is, and so unless you are a fan of foreign films in general, vis a vis a person with two hours of patience to blow for the small reward of a reasonably interesting comment on youth and foolish passion, I suggest you stay away. An interesting but not entirely entertaining film that I suspect to be aimed mostly at the British public and the coolness of their quasi-democratic society.If you are going to see Scarlett Johansson, you will have to wait for her to find another vehicle to titillate your senses; Allen is all for his message and the sex scenes are gone before they begin to smolder at all. The way she looks now they might have memorable. ----- 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie,"The theme of although skill is involved, but luck does have something to do with it was apparent in almost every aspect for Chris. He starts out in the movie as a tennis instructor, and eventually gets a job at a business firm from one of his clients/girlfriends father. You think life couldn't get better for this guy until he gets a mistress, in which no one suspects him with. The movie flawlessly binds his day to day life as a loving husband and business man while he also is shown as a desperate fool at the end of his rope looking for a way out. Scarlett Johanson's performance was flawless as Nola who was also Chris' mistress and once business partners fiancé. This is a great movie about desperation and lust. It should be viewed by all and is in my opinion Woody Allen's best directorial job I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

You can figure out by this, that I am not especially fond of Allen's oeuvre. But from the opening shot on I was seized! Calm eloquence, daring but subtle profoundness, a balanced camera POV, the perfect set up. This was going to bee ancient Greek drama. And indeed it was! No spoof! Any judgment on good or bad would be superficial. This movie is beyond. With all its conceitedness. The cast, the story, the camera; it all fits together as if Moving Pictures were reinvented like it was with Grapes of Wrath, Citizen Kane, Spartacus, Apocalypse Now, 2001 Space Odyssee, A Bout de Soufflé... and other key notes in cinema history. You can criticize on details, on taste, but in the end that doesn't matter at all, because the movie is aleatoric multi-layered with metaphors. This time, for me on long- term, as a monument for the disintegration of our culture, but also as a sign of the decline of movie pictures. These are the things you ""cannot do on stage anymore"" (as the late Frank Zappa would have said).

surprisingly good,"Given the sexy, suspense thriller image that marketers have created for this movie I went into it expecting something formulaic, high on action and sex and low on character development. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a thought-provoking story driven by subtle characterizations and allusions to Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. The interactions of the characters are intriguing to watch and grounded in realism and the acting is mostly strong throughout.A voice-over at the beginning suggests that luck may be more of a determining factor in life than is often thought and the events which follow support this central idea. At the same time the film explores the familiar themes of obsession and love vs. ambition. Whether the movie intends to be taken seriously with respect to any of these themes is hard to tell. Unfortunately any serious artistic aims are undermined towards the end, where real-life credibility takes a back-seat the clever machinations of the plot.Though artistically less sound, this movie is nevertheless a worthwhile ride as it manages to be both very entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What if Roskolnikov was blessed with a little luck?,"What if Roskolnikov was blessed with a little luck? Woody Allen's brilliant rendition of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Match Point (2005), comes close to answering that question. The film is a quiet abandon of Allen's classic style of quirky and paranoiac storytelling. The staple concrete Manhattan backdrop, that we have come to expect from a Woody Allen flick, has been replaced by the damp grey-white overcast of the London sky. Even the cartoonish banter between the classic Woody Allen characters has taken a side-seat to highly textured dialogue between multidimensional characters. All in all, if it weren't for the ten-second flash of his name in the opening credits, I would have never guessed that Woody Allen wrote and directed this film.We first meet the protagonist Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a modern-day Roskolnikov, and would-be tennis pro turn tennis instructor, as he enters the filthy-rich world of British aristocracy. We see Chris as a self-made Irishman, who rises from the poorness of his background learning to play the rich man's game  tennis. He soon befriends Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode) and is introduced into the life of upper-class decadence, during which he meets, and becomes romantically involved with, Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris's will is slowly bent, as he is coerced into the Hewitt family business. During this time, he chances upon the breathtaking Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), the fiancée of Tom Hewitt. Soon begins a carefully constructed love-triangle, which through a very Hitchcock-like style of suspense, is cast into motion, one step ahead of the viewer. The anxiety once donned by the classic Woody Allan character, is now offered to the audience to wear, and just like a tennis ball in a rally, the spectator is made to watch the tension bounce back and forth from one character to another.I'm normally not a big fan of Woody Allan movies, however Match Point definitely surpassed all my expectations. Many critics have viewed this work as proof of the fading director's resurrection. I view it as a piece of solid storytelling from a one of the greatest directors of our time in the winter of his career. Match Point is one of the best films to come out of 2005. Obviously, the movie is not for the average moviegoer, but if you are a fan of fine film-making, definitely check it out.Similar movies: Closer (2004), Rope (1948), Last Tango in Paris (1972), Sabrina (1954), In Good Company (2004), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
If this movie were a tennis player it would be Tim Henman.,"Whilst watching this movie we were forced to actually pause it on at least four occasions to allow ourselves time to recover from the awfulness of this film. The characters were irritating, two-dimensional and unbelievable, and the acting was atrocious throughout. It was only beaten by the dialogue - usually a sure thing in WA movies - which seemed to have been written by some fantasising 15 year old.Normally we find IMDb ratings to be a fair indication of whether a film is worth the time, but on this occasion cannot understand who would rate this film highly. My only thought is that it can only be getting votes from people who would love to come to England and think this is what it is really like over here.Woody Allen should stick to playing his saxophone and watch his old classics on VHS. It's very sad to see him putting out a film that would have not even made it past a script agent's wastebasket had it not had his name on the front.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is a very interesting film with great acting from the whole cast especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer. The screenplay written by Allen was pretty original actually and most of the dialogue was neatly written out. The direction also was good and I like some of the camera shots that Allen pulled out. I like how the film was pretty sappy in the beginning and as things start to turn out bad halfway through, it got darker and built up a lot of suspense. Usually Woody Allen makes comedies and happy ending romances but this is a totally different outlook on his films.

Match Point is worth your time (maybe on DVD),"I'd like to ""review"" it for you, but I'm afraid I'd give something away. So I'll just say it's very well acted (could be slightly better) and beautiful to look at. The story is twisted but long. There's a lot of ground to cover, and just when you think it's going to end or that you've figured out how it will end, you get thrown for a loop. Scarlett Johansson is so gorgeous, you can't take your eyes off of her. But she seems out of place being an American in a English movie. I almost feel like Woody Allen (the writer/director) wanted to cast Scarlet but wasn't sure if she could pull off a successful English accent, because of her deep American voice. So he made up this ridiculous sub-plot of her finding her acting roots in London. Regardless she's absolutely great and so is the cast. I particularly I think that Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer did a great job. Mortimer's perky oh-so-sweet way was a little off putting but she played it very convincingly. Goode seemed to understand his character the best, (even better then the lead played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) when he spoke I truly felt he knew what he was saying.

Merely a more modern version of Allen's typical dark and passion-filled drama,"Woody Allen's comedic films and darker films are both very distinct, but very similar within each genre, and while the film begins as something much different in the drama realm, it turns out to be Allen relying on his strengths, simply from a more modern point of view.In ""Match Point,"" Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Allen's troubled protagonist Chris, a former tennis pro, torn between his love for his wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and all the support her family provides him through his new job, and his undying passion for Nola (Scarlett Johansson), the former fiancée of his brother-in-law (Matthew Goode). Much of the film focuses on Rhys-Meyers figuring out what it is matters most and the drama this causes both his relationships, but then a long ways in turns very dark, Woody Allen dark, much like 1989's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""The films strengths are in the dramatic relationships and events that have a more modern realism to them to keep Allen's style fresh and effective. Thematically, like past Allen films, the movie thrives on the impending choice and consequences Rhys-Meyers will make and deal with as a result. (Ironically he reads ""Crime and Punishment"" along with a reader's guide early in the film.)On the weak side, there is also the theme of luck constantly being pounded in, or as Chris the tennis pro puts it, ""sometimes the ball falls on your side of the court and sometimes it bounces over,"" although tennis, despite the title, hardly plays any role in the film outside of metaphor and symbolism. While luck can be pulled off as a theme, it appears more like a cop out for Allen than an important lesson, as anything can happen if you're lucky enough. Allen does, however, use it effectively through small directorial choices that keep the viewer constantly predicting the consequences of Rhys-Meyers' actions before they occur, and then looking incredibly clever when he throws in luck as a curve ball, but for the most part it seems unrealistic and somewhat bothersome.Aside from the need to be thematically explicit, the film succeeds as a more modern telling of one of Allen's old stories, which in some ways helps the film and hurts the film. The characters are incredibly strong and the passion and tension in the film is very effective, but as a whole the story is rather thematically questionable in terms of whether Allen's sometimes clearly stated ideas are truly as he says they are.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

'Match Point' contains not only outstanding, up and coming acting (Johanssen and Rhys-Meyers), but the music (including those clever choice moments of silence) carries its audience along. As well, while this movie is quite unlike many others credited to Woody Allen, if you desire Allen's natural zest for subtle comedy, stay conscious of the natural witticisms inherent in scene changes. It's important not to get hung up on analysis, however. Be sure to engage emotionally with this film in your initial trial run.

Not bad.,"In short, Whilst i'm generally not into movies like this, i did find it enjoyable.

A sordid love triangle involving his wife, Chloe Hewett Wilton (Emily Mortimer) and a gorgeous Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson).The movie does plenty of character development and has and ending which will surprise most, but overall it's definitely worth checking out if you are having a night in.Despite the slow-paced nature of the film I did find some just seemed to skip months or even a year into the future within the blink of the eye. Also, i think some scenes could have been done without and were probably there to cover any potential plot holes. But i'm just nit-picking.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"it's amazing, it's intelligent","Woody Allen moved to Europe from Manhattan and he did not miss. Here, in Europe, he did a great job. Allen came back to those kinds of movies, that differs from his others (I mean his look-alike sexual comedies). He took at least two masterpieces (Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" and Dryzer's ""American Tragedy"") and mixed them to a brand-new cocktail, that turned out to be an explosive kind of thing. Allen red Dostoevsky's novel visa-versa - from its ending to its beginning, from character's torches of what he has done to the moment when he had actually done it. And it turned out that the story perfectly fits to Dryzer's Tragedy. Well, who else - except a New York intellectual - could possibly do that? Allen creates his own story of what those two great masters has wrote. He shows nowadays reality in his movie and modern character. But the most incredible fact is that Allen does not punish his hero as well as he does not find him guilty. Allen declaims - this what we have - this kind of people, in this kind of world!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A different touch from Mr Allen,"Very interesting plot with good acting. Matthew Goode has a great future, for some reason i always wanted him on screen. He is real. Scarlett and Emily have done fine job. The pace of the movie was good, and kept the interest all the time. In the beginning the chemistry between Scarlett and Jonathan was missing, however it carried well later on. You will definitely talk about this movie after watching it.Direction, music, cinematography, editing and acting is excellent. Presentation of the story is very absorbing and catchy, music is brilliant. Matthew Goode is a fine actor than Jonathan Rhys Meyers.A good one from Mr. Allen once again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A passable story ruined by miscasting,"Rhys-Meyers is talentless. I have never seen such a wooden performance in my life. It's not often that Allen makes such a disastrous mistake. Hopefully we will not have to endure this actor again. Even the usually captivating Johansson is left drifting in this movie as she tries to act against a wooden plank. The story is passable, and the movie is somewhat redeemed by the twist and turns at the end and great performances from James Nesbitt and Ewan Bremner in the last 10 minutes of the movie. However the otherwise strong British cast is inexplicably under utilised. Great character actors such as John Fortune, Rupert Penry Jones and Penelope Wilton are reduced to bit parts with no redeeming dialogue. I am disappointed to say this about a movie by the Master, but my heartfelt advice would be to avoid this movie at all costs. 1/5",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A surprisingly deep and satisfying film,"Match Point is not only a great film, not only a great Woody Allen film, but it's enjoyable on many different levels. What Allen does is to create a whole world in which his characters live and develop. They are very nice characters to look at, listen to, and sympathize with.On a visual level, this is a lush, gorgeous film. Both the main characters are seductive, and dress that way. The locations are just as pretty whether they be downtown London, a tennis club or an estate.The main characters are human with faults, desires, and unreasonable expectations, like us all. It's easy to sympathize with both of the main characters even though they are despicable in so many ways. That is why I think it's a great movie. Anyone can make you like heroes and nice people, it's a lot harder to make you like scoundrels.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Massively entertaining,"It's hard to define the genre. Because it's not a rom-com, it's not a drama and it's not a thriller either. Until a certain point the film is mainly a drama about a man who marries and has an affair (it's a little more complicated than that though) with some comedic hints. But at one point (I'm not gonna give a way when it happens) it turns and becomes a comedy and it works. It works because the characters are extremely shallow and nearly cliché. This allows the comedy to work since you're not extremely into the characters but it also allows the drama to work because society kind of is as depicted in the film and because you're unable to see the thoughts of the characters and have to figure them out by yourself. The film is social satire through it's depiction of the characters and their decisions. But especially the ending is extremely biting.The movie is easily thrilling enough, dramatic enough and witty and it even got some depth. The cinematography is really great and helps establish the mood of the film. All in all it's a great pleasure to watch and I can only recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's the point in a movie like this?,"Frankly, I don't see a point in making a movie like this. The main theme of it is extremely old and boring and was exhausted maybe 20 years ago. There were no performances that would make this movie memorable, either. For an hour and a half I was asking myself, ""Why should I care?"" (still don't know the answer, by the way) and ""When is this going to end?"". With very few exceptions, the dialog is terrible and so is the narrative, very schematic, predictable, and full of stereotypes. I couldn't believe Woody Allen wrote and directed this.So it was, extremely boring and uninspiring, until the plot took a twist in the last thirty minutes. Then there were indeed a few non-stereotypical turns some of which I enjoyed (and they are the only reason I give this movie a 6 instead of a 3) but overall, was this last half an hour worth waiting, dying from boredom in the meantime? Definitely no if you ask me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
People say Woody Allen is back,"But truth is he never went anywhere. Here he goes to London and makes almost a film noir with British actors. The first third establish Jonathan Rhys Meyers character as the poor, but lucky Irish who has gotten into the higher circles of society. Not unlike one Barry Lyndon he does so with a minimum of constraint and effort, growing only desire for the sultry American Scarlett Johanson on the way, that sadly for him is dating his wife's brother. Here the tone is full of rewritten clichés from the classic movies, all tongue in cheek and humorous. Like many other of Woody Allens movies the references are clever and aplenty, repeated viewings may be needed to enjoy all of them.Apart from a slow moving middle part this is an excellent movie, it really picks up the pace so by the end you're left quite satisfied.

"Nihilism, morality with class cinematography","I think those who criticise the plot do not appreciate the message and the themes. I don't think that anyone's performance in the movie was particularly good, and rightfully so Oscars has only nominated Allen. The movie explores a theme that many other movies have: the question that leads people to subscribe to religions and ideologies in order to find meaning and logic behind luck. I enjoyed watching the movie and contemplating about it. It reminds me of another movie, The End of the Affair (1999), in which accidents shape the protagonist's ""fate"", although the movie invites you to think of these accidents as God's hand and it gives a religious explanations where as in Match Point, Woody Allen's vision is very nihilistic and leaves you thinking there is no meaning and that no one's actions is ultimately punished or rewarded- Its meaningless and all luck.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, not great romantic mystery devoid of Allen's signature","I must agree with the smaller consensus in regards to some of the lavish praise that has been heaped onto this movie as being way overstated. My local paper's critic basically attributed this fact to it being Woody Allen's best in a little while, when his career has been in decline at least ten years. The fact that Allen had produced some kind of resonance within the film community at long last could have been the only reason audiences were on their feet at Cannes when it premiered, she went on to guess, and I must say I agree. Match Point is a very competent film, which does keep viewers pretty compelled throughout with it's involving story. For the first time though, I truly cannot see any trace of the writer/director in his script or direction. Obviously, Allen needed to do a little reinventing with his movies becoming more and more irrelevant in this modern age, but opting to basically sever his unique persona that has radiated everything I have seen by him was not the most assured decision of one of our most illustrious filmmakers. It will keep him in the limelight a little longer though.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Started slowly but by the end I was riveted,"After half an hour of this film I felt as if I was watching one of those awful one off Sunday evening dramas which seem to have been made only with the middle class housewife in mind. There were cut glass English accents, shots of tennis and the opera, meaningful looks across dinner tables and a rather obvious love triangle involving Scarlet Johannsen. But I have to admit that the longer this film progressed the more intriguing it became until by the end I was quite unashamedly shouting advice at the screen. Match Point was refreshingly unpredictable and also rather refreshingly had no particularly likable characters thereby avoiding moral judgements. As others have said this is far from your typical Woody Allen film - and I am normally a big fan. A slight disappointment for me in Match Point was that you can normally rely on Allen to produce scintillating dialogue yet the conversations appeared stilted and slightly humourless. I also felt that some of the details - such as Chris being a supposedly working class boy from Ireland yet with a posh English accent and a penchant for Dostoevsky were a little far-fetched. Overall though Match Point is definitely worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Deeply, Terribly Disturbing. Clearly Woody Allen's Best Film.","I have my own list of the best films I have watched, and on most of them I usually vote a 9... because there can always be a better film. Now this one's clearly a 10. Also, make no mistake, this is definitely the best film Allen has made. I guess it's the pinnacle of his career, and I'll be glad to be mistaken if he ever does better than this. For your convenience I'll divide the two hour film in four quarters of 30 minutes length each: First and second quarters keep your attention up pretty good. The photography is excellent, the same as the social environment shown, and some very disturbing ideas are subtly put on the table. By the middle of the film you still don't know however if it goes for the gold, the silver or the bronze, however you know it is already getting one. Third quarter becomes a little bit dull, but prepare for the last 30 minutes because you'll eat your bench up. And the best is yet to come, because the ending...OH, MY, THE ENDING!!! You just cannot imagine... Terrible... Deeply, profoundly disturbing and unexpected. I can state that I have never watched a film with such ending, and most probable I never will. Well, I don't think there's much left to say; Woody Allen has given me an incredible surprise. Two very big thumbs all way up for Match Point.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a soap opera turned into a feature film,"I'm not sure why this movie has gotten a lot of really good reviews. It was just fair. The plot comes right out of any daytime soap opera.

Since Chris doesn't think he has a shot with Nola, he goes ahead and marries the other girl. He gets a nice job offer from her father and becomes content. But, then he runs into Nola again and starts an affair. It is the classic of husband telling mistress he will leave his wife nearly every day but never does. But Chris turns out to be smarter in the end than I thought he was. I thought he would never get away with it.But the whole plot was just too unoriginal.

The dialog, especially in the beginning, is so studied and forced as to not be believable.It's beautifully filmed and it kept my attention throughout the entire movie.

Excellent,"I don't believe this is a spoiler, but the plot appears to be exactly the same as the opera ""An American Tragedy"", commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera ten years ago and first performed last year. The first clue (unconscious?) was that the sound track is almost exclusively old opera recordings, ranging from the opening (the 2nd strophe of Donizetti's Una Furtiva Lagrima from ""Elixer of Love,"" to the uncannily well-matched dramatic denouement (Iago/Otello except from the Verdi opera). Perhaps this is all just coincidence; the opera is based upon a book about a true story that happened in upstate New York in the 1930s; the movie is set in present day London. But the analogies are consistent throughout. Is this a bad thing? I think not; it is masterfully done.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Clever, very clever, with a nice surprise ending","This has one of the neatest bits of stage business you are likely to ever see in a movie. Keep your eye the ball (or ring) as it hits the net, or perhaps a railing. Whether it falls forward or backward can make all the difference in the world.I can't believe that tennis players say the same thing that poker players say: ""I'd rather be lucky than good."" Poker players say that because there is a significant element of chance involved in any given hand; and besides they already think they're good. It is the other guy who is lucky.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy on the make. He is handsome, charming, smart, and a very good tennis player who is candid about not quite being good enough against the very best. He gets a job teaching tennis at an exclusive English club and quickly meets and charms a very rich student (Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt) who has a sister (Chole, played by Emily Mortimer) who finds him irresistible.Well, how lucky can you get? Complication: Scarlett (the sexiest woman on earth, at one time, anyway, according to some magazine) Johansson playing Nola Rice, who is seriously dating the very eligible Tom Hewitt. (You could say she's on the make as well.) She's an American would-be actress who can't quite wow them at the auditions in London. She is sitting pretty however because if she marries Tom she will be set for life.I could go on, but the plot is so delicious that I don't want to spoil it for you. It's a variation on the venerable theme of rake's progress, employing in an interesting way the old adage, ""The man who marries for money earns it."" I have only one criticism of this especially well directed effort from the redoubtable Mr. Allen: you could have done without that cheesy ghost or hallucination scene near the end, involving sweet lips Scarlett and her neighbor.See this for Woody Allen, who is just as smooth with this upscale noir/Hitchcockian thriller as he is with his renowned comedic and satirical efforts.

Who wrote the dialogue?,"I was disappointed to find out after watching this film that it was a Woody Allen film. Woody must have saved money on researchers and just based the characterisation in this film on British Stereotypes from the 70s. The dialogue was awful and the editing at the beginning felt like they had gone 2 hours over length and had to cut severely. I almost turned it off, but was only appeased finally by the story turning a little dark, with a reasonable twist. Despite poor material the actors made a reasonable job of interpretation. The male lead pulling off a realistic job of the manipulative social climber.As an expat Brit I enjoyed the views of London",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Appalled by moral and the story, but can't deny this movie is carefully orchestrated","'Match Point' talks about how luck plays out in one's life very persistently. The ending takes you back to the beginning scene whether the ball is about to go over the net or drops on own's court. The same image repeats when Chris throws the ring, and it looks as it will be thrown into the water but cannot cross over the fence. That slight chance which can determine the result of the whole game. That highest suspense at the match point prevails in the movie. The penetrating theme, topics, and emotions are delicately placed so audience can be reminded just the right amount of director's purpose; Chris climbing up the social ladder is also due to luck of getting introduced to good-natured and resourceful Hewett family, and Tom's last line is 'I don't care if he's great. I just hope that he's lucky.' (I do not agree with what he says, but I got to admit he says it dang well)I hate to admit, but Allen's directing is neat, no clutter, no exaggeration, no overdramatic plot, but just perfection. Every object, line, scene does its job. Not a single addition to the story, image, and performance of what he wants to tell. In 'Match Point', that lasting image of tennis ball and ring hanging at the border perfectly sumps up the whole movie.I could not believe this film is released in 2005. It does not feel old or out of trend because Allen kept it simple but complete. Aria as background music & vinyl sound give out classic-film vibe. Outfit and architecture finally prove that this film is shot in early 2000s. Directing, acting, and editing is so 2021.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great, and yet hard to watch","This is not your typical Woody Allen movie. This movie tears up your insides and spits them out. There is a certain ambivalence felt towards the characters, you don't know if to hate them, or feel for them. This is a very intense movie, I don't recommend it to the sensitive viewer. I myself am not easily stirred emotionally, but yet found this movie hard to watch. If you thought that Woody Allen was a comedy master and that's it; think again. This movie at the same time that it reaches a peak of intensity, also hits a fair degree of symbolism; especially towards the end. It's kind of hard to talk about this movie without revealing the end, but I definitely recommend this movie; for the emotionally stable. Ha,ha.

Passion or Comfort,"Match Point starts off with a strong statement that much of life has to do with luck. Yes, hard work is a must but circumstances make a whole lot of difference.

In this film Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis star that has high hope in making something of himself. The tennis circuit took him from his humble beginnings but his new job as a tennis instructor at a private club opens the door to opulence.

The Man Who Had All the Luck,"Filmed on location in England and featuring just one joke about neuroses, ""Match Point"" is perhaps not instantly recognizable as a Woody Allen film. But its intelligent script and skillful direction mark it as the work of a talented filmmaker, and one who is still willing to try new techniques.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who teaches tennis at a posh club, becomes friends with the wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and starts dating Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). But he finds himself extremely attracted to Tom's fiancée, an aspiring actress named Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Increasingly, Chris must choose between two very different women and two very different lifestyles--optimistic, naive, moneyed Chloe, or worldly, seductive, struggling Nola? Using this rather simple story, ""Match Point"" goes on to explore questions of luck, fate, ambition, and morality.Allen takes his time with the early part of the movie, which is perhaps a few scenes too long. Eventually, though, it subtly shifts from being a realistic drama to something much darker and more involving. The last 40 or so minutes are absolutely gripping, full of classically suspenseful moments and a very clever resolution.Some reviews have called Nola a ""femme fatale"" type, and her memorable first appearance certainly gives off that impression: her husky voice purrs ""So, who's my next victim?"" as she pouts by the ping-pong table. But one of the nice things about ""Match Point"" is that it subverts these expectations. Nola's character gains depth until she seems like a rather ordinary young woman who got herself into a difficult situation and is trying her best to get out of it. She's far from a perfect human being, but far from the evil ""femme fatale"" mode too. (Besides, no one in this film is perfect.) Scarlett Johansson gives a vivid performance of this complex character.In the early scenes of ""Match Point,"" Chris's personality is a little unclear, both in the way Allen wrote the role and the way Rhys-Meyers performs it. However, by the end, both writer and actor have fully committed to making Chris a ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" type. Mortimer and Goode excellently capture the Hewett siblings' characters--good-natured, accustomed to a life of ease, unaware of how lucky they are.""Match Point""'s slow start keeps it from perfection (there is also one small misstep toward the end, where Allen violates the rules of the world he has created). Still, in an era when many movies begin well and then fall apart by the end, I'll take ""Match Point""'s solid-but- unremarkable beginning and brilliant ending any day.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
didn't buy the hook-up but......,"Having read many comments and agreeing in principle with most, this movie really is a thoughtful and fairly intriguing film about a poor boy from Ireland faced with an age-old problem, the stable, attractive woman, or the more combustible, but gorgeous.....(oh who am I kidding? I wish my choices were that good) woman.For me, I had a bit of a problem with the premise on which one of the relationships is premised. Without giving too much away, it seems that one affair seems to have begun rather reluctantly, indeed, it seemed to me inexplicably given the initial resistance. That said, if you can get past that seeming unlikelihood, Allen has hit on a very nice film. In addressing the role that luck plays in life and the pressures on a poor boy to make good, Allen has tapped into a rich vein of material addressing class, gender roles, and sexual politics. The acting is quite good although the setting, a rather tony British social circle seems quite exclusive. That said, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Emily Mortimer as a naive but sweet lady, and Scarlett Johannsen who seems effortlessly to inhabit her somewhat troubled, provocative character. She is very talented-do not underestimate her abilities on account of her good looks. (That admonition may be directed at me as much as anyone :) ) Seriously though, Johanssen is a very very very talented actress. She creates and seems to meld with the characters she plays effortlessly.I found the soundtrack (early Italian opera originally recorded on 78s (not sure if that's how they're transferred into the movie)) excellent and it foreshadowed throughout the film. I thought his selection of this extremely visceral, emotional music was quite fitting for story arc. Really, Allen is an excellent director and I would imagine he thought he needed to take a break from New York. Really though, this is a very good film and it will be interesting to see what he does next.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A win for this Match!,"Woody Allen has been serving our comedic cravings for many decades. Love him or hate him, the ""Woodsman"" has verifiably proved that he is a comedic cinematic genius and a master of storytelling within themes of neurosis, self-exploration, adultery, egoism, and obsession. His latest effort ""Match Point"" serves up those themes with cinematic poetic justice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as tennis pro Chris Wilton, an opportunistic handsome Scottish lad who befriends a British yuppie named Tom Hewett played by Matthew Goode and eventually marries his sister played by Emily Mortimer. Let's just say that Chris wants to live a joyous ""Chrismas"" lifestyle every day of the year by marrying into a wealthy family. The luscious Scarlett Johansson co-stars as Nola Rice, Tom's fiancée and Chris' American object of desire. I will not spoil a good cinematic match for you, but I will say that Chris' obsession for Nola does have enough probable cause for him to double fault and jeopardize his enriching plan. Johansson looks ravishing in the narrative. No doubt that ""Scarlett Fever"" is hot! Murder does come into play in ""Match Point"" during the latter part of the narrative. Rhys Meyers and Johansson were a superb acting duo with their ace performances. However, the main ""advantage"" of ""Match Point"" was the cleverness of Writer-Director Woody Allen. His triumphant return to cinematic excellence was done by the way of game, set, and ""Match Point"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Actors are great, but at times the script is predictable and cheesy and can tell the actors are doing forced line readings.

The crime and punishment reference in the beginning is an insult to the classic novel which the movie attempts to either honor or adapt, but falls very short.

Match Point Review,"Woody Allen went serious in 2005 with this incredibly serious and tense thriller set in England. That is not to say that Allen has abandoned the themes of his earlier work, about meaning and morality in this world of injustice and chaos. Of course the conclusion of this film is much more pessimistic than that of his others. This is not a whodunit or a crime doesn't pay moral message, this is filmmaking on a more powerful and intensely cynical level. It is a film about injustice and about the fact that crime can pay for people who betray moral values out of greed. Not that it supports this depravity, it states a cold truth, that there is no punishment for the wicked if they manage to fool the people around them. It may not be touchy-feely, but it certainly packs a cold, calculated, but incredibly sexy punch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

And I would have found it a much better film if it hadn't been a murder film, which is cheap to resort to for making a point.I like Woody Allen's work (even when he plays the same neurotic character over and over again), but every time he tries to make a serious crime film, this happens.

Allen's take on An American Tragedy - with his own twist,"Match Point is very similar in tone and story to Theodore Dreiser's great work An American Tragedy, although Allen has added a twist ending that hearkens back to Dostoevskii.The plot is about a social-climbing tennis pro (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer as Chris) who charms his way into a rich British family, and the heart of their daughter, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). He is also friends with the scion of the family, Peter, whose fiancée is a beautiful young American woman, Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Chris is immediately enchanted by the bewitching Nola, especially in comparison to the rather plain Chloe that he has attached himself to, but both of them know that an indiscretion could spell disaster. Both of their futures appear hinged on remaining in the good graces of the Lord of the Manor and his children. Nola even spells it out for Chris - Chloe loves him, her father is also fond of him, his future is set if he doesn't ""blow it"". ""How do you suppose I would do that?"" Chris replies. ""Me"". She answers.Without going into spoilers, the twists and turns of passion restrained by pragmatic, non-romantic concerns will lead Chris and Nola into territory where a difficult decision will need to be made.For the most part, the performances are steady. Rhys-Meyer does his best work during the first half of the film, when his furtive nature and wariness at making a gaffe that could alienate this rich family create drama and intrigue. He always seems to have an agenda. This furtive nature is heightened by his reactions to Nola, reactions over which he has no control.During the second half of the film, when he has to make more trenchant decisions, his work isn't as strong. For the most part his character is petulant and moody, and although this is called for by the script, it is hard to retain sympathy for the character. He was more interesting when he was climbing the social ladder than when he has already achieved a perch that he must protect from his own indiscretions.Scarlett Johansson continues to impress as an actress. Her performance as Nola, a young actress aware of her effect on men but still unsure of herself, is beautifully portrayed. This is showcased in one powerful exchange where she and Rhys-Meyer have a drink after she has had a disastrous audition. Beginning distraught and cursing her life and choice of career, she morphs into a seductive temptress, sure of herself and well aware of her effect on Rhys-Meyer. ""Where was this confidence during your audition?"" he intelligently asks, all the while knowing and not knowing the answer. During the second half of the film, when Nola becomes more needy, she sets a clear choice for Rhys-Meyer - choose between his pocketbook, and his passion.The film ends on a twist ending, which echoes some of the themes in Allen's earlier work, most notably Crimes and Misdemeanors. Allusions to Dostoevskii are made repeatedly. Although this film is not up with Allen's best work, it is a change - not set in Manhattan, and Allen appears nowhere in front of the camera. Well worth watching if you haven't seen it before.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but miscast,"""Match Point"" was Woody Allen's best movie in years. That isn't saying much since I consider his recent attempts to be really bad. The story was similar to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" where a married man has an affair that threatens his marriage. Performances by most of the major characters were very good. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton were especially good in their roles. I also liked Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was at times a bit over doing it but still his performance was believable. Unfortunately the only one I was disappointed with was Scarlett Johansson. I like her as an actress and I've enjoyed her in her other roles but I think she was miscast as the sexy femme fatale. She is gorgeous but she seems too intelligent to fit into the role as a troubled would-be actress. I think a more bimboish actress would have fit the role better. It isn't that she was bad just awkward in the role. Still the movie is worth seeing. Now for the problems of the movie. Mr. Allen typically portrays members of the upper middle class. His characters move through the rarefied sets like people from 1930's movies. They are impeccably dressed and often are portrayed having drinks. ""Match Point"" was no different but this time it was set in London instead of New York and the switch maybe helped since the characters were more familiar, at least if you watch Masterpiece Theater. I don't particularly like his characters. I find them to be spoiled and complaintive. There is no portrayal of people on the street. You know the street. The place between fashionable enclaves and expensive apartments, between trendy galleries and smart restaurants. The characters move through a world untouched by most of the moviegoers and suffer problems caused by their own selfishness. How are we, the movie watchers, supposed to feel any empathy with characters who are so removed from our lives. His movies aren't escapist fare where muscled jocks and hot babes raced around in expensive cars avoiding the law while pulling their latest caper. Mr. Allen's movie explore the humanness of life but lately they feel very removed from real life. I have a real problem caring what happens to the characters. They don't appeal nor resonate with me. Maybe Mr. Allen is portraying the group he is most familiar with. I think he needs to get out more.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen doesn't stop at simplicity,"Woody Allen's Match Point opens by telling us exactly where it derives its title from. It compares life to that moment in a game of tennis, when a ball is swung and hits the top of the net and for a split second has the option of falling back on your side of the court, penalizing you or, with a little luck, falling on your opponent's side, penalizing them. In a sense, this is a film that questions the mysteries that inhabit life, actually offering up some very interesting existential questions about life and its numerous quirks.I guess it's too considered a ""match point"" when you've caught yourself in the middle of a love triangle and are unsure of whether to stay with the one you're officially with or take a risk and form a full, open relationship with the one you've kept ""waiting"" on the side. The character stuck in this depressing position is Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a retired professional tennis player attempting to climb the social ladder in London, as he trains Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). The two share their love for opera, and along the way, Chris meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister, and quickly jumps into a relationship with her. That is, until he meets Tom's confident, incredibly sensuous fiancée named Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson). The woman is bold, beautiful, and gorgeous and knows of this, and becomes smitten with the idea of becoming involved in an affair with Chris, while Chloe is left in the dark. There are a number of twists and unforeseen directions in the film, so spoiling them would be an act of sin.Allen completely disregards everything he's led us to believe he has been about since his career beginnings in the 1960's. His male archetype is not a neurotic, inept, quirky writer, but a fully brazen and somewhat arrogant womanizer played expertly by Meyers, who embodies this role with true power and intensity. The characters around him that could've been gravely underwritten (for example, Mortimer's Chloe) are developed through monologues in luxurious restaurants, sipping the fanciest wine, talking openly amongst friends and acquaintances. It's scenes like this that Allen nails with a complete and total brash sense of direction and confidence. He portrays these luxurious get-togethers as comfortable, inviting experiences that places the viewer at their table or like a voyeur at a nearby table, listening in on a conversation you're afraid for just because you don't want it to go the way you believe it will.Aside from Meyers, the wealth of supporting talent that surrounds him is commendable and fascinating. He is greatly assisted by Johansson's deeply passionate, sensuous Nola, and we can see him being persuaded by her just by her simple gaze and her incredible attractive lips.Match Point could've evolved into a simple love triangle involving a prestigious tennis player desperately struggling to maintain two different girls while he resides in London's upper-class. But two tactics that Allen inserts here comfortably are exploring how someone can climb the social ladder of London, and, inviting in the idea of how luck plays a role in all our lives. He illustrates how sometimes the most despicable, unruly humans get the undeserved good luck, while the good people of the world get shafted with the bad luck.In multiple ways, this reminded me of Spike Lee's sincere and delightfully efficient directorial debut She's Gotta Have It, which also centered around a love triangle, but instead of exploring the idea of how luck plays into ones life, it examined each character and how they reacted to being part of this triangle. Lee channeled Allen in some respects, with the black and white atmosphere and the dramatic tonality of the screenplay, and both in return made a sufficient picture.Some consider Allen to come gift wrapped in his own pretentiousness and accuse him for making ""odd"" pictures that few can connect with. I consider him valuable and a necessity to film; we need people like Allen to show a barrage of different people, with extremely different personalities, that somehow come all together and connect with their traits to make the complex, admirably complete figure that is Woody Allen.Starring: Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton.

Woody. Make more films like this one.,"Being in the SE Asian region, not all films from the US find their way to the local cinemas, hence the DVD rental stores. I rented this - the black and white poster alone got me, but I had no idea what I was going to watch. Not even close to, say, Annie Hall, Sleeper, NY Stories, and Husbands and Wives, this was surprisingly intense suspenseful. For a few times I had to hit the pause button just to walk around and let my pulse calm down, I kid you not. Never have I been so unnerved by a film since perhaps Ringu. Woody should move into this territory more often. For those who are looking for Scarlett's talents other than the oft-repeated Black Widow, go to this one and watch her without the CGI. Her male counterpart, Jonathan Rhys Myers, holds his own, Emily Mortimer is a treat, and any movie with Brian Cox in it can't be that bad.'You came here to look at me.'",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's film noir,"It surprises me that this movie has not received more attention because it is a major departure for Woody Allen's career as a director and a very dark and brooding film that has more in common with Double Indemnity or The Postman Always Rings Twice. It is not a comedy but it does borrow on some of the themes in Allen's previous movies, particularly Crimes and Misdemeanors. It also deals with London's version of the artistic crowd he casually mocks in his New York movies of the 1980's. The climax is one that could have appeared in a film noir of the 1940's.The dialogue is witty and the cast is excellent with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johanssen in the leading roles as two newcomers to London society whose paths converge, then change and finally come together again leading to a bizarre twist of fate at the end. Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer as brother and sister are both excellent and round out the leading players. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are Mr and Mrs Hewett, the society couple who bring Rhys-Meyers into the family firm.I found the lives of the family that Rhyss-Meyers married into somewhat shallow and this was no doubt Woody Allen's intent, reflecting his distaste for families with social status. Rhyss-Meyers finds it ""boring"" as he puts it, and seeks out an unconventional girl from Boulder, Colorado for some excitement and falls madly in love with her. He cannot bring himself to abandon the perks that come as a member of his new family and this leads to rather grim consequences with one person finding unusual good luck.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen movies greatest boon of all,"n the opening of the movie, a voice-over ponders over the how luck plays crucial part in life than one hates to admit. How a tennis ball hits the net at pivotal moment in a match and how an inch will decide the victory or loss. This philosophy is going to come back later, we know in the Woody Allen's Match Point, a story of lust and luck.For the first time Woody Allen leaves his beloved Manhattan and sets this one in London where Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) moves from a small town as tennis instructor at a high class club. He has given up career in tennis because he admits he has the talent but not the focus. We believe him. He is sort of guy who will take the shortcut to success and avoid the hard word. He is befriended by an upper class lean bloke Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) who acts entry point to a world of wealth and luxury. They bond over common love for opera where he meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer) Tom's sister, who can't take her eyes off Chris. He plays his cards well without coming off as desperate and is on his way up the ladder where easy money is.Trouble enters in form of a sultry siren Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress and Tom's fiancé. They meet at party in Hewetts' country house over a game of TT. Jonathan Rhys Meyers's searching, cold, calculating eyes are set on her the moment he sees Nola. They later meet after Nola blows off another audition and goes to a bar to vent the steam. At this moment, after a few drinks conversation gets more direct. These are two outsiders in the world they are about to commit. Nola says he is going to do good unless he screws the whole thing by making a pass at her. Their flirtatious talk back and forth are some of the best screen verbal foreplays in movies.Chris: ""So you are aware of your effect on men?"" Nola: ""Men always wonder I would be something special"" Chris: ""And are you?"" Nola: ""Well, No one's ever asked for their money back""They are going to have an affair, on and off sort which leads to a tragedy which involves a murder. Thanks to the trailer it's not like am giving away anything.It's debated Woody Allen made come back with this film which is partially true. This is Woody's one of the best works, his personal favorite. This is polished assured work from the man in top form making his frame as lustful and glowing as the characters in them to deliver its cynical themes. They are blissfully free from his influences and reference talks and stays close to the ground without losing any Allen incisiveness in dialog. Movie a pleasure, an entertaining drama deals with the nature of lust, its consequences (pointed self-reference would be Allen's own Crimes and Misdemeanors) and third entirely new angle luck, which gives this movie its final splendid kick. It is Allen's imagination and cruelty of fate movie finally settles on.

the directing of this movie gives the cinema hope!,"After seeing the Scarlett Johanson is going to be in a Woody Allen picture I had to check it out. I could not of been anymore pleased.Films now a days has a typical plot and no effort on camera shots. This film had it. The movie started off very slow for me. Actually, to be honest with you, I wanted to turn it off after 45 minutes! The movie's plot is one very crazy love triangle. The acting was so good I could relate it to my favorite movie of all time, 25th Hour. You could really feel for the guy that was in the situation and understand the pain he was going through.Woody Allen tricked me with his great shots making you lean towards a negative effect but turning out to be a positive effect, or vise-versa. This movie was very original and really required a great script. Of course we know how good Scarlott Johanson can be (excluding the Island - my opinion).My advise to you is not to turn this movie off after the first 45 minutes but be patient as this movie turns out to be one of the years best thrillers!

One of Allen's darkest films,I know Allen has a fairly wide raging filmography but I tend to think of him as a comedic director. Further many of his films always seem to have a comedic edge to them. Match Point is one of a handful that isn't comedic at all. It is instead a dark sensuous thriller about the life's haphazard way of dealing out fates by chance not moral standing. It consciously borrows from Crime and Punishment to make this point and the novel is incorporated directly into the text. Chris is a fascinating character and there is a maddening ambiguity to when he became awful morally. This is just a well put together film. I like how minimal a lot of it is.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dreadful bore,"Match Point is Woody Allen's latest offering. The director of such gems as Manhattan, Annie Hall, Zelig, Bullets over Broadway, and Hannah and Her Sisters has been the king of the American art-house film for decades. Sometimes his movies are poignant, and sometimes they're slapstick hilarity. This offal, however, never even hints at Allen's writing or directing abilities; indeed, it may as well have been directed by John Badham for all of the flavor and panache it expresses.Even though the movie's appeared on many must-see lists as people gear up for the Oscar nominations, Match Point is a travesty of a sham of a mockery of an entertaining film. It's a longwinded load of dung. Nearly every scene is deadeningly dull, and the few that aren't are instead serve as perfect clichés.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis pro who falls for Chloe, the daughter of a rich British family (the movie's set in London), played by Emily Mortimer. Chris' best pal is Tom (Matthew Goode), Chloe's sister. Rounding out the main quartet is American actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), who's engaged to Tom. Wouldn't you know it, seconds after meeting Nola - after already being partnered with Chloe - Chris falls for the flaxen-haired lass, who's strong-willed and outspoken where her British counterparts are a little more complacent.Can Chris keep his lust a secret from Tom and Chloe? And what of the parents, the richer-than-rich Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) and Alec (Brian Cox)? They dote on Chris, showering him with money and gifts and a job. How could Chris give all of that up to be with Nola? Several things work against the movie aside from the faceless direction and writing. For one thing, Chris is utterly unappealing. A protagonist certainly does not need to be likable, but there must be something about him or her that makes the audience want to see what happens to him or her. The appalling acting by Rhys-Meyers doesn't help matters at all; he's lifeless, utterly devoid of emotion. He can't even seem to conjure enough strength to show a good facial expression. He's a blank, a cipher no one wants to learn more about. Allen didn't write the character well at all, to make matters worse. It's a little too easy to figure out Chris' intentions, but his motivations are sometimes a mystery. And for goodness' sake, someone give this boy a spine transplant! How can a lead character be so terminally wishy washy? Of the supporting cast, only Johansson and Cox emerge unscathed. Cox is a veteran actor and could probably have played this role in his sleep, and Johansson is a rising star, capable of fantastic range. She was given very little to work with (her character doesn't really possess any unique traits), and it showed.The pacing is mind numbing. I cannot tell you how many times I checked my watch to see how much time remained in the movie. It's plodding and aimless, certain to bore even the most rabid Merchant-Ivory fan, even though those masters had nothing to do with this one. Instead, we're given the vagrant stepchild of a true master American filmmaker. Allen would have been much better off removing his name from the credits for the pseudonymous Alan Smithee. Another annoying debit: Despite the title, tennis takes place for maybe three scenes.If you're not a fanatic of tedious, overwrought melodramas, please adjust this rating down at least half a star.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fascinating,"This movie, a while after it was released, became one of my favourite. This is also the first movie I saw by Woody Allen and my favourite actress plays in it. At first look, the screenplay might look like so-so or not quite original. But I think that everybody was surprised after seeing the whole two hours. That's what happened with me. I rented, started it and I just couldn't pause it until the end. I was just totally absorbed by the story and I was always asking myself : oh my god, what's gonna happen next?, every single minute. That is exactly what I'm looking for in the movies and very few of them can do that. This is certainly the best film by Woody Allen. Now, everybody's gonna say: nope! nope, it's Annie Hall. Well, I wasn't so much amazed after seeing Annie Hall than Match Point. This film is awesome because it made me think for a long, long time after seeing it. And I watched it about a dozen times and I still enjoy it! And also, the actors are just great. Even if Jonathan Rhys-Meyers didn't get a lot of prize for this role, I still think that his performance was awesome.

Woody's terrific non-comedic nod to Hitchcock with a sizzling Scarlett Jo,"Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" at 53rd San Sebastian in 20052EE648C9-20F9-4C8F-8452-7DC284AC5808The dominant theme at the festival this year was Hitchcock with Hitchcock imagery everywhere celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Master of Suspense. Though there actually are no films by Hitchcock on view, several films are in a way a homage to the master. ""Match Point"", the latest from Woody Allen is a vast departure from his usual form and is, in effect, a Hitchcockian suspense thriller filmed in London no less, with an entirely English cast except for a smashingly sexy Scarlett Johansson in a most uncharacteristic vamp role, as the sole American presence – (and what a presence she is!). Young Scarlett really sets the celluloid aflame in this stylish shot out of Mr. Konigsberg's Twilight Zone, with savvy support from Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the freaked-out lover-killer who in the end will go unpunished.... No sidewalks of New York, no neurotic Jews, no sly jokes and one liners, just a straightforward English psychodrama made with such aplomb you would never guess it was a Woody Allen film if you missed the opening credits. In a way it does hark back to Woody's Crimes and Misdemeanors, but only because of the theme of getting away with murder. Rhys is a professional but impoverished tennis instructor and bald faced social climber with clients in high society. His character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by a steamy extra-marital affair with his new brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. When Johansson claims to be pregnant and insists that he leave his wife for her -- which would bring down the whole world he has strived so hard to attain - she signs her death warrant. Rhys goes to her apartment, shoots her to death (in a shocking sequence) and makes it look like a robbery to obtain drugs. The rest is a cat and mouse interrogation by a Scotland yard detective with echoes of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. His skin is saved by a twist of fate similar to a tennis ball suspended momentarily on the net which could fall either way. This is, of course, the Match Point of the title. Instead of a tennis ball we have an incriminating ring from the scene of the crime which accidentally gets dumped onto the ground after teetering on a rail by the river where Rhys is disposing of other evidence from the scene of the crime. We find out that the ring was picked up by a junkie who got killed but now appears to be the indisputable culprit who killed Johansson. Case closed. Our anti-hero gets away with murder. Everything handled just right by Allen to produce a tight thriller with the kinds of twists and turns that mirror Hitchcock to a tee. Not only is this a. ""return to form"" for Woody, but a venture into fresh new territory -- straight drama with not a single laugh --and done like an expert born to the cloth. Most enjoyable film with an entirely new Scarlett Jo! as an astonishingly sexy femme fatale.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Impressive.,"Woody Allen has a deserved reputation as a highly skilled film maker. He has a place in the history of Hollywood. Despite this... critics and the public have been both suspicious and doubtful about his work over the last 20 years or more.This film confirms beyond any doubt that Mr Allen is a master of his trade. To be able (as an American) to create such a plausible and accurate portrayal of English manners may not be a wondrous achievement in the way that Hollywood is so desperate to make us 'wonder'... but it is a delight. It is an experience to treasure because the story (transported by an exemplary cast) provides an insight into what being English really is. Smug, self satisfied wealth, sits alongside social conformity and naked lust. It completely ignores harsh reality of course... but what the hell!If I was better read... I am sure I would be able to give you all sorts of literary references to reinforce my opinions about this film... but I watch films for the emotional responses they drag out of me, and not much more.I like it.

"""Now, isn't Allen, the master writing stories?""","The story of the film starts in a normal fashion and doesn't interest much to a general audience but the way it takes turns after the second half and the engaging part in the end is going to be in my memory forever. After watching the film, the question related to scripts again resurfaced in my mind. Isn't the story the most important part of a film? Well I just think of the fugitive, the story being pretty much normal but I bet there will be very few who didn't like it. No doubt, a film has to have all the departments very powerful in order to be successful. In the fugitive we have an extraordinary execution of a normal story and in Match Point we have an extraordinary execution of an extraordinary story. But why can't I distinguish between the two films properly. I want to incline more towards the Match Point but after finishing both of them I had almost the same feeling. But in the end I believe it is the story which should be paid more emphasis.The film' story here digs deeper into LUCK. How luck can change the life. The story does true justice to the idea. We have a Retired Tennis player inducted into a family and start to have a relationship with the daughter of the family. Sideways, he grows his feelings for another girl involved in the same family. The story takes many turns all the time. The combination of the mood at times along with the opera music was an exhilarating experience. The way the film ends, the acting by the cast, the change in behavior or the characterization everything about the film is so perfect. The ending clearly suggests that this is how life is sometimes and we don't know it. Woody Allen is a master storyteller. With 23 nominations of original screenplays, the guy is a gem in our world. I seriously doubt that anyone would dislike the film. There are instances where the story tends to proceed in a clichéd manner but wait till you reach to the end.MESSAGE: ""LUCK MATTERS.""VERDICT: ""A must watch.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

On a different level, Brian Cox gives a great if subtle performance.The bad. That dream scene is a bit awkward, but it still works.The ugly. Nothing.The result.

A total disappointment from someone who has done much better,"What a dreadfully trite little film. Its view of the rich high life in London reeks of a Cinderella story with no substance and its characters and situations hold no interest for this film-goer. For me they are unbelievable and one-dimensional and the performances by the actors are in complete harmony, the whole creating a soporific experience. Scarlett Johansson has done herself no favors by this appearance for I feel the lackluster writing has dragged down her performance. The other actors blandly blend into the background and I was left wondering if the male lead was chosen for the resemblance of his mouth to that of Scarlett! Even Brian Cox, who can be wonderfully acerbic or a thoroughly nasty piece of work given the opportunity, is asked to portray a character without spine or interest. The direction is pedestrian, the film only getting some pace towards the last quarter. It must be assumed that Allen aimed for the pedestrian pace but it did not work for me. I am a fan of Woody Allen but I feel that this latest effort is not up to his normal standard, although I have not seen his later works. The premise is interesting but its exploration is not substantial enough for this film and Allen does not do it justice in any event.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Matchless,"There has been a lot written and said about this movie, and I can understand why; I think it is one of the most intriguing movies I've seen.With a measured pace and style, ""Match Point"" tells the story of Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who marries for money and position while lusting after another woman with whom he has an affair. But when she becomes too demanding, he solves his problem in a totally unexpected way.The plot is built around the theme of luck. Meyer's character sets up the premise in his opening narration, ""The man who said I would rather be lucky than good, saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control"".Luck also played a part in the making of ""Match Point"". In an interview Woody Allen told how he was lucky with just about every aspect of the movie. Lucky with the script, lucky that the location changed from The Hamptons in NY to London, lucky with the cast, and lucky when Kate Winslet dropped out and Scarlett Johansson was available.Would this movie have had the same frisson with Kate Winslet playing Nola Rice? It's subjective of course, but Scarlett just has that powerful, glamorous look and calm sensuality that could cause males of any age to stumble over their words.The cast praised her acting, although it's the scenes where her relationship with Chris Wilton starts to unravel, replete with yelling and screaming, where she seems a little stretched. As she herself says, ""I'm a pretty relaxed person and I don't consider myself a screamer so when you're elevated to that, it brings up all this crazy energy that you didn't realize you were bottling up.""I was actually surprised to find that about half the reviewers on IMDb hated ""Match Point"", especially UK reviewers. One of the main complaints was that Allen didn't really capture a feeling for modern London life - they felt it was all a bit Oscar Wilde.However, in all the interviews I've seen or read with the mainly British cast, Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Matthew Goode, none of them had anything but praise for the script, and all seemed to enjoy working with Allen. Most of the crew were also British, so up-to-date advice and local knowledge was always close at hand.Anyway, it's the terrific cast, and the story with its reverse homage to Dostoevsky that drives the movie. Those who hated it overlooked some of Allen's most insightful writing - look at the way Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt gets over Nola, he and his family move on from her. Then, even Chris Wilton gets over her - passions cool, relationships change, love can turn to hate, or worse, indifference. Allen weaves it all into his story where the security and power of wealth are the strongest driving forces of all.All I would say is that it's a film that deserves re-evaluation. I've seen it a number of times, and each time I discover some new aspect to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Patience is Rewarded,"This film is not boring. Not in the least. What is routine, what is everyday, does admittedly consume the first, oh, 45 minutes and requires patience from the audience. But after that, and one cannot really mind all that much as the cast is absolutely gorgeous, the suspense piles and piles until it is quite unbearable. One of the most satisfying suspense films ever.What Meyers does playing Wilton, the protagonist and tennis pro, is phenomenal. His smoky eyes speak volumes and his mouth is absolutely expressive. From early in the movie, Dostoyevskian themes are suggested, and Wilton's behavior and psychology slowly shift into a complexity worthy of one of the Russian author's own heroes. Indeed, instead of confusing the pace and content of the movie, Woody Allen's allusions to books like Crime and Punishment is woven integrally, with care, into the film.The movie itself plays, almost, as a tennis game. Characters act, and the audience feels batted back and forth as we take short leaps in time and discovering events directly as well as indirectly. If there is a net the audience passes over, it's the films score. Opera music provides a continuous thread and boundary to anchor the story. There is hardly a superfluous line in the movie, much less any criminally unnecessary scenes. Speaking of scenes, I love how classically the movie is filmed. Often times, two characters are framed very properly without the camera cutting for whole minutes at a time. While camera shots become more complicated and disjointed in popular cinema, here, Allen's simplicity was a treat. Beautifully filmed.Undeniably, Scarlett Johanson is a beauty, and is on her way to greatness, although, do not expect it here. At times, her performance is a little reserved, but her subtlty is reamrkable. One laugh in particular had me distracted even scenes later.As I said, patience is rewarded. The plot is tight and thick, though slow-going at first. One thing is certain, if you commit to it, you'll never imagine, or be disappointed, where this movie will go.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Thrilling and Complex!,"Wow! ""Match Point"" was my first Woody Allen movie, and DANG it was good! I came out of the movie all giddy and excited about how good this movie was, no wonder it's now sitting at #5 in my top movies of 2005! The movie was clever, exciting, suspenseful, involving, artistic, and powerful all at the same time. I must say that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (who was also in ""Bend It Like Beckham"") outdid himself and delivered a knock-out performance as the social-ladder climbing/adulterating husband in the movie! His portrayal of his guilt, indecision, and passion are so raw yet nuanced that I can fully appreciate the dilemma that his character has to go through in the movie. It seems that there are so many good performances by a male lead in the past month that the Oscar race is definitely shaping up to be a slug-out! All the other supporting actors in the movie were very good, though not as many got the chance to shine like Meyers. I believe he stole the show.As for the screenplay and directing by Woody Allen, I must say that I am very very impressed! The story had twists and turns that kept me guessing. Every time I thought I figured out the ending, something else (believable) pops up. The whole theme that was set in the beginning (""I'd rather be lucky than good"") was laced throughout the movie, to a very good effect. I especially loved Allen's inclusion of literature, art, and music into this movie, and the story draws its strength from all three aspects. The movie explores many topics including adultery, wealth vs love, guilt, passion, and of course, luck vs skill. All this, mixed in with some great music (mostly from an tragic opera - is that a redundancy? ), led me through a roller coaster ride of emotions and lots of anxiety for the characters' fate in the movie. I attribute that to Woddy Allen's superb directorial skills! I remember reading a review for this movie that said, ""To call this movie Woody Allen's comeback is an understatement!"" I fully agree with that assessment! The *only* flaw I found in the movie was Jonathan Rhys-Meyer's tennis forehand... for a pro that supposedly played against Agassi and Rusedski, his forehand was quite painful to watch... haha! But hey, the movie is so good I can forgive him for that! So what are you waiting for? Go see the movie already! You'll be thrilled!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant!!!,i love London. I love woody allen but i was pretty sick and tired of his new-york-ish and neurotic movies. i usually don't expect anything buying a ticket. This one took me by surprise. Even my friend who was not a huge fan of W.A. said it was a great movie. The idea of showing rich young people acting like they were born in XIX. century was quite interesting (and was in wody allen style) (how many of you can say that he is a theatre or opera-goer?). i have one question. If you are a tennis player and you play against agassi can you say you are a poor young man and made nothing of this? i won't write anything more. i highly recommend!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is going on with movies these days? *SPOILER*,"I sat in the theatre and watched this movie with people around me booing, except for the teenagers who giggled all the way through it. Personally, I could not find anything likable about these characters. Chris Wilton is shallow and stupid, and he marries into a family of even more shallow and stupid people. The dialog is all talky and on the nose, and there is too much dialog, all talking heads all the time. Nobody does anything except talk! There is no action, just talk, talk, talk. I could not find any sympathy for these characters. They evoked NO emotion in me, no empathy, nothing. I felt nothing. I felt no journey, no arc. They learned nothing, therefore, I learned nothing. Then, at the end, these random police officers come into the story, and the perspective changes abruptly to these two dumber police officers and how they deduce who killed Nola and the Landlady. Then these random ghosts of Nola and the Landlady show up-- come on? I never do understand why Chris comes to the decision he does to kill Nola. Why did he decide that? What made him decide that? What an awful thing for the director to do to me, to have the main character make a decision off camera without me to witness his thought process. I am so not buying anything in this movie. It never took me anywhere... And I desperately wanted to be taken on a journey with these people. The characters were so underdeveloped, they had no life to them. I just don't get why people liked this film. I really don't get it, unless we are all just shallow in this world today, and can identify with shallow characters on screen.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Relentlessly gripping from start to finish,"After a slew of less than successful films, it seemed that Woody Allen, who it seemed at one point could never fail, had lost his touch, become too dated and formulaic to appeal to modern day audiences. Wisely enough, Allen seems to have realized the best way to stay fresh and interesting is an abrupt change of pace, of base of operations, of genre and of style. The most noticeable difference in Allen's latest, 'Match Point' is the fact that he forgoes his usual NYC setting, replacing it instead with upper crust English society. Also, gone is the light comedic tone and neurotic lead characters who seem only a shallow echo of Allen himself - here we have very different personas spouting significantly different lines than those we are used to hearing in an Allen film.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a fallen from grace ex tennis pro who marries into wealth to raise his social standing. With a beautiful and enthusiastic wife (Emily Mortimer), her very British brother who Chris instructed in tennis and introduced him to the family (Matthew Goode) and more importantly, their very rich and generous father (Brian Cox) who lands Chris a high ranking position in his business firm, it seemed that Chris had gone from virtually nothing to everything he could ever want in a nauseatingly short time. But Chris' stable and very successful life is rapidly brought to a staggering halt when he is introduced to American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) who he instantly falls for, despite her being engaged to his future brother-in-law. Complications ensue as Chris and Nola try to decide whether their affections for each other would be worth compromising their very secure lives for each other.Although the main feel of the story may be different territory for Allen, the underlying profundity of the narrative is still there. All throughout the story, we as an audience find ourselves forced to confront the issue ""is passion more desirable than stability?"" and likely applying it to our own lives as well. Allen's script is excellent, making so much more out of what could have been a very cheesy and unoriginal story, with numerous great lines only touching on being pretentious at times, but this is largely masked by the two excellent leads and great supporting cast.Performances are excellent across the board, especially from the two leads, who are the main focus of the show, and are easy capable enough of maintaining our interest. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is excellent in the lead as Chris, the ex-tennis pro who grows bored and unhappy with his unnervingly stable life - he really brings Chris' conflicting emotions to play in a truly compelling fashion. Scarlett Johansson is also great as Nola Rice, the unsuccessful actress who also finds herself tempted to choose passion over stability in her life. Despite common sentiments that she was only cast due to her looks, Johansson gives a very strong performance, though it's true that her absolutely stunning beauty is a highlight of the show. There is also excellent support from Emily Mortimer as Chris' wife, who is very nice though not terribly interesting with her constant desire to get pregnant, the very British Matthew Goode as Nola's fiancée, and Brian Cox as Chris' very rich father in law, who essentially secures him a position in life. Cox avoids stereotyping by underplaying the feigned kindness with a streak of intimidation, and his performance is superb - as are everyone else's. In fact, the only real downside of casting is the horrendously stereotypical British police officer, who comes across as hilarious at one of the most crucial and not intended to be funny parts of the movie.Allen has created a truly excellent piece of work here, as Match Point is relentlessly gripping from start to finish. Despite its seemingly simple storyline, we as an audience still manage to be taken aback by each twist of the story, and the ending is nothing less than genuinely surprising, as well as very satisfactory for having not taken the easy way out in storytelling terms. Intrigued? You'll just have to see Match Point for yourself... chances are you won't be disappointed.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perhaps the Master's best.,"I am a self confessed coward when it comes to movies and I mentally threatened myself many times that I would walk out of this wonderful film simply because it was too strong for me. At the end, however, I was glad I had stayed for the absorbing twist that ties the movie all together.The script was a tough one for me. Allen wrote it beautifully with the tension slowly building like a spring wound too tight but with nothing that can be done to release the tension; the inevitability of the drama that unfolds made for seat-squirming for a coward like me. Alen's direction was superb; as I mentioned the tension was built slowly but inexorably to the climax. His directional timing was brilliant and all of the cast worked together perfectly.Allen's shot selection was also superb as was Adefarasin's cinematography and Cardine Smith's set decoration. The visuals of Match Point were therefore as stunning as the acting and as one critic wrote, ""This may be Woody Allen's best film ever"". I believe that assessment to be totally accurate!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's sparkling Hitchcockian Comeback,"ALLEN ENTERS NEW TERRITORY WITH ""MATCH POINT""Viewed at 2005 San Sebastian Film Festival featuring centenary homage to Alfred Hitchcock. Though there were no films by Hitchcock on view, several films are in a way a homage to the master. ""Match Point"", the latest from Woody Allen is a vast departure from his usual form and is, in effect, a Hitchcockian suspense thriller filmed in London no less, with an entirely English cast except for a smashingly sexy Scarlett Johansson in a most uncharacteristic vamp role, as the sole American presence – (and what a presence she is!).At a turning point in his life, an unscrupulous social climbing former tennis pro falls for a scrumptuous femme-fatal type (Scarlett Jo) who happens to be dating his new best friend and soon-to-be brother-in-law. Her blatant irresistibility forces him to tread a skittery fine line between acceptance or expulsion from the high society he has edged his way into -- like a tennis ball teetering on top of the net at a decisive win-or-lose ""match point"". Also the metaphor for which way the evidence will fall when he is a suspect in Scarlett's shocking but necessary murder. Young Scarlett really sets the celluloid aflame in this stylish shot out of Mr. Konigsberg's Twilight Zone, with sensitive support from Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the freaked-out lover-killer who in the end will go unpunished.Woody has strayed from comedy before with mixed results but this no-nonsense edge of the seat entry into typical Hitchcockian territory demonstrates his versatility as nothing before. The tennis background is perfectly employed to a breath-taking conclusion where a tennis ball teeters momentarily on the top of the net and can fall either way. Johansson, moreover, pulls out all the stops and shows she can act as well as just look gorgeous — and sexier than ever as a scheming heartless femme fatale. Hats off to both Woody and Scarlett for a perfectly realized neo Film Noir. Alfred would have loved it!An extra dessert for Opera fans; Since both leading men are opera lovers the musical score is made up entirely of opera excerpts with remastered Caruso recordings and oodles of Verdi arias commenting subtly on the proceedings of this amoral operatic film noir masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Woody Allen, you did not disappoint me.  Bravo","Walking into ""Match Point"" as my first Woody Allen experience proves that I have a long way ahead in exploring cinematic excellence. Here Allen deftly plays with our expectations. At various points, the film appeared to be falling into conventional traps; for example, when the attraction between Nola and Chris became unbearably evident, but one of them was afraid to be seen together, I suspected the story to branch into the ""forbidden love"" territory a la ""Brokeback Mountain."" But not so! Or, when Chris was reluctant to accept an office job, I thought perhaps this film would explore his unhappiness with the business world, and where his heart really belonged, as a conventional film is expected to do after establishing the character's reluctance. My foreshadowing was off, and I'm glad that the seemingly conventional plot was nothing more than a warm up for the dark, haunting side of the human experience that is often overlooked because the truth hurts. If you have not seen this film, here is a word of warning to set the right expectation: do NOT expect to walk away charmed, and do expect ""Match Point"" to explore psychologically frightening territories. The story progresses through several phases, and Allen demonstrates that he refuses to give in to popular expectations. Nevertheless, keep in mind that Allen stated in an interview that he was not aiming for a depressive tone -- merely a realistic one, not that it isn't funny occasionally!""Match Point"" is my first Woody Allen experience, and I would rate it as a daring and powerful effort that transcends the limitations of popular cinema; I would not have expected any less from the legendary director.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You will be SHOCKED,"Match Point begins and ends with Opera music in the credits. As being a fan of Operas, I realized the story itself is an opera. The story is about a tennis obsessed man who moves to England to become a tennis coach (one for beginners), but realizes tennis isn't going to make a life since he's good, but not pro level good. But, he gets lucky when he gets a certain pupil. This man is the very wealthy son of one of the richest men in England. Of course, the two become fast friends when they find a common interest in Opera, and many things lead to another. Soon he meets the man's sister, and the two become fast lovers, too fast. But trouble arises when the two get married and then he meets his future sister-in-law, an American girl played by Scarlett Johannson, and the two secretly have sex. Then she breaks up with his brother in law, and so now she's single, and despite his marriage, the two have an affair that lasts for a long time, all secret of course.The movie's plot thickens later for other reasons, and the man gets caught between the two women he loves, and he must face his options. What makes it good is you NEVER expect what happens. Highly recommended for boys and girls of all ages (to a point, I'm not saying a 6 year old would enjoy it)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would Not Recommend,This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is poorly cast and poorly acted. It was not entertaining at all; more on the line of irritating. My wife and I agreed that watching it gave us knots in our stomachs rather than being a relaxing or amusing experience. The only possible redeeming part of the movie is Scarlett Johansson: because she is so pretty but the part she plays is such a bitch not even that makes up for it. I have been a Woody Allen fan for years and can't believe that a comic like him could write such a script.I think he should return to stories like 'Mighty Aphrodite' that will entertain and amuse viewers.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The confirmation (another) of a genius,"With this remarkable film, Woody Allen reassures both fans, non-fans and critics that he is still one of the few genius cinema has left. I am definitely going to label it as a masterpiece. Again Mr. Allen shows his deep knowledge of the human behaviour, and specially his most irrational (or not so) actions. An immoral and cynical story, where such things as love, lust, welfare, greed or luck play a more important role than the characters themselves. Its a case study about the concrete and the abstract. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the non-chalant Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy that fought his way up (you may say he is a social climber), and after finding his El Dorado (marries the sweet and rich Chloe), is faced with a terrible choice (as he says, he must choose between love and lust), Scarlett Johansson, as a sexy actress that has not yet found her way to the top, and all the crew have astonishingly intense performances. The dialog is both clever and literate, the environment is elegant and charming. The very first minutes of the movie particularly dazzled me, and you really become aware of the important role luck plays in one's life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
excellent riveting,"Stark, menacing. Echoes of Hitchcock and Allens earlier movie Crimes and Misdemeanors. A young man's ride of opportunism that leads to some extremely difficult choices. For me this is one of Woody Allen's best movies. London was an excellent backdrop for this theatrical tale. Excellent cast ..the performances ranged from solid to excellent. Scarlett Johansson is great as an Amercican femme fatale actress wannabe .. a fish out of water amongst the London posh set. Johnathan Rhys Myers sullen oportunist is entirely believable. I loved the art direction and camera work. The visual style created an interesting backdrop for the emerging dread. No dark corners or mood lighting.

He captured the British aristocracy, Irish easy, and American money-lover in a dynamic dance of suspense and lust.I could feel the tension in the theater as the plot twisted and the viewers' minds tried to grapple with passion, deceit, and crime. At the end of the movie, there was an audible gasp - ""Is that it?"" ""Wait, go back!"" ""What happened?"" I'll be thinking and talking about Matchpoint for quite a while. I rate it second to Crimes and Misdemeanors which had a better motive for ""eliminating the problem"".Not to be missed if you like movies the way they used to make them!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Extra-marital affairs are never without risks,"This is a great movie It is about the risk of a married man (into a wealthy family)having an affair with a young, much poorer, and aspiring actress. The affair, like most other affairs, starts off with pure passion, lust and wild sex, not love, before the man is married and before she is separated from her rich boyfriend. After the marriage, he is bored with his rich wife sexually and is tempted by her and he rekindles the affair with the now-single actress. He loves his wife and the luxurious life she brings to him through her rich father but he enjoys the wild lusty sex with her. So he does not want to leave his wife for her until an important life event happens that tests the strength and the foundation of the affair and his love for his wife and his lust ( ?? love) for his mistress. The movie shows what a man is forced to do to resolve this dilemma.I think this movie warns those who are married NOT to have sexual affairs as most affairs end up tragically especially if the affair is conducted between a married man and an unmarried, poorer loser........unless you have the audacity to leave your spouse, children and comfortable life for the sake of love for the person you are having an affair with. Sadly most affairs start off by lust and passion and not love and as most people have human feelings, one-night stands and short-term affairs often create more feelings and lead to something more and they cannot stand the test of time and important and tragic life events unless the two partners really love each other.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

They were a bit difficult to understand on one hearing.I am a native English speaker.I enjoyed Emily Mortimer's gangly walk in the early long shots of her which helped to build her character. You could say that the film was a London travelogue but not using the usual historical buildings and stuff. No. The story was played out in front of terribly exclusive frontage of upmarket famous jewellers and fashion houses and opulent Thames embankment dwellings and offices.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Game!,"Woody Allen has been making movies for just over forty years so it seems reasonable to wonder just how much of a departure MATCH POINT really could be from a director who's neurotic mistrust of love and life looms over most of his offerings. Even as he gets on in years and no longer takes on the lead acting responsibilities, cutting down to merely writing and directing one film a year on average, the ghost of the Woody Allen caricature finds it's way into the picture (see Jason Biggs in ANYTHING ELSE or Will Ferrell in MELINDA AND MELINDA.) The lead here, tennis pro turned instructor, Chris Wilton is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. We meet him after Woody's classic plain white text on black background opening credits, interviewing for a job and looking for a London flat. The young lad worked his way out of a poor Irish background into the pro-tennis circuit before retiring for a more stable life where he could appreciate the finer things life had to offer, like opera and art. In opposition to past leads, he is well put together, focused. He has his eye on the ball, if you will. This is not to say he has everything figured out or is without fear. He knows he wants to do something of value with his life, isn't clear on what exactly that is but also does not let hesitation paralyze him. Upon meeting Chloe Hewett (the glowing Emily Mortimer), Chris' biggest similarity to the Woody Allen archetype becomes apparent. Despite all his efforts and subsequent accomplishments, he is a pessimist. He may appreciate the finer things but his belief is the finest things are those capable of capturing and communicating everything that is tragic about life. Can a pessimist truly know love? Woody seems to think yes, at least at first. Chloe is an eternal optimist who has never known anything tragic about life and despite their differences they fall in love while walking around London, which Allen frames like postcards in much the same way he has framed Manhattan for years.Woody has a strong handle on the visual direction, allowing characters to walk in and out of the frame when we would expect them to. There are no surprises, just a natural direction, suggesting that Woody knows exactly what we will want to see as we watch from behind bushes or fences. More importantly, he has an even stronger control on this, his finest screenplay since 1992's HUSBANDS AND WIVES. MATCHPOINT is ultimately about luck, how little importance we place on luck despite the significant role it plays in our lives and how far we're willing to push our own luck. Chris, a devout believer in the influence luck has on his life, decides to close his eyes and hope for the best when he embarks on an affair with Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson), his soon-to-be brother-in-law's fiancé. The two gravitate towards each other, pulled by an uncontrollable sexual desire. Separately, they each represent opposite ends of the luck spectrum. Chris is still riding his lucky streak, scoring his tennis instructor job, meeting Chloe, getting a job at one of her father's business firms. Whereas Nola is still trying to escape hers, running away from her dead-end Colorado home, struggling to make it as an actress and eventually losing her fiancé, Tom (Matthew Goode). The question then is how much better is Chris' luck when all the successes he stumbles upon are not what he wants but what he believes he should want?Further strengthening Woody's script, is the issue of class woven in and out of the entire film. Both Chris and Nola come from modest backgrounds at best and are dating members of London's higher society. Tom and Chloe are happy, High-spirited people with all the time in the world to pursue their interests  opera, tennis, opening an art gallery. Chris and Nola have been working their whole lives to get where they are with Nola finding she still has a great deal of work ahead of her while she's not certain she has it in her to get there. For Tom and Chloe, there is no flipside to the coin and new opportunities arise all the time. They've always been lucky and what makes them descent is at least they can each acknowledge their fortunate existence. Nola has yet to truly know luck and lack of enthusiasm in her speech shows how little faith she has in potentially finding it. But it is the taste of a fortunate man's life that is new to Chris Wilton. He has a driver now and his new flat no longer has a fold out sofa bed but it does have one of the most spectacular views of London available. So when his affair with Nola begins to threaten his newfound cushion of a life, he is forced to make a decision for the first time instead of leaving everything to chance. This decision brings about a tension and discomfort that is so rarely achieved in film-making today. Woody manages to blindside his audience without using it as a gimmick or relying on twists to give the film its ultimate meaning.Be it lucky in life or unlucky in love, Woody serves up a film about the game itself. We may all think that we have control, that we hold the power over our lives or that we are making the decisions that will move us forward. What Woody wants to remind us is that, like a game, we don't get to make any of these decisions until it's our turn to serve and we certainly don't know what our opponents will do next despite how well we think we know their game.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is a clever film. It is an unexpected film from the master of neurotics in New York. The actors are superb.

Crime and punishment,"Very much of an Ingmar Bergnan's complicated personalities and voices meets a modern version of Fyodor Dostoyevski's Crime and punishment. Woody Allen's latest movie examines those 50/50 moments when life can go one way or the other, audiences will be equally split. Others bored of a decade of more misses than hits, will find it pretentious and stale. Whatever you think, its clear that Allen's first UK based film has given him some fresh settings and a big target in the shape of super posh Brits.

Fine and unexpected thriller from Woody.,"A tennis coach turned businessman (Jonathan Rhys Myers) begins an affair with his brother in law's former fiancée (Scarlett Johansson) but can't decide whether to leave his wife (Emily Mortimer), whose family has provided him with upper-class comforts, or to break it off with the mistress.Impressive film written and directed by Woody Allen, this is very much a change of pace for the veteran filmmaker. The film is very well written as Allen ensures his script touches on themes of fate and luck, which ultimately have an enormous bearing on the climax, and class struggle and the desire to enter 'higher society'. The acting is excellent as Myers' character is both shifty and almost likable. Allen draws considerable suspense throughout the film as we (the audience) ultimately follow Myers and, in the tradition of the best of Hitchcock, want him to succeed even when his intentions take a turn for the worse. Perhaps a tad slow in parts and hence slightly overlong, but overall a very impressive film. This was likely influenced by A Place in the Sun (1951), which is also recommended. Also with Brian Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly enjoyable touch of British drama.,"Having never seen this upon its release, I had to settle for a small screen viewing and I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The characters are fatefully intertwined by a central character who unravels further and further like a modern-day MacBeth into a downward spiral at an increasing rate of knots. His tale of deception, lies and mistruths to cover his tracks makes for a gripping finale. You can sense what's around the corner, but you just have to keep watching to see him hopefully get his just deserts. I loved the ending (some might not), but I really loved the ride that takes us there. It makes you feel uncomfortable and a film like this needs to take your feelings and give them a little twist the way Woody Allen does with this. The characters have depth and we actually feel for them in what will be inevitable suffering at some future point. I won't ruin it with spoilers, except to say that if you've had some Woody Allen disappointments - this effort just might reinstate your interest in his work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Addiction of Love, Lust & Money","This sexy suspenseful thriller is the best movie of its kind I've seen in a long time. I know this because I didn't want to get up to go to the bathroom in fear that I would miss something. This is now my favorite Woody Allen film topping my past favorite ""Everyone says I love you"".The film draws you in right away with the beautiful setting of this elite London tennis club for the ultra-rich. The main character Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro wash-out turned tennis instructor. He is an American who is not from the same socioeconomic background of his clients, but blends in quite nicely with his sophistication and charm. Tom (played by Matthew Goode) is a wealthy student of Wilton who quickly becomes a friend sharing a common love: Opera. The relationship of the two men makes a brief head fake towards homo-sexuality before Tom's sister Chloe (played by Emily Mortimer) is introduced to Chris. She has her eyes set on him from the very start. Chloe invites Chris to the mansion for a gathering and the two take a swift liking towards each other.While at the estate Chris stumbles upon Nola. Nola is played by Scarlett Johansson who does a stand-out performance. She is a sexy seductive American struggling actress who unexpectedly is the fiancé of Tom. Chris and Nola have immediate unspoken magnetic attraction towards each other portrayed nicely through their lustful eye contact. Later, a family feud sends angry Nora out on a walk alone which doesn't go unnoticed by Chris. He runs quickly after Nora, once he reaches her he makes the risky choice to kiss her which results in a steamy sex encounter in the pouring rain. Great scene, but could have been a little longer and more explicit given the excitement it creates.Despite his attraction towards Nola, Chris continues his relationship with Chloe by default because Nola refuses to risk her engagement to Tom. This finally results in a marriage to Chloe based primarily on money and career advancement for Chris made possible through Chloe's family business connections. Chloe wants children with Chris right away and tries relentlessly to get pregnant. However, Chris wants no part of this with thoughts of Nora clouding his mind. When Chris surprisingly learns of the break up of Tom and Nola, he obsessively pursues Nora. Initially Nora is reluctant to oblige Chris's advances, but he breaks her protective wall and she neurotically falls in love with him. Chris eventually is confused about his feelings for Nola trying to define love or lust. While Chris continues the precarious lustful affair with Nola the impermissible happens: she gets pregnant. This is where the drama turns to thriller and gets the adrenaline pumping. How far will Chris go to protect his new found family, stability, money and power? Will he experience his own self proclaimed ""stroke of luck""?This story line is easy to relate to on a personal level because of the choices we make in relationships/marriages, ultimately for the wrong reasons.... and how greener the grass always looks on the other side. I could identify with the emotions the characters went through when dealing with love, lust, and money. Which one should be the most important to us? Love is the easiest answer, but lust and money can lure the best of us down a regrettable path. We learn that having too much of one without the balance of the others can be devastating for our peace of mind and over all contentment.The movie makes you crave a happy romantic ending but your instincts tell you otherwise. A must see in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
4 turned into 8 in two minutes!,"By exactly the 115 minute of this film's runtime I already made up my mind this film was a four as I saw how boringly obvious the end was going to, but exactly two minutes before the end the FOUR turned to an EIGHT just suddenly!

Very good except....,"I loved this film, but as an opera director, I had one big beef, which I'm sure was a money saver - the performances at Covent Garden were accompanied by piano on practically non- existent sets - very disappointing! Otherwise, an excellent film. This is the most satisfying Woody Allen film in recent memory, and the plot twists toward the end, and the recurring symbolism was great. I found Jonathan Rhys-Myers performance very rich, and all of the other performers were strong. A pity that the excellent Brian Cox's part was not fleshed out more - I am always intrigued by his performances. The operatic selections were well thought out, and in some cases (ie the Otello excerpt) creepily appropriate. I was glad to see a setting outside of New York City, and as always, Allen catches ""atmosphere"" as well as anyone. Wonderful film overall!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Match Pointless,"Really weak plot, uninspiring dialog, predictable acting. Woody is just not very good at drama and he proves it once again. The forced parallel with Crime & Punishment is a drag and Chris Wilton is sure no Raskolnikov. The plot may have worked as a cream puff romantic comedy, but it's not funny, save for the unintentional comic effect of the badly written characters spewing banal truisms with tragic facial expressions. The attempts at depth and wisdom are so weak, dishonest and lazy, it's the level of high-school poetry. It may have worked as a crime movie, but it's not very exciting. Just predictability all around. Even the twists in the plot are not very surprising. Oh, and the dialog. Just dreadful. Plain dreadful.Don't waste your time on it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
One Of The Best Thrillers Of All Time,"Hitchcock = suspense. Scorsese = gritty drama. Ford = westerns. Allen = comedy.What you have read above is all true. Except for one thing. Hitchcock is the master of suspense, Scorsese is the master of gritty drama's, Ford is the master of westerns. Allen is the master of comedy, suspense, drama and thriller. And he proves it, he really proves it, in Match Point.Young retired tennis player Chris Wilton accepts a job as a tennis instructor at a posh tennis club in London. One day, he shares a court with Tom Hewett, destined to become his brother-in-law. He marries Hewett's sister, Chloe a few months later. Wilton climbs his way up the ladder at work, working for his father-in-law. He basically is very well set. He has a bright future. Only one problem, he is also involved in an intense sexual relationship with his brother-in-law's fiancée.The film is definitely one of the best thrillers ever to hit the screen. The performances by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johanasson and Emily Mortimer are excellent. Rhys Meyers and Johanasson are especially noteworthy. The film's setting suits it perfectly. Then there is the fact that it's directed by Woody Allen.I might be stressing this point a little too much but, it's. Directed. By. Woody. Allen. There I think I got my point across. Allen, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, The Purple Rose Of Cairo, Midnight In Paris. That Woody Allen. That being said, it is probably Allen's second best film (after Annie Hall). It is a great stylistic thriller. His direction is flawless. The screenplay, also written by Allen contains some of the best crackling, suspenseful, witty dialogue written in years.The film is a must see for any Allen fan, or a fan of any good thriller. It is, in my opinion, the best film of 2005, and one of the greatest thrillers to hit the big screen since the 70's. It's stylish, intense and thoroughly evolving. Match Point is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Don't believe in luck?? Lets see if ""Match Point"" can change that.","The movie really went from disaster to masterpiece within the last five minutes. It makes its case with the whole ""luck"" factor being an integral part of everyone' life and makes it well. Although the script is definitely not any more believable than a spruced up sci-fi, ""awesome"" is the word for this movie. However, it's not exactly the same as space shuttles docked on meteors planting nukes. ""Match Point"" makes it case about life and luck from the word GO and successfully nails it in with a wedding ring saving families, careers and feigned innocence.Jonathan Rhys Meyers, playing Chris Wilton, does an incredible job playing a small time tennis instructor who gets involved with a wealthy conglomerate's daughter and soon bowls her over. Her parents decide to groom the young man ordering roasted chicken instead of soaked caviar towards becoming their son-in-law. Understandably, Chris is doing a great job running his father-in-law's business while scaling the corporate ladder. The movie does not explain however, if Chris got his MBA from Harvard or Kelloggs !! Soon he falls prey to Nola's(played by Scarlett) drop dead gorgeousness who incidentally happens to have been engaged to his wife's brother but only to break up soon. Chris nurses his affair while his wife nurses her obsession to get pregnant repeatedly albeit a slow starter. What follows is a bunch of credible and not so credible romanticizing. Chris soon gets torn apart with his affair and his career centric marriage and decides to do something radical and drastic. Chris' actions however, although seemingly adroit wouldn't really fit into a professional's handbook. Well, ""Fortune does Favour Brave Chris"" in the end. I really got Lost in Translation with Scarlett and have been watching out for her ever since and she definitely doesn't disappoint with this one either. Soundtrack predominantly has an operatic allure and it somehow seems to fit.All in all, ""Match Point"" is definitely worth all the ""dead presidents"" and if you already believe in luck get ready for some reinforcements.9 on 10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Magical Woody Allen,"""Match Point"" moves fast. Everything happens so quickly that you miss it if you turn your head around. Even so, the movie's length is over two hours, and when you think an hour has gone by, only thirty minutes have passed. My grandmother said: ""They say it's not like Woody Allen's films but it has the eye of the genius"". She was right; Allen has created the most common plot line with the least common results.Basing it slightly in something about a question of luck, the master places his game in Britain, particularly in London, precisely in the high class of the city. An Irish tennis instructor, former professional, called Chris Wilton (the growing talent Jonathan Rhys Meyers) requests to give classes in a tennis club. Soon he buys an apartment and meets Tom Hewett (a surprising Matthew Goode), and goes to an opera with his parents because they share the same passion.This is when you wonder if Chris could have studied Tom and known what he liked, if he just sensed it or if he just had luck. Chris says at the beginning of the film: ""There's a time in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net and remains in mid air for a second. With a little luck, the ball goes over and you win; or it doesn't, and you loose"". That statement is presented later in the movie with many situations but specifically with one crucial moment.Soon, again, Chris meets and starts dating Tom sister's Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and going to his parents' (flawless but limited Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton) country house, generating a good relationship with them. We get to know the main character (all of the characters) and we predict his ambitions and the place he wants to arrive. However, he is surrounded by people who play the game, know the rules and are aware of the consequences.But there's always a weakness; in this case, it is Chris' very believable affection for Chloe. When Chloe's parents realize that they're both becoming close, they want to help him, even if he (very intelligently) didn't ask for it. Then Nola Rice, (each time better, Scarlett Johansson) Tom's fiancée appears, and meets while playing ping-pong when he tires to help her in a provocative way. ""Didn't they tell you that your game is aggressive?"", she asks him. ""Didn't they tell you that you have sexy lips?"", he responds.Now Chris has done a lot to get where he is and knows that the only of screwing it up is by ""making a pass"" at her""; or so she tells him. The vocabulary and way of speaking used in every scene is admirable. In the line of what Patrick Marber did in ""Closer"" recently, but in a better way, Allen makes the character's seduction believable with his words. We believe it here, because we are allowed to be in their minds.Then we sit and watch, patiently, and when we think we know the characters, actions take place and we can't believe what we were thinking. That's why Woody Allen's screenplay highlights more than his direction; that's why the screenplay is the high point: it astonishes. His direction, on the other hand shows the always great acting control and a camera that makes a long movement observing each scene it shoots.The music is simply constituted by long or short or whole parts of famous Operas, which is as tragic as the tone of the story, editor Alisa Lepselter draws a lot of attention because of the rough cuts that definitely prove that Allen is not doing one of his last nice comedies. The central character does lots of things to cause an effect on people and to win them; but Chris Wilton is no Tom Ripley.Ripley was a true genius, uninterested in what his decisions would cause to anyone; Wilton lies down with a manual about reading Dostoievski so he can impress an old man. Ripley didn't feel; Wilton is vulnerable, and doesn't own a mastermind: so he depends on luck. It could be enough, or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointed,Disappointed in this movie. The acting was wooden and the storyline weak. I felt no chemistry between Johansson and Rhys Meyers at all.Just didn't buy into the movie at all....a bit of a yawn.The relationships between the main characters were all very shallow and I felt no substance at all. We never really got to see inside them nor did the characters develop into anything you could really get your teeth into. I felt everyone was holding back. The friendship between Goode and Rhys Meyers was not believable and everything felt contrieved.This was not a good vehicle for the actors but then the script probably didn;t give them much to work with.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance
wow !!!!!  **spoiler**,I have heard a lot about Woody Allen and I was excited before watching this one as this was my first movie of Allen. Nevertheless I was not disappointed. It was amazing. The story was one of the greatest and the casts were awesome. The twists and turns (although that came late in the movie) were worth the long duration of the movie. The movie is slow in pace but I understand the necessity as the story needs a lot of relationship make and break in between the final climax. I am myself a firm believer in luck so I could very easily relate my thoughts with the protagonist and approve the story and the twist at the end. I especially liked the scene where Chris talks with the ghosts. The reasoning he provides are worth preserving and I cannot forget the lines ever. It makes his actions totally acceptable. Awesome ! Majestic !The movie made me jump out of my seat. Watch it and you wont regret. just keep patience.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
woody Allen can still make a fantastic thriller,"this seductive and shocking film is a story of how luck can change in an instant. Chris is a former pro tennis player who now is a tennis coach. then he meets Tom, a man who has a wealthy family. he invites Chris to the opera, where he meets Chole. they hit it off right away and begin a serious relationship. Chris wants to be part of her wealthy family. then things crumble when he meets Nola played greatly by Scarlett Johanson. She's Tom's girlfriend. she's a starving actress from Colorado. they like each other immediately, she's everything opposite of Chole, she's seductive, sexy, and unwealthy, also is kind of a femma fatale type. the parents of Chole and Tom like Chris, but not Nola. the mom makes a rude comment about Nola's work status, Nola gets upset and storms out. she goes outside and cries. Chris follows her and kisses her... then they make love. they keep it a secret. and Nola dosen't want it to go any further. Then Chris marries Chole and Tom dumps Nola, and soon marries someone else. Chris runs into Nola and they have a drink, then go to her place, and begin a steamy affair. they become inseparable, and then Nola gets pregnant. Chris dosen't know what to do. Nola gets upsets because Chris won't tell Chole. she threatens to rat him out to Chole. So Chris finds a drastic solution to end all the worrying, he kills Nola, and her neighbor to make it look like a robbery. he almost gets charged but luck saves him they link a thief to the murders. This is different then most of Allen's newer movies it's shot in London and is more of a drama/thriller. great acting and a big climax. Allen's back.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, but certainly not a masterpiece","If you look at the graph of voting on this movie, the greatest number of voters give ""Match Point"" at 10, which seems to me ridiculous. The movie has any number of flaws: a few awkward bits of dialogue, excessive length, and a premise which is sufficiently tired.The casting is perfect, a number of individual scenes are masterfully directed, and the play of characters and situations is really quite deft. You don't leave the movie thinking about your OWN life (ugh!), but rather reconsidering and debating the options, motives, and mistakes of the characters. Which is to say, it is a fairly believable, adult film.Maybe in this day and age, that is enough to make a movie seem like an all-time masterpiece, so let me say, compared to any number of films which came out in the past four years, this certainly is a ""10,"" and in that case I'm not sure of the criteria on which one rates these things.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Renewed my desire to continue watching Woody Allen films,"I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen, but continue to give him a lot of chances to redeem himself. I understand the very small niche he contributes to, and can appreciate it for what it is, even if I never seem to end up overly liking any of the films I have watched of his. But after getting tons of great reviews and even an Oscar nomination, I knew I had to see Match Point. I am very happy to say that after viewing it, I was actually impressed.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has moved to London and is looking for a job. Being a minor professional tennis player, he gets a job teaching at a local country club and ends up meeting Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode). Tom happens to be a member of a rather rich business-orientated family, and happily welcomes Chris to join his family to watch the opera, and later to go to a party the family is hosting. Chris meets and almost instantaneously becomes very acquainted with Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), while charming his parents (Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton). At the party however, he ends up meeting Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a sexy American actress, who just happens to be engaged to Tom. He is obviously smitten for her, but attempts to resist his primal urges and stick with Chloe.It may not sound like too much, but the movie is not really that complicated. It is fairly straight forward and like every other Allen film, is very dialogue driven. The film itself feels very slow and pretentious for its first half as a result of this fact, but then picks up and does not let up afterwards. By moving and sticking to a London setting instead of his traditional New York, Allen has transcended his standard film-making process, and has carved himself out something almost totally different than his past films. It has its darkly humorous moments, but for the most part, is a slow building, and totally worthwhile thriller. 2005 was a year of maturity for many prolific Hollywood personalities, and Woody Allen is no different.The cinematography really captures London, albeit from a very tourist looking prospective. It does not feel gritty or glossy, just very much in vein with something that feels a bit amateurish. It still looks wonderful of course. The editing is quick and does not bother lingering, something that many of Hollywood's newest filmmakers need to master. The script is very well rounded, and has the sense of being created by a master auteur. The dialogue is great, and very individual for all of the characters. Unfortunately, it does get a bit unrealistic at times, and becomes slightly silly. There were a few exchanges that just felt out of place in the film, and really beg the question of why they were even there in the first place. It is not terribly original (begging the question of the real reason for his Oscar nomination), but it still works and is much more clever than most modern cinema is.The addition of the opera music is a particularly great touch. It ascends and descends majestically and artfully throughout the entire film, and is absolutely fascinating to listen to and revel within. I have never seen a real opera in my life, but I feel Match Point would be a fairly close representation of one.Meyers is great as Chris. He is a bit flakey at first, but as his naivety begins to get the better of him, his performance really begins to shine. Much like the film, his performance is a graceful build right into something worthwhile. Not to give anything away, but as the film nears its ending, you can tell that this guy is really going to make something of himself in years to come. Johansson is her regular smoldering gorgeous self, and much like Meyers, gives her performance a while to build up. It is nowhere near as strong a performance as Meyers, or even some of her previous work, but is still very much proving that she is one of the best young actresses in Hollywood today (and obviously, one of the most beautiful).Supporting work is excellent across the board, from Goode to Cox to Wilton to everyone in-between. Allen has put together a very good ensemble, and all of them work wonderfully together. Mortimer is of particular mention, as her character's transition throughout the film is outstanding.Quibbles aside, the film is a great watch, and renews my desire to watch more of Woody Allen's older films. It is a very well made film, and is a definite worthwhile watch.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Horror Story for our Times,"In interviews and documentaries, Woody Allen has always claimed to believe in the accidental, and thus morally neutral universe. In Matchpoint he gives us a picture of what life would be like in a world ""where everything is permitted"".He begins with a reference to Dostoevski who proposed that even if God didn't exist, we would have to invent Him because humanity and civilization are dependent on the belief that the universe is ultimately a just place. Allen has his latter day Raskolnikov make the pronouncement that ""faith is the easy way out"".He then provides us a picture of a world where life is inherently devoid of meaning and where the summum bonum is to make lots of money, live well, and to have children, so they can do the same. It is a vacuous life that is hollow at the core and which hardly seems to be worth living.If one takes his protagonist as a role model, it seems that Mr. Allen believes that the only truly self-actualized person is the psycho-path. Conscience is merely a hindrance that interferes with one's personal development.Ultimately, Mr. Allen gives us a horrific view of life as he sees it, and inadvertently makes Dostoevski's case for him in a rather brilliant fashion. Postscript. Judging from Cloe's demeanor when she realizes he is having an affair, it is clear to me that he does not have to kill her, If he had simply told her part of the truth, she would have called daddy, who would have called a friend in the home office, and Nola would have been deported and the problem solved.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do you believe in luck?,"Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the movie up to now, after it's about a month I've seen 'Scoop', but it doesn't matter. It's a masterpiece that one should not suppose that everybody knows and understands what Allen wants to visualize.In the recent years, Allen has gained the courage to put on the little tiny facts that ordinary people would not feel and understand in their lives. Sometimes comedy and drama are such mixed up that you cannot differ like 'Melinda and Melinda' and sometimes the comedy part is so strong that one may think is't just a cheap TV series like 'Small time crooks' and sometimes the drama part is heavily taking your breath that you forget that you have to expect some comedy in this movie like 'Matchpoint'.Maybe matchpoint is too drama and maybe one of the reasons is that Allen is not playing in it with his unique dialogs and accent; but it's lovely. And, believe it or not; it's lovely that an American in Hollywood dares to use such ordinary facts in life (which are quiet important to European and Eastern artists) as the main line of his stories and develops and expands the case in such a comedy noir/drama style that none of the a.m. artist cannot even think about that, maybe some exceptions like Emir Kustarica or Roberto Benini are 'SOMEHOW' alike Mr. Allen. This is why Allen is 'UNIQUE'...How many times have you think about 'LUCK' in your life? There are quiet several periods in my life that I tried to prove that we are making and ruining the luck for ourselves and quiet several periods of time that I really have believed that it's out of our control. But what Mr. Allen thinks about that? The point is it's not important for him, although it is said in the beginning narration that some people are afraid of the fact that it's uncontrollable but the movie is about something more important that I believe the main comedy part is hidden behind this fact:Is Chris lucky? What is luck by your opinion? Was the reflex of the ring good luck or bad luck to Chris?Specially think about the last question. I think that when the ghost of Nola told Chris 'You have to pay for what you did' the next sequence is the officer waking up and finding the true answer, but ...... we are wrong! This is not about what Nola's ghost said. What Nola forecasted (maybe) was finding the bounced ring in the pocket of the killed addict which resulted in finding Chris not guilty. I mean, the point is successful escaping for law is BAD LUCK for Chris as he has a miserable life in a golden cage ( like an Iranian idiom: The inside of my life in burning me and the outside of my life is burning the others! ) Maybe finally when he is about to dye or even much sooner he would wish that he had not escaped for what he had done.This is the real comedy side of this movie that leaves you in confusion that what is good luck and what is bad luck. Please do not suppose that Allen can answer you because this is the question that no one can answer ... no one. It depends and just the one who is experiencing the case has the right to talk about that.This is what makes me love Mr. Allens masterpieces. The works that every person can understand some layers of it and it is obvious that why during the recent years there are many people who hate his works. They just want the basic layers that right now Allen is not worried for them and as he gets older and more experienced he is concentrating on the deeper layers. I think that Allen has his own - very unique - style that can just be achieved by someone who is talented and thoughtful as Woody Allen AND has directed, written, acted and ... in more that 50 movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's script cheats to make his film work,"Although a mild thriller with beautiful people and sets, and even a philosophy of luck with which I totally agree, in order to make his point, plot and film work, Woody sloppily leaves out a routine forensic activity, which is distracting at best and at worst, spoils an otherwise well-crafted film. My daughter laughed when I told her that I must write to Woody and call him on this blatant gap. Still, the film had both erotic and tense moments enough to hold most moviegoers and a pace to satisfy even restless husbands who demand action. The London setting was a refreshing change from New York and Woody does his usual good thing of taking us into really interesting and beautiful homes to live out his film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The long promised return to form,"Now affectionately known as his 'London picture', presumably to distinguish it from all those other 'Noo Yawk' pictures, ""Match Point"" is unmistakably Allen. He has said that originally he wrote it for a New York setting and that the changes for London were purely cosmetic, and in doing so he has alienated a large number of British critics who feel that Allen's high-brow, intellectual, art-orientated dialogue doesn't ring true in a British setting. Rubbish! This smart, intelligent film is worth a hundred Richard Curtis rom-coms and it's Allen's understanding of what humanizes his characters that makes it so.Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the tennis coach who through good looks, better manners and an excess of guile, not to mention extraordinary luck, worms his way into the affections of a reliably realistic upper-class British family and in particular into the bed of the sweetly vacant daughter. From here on his trajectory can only be upwards until he falls in love the son's American fiancée, (a fabulously willful Scarlett Johansson). Then the waters muddy.This is Allen in a serious mode. There are no deliberate laughs, though the irony of the later scenes isn't entirely lost. Nor are the allusions to Dostoyevsky whom we see the hero reading at the beginning. The material isn't particularly new either, (he covers similar ground in ""Crimes and Misdemeanours""), but the movie is so intelligent and accurate that it represents something of that return to the form we have been waiting for, (as did last year's ""Melinda and Melinda"" and this is a step-up from that).As ever Allen confirms his position as one of the greatest of all directors of actors. Here he has a superb ensemble. Rhys Meyers has his best part so far and makes the most of it and Johansson turns what could have been a shrew into a multi-faceted, vulnerable young woman. The family Rhys Meyers wheedles his way into, eventually through marriage, is superbly represented by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton, (parents), and Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer (siblings). Again in the hands of a lesser writer, (Richard Curtis, perhaps?), these people could so easily have been the most basic of caricatures but Allen bestows on them a kind of gentle affection; they are nice people for all their wealth, looks and sense of class. The mother's rejection of Scarlett Johansson as a potential daughter-in-law is only in part based on her feelings that she is 'beneath' them, (so, too, is Meyers, but he has potential). Rather, perhaps, she sees in her that fundamental lack of stability she later comes to display. And there are pleasing cameos, too, from the likes of Margaret Tyzack and James Nesbitt.Allen, himself, feels ""Match Point"" may be his best picture. For those of us who still feel ""Interiors"", ""Manhatten"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" are masterpieces that may seem something of a blinkered boast. Nevertheless, Allen working at a level just below his very best is still someone who can whip most of the opposition into a corner.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

My wife and I often disagree about what makes an enjoyable and interesting story.

How come the critics cannot see that ""match point"" is a very poor and pale copy of his previous but utterly brilliant masterpiece ""crimes and misdemeanors"" (simply one of the best movie ever made by the way!)or that he even ""borrowed"" from others like Antony Minghella's ""the talented Mr Ripley""? it's been 10 years since we're witnessing the fall down of Woody (small time crooks - celebrity - deconstructing harry - curse of the jade scorpion - Hollywood ending), and now is the time to say it cause his last is so flawed, so bland, so badly acted and dare i say it so idiotic but still pretentious that it hurts whenever critics think that us, moviegoers, are too stupid to recognize it. Yes i am sorry to admit it too but Woody Allen is Over. period.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Your Typical Woody Allen Film,"Say what you want about Woody Allen, the guy makes some good films. He makes some bad films too. Heck, he's made a movie every year for the last four decades, there's bound to be one or two stinkers in there. But Match Point, for my money, is his best yet.It's just so different. It is his most different work from anything else he has done and, unlike his other films, it is not immediately identifiable as A Woody Allen film, if not for his name in the credits. That's a good thing by the way. Different is good.But moreover, it's different from anything I've ever seen before or since. Not so different that it feels TOO different. It's still very fun, unpredictable, and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until the end, and then sends you home with a an ear-to-ear grin on your face. See it if you haven't yet. Tell your friends to see it. It's very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Match point scores,"I'm sorry, but I have NEVER understood Woody Allen's genius.I do not understand why he is so respected in the artistic cinema circles, nor why is he considered one of the all time great comedians, writers and directors.I am sorry. I don't.Enter Match Point.Now THIS is something I can see the genius of... this movie is a tennis lesson, is watching Aggassi play Bjorn Borg the Wimbledon cup final. It is watching the ace serve hit the net, and dauntingly hovering in the air... and the stadium in sepulchral silence.That is the movie. I guess that description IS a spoiler on its own.Woody Allen plays a tennis match with our minds, with our morals and makes us wonder... Would I? You watch the movie and you are constantly asking yourself: Now, why didn't I think of that? Wait... Why did I ask my self that question? As if your reasoning was serving and your common sense wanted to return it, neither wanting to loose.Then, the ball hits the net and hovers in the air. Then the movie ends and you have watched a great tennis match in the form of brilliant acting, superb directing, and genius stature story writing.If this is Woody Allen's work, then I MUST re-visit his movies to understand why I missed the genius in the first place.Pffft... No wonder, all his movies have been aces, and like an amateur tennis player, I couldn't even see the ball until the game was over...In the match point.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What bad luck!,"Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" has surprised me for the better. He had high expectations and has exceeded them.
In this film Woody takes away the direct comic element, to present a sober and thoughtful story about the role of chance in life, the priorities of high society and destroys the myth of the self-made man.
It does not have an innovative plot, but the depth and complexity of the main character are worthy of Dostoyevsky (read Crime and Punishment). In addition to having one of the best roles of Scarlett Johannson.

Woody Allen's Stunning Film Noire Tribute to Stanley Kubrick,"Woody Allen is fond of quoting other great artists, and often includes samples, snippets and glimpses of their work in his own. For Match Point, a very sly subtle murder thriller, you would think his inspiration must be Hitchcock. Or maybe Dostoevsky. Or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Or possibly even himself. You'd be wrong. Dead wrong. The most direct influence this time is the great Stanley Kubrick whose classic Eighteenth Century period piece Barry Lyndon sets a clear model of high style and languid pacing. Kubrick's sprawling tale of an Irish commoner—whose fate is no more determined by his own ambitions than it is by sheer arbitrary luck—luxuriates in visual splendor. Woody, too, lavishes great attention on the continual procession of impeccable London locales and rambling country estates, and on the stunningly attractive characters who inhabit them. Scarlett Johansson's radiant beauty, Woody seems to suggest, is reason enough to film her. When she's on screen everything is suddenly so intensified, so much more visceral. She may have a clumsy delivery and often awkward physicality, but her voluptuous contours and magnificent face mercilessly seduces the camera. Likewise, her counterpart, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, possesses a face engineered for film. His full sensual lips echo Scarlet's, as if implying that their ill fated lives are not only metaphysically preordained, but also genetically inevitable.Kubrick, himself a native New Yorker (Bronx) who transplanted himself to England in 1961 to work independent of the Hollywood nonsense, enjoyed film simply for its own aesthetics. He took excruciating care in composing, lighting and staging his scenes and the results are often breathtaking moments of cinematic art. Woody saw in Barry Lyndon an enviable standard of indulgent visuals, and like his own masterpiece homage to his cherished hometown, Manhattan, he spared no effort in capturing iconic views and vistas of posh London and the Arcadian countryside. While Kubrick's tale meanders for over three hours, Woody has limited his to just two, but even this modest length out lasts his usual film by a full thirty minutes. This extra half hour Woody invests in both developing well rounded complex lead characters, and also reveling in the often spectacular country landscapes. Some viewers will undoubtedly find fault with the intentionally thinly drawn support characters—more elegant props than actual personalities—but this contrivance only heightens the allegorical quality of this severely morbid morality tale.It moves along gracefully at first, gently developing a hypnotically pulsing rhythm that gradually builds and quickens as the predicament surprisingly grows dire. After a series of exceptionally well paced set pieces confidently establishing the form that this thrill ride will take, it eventually, inexorably, explodes into a frantic, feverish fit of mayhem.Upon reflection I realized that there's an awful dread that haunts most of this film—a palpable evil presence—that Kubrick would be proud of. And Hitchcock, too, for that matter. The crime is utterly ghastly, unspeakably horrible, and all the more shocking for the early languorous pace. This is a Woody Allen few, if any, fans will recognize. For this one he has fully unleashed the dark demon that he only tentatively brandished in his earlier similar tale of spiritual nihilism, 1989's Crimes and Misdemeanors. The sin in that one was second hand, distant, and therefor rather abstract and theoretical. But in this deeply sinister picture, the transgression is total and absolute; the hands of the killer are now intimately near the heart and soul of the protagonist. Allen has built an even more confining cell for his monstrously guilty prisoner, but ironically, outrageously, horribly, he also has also entrusted him with the keys. It's so disturbing, this story. It's utterly bleak.The final paradox of this jet black film is that the one to which it owes it's greatest debt was in the end Kubrick's least disturbing, most gentle, most buoyant creation. In Barry Lyndon there's the occasional gentlemanly duel, the odd minor war injury, or the temporary pang of unrequited desire, but virtually no gore, menace, or mayhem. Woody's Match Point, however, is the most darkly chilling horror he has ever conjured. It's a shiver to the marrow that grows deeper and darker.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing movie,"Just saw it last night and it was an amazing experience.Woody Allen really knows how to entertain us, giving a fashionable story about love and sin, with some very interesting twists during the movie. Scarlett Johansson is amazing in this movie, all the characters are really convincing and the movie is very well filmed and you also will find a bit of British comedy including a mother-in-law acting just like a monster-in-law. The British accent is also very evident and convincing. For those who likes an interesting story this is a gem, I just can't wait to see their (Woody-Scarlett) new projects. Let's hope for ""Scoop"" to come out soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"woody, how could i doubt you??","like your favorite ex-boyfriend, you never truly get a good woody allen film off of your mind. however, in the first half hour of ""matchpoint,"" i had to keep reminding myself i was watching a woody film - having been so disappointed in the recent past. instead of the obvious, allen utilizes the benign British sublime to his altman-ish advantage, where you're not sure what's going on, but the fast forward button doesn't even enter your mind. then, after all the prejudice, you get swept away in the moment of a brilliant film and you realize... thank god he still makes films. it doesn't hurt that i'd download jonathan rhys meyers in a toothpaste commercial, but even scarlet found her groove in this one. this movie isn't the mark of a director, but of a movie maker.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An Engrossing, Brilliantly Played Work of Chamber Music","Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self-parody: the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural/society examinations with the best of them! MATCH POINT is a case in point. From the opening credits, to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives, to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side, to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges. Match Point is an intelligent, burnished, glowing little masterpiece of movie making, a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending.Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family, a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father (Brian Cox), a class conscious mother (Penelope Wilton), a handsome son Tom (Matthew Goode) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), and daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business. Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who, despite her physical attraction for Chris, knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom.Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury, marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately, and yet he lusts for Nola. In time Nola and Tom part (the reason to be outlined later in the film) and though hesitant to shake Chris' marriage to Chloe, Nola becomes physically involved with Chris. The inherent dangers of Chris' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film.For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film: the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal; the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings (know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced!) and from 'live' stage performances at Covent Garden (superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano!). But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance. The cast is impeccable, from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer. This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I don't care if he's great...I just hope that he's lucky.""","Allen's Hitchcock picture is a sexy, auteur soap opera with beautifully lush dialogue and a slow-burn of romantic suspense. Unfortunately, like all of Allen's work, it's nearly impossible to watch without psychoanalyzing Woody and his creepy obsession with ""forbidden love."" (Impossibly) Removed from that, it's a sordid good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another winner from grand Woody!!!,This film symbolises the typical Allen recipe: strongly psychological elements combined with wonderfully crafted dialogue and the usual Allen style scenery with old fashioned music on the background.Captivating from that start Allen has put his mastery into this film creating a wonderful conception a film that I enjoyed every moment of with a twisting plot that kept me right in my seat from start top finish.The great creator of films has just returned on top form giving this decade a film with substance.Keep them coming Woody.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absorbing drama,"A real return to form for Woody. An absorbing drama, great acting and beautiful cinematography. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers reminds me of a young Malcolm McDowell, he has a intriguing and intense face, and acting skills to match. One could say that its a variation on Martin Landaus plot line in Crimes and Misdemeanors. Match Point is one of those Allen-films were you are not missing the comedy, and it works very well as a drama/thriller. Some small dialog things might feel a bit out of date (Nola: ""I need a drink"", Chris: ""This way""). I sense that directing sex-scenes is not Allens forte, and they are mercifully brief but makes their point. Maybe the policemen near the end are a bit broad in this serious context, but those minor things aside, this is a compelling movie. My theory that directors past their sixties has their best work behind them, is subverted here. Hopefully we have more great films to expect from Woody.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
