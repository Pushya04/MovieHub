"Visually a feast to the eyes, but sometimes the story is unengaging.","I thought this a very well done film indeed. I will say the film looks just splendid, especially the scenes in Narnia, with beautiful snowy sets (some looked as though it had come from the LOTR trilogy). However, some of the scenes looked as though they had been computerised, such as the scene with the children and beavers running across the ice. There were also some attempts to put some humour into the story like the professor's line ""ah yes, the weeping one"" in reference to Lucy and the beavers especially, but because the director had taken liberties to make the story darker, the humour didn't quite work. However there are a number of positives, like the spirited performances of the children, Georgie Henley especially, better than Sophie Wilcox's rather goofy portrayal in the 1988 series. James McAvoy is charming as Mr. Tumnus, and Liam Neeson was majestic as Aslan. But the acting honours go to Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, even with her calmness she dominates the screen, in a sometimes chilling portrayal as the character. The film was fairly faithful to the book, but the added scenes and dialogue failed to engage as much. All, a flawed but enjoyable film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The perfect Christmas movie,"To sum things up: I loved this movie.I had been waiting for it ever since it was announced, so of course I couldn't pass up the chance to see a press preview this morning. And, while there were some definite weaknesses (mostly in the quality of the animations), overall I was completely convinced. Naturally it did not coincide 100% with my own vision of Narnia visually, but emotionally it rang absolutely true, choking me up several times and really touching me. I walked out of the theatre with a warm, contented feeling - just like I feel every time I read C.S. Lewis' book!The stand-out performance was definitely Tilda Swinton's as the White Witch, but I liked all actors/voices, from cute little Lucy (newcomer Georgie Henley) to majestic Aslan (Liam Neeson). I thought the children did a great job, considering their relative inexperience and the amount of blue screen work involved.Tip: Stay seated through the actor credits - afterwards there's another small scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Magical Journey Through Narnia...,"A wonderful movie. The characters are beautifully made from a well chosen characters. The CGI and special effects are top notch. The centaurs, beavers, trees, tigers, bears, fox, all are taking. Oh! yeah, they are talking. The creators have done an excellent job in bringing out the emotions, the lip sync, and the body language of various animal, very well. The White Witch was scary as hell. The final battle sequence was spectacular. I was amazed with the battle sequence.Aslan's character was the best. I love the way the Lion talks, walks and emotes. It's simply amazing.Amazing direction. Amazing music. Excellent make-up. Amazing editing work. A very good adoption of the Narnia series. Very funny movie too. Worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Amazing fantasy, breathtaking adventures and overwhelming battles","This enjoyable story produced by Walt Disney Pictures is based on C.S Lewis books. It begins during German air raids over London in WWII. The Pevensie four children(Henley,Keynes,Moseley and Poppewell) are sent to live at the country house of eccentric teacher Kike(Jim Broadvent). Meantime they're playing hide and seek, Lucy encounters a strange wardrobe that lead the snowy land of Narnia . There, she finds a sympathetic but coward faun(James McAvoy). Later she returns at home and the others don't believe her at first, but soon are convinced. Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world with fauns and centaurs and where animals speaking, a beaver( voice by Ray Winstone), fox(voice by Rupert Everett) and furthermore the Father Christmas(James Cosmo). This magic land with perpetual winter is ruled by the nasty White Witch(Tilda Swinton). But the children are the chosen ones, according an ancient prophecy, and they team up with Aslem, the mighty Lion and real king of Narnia , fighting to defeat the evil witch in an epic finale battle.The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures, exciting fantasy, sensational scenarios and good feeling. Plenty of action and emotion and with an incredible battle scenes similar to ¨Lord of the Rings¨. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out. In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary and highly detailed work by C. S. Lewis. This two and a half hour movie stays closer to the original work than any of the former efforts, mostly animated. The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Musical score fitting perfectly to the action-adventure by Harry Gregson-Williams. The motion picture is marvellously directed by Andrew Adamson, he's the director,producer, writer of ¨Shrek¨ trilogy. Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and all family.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
excellent filmization of CS Lewis's novel,"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an extremely enjoyable filmization of CS Lewis's magical childhood epic. The story expertly weaves in childhood themes with a modern day Christian plot line (including a slightly grisly 'crucifiction' scene) to create an enchanting motion picture. Tilda Swinton is superb as the sinister White Witch. The children are average though young Georgie Henly stands out. The Special effects are more than adequate, with a specially impressive rendering of Aslan. The film moves slowly initially and its epic nature become apparent only towards the end with a vicious (but bloodless) final battle. All told, a pleasant surprise indeed!Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Talking Beavers, Lions, Satyrs, and Precocious British Children, Oh My!","Adam Adamson's film adaptation of C. S. Lewis' first entry in his classic Narnia Series starts off awkwardly like a combination of the ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Lord of the Rings."" The filmmakers spend too much time early on trying to be cute and Disney-fy the product while clumsily presenting scenes composed of live-action actors and not-so-great computer effects. The result, not surprisingly is like an animated film with some flesh-and-blood actors spliced in. However, once you get used to the film stylistically, all is mostly forgiven.The filmmakers finally find solid ground when they really start to dig deeply into the story and reveal the blending of nature-based neo-paganism with medieval Christian mythology and wrap it up nicely into a children's fairytale. It's when you start to realize the white witch (played effectively by the always somewhat creepy Tilda Swinton) represents the old pre-Abraham polytheism demanding animal and human sacrifice for appeasing the pantheon of gods/goddesses and the lion king, Aslan, represents the Christian view of one self-sacrificing god that you remember the brilliance of Lewis' source material. And while it isn't terribly well executed, the epic ""Battle-Beast"" style showdown at the end is pretty entertaining from a visual and imaginative standpoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The perfect pick for the holiday season.,"Rewatching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe reminded me why it's such a timeless movie. It still gets me every time, especially the lullaby scene with Mr. Tumnus, played beautifully by James McAvoy, who is one of my favorite actors. Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan is inspiring and adds so much gravitas to the character. But for me, the standout is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Her performance is chilling and commanding, making her one of the most memorable parts of the movie.The production is top-notch. The visuals are stunning, especially considering it was released in 2005, and they mostly hold up well even now. The costumes and set design are fantastic, capturing the magical and otherworldly feel of Narnia. The soundtrack is another highlight, adding emotional depth to key moments and making the experience even more immersive.Based on the beloved novel by C. S. Lewis, the film does a good job of sticking to the important plot points while making the story accessible to a new generation. Of course, no adaptation is perfect, but this one stands on its own as a great piece of fantasy storytelling. It's not just a movie; it's a journey into a world full of magic, courage, and redemption.This movie also feels like the perfect pick for the holiday season. It has that warmth and wonder that makes it ideal to watch with family at Christmas. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe remains a classic, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone who wants to experience a bit of magic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Classic for all Time,"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe should go down in the history books right up there with the likes of Lord of the Rings. I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.Though the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero.I commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just ""based"" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.Ten stars!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Splendid!,"With an appeal to both adults and children, the British author C. S. Lewis wrote seven books in his Chronicles of Narnia series. The stories are rich in mythology and religious symbolism, drawing upon archetypes from the Norse, Greco-Roman, Persian, medieval chivalric, and Judeo-Christian traditions.Now comes this wonderful film of the first chronicle, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" The beautiful cinematography and the terrific performances of the children make this film outstanding for family viewing. As integrated with the live actors, the colorful animal characters, especially the Lion (Jesus), reveal brilliant technical film-making as well.Lewis's books are not overtly allegorical. Rather, the symbols and the messages are subtle. The four children in the story (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) were inspired by the actual children evacuated from London during World War II, who spent time in Lewis's home. Lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories. In this area, the film is enormously faithful to the original book and would have made the author extremely proud.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heartless Adaptation,"A strangely disappointing experience given the quality credentials of just about all involved.The relative inexperience of the writers is clearly evident. Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God (hell), or the Nazi regime, the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential, none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored, we are not told who she is, where she came from, how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive. Similarly, the children seem happy to throw themselves into a war without a second thought of home. Nothing in this story is ever explained, we are simply expected to accept it without question, which is a far more dictatorial representation of Christianity than Lewis ever intended. The plotting lacks energy and momentum, with no real sense of suspense. The characterization is weak and one-dimensional. But even more surprisingly from the creators of Shrek, is the complete lack of humor.The acting is sound from all but the leads. The two older children struggle to bring the necessary range of emotion to their roles, with Moseley in particular presenting a decidedly weak interpretation of heroic kingliness. The two younger children luckily make up for their on screen siblings' shortcomings, with Henley bringing the wide-eyed innocence to Lucy that the role requires, and Keynes displaying a surprising amount of subtlety as the eternally wronged and resentful Edmund. McAvoy and Swinton are both excellent and at times are required to carry the movie alone.The CGI is competent, but little more. It's always good to see Fauns and Centaurs running around, but it doesn't break any boundaries in terms of design or execution. There's none of the thrill of the vast armies of Middle Earth, or the attention to the minutiae of Narnia that is really necessary in realizing a new world from scratch.Disney clearly hopes that this will bring them the rewards that 'Lord of the Rings' brought New Line Cinema and 'Harry Potter' is bringing to Warner Brothers. But 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' lacks the emotional depth, epic range, creative inventiveness and dramatic urgency of the 'Rings' trilogy. Similarly, it has none of the humor, camaraderie, charisma or charm of 'Harry Potter'. Judging from the audience that I saw it with, it will be very popular, and a sequel is very probable, but unless Narnia finds some heart and soul, the complete cycle seems unlikely.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A very faithful adaptation of the book, but I wasn't overly impressed","I left ""Narnia"" feeling kind of cold. I loved the books as a child, and most specifically ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" which I read numerous times when I was young...but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements don't fit into place.I think it's one of those books that is better off left as a book. The themes and actions that take place in C.S. Lewis' Christian allegory do not translate well to the screen. I felt that something was off. The direction by Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"") is commendable, but the second half of the movie is very bright, the animation throughout is quite poor (except for Aslan), and the final battle comes across as utterly silly.Also, by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel, Adamson's film lacks cohesion. It all happens too fast. The characters are rather thin and I felt as if some scenes were handled poorly. For example, when Edmund first meets the White Witch -- if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe, then told by a queen you were going to be the king, don't you think it'd be hard to conceal your excitement? Instead, Edmund returns into the real world, and the only hint we get that he's thinking about Narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with Peter pointing out how Edmund is sulking about.The course of action in the film is poorly developed as well. One minute they're reluctant to fight, the next minute they're armored up. The problem is that with a two-hour film like this, it's hard to develop the characters. In a novel, it's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters. WATCHING them is much different - and it's hard to take their decision to join Narnia's battle against the White Witch very seriously at all.Also, maybe I was the only one who noticed that young Georgie Henley (who plays Lucy) was always smiling. Not just a happy smile, though. A wicked smile, like she's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge. It's kind of creepy. When she cries at the end, it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh.Am I being harsh? Probably a bit too much, yes. It's just that coming from a child-at-heart who loved this particular book years ago, I feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre. I felt disattached from the characters, I thought the animation was poor, some scenes were handled poorly, and the final battle was a joke.Overall, it's worth seeing if you like the book(s). I was personally disappointed by the film, but it seems - judging from its IMDb rating - most people weren't.Hopefully the sequel will be better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Very Satisfying Realization of C.S. Lewis' Creation,"What a fabulous movie! I just saw a screening of it (with a bunch of other actors and writers) and the whole place burst into applause at the end.Tilda Swinton is amazing as the White Witch. Her cold, evil gaze could freeze anyone.I loved the kids - especially the little Georgie Henley, who played Lucy. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan was suitably majestic and comforting and grand.It was beautifully filmed, and I felt Narnia was perfectly realized.Looking forward to the movies that will follow.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A worthy family film that's a bit slow out of the gate but enchants both young and old...,"One of the most anticipated films of the year is the adaption of the beloved book by C.S. Lewis ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". With a cinema filled of families and people of all ages (there were more adults than kids), I was very excited about enjoying a film that I had waited impatiently for weeks to see.Just to get the negatives out of the way, Narnia is a bit slow. The first 40 minutes crawl by at a snails pace and the lead up to the meeting of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy is dragged out too much. But when all four kids get through the wardrobe, the story really gets to picked up by likable characters (the beavers come to mind) and tense scenes with the White Witch.As for the positive notes, the scenery was top notch, with many people in the audience audibly playing ""Where in the country was this scene filmed?"" The animation and special effects are brilliant as well. Most notably, Aslan, the lion saviour, is wonderfully animated and incredibly realistic. At times, you could just as well be looking at a real lion. Other effects of centaurs, fauns, griffins, beavers, and bull-headed monsters are also top notch.On an entirely different note, I really don't understand what all the fuss is about with the religious allegory. The symbolism is there for all to see including all the elements of sacrifice, and forgiveness, but it's not ""in your face"" or distracts you from the rest of the story. If you enter the cinema seeking an allegory on Somebody's sacrifice, you'll be content with what you see. And if you plan seeing this film just as a family friendly holiday movie, you'll be content too.In all, Narnia deserves a worthy 7/10. It may be a bit slow out of the gate and outstay it's welcome length, but it's a worthy family film that enchants both young and old and transports you effectively into the land of Narnia.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Heavy in prophecy, light on intensity","It could be that Narnia has had to follow up two fantasy hits such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it could be that the book lacked in fire power, or it could be that the movie just wasn't done that well; but in any case Narnia fell short of expectations. Recently it seems to be en vogue to have children or teenagers playing the leads in fantasy movies (ala Frodo and Harry Potter), but what Narnia failed to do is make these children believable.There was no transition from these kids' innocence and ignorance into courageous warriors and saviors. In Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam were never sure of themselves and they constantly exhibited inexperience throughout their goal to save middle earth. Harry Potter was always in need of help and he was not even the best magician in his class. But in the prophecy rich Narnia in which four humans were foretold to save the land, it seems all of the prognostication forced itself upon the somewhat unwilling heroes. First the siblings are bumbling around Narnia trying to stay alive as anyone would do in a foreign land, and then seemingly overnight the older brother is leading a major battle, the other brother is an integral part of that battle, while the two girls develop fearlessness of the foreign woods they are in.The movie lacked intensity, there were never any white knuckle moments or hair raising events. The dialog was very generic and far from profound though one can infer that it was supposed to be, and the drama was mild even with the fate of an entire mythical land being in the hands of children. This was a kids movie dressed up as an adult one nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good film,"Good film. There are some problems with the film adaptation that are less noticeable in the book. First, the Narnia of the film is almost too beautiful, pristine and serene, without any note of harshness of the 100 year winter caused by the rule of the witch, or the sense that the landscape has been depopulated by war. The return of Azlan to fight the witch with his army is introduced without comment on where he--or they--have been all this time. Finally, and perhaps most seriously, the resurrection of Azlan, which Lewis intended as a parallel to Christ's resurrection, is the pivotal moment of the book, but is made unbelievable in the film. Maybe I'm splitting hairs here, by expecting anything to be ""believable"" in a world populated by talking beavers, foxes, badgers, not to mention centaurs and fauns, and where everyone has lived through a 100-year long winter yet still believes in the eminent return of their lion king, but I was disappointed by the way the death and resurrection scene was handled.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An Incredible story of love, forgiveness, bravery, and sacrifice.","The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was based off of an already popular and compelling story. Some people don't know that the Chronicles of Narnia is allegorical and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was based off the crucifixion. this only makes the story more realistic and fascinating as the Director (Andrew Adamson) takes C.S. Lewis's incredible world and adapts it to screen for all the world to see. the story focuses on four children who find their way into a magical world called Narnia where animals talk and thins like unicorns and nymphs and mermaids are real. it sounds simplistic but there is another twist to this world. eternal winter seems consume what was once a beautiful country. this winter is because of a witch (Tilda Swinton) who has Narnia under her rain. but when the Pevensies, Peter (William Mosely), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) come to this world, they discover the truth about a lion called Aslan (Liam Neeson) who is the real King of Narnia. one might expect a silly story about kids who talk to animals and fairies and learn lessons and stuff like that, but the story is so much more intricate and spectacular. more than just a 'good story'. it's a one of a kind adventure.

Narnia Fails To Uphold Responsibility To Book Fans,"Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task, but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently, Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, Adamson's ""Narnia"" wasn't quite up to snuff.I count myself among those who cherish ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" having read them as a child and having re-read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion, this film adaptation not only falls short, but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.Here are the general categories (including some specific examples) where I felt the film didn't deliver:Screen Adaptation - Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or cliché. Example: The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. (It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund - we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice!) Also, in the book, the mere mention of the name ""Aslan"" for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost, as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a ""fantasy"" movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch: in the book, the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. (They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.)A couple of outright inventions served only to distract us from the magic and mystery of the real story: The waterfall scene - who came up with that idea? The cricket ball through the window - not as effective as the original story.Casting - The elder siblings were mediocre, and I can't tell if Tilda Swinton was just awfully directed or totally miscast. (In the book Jadis was a noble and grand enchantress, albeit with dastardly aims; in the movie she was shallow, petty and despicable.) Oh, and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan the Lion was not nearly powerful enough--this is one of the most important roles in the film. Was James Earl Jones not available?Direction of Actors' Performances - This ties in with my comments about casting, above. Performances in individual scenes seemed disjointed from overall character motivations and some character interpretations (such as Jadis and Edmund) were shallow and unsympathetic. Where was the charisma that would have made Jadis's character believable, let alone have enabled her to amass an army of supporters?Hair/Make-up - Jadis sports blonde distractingly annoying dreadlocks despite her otherwise un-Irie nature. The professor's hair and beard looked about as realistic as a department store Santa, and the main Centaur's make-up also stood out as distractingly awful.Wardrobe - Jadis has one outfit in particular that looks like it came right off the runway of a bad 80's fashion show. Another includes an atrocious hat shaped like a giant icicle--Mr. Freeze from Batman & Robin would have had hearts in his eyes.Special Effects - Overall special effects were not nearly as cleanly integrated as WETA's work on LOTR, and cohesion was lacking. For example, the cuts between live action and CGI wolves were painful at best. Also, the teeming masses of bad-guys all looked as though they could have been extras in the Orc armies of LOTR. Mr. Tumnus was an example of the fact that Jadis's supporters were comprised of otherwise beneficent creatures that she'd charmed, threatened and bullied into joining her. Here they were unimaginatively portrayed as one-dimensional twisted, evil fiends.Cinematography - Boring; All the visual texture and lighting of a made-for-TV movie.Due to my disappointment in Adamson's interpretation of this work, and in the execution of the movie that resulted, I rate this film a 5 out of 10. It is not completely devoid of entertainment value but fails to uphold the responsibility that a filmmaker shoulders when adapting so well-known and well-loved a story.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive ""Professor Kirke"" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper ""Mrs. Macready"" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. ""Lucy"" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets ""Mr. Tumnus"" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of ""Narnia"" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the ""Pevensie"" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous ""White Witch"" (Tilda Swinton). They align with ""Aslan"" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great.

"A Nutshell Review: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","This is one of seven books by CS Lewis on the fantasy world of Narnia. My earliest recall of the story was an animated cartoon, where 4 children chanced upon a wardrobe which transported them to a medieval-fantasy ice world ruled by an evil witch.The introductory scene might confuse audiences that their watching Band of Brothers, though the German blitz over London is a sight to behold. Father Pevensie has gone off to fight in the war, and Mother Pevensie decided to pack the 4 Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, to the countryside to seek safe havens. They get to live with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent in an extremely underutilized role), and the youngest of them all, Lucy, discovers the Wardrobe in one of the mansion's rooms.The children bicker a lot, and through their Narnia adventures, learn about the importance of family and cooperation. Disbelieving Lucy at first, the rest got introduced to the wardrobe soon enough, and thus begin their stay in Narnia only after an hour into the movie (Yes, it takes that long before something decent happens on screen). Put under an icy curse, Narnia awaits the arrival of 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve to deliver it from the clutches of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swindon, perhaps the only human form in Narnia).But first, the children have to learn to make sense of the gifts bestowed upon them by Father Christmas, as well as to seek out Aslan, the mystical (speaking) lion, voiced by the regal Liam Neeson, in yet another mentor-like role after this years Kingdom of Heaven and Batman Begins. Yes, he's a good choice, but used too often it becomes deja-vu.The talking animals became the talk of the town amongst some critical circles, but I say, give it a break. There are talking lions, beavers, wolves, foxes, etc, whose lips move in sync with their impeccable English, that I'm sure will sell many merchandise, probably soft toys.While the cinematography is beautiful, somehow, familiarity with the source material brought about a monotone feel to the narrative. You'd know what will happen next, and the way this movie is delivered, there isn't much of a crescendo or scenes to excite. Shrek director Andrew Adamson should have known better, but opted for the safe and boring route.The acting by the animals surpassed their human counterparts. The four Pevensie children are excruciating painful to watch. Their acting's very contrived and forced, and I wonder if there could be other worthy contenders amongst those who auditioned. The pixel-creations of the animators gave the animals more range than the 4 kids. Tilda Swindon looked evil throughout, but that's about it. Somehow her androgynous role as Gabriel in Constantine was way better than her role here as the resident witch.The highlight is probably the much talked about, effects laden war scene, but from scenes in the trailer, there isn't much else to add. Already spoilt by mega war scenes from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Chronicles doesn't go one up against what audiences already experienced, safe to substitute Uruk-hais and various Orcs with animals and mythical creatures like the centaurs. Lacking intensity throughout the battle, I was taking stock of which animal was on whose side, like the polar bears and white tigers on the side of the White Witch, and the mass of centaurs on Aslan's.Don't get me started on the religiousness and the classification that this film is ""Passion of the Christ"" for kids. If you subscribe to that, you'll believe anything. I think one must have read too much into the major sacrificial and resurrection scene. There is hardly any blood spilt, nor is there any major bloody torture scene to rival Mel Gibson's picture. Just because this scene is similar to Christ's resurrection, or the theme of the coming of the messiah(s), or the betrayal scene makes one label this movie as such, is stretching it a bit too far. It's a children's movie/story, for crying out loud, so just leave it as such.Will this movie make money? Sure, on the fact that it's an event movie. Chronicles of Narnia built its hype, but didn't offer anything new in terms of special effects, and was weighted down by mediocre acting and a plain, bland narrative. Should there be another movie based on the books, let's hope it betters the first one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
10 out of 10 stars.,"The Chrinicles of Narnia, the lion the witch and the wardrobe, is now my favorite movie! this movie was FANTASTIC! the actors are amazing and the movie is just so exactly like the book. If you read the book and are going to see the movie, you will not be disappointed. The movie was better than i expected actually. It's such an amazing and imaginative movie it's just enchanting. I wouldn't normally give any movie 10 stars, but i gave this one 10 stars out of 10. When i was watching the movie, and seeing all the sets and the props, i felt like i had already seen them before. Like they had taken them right out of my imagination when i was reading the book. I know not everyone will have this feeling, but i did, and it was magical. Even if you don't want to see this movie, go because it really is a spectacular and magical movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
weak in believability,"I went to see this movie expecting something relatively decent, something on the scale of LOTR's epic as some people have been making the comparison to. However, it was disappointing besides the visual eye candy.Human characters particularly weak besides Swinton, I was rooting for the white witch the entire time. The kids themselves are irritating, lame, and whiny, besides maybe the smallest of the four. They're relatively one dimensional.There's several points in the story in which believability is thrown out the window, given that it is a ""children's fantasy,"" in which I'll allow some sort of leeway, but there HAS to be some sort of rational sequence of events that leads up to the acquiring a certain skill or a turn of events.Strategy and stupidity of the armies is enormous, I refuse to believe that a white witch who has ruled over the world for the past 100 years is that bad of a tactician.All in all, the CG animals, such as the talking beavers are the redeeming aspect the adaptation.Probably entertaining for someone not as critical or for little kids.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
beautiful,"The visuals for this film are absolutely stunning. Just breathtaking. The acting is done well, the voice-overs included. the CG animation on the creatures are marvelous.I read this series over and over as a child and just re-read them recently in anticipation of the movie. Although as a purist-at-heart I was slightly disappointed to see even a second of the precious work edited, overall I am amazed at how well they adapted the tale to fit into a neat little 2 hour time frame. I feel that nothing important was omitted and the parts that were adjusted in the script were done so well that it still could have passed for C.S. Lewis' own hand.I was lucky enough to preview this film (and to see it free, to boot), but I am certain that I will be trekking to the theatre to see it a few more times on the big screen. BRAVO!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't live up to the hype,"I've been hearing a lot about this movie for quite some time, mostly surrounding the fact that it's supposed to be the ""new"" Lord of the Rings, or replace Harry Potter and give something back to people who remember Narnia more favorably than Hogwarts from their childhood readings. I've actually never read any of the books except for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, so I was looking forward to seeing the film. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.The story itself was well-told, and it remained true to C.S. Lewis' writings. Unfortunately, the child-actors were a bit on the weak side and didn't really add to the drama and epic nature of the film. Also, the CGI work was very disappointing- I expected much more from such a high-budget movie. You could most definitely tell this movie was directed by the same guy who did Shrek, a lot of the animals and larger scenes of the encampment looked fake and cheap.Everyone seems to be up in arms over the religious overtones/undertones (however you like to perceive it). I myself being a Christian didn't go to the movie looking for it, I just wanted to enjoy a good movie. However, the allegories are pretty hard to miss for any educated adult who has knowledge of Christianity. And yes, some pastor's have used that too their advantage, and rightly so - that's their job. But in all honesty, if you were looking for a strong film to formulate a message from, I'd go with something that had a better quality to it.The movie is indeed a fun film, full of adventure and wonder. Not quite on the epic level of Lord of the Rings, so don't get your hopes up. For kids and teens, I think its an excellent movie that might inspire some kids to pick up the book when they get home. It's a good thing too, because I think the book captures the imagination much more than the movie did.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie,"With first-rate special effects and compelling storytelling, this adaptation stays faithful to its source material and will please moviegoers of all ages.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A disappointment,"I wanted to like this movie, but at almost all times I was aware that I was ""watching a movie"". It never really moved my soul. The acting was frankly very bad. The emotional depictions were worse. The screenplay wasn't great either. The scenery, the special effects, however - with the exception of most of the animals' talking - were good.I began to hope that the appearance of Aslan would save the film, but he was a disappointment as well. The majestic King seems like a big stuffed toy from FAO Swartz.The whole thing comes off as childish. I often thought that it would be OK to pass this movie off on a kid, but not an adult. Even the classic lines at the end, ""After all, Aslan is not a tame lion / But he is good"" simply had no power whatsoever.In the inevitable comparison to the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy, there simply is no contest. That's a shame, because the Lewis writings are truly superb and deserve far better treatment. Now that this version is done, it will serve as a firewall preventing a better interpretation from being done for a long time.As I said, I wanted to like the movie. Not only do I enjoy the richness of the original story, I love its Christian underpinnings as well. I remember years ago being genuinely moved by a simple animated version of this story, especially the scene of the death of Aslan, where there was a holy silence that descended not only on the land of Narnia but on my own heart as well; but this expensive production barely stirred me. It may well be that Disney is simply out of its depth with this kind of rendering, that its massive corporate group-think actually works against producing an artistic work of this kind when using real actors rather than pictures.That's sad, for what could have been but is not.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A complete special effects let down.,"While I definitely would have liked a more mature version of this film than it was, it was Disney and I can let that part go. What I can't let go is how terrible the special effects were done.#1 Blue/Green Screening This is 2005, there is NO reason for half assed blue screen effects. There were several scenes where the children were standing in front of a pictureeque mountain top view and it was so obvious it was a blue/green screen that it completely ruined any emotion they were trying to get across.#2 Proportions This is a film which has many characters with differing sizes: Giants, Minitaurs, Centaurs, Dwarfs, etc. It's clearly important that they look proper when they're in the same scene together and not like some cheap photoshop editing. Unfortunately the latter is what you get. There are loads of scenes where I have no idea what they were thinking. I mean, I understand digital animation isn't cheap, but if you're going to rely so heavily on it you should be prepared to do it well (Peter Jackson, LOTR well).#3 Limitations in digital animation One of the most difficult forms to emulate with digital animation is hair and/or fur. Short or curly is sigificantly easier to render than long (2+ inches), flowy hair. This is because each hair has to be independent of the others and animated in a similar fashion, but not exactly the same. Unfortunately there were several major characters in this film whom were created digitally and had long, flowy hair. The result is they looked poorly animated, digital characters.It's a shame that Disney, a company who once owned the animation market is no trailing so far behind. I had such high hopes for this film and the ones to follow. Unfortunately, I don't think they'll ever be realized.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"At last, a childhood classic translated perfectly onto the big screen.","I am, by nature, wary of any film that relies upon children to play the lead roles. I have avoided the Harry Potter films like the plague, working on the (frequently reinforced) principal that no film ever manages to get close to as good as my imagination. At long last I have had that theory disproved. I have just spent the last 2 hours sitting in the cinema with a massive smile in my face (with occasional grimaces as the idiot sitting next to me insisted on talking to his girlfriend. I think there should be some kind of panic button that gets the ushers running in with night-sticks to sort these muppets out).Having spent the last 2 months trying to get a job it was the most amazing experience to rewind the clock by 15 years and feel the rush of wonder and awe as the magical world of Narnia sprung to life on the big screen. The casting crew did a fantastic job, with practically every character looking and acting exactly as I had imagined them since I was a child. Once again New Zealand came up trumps, and the splendour of the scenery perfectly complimented the fantasy of the story.I've never felt compelled to write a commentary on this site before, but I was so relieved and enchanted by this film that I couldn't help but try to spread the word.Sit back, relax and let yourself be taken back to the magic and and excitement of your childhood.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
brighter than the book,"Although the movie's mood is much brighter than C.S. Lewis' book ""The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe"" - it's still not your average Disney-family adventure. For one thing the child actors actually look like people, not like surgically enhanced dolls (the actor of Peter actually really much resembles Englands Prince William...) - and they play pleasantly subtle. The decor of the world Narnia is not too fanciful and the lighting looks mostly natural. The CGI's are amazing: all the talking, running, flying animals - and especially the great lion Aslan - actually seem to have some weight at last. If it wasn't for the grand epic score that all too much resembles the ""Lord of the Rings""- Trilogy, this would be a likable enough. But the score is over-persuasive all through the film. It doesn't allow you a second to take a breath, think for yourself and makes you feel strained out after the first half hour or so. A contradiction in itself: how the images work so hard on creating a whole different universe. And the soundtrack/score at the same time works so hard on making it sound like any other blockbuster of the season ...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great visual adventure, but somewhat flat","I have read all of the Narnia books, and being a film student in college, I was eagerly anticipating this movie, and went to the opening show. After leaving the theater at 2:30 in the morning, I felt it difficult to describe how I felt about the film. As a visual epic, it is beautiful, and well done. The land of Narnia is beautifully brought to life, and the art direction, props, creatures, costumes, are all equally spectacular. It is a very broad and epic movie, with all sorts of different creatures and monsters for the audience to stare in fascination at. So visually, well done, I have very few complaints. But the story, the actual film as a whole felt lacking to me. As I said I have read the books, and I was impressed that very little was changed at all, in fact I had a hard time remembering anything. Nearly everything important was preserved from the book, with little to no alteration. Yet in the end, I didn't feel the story, it didn't emotionally move me. The acting was good, yet flat and predictable much of the time. In fact because so much of the story was preserved, I felt like it was just a copy of the books. And while that is good, especially to 'purists' of the book, film is a different medium from literature, and thus the style has to change somewhat in order to evoke what the books do. But I don't hate the film, I thought it was quite good, I loved the books, and I like this film as well. It just didn't have the depth and emotional truth of the books. See this movie, it is good, I will again, because I imagine many people will have a different reaction.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Empty tale of visual bravado,"Narnia isn't the next Lord of the Rings, nor the next Harry Potter, at least on the cinema screen. Even what spirit those fantasy spectacles had, Narnia lacks. And it seems the whole hundreds-plus audience, many of whom were children, agreed with me in their numb, passive state. No yelps of joy, excitement nor even the slightest scare. After the movie ended, both kids and adults were in such a rush to leave, silent and obviously underwhelmed, that some of them missed the tacked-in ending during the credits.Visually, the movie is a quality work, displaying technical prowess and craftsmanship. You will wonder how they managed to create all beasts from the real world to the mythology, from beavers, panthers and lions to fauns, centaurs and gryphons. There are also some large, captivating sights such as the view of the ice castle and the scene of the final battle. The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.What is not acceptable is the soullessness and joylessness of the rest of actual content of the film. Much of it weighs down upon the main roles the main roles. Georgie Henley's Lucy Pevensie gets a lot of screen time compared to her siblings, which is for the better thanks to her charisma. The rest of three, however, come off as stiff and unnatural, with perhaps more fault to the script and directing than the actors themselves. The children are portrayed as precocious on some occasions, yet unbelievably daft on others. Due to this, the three eldest siblings are thrown quite off balance during the film, and not in the credible way of children, but rather for the goal-oriented purposes of trying to build up suspense and plot where there is none.Maybe the producers have tried to make a child-centered movie by explaining the obvious, but it feels more like underestimating its young viewers. On the other hand, the deeper questions are left completely unattended, such as the nature of the Great Magic, and the importance of Humans. This leaves the story empty, and creates a soft of befuddlement over the whole movie: what was all the fighting about? Why were the good creatures good and the bad creatures not? Underneath its eye candy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is hollow, and without a soul, the exterior fails to impress alone.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lucy in the Sky,"Writing about big movies like this is a real pleasure because you can assume that the reader has already been exposed to the mainstream opinions and obvious controversies. So one can focus on other, perhaps more interesting issues.I was never a fan of Lewis' romantic Christianity and his allegorical crusade, not with the genius of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as the benchmark. Or the King Arthur stories. But I have to admit that while I found his written tale dull as Oxford dust, his storytelling ability had magic, and that was what made the thing fun for many. That business about the narrator being explicit and commenting on what is happening is lost in the two movies.Oh, I should say that you really should see the 88 BBC version first. It was both cheaper and more magical. It had much better kids except for the young girl. Neither production gave us an awareness of the powers of the Queen (except via wand), so that power had to be carried by intensity. Therefore, the screaming queen of 1988 fit better into the dynamics of the world.If you do see the 1988 version, it will remind you how artless this modern one is. I'd say about a quarter of the shots in this new one are almost perfect copies from the older. Look at really great productions; ""Aliens"" comes to mind, and you will note that there is not a single interesting design in this whole thing. Every shot, every character (mostly dumb rubber masks in queen associates) every character action is from the third bin down in familiarity. That is, except Tilda.Magic should be in the way the thing is portrayed. Nothing here seems magical at all, nothing like ""Time Bandits"" for instance, or a few of the better parts of ""Lord or the Rings."" The sets were dull, the magical places ordinary.I am an admirer of Tilda. I'll see anything she is in and expect to enjoy it. She did have a captivating sequence here in the final battle, but it was ruined in a way by the dreadfully staged ""stone table"" sequence before. Straight out of a 40s cannibal movie, with a set so cheesy and artless it made me squirm. No Baz Luhrman here.Here's the thing. Tilda knows a whole lot more about what works and what doesn't than the director. So she's created her own character in his vacuum, her own wardrobe and makeup. Some of that is great, but it doesn't fit anything, not the book, and not the lumpy director's vision, or what it seems to be.So what you end up with that's positive, is an appealing young girl, an amazing witch in the battle scene, and one extremely nice cinematic effect. It was so good it made everything else seem cinematically unimaginative. This was when Lucy pulled the sheet off the wardrobe to reveal the tree carving (Alice again!). The dramatic movement of that drape was wonderful, just wonderful. It was featured in the trailer. Then you got Lucy's gaze for the first time, one that is repeated tiresomely thereafter.That this wonderful bit of magic came and went before Narnia appears made me look in vain for more.(There's another scene that could have been great. While Lucy is being hypnotized, virtual satyrs dance in the fireplace, a sort of dream within the vision within the movie. Another director might have implied what Lewis does, that everything that follows could be Lucy's Dream.)Oh, there's one overt decision the director made. A sad one. He decided to play up the Nazi angle. So we have that incongruous bombing sequence where the Germans look like monsters. This gave Tilda her cue to have an Aryan look and movieland Nazi coldness.What follows is an intrusion of the American battle narrative on the original British one: war is depicted as inherently vile at the beginning up until Santa Claus becomes an arms merchant. Thereafter it is depicted as glorious, with the girls now involved as warriors. The shift is that Christians are battling evildoers, you see.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well-made and enjoyable....but.....,"Technically speaking, this was an excellent film. Up until very recently, doing a competent live-action version of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was really impossible because the special effects were technically impossible to do and still make them look real. Now, thanks to computers and incredible software, it is possible to get the look right of the book and Disney did a great job. And, having read the books, I was impressed that they got the story right. The problem for me, though, was that although everything seemed to fit just fine, the story itself didn't fully engage me. Perhaps I'm just getting old, but after this eye-candy was over, I just felt a great sense of ""is that all there is?"". The biggest problem related to this were that the LORD OF THE RING movies were so great, so grand and so wonderful that this left this film in the category of ""also ran"". You just can't help but compare the films and when this occurs, the depth and complexity of the Peter Jackson films is apparent.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A little let down,"Was this a good movie? - Yes. Was it well cast and acted? Yes. Was the scenery and animation convincing and even beautiful? I thought so. But as someone who first heard this tale as a bedtime story when I was 3 or 4 years old and having read the book now numerous times, I have to say I was disappointed. I know I can't expect perfection or a word to word exact translation from book to film but the movie seemed to alter the personality of the book just enough for me to feel let down. It was as if they took the body of the book striped it down to it's bare bones and then fitted it with a new body. So much of the charm of the book is in the humor and wit of its author which I didn't see or feel in the movie at all. The rhythm felt all off to me. I don't understand why they added some stuff that didn't enhance the story any (in my opinion) and didn't make it any shorter, and took out important dialogue that gave much more depth to the different characters. There were scenes I thought were done very well and if I had never read the book I'm sure I would think it a great and entertaining movie. But I have read the book, backwards and forwards, and to a hard core fan like me this movie did not cut it. I am sorry to be such a downer in the midst of all this praise, and I think those involved in the film should feel proud - it is a good movie - I just can't help but feel it could of been more. But maybe a movie maker has more to consider than keeping us hard core book fans happy and also need to think of those who have never read the book at all. And I will always have the book - just the way it is, and I can always use my imagination to go to the Narnia I have gone to as a child. I hope I never lose that magic and never grow to old and lose the power of my imagination - I don't believe C.S. Lewis ever did.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imagery succeeds; screenplay fails.,"Visually, it is stunning. Technology has finally allowed film to approach, if not equal, the images we form in our heads while reading fantasy novels. Unfortunately, what is gained by the spectacular imagery is lost by the screenplay. Though the film occasionally falls victim to the hyperbolic theatrics that Hollywood so loves, the most disappointing factor is the failure of the adaptation to integrate fluidly Lewis' theology. C.S. Lewis' greatest accomplishment in the book series is his adroit and nuanced amalgamation of theology into the story. In the film, it seems like a secular story with Christian theology awkwardly (and overtly) wedged in between plot points. Standing alone, the imagery is magnificent, and the story is engaging; compared to the book, the film adds nothing and takes quite a bit.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More importantly, it is a reminder to us that the simplest of good deeds can change our world for the better.On a technical note, the special effects in the movie could have been better, but when you consider that this is basically a children's story and children aren't as critical as adults, they are fine.

More regal than a Buick,"I kept my expectations low for ""Narnia"". I was expecting it to fail. To try to be too epic, too ""Lord of the Rings"", but ending up more like ""Dungeons and Dragons"".

I actually applauded at the end, even though I was alone. ""Narnia"" can take its place as perhaps second to ""Lord of the Rings"" in the fantasy adaptations trophy room.I hadn't heard of any of the children in this movie, but they were all good. Expect that main little girl to get more work in the future, she was excellent. Tilda Swinton was so-so as the villain, but she wasn't very scary. The wicked witch in ""Wizard of Oz"" is more gangster than her.There were a few distractions while watching the movie. For one, there are more talking animals than a Disney animated film (wait, this is a Disney movie)! And it bugged me that I couldn't figure out who voiced the Lion. I thought for sure it was Sam Neill, but instead it was that Cadillac among Buicks, Liam Neeson who provided the vocal chops.All in all, ""Narnia"" is a very regal movie: exciting, good lessons for children, and spectacular visual effects.

"Most Importantly, Do Not Disturb the Professor!","So says Mrs. Macready to the children, but thankfully they do not listen in the book, or in the movie, which is perhaps most notable for clinging so closely to the original. My kiddos and I have been enjoying the Narnia books over the past several months, and they are big fans of them; so they were naturally drawn to the movie too, which I hadn't seen before. Lucy steals the show in both media, and all of us thought she was the best acted; as the youngest, of course, she guides the others with her imagination, which is validated by ""the Professor"" before all four siblings take the plunge into the closet. Probably the most striking scene is not Aslan's death, but Lucy's initial encounter with the faun, Tumnus, in which not only the wonder between the two but also the tension and potential menace is given its space. In fact, the Christianizing elements which are often pointed out by Lewis's critics and supporters take a clear back seat in the movie, which instead chooses to go even further than the book in ""classicizing"" Narnia with figures from Greek mythology, from centaurs, griffons, and satyrs fighting for Peter to the minotaur general and cyclops fighting for the Ice Queen. Both my son and daughter pointed out that virtually the only added scenes were London being bombed, at the very beginning, and the parallel vision of griffons ""bombing"" the Queen's army with rocks before battle was engaged.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unforgettable adventure, or just meddling kids","The expectations were really high remembering how thrilling the originally made cartoon was. Scenes were spectacular. All those cute animals communicating in English and those joyful enthusiastic children trying to help everyone they either have, or haven't met. Yep, they really did it this time. Or have they....I couldn't stop myself from catching the fact that the film was dull. I mean, they really stayed faithful to the original, which can be as far as I'm concerned, only a good thing, but the result was vastly disappointing. Maybe it was just a bad mood, or too high expectations, but still:""Boooooooooooring""! However I must give credits to Tilda Swinton for her performance in acting the Snow witch. Her deeds were as cruel and as hysterical as I remember them from cartoon. As the snow laied throughout the Narnia was melting, so was she getting more and more repulsive. Her attractive blistering pale skin from beginning was steadily turning into a red burned dermal cancer.""And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling kids."" Don't we all remember that line from Scooby Dooby Doo. Why did those pesky children had to interfere. Who is to say that wood animals are better in views of good versus evil, than mountain goblins, minotaurs and other black marked animals. The way I see it, all they did was playing a role of a revolutionary, stepping on a side of anarchy. Fairy-tales can get disturbing sometimes. What I resent them the most is that if they wanted to film a movie for children, why did they have to make it so violent. I get the filling like they wanted to make an universal film, for anybody to watch. If they really wanted that, why filming a fairy-tale??",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointment on a blockbuster scale ...,"... after reading Narnia as a child and with a daughter who recently read all the books in quick succession, we were waiting for a marvel of imagination and magic, and (why not) a few good special effects.The film was a total disappointment for all the family, from start to finish.Dull acting - overlong shots of the children showing standard expressions 1, 2 or 3 (maybe just 1 & 2)A total lack of expression by Timnis, the Witch and the Centaur (even Shrek had conveyed more emotion)Dull special effects ... we're spoiled by LOTR of course, but we do expect the Witch's palace to look a little bit better than sheet plastic in soft focus.The battle scenes would have been impressive to people seeing the film at the time of C.S.Lewis's writing in 1950 but not today ... sorry guys!In fact we wondered where the $180 million budget had gone !

An Epic Almost on the Scale of LotR,"As a loyal Harry Potter fan, it pains me to say this film totally blows all four HP films off the map and it's even in league with the excellent 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It definitely deserves to rake it in at the box office and rank as Christmas number one. Based on second of the classic Narnia chronicles (the first in the series as CS Lewis intended), 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is centred around the four Pevensie children-- fifteen-year-old Peter, thirteen-year-old Susan, eleven-year-old Edmound and eight-year-old Lucy-- who are sent to the vast country estate following the London Blitz. There, the children discover a wardrobe which contains the path to the magical world of Narnia, dominated by the cruel and vile White Witch and her minions. As prophesised, it lies to the children to join forces with the majestic Aslan to lead Narnia to freedom.It's been many years since I read the book (far more than I like to think although I'm going to remedy that by re-reading it as soon as possible) but I felt that Ann Peacock did a wonderful job of adapting the novel to screen and fitting it into a measly two hours and twenty minutes. There obviously were some cuts made but everything that was important remained intact and the story stands well on the big screen, particularly the Stone Table scene and the battle.The characters were portrayed perfectly with Edmound being impudent without being totally hideous while Susan's bossiness is not too overbearing. Fans of Peter and Lucy will enjoy how they come across as the lead heroes of the film, both being depicted as brave and loyal in their own way. It is refreshing to see the characters depicted almost exactly as they are in the books, rather than being dumbed down or made out to be 'cool' just to appeal to children in the audience. Those who fear a repeat of the rather mediocre Harry Potter young cast spoiling the film need not worry as the four child actors were excellent from start to finish. Adorable wee Georgie Henley stole the show as Lucy despite her tender age (and this being her debut film) and Skandar Keynes managed to portray a careful balance with Peter, showing his traitorous side but also his bravery and kinder nature. I wouldn't be surprised if all four went onto do many other projects.However, it was Aslan's scenes that dominate even if he is a CGI character! I know many people were worried about this, unable to see past Jar-Jar Binks, but it worked well and you'd honestly think they had a real lion do the shots. And Liam Neeson's vocal work was brilliant in thundering across Aslan's strength and nobility. Tilda Swinton was just positively vile as the White Witch, exactly as she should be! She was able to carry off how wicked and callow the White Witch was in a way that will leave the audience close to horrified.Overall, this film should certainly go down as a classic in the years to come. Everything was done so well, from the acting to the CGI to the musical score to the cinematography, and I'm sure both children and adults will thoroughly enjoy themselves. For something produced by Disney, 'Narnia' delivers as awe-inspiring performance without pandering to toddlers or mutilating the book. If anything, I think the PG rating it was given in the UK might have been a tad complacent as young and sensitive children may find some scenes hard to stomach (I know I would have bawled my eyes out at the Stone Table scene had I watched it at six years old; I nearly did even now and I'm in my twenties!). I recommend this to anyone looking to see a decent Christmas film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid but not Inspired,"Despite some fine scenes and special effects here and there, ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" doesn't quite scale the heights of film fantasy to which it aspires. There's a kind of dramatic flatness to the story, at least as adapted here.Granted, the original isn't particularly complex emotionally even compared to Lord of the Rings. Director Andrew Adamson has only directed the animated ""Shrek"" films before this, so that could also be a reason for the one-dimensional quality of the drama.Also, the acting is very uneven. Among the children, the wonderful Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund are fine, but Anna Popplewell is a dull Susan, and William Moseley is a stiff Peter whose transformation into a soldier is impossible to take seriously on any level. Tilda Swinton has a imperious coldness as the White Witch - I liked her though you could say that she isn't quite terrifying enough. Another highlight is James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus - his scenes with Lucy are among the best in the film.The final battle scene - not explicitly described in the novel - is Lord of the Rings Lite, but it works well enough. One disappointment is the voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan. Obviously it was recorded separately, but Neeson's line readings aren't very engaging and the sound has a disembodied quality that exposes the artificiality of the special effects. Some of the other voice performers (Ray Winstone and Dawn French as the beavers, and Rupert Everett as the fox) fare better. This film gets its job done well enough, but classic fantasy film it isn't.It'll be interesting to see when/if the rest of the Narnia books get adapted. Unlike ""Lord of the Rings"" or the more recent ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the remaining Narnia books are extremely variable in quality (and increasingly preachy), the final volume being downright dull.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"Some of the costumes in this movie were unforgivable, they looked like they were taken directly from the Xena Warrior Princess set. Seriously. I don't understand how the director allowed it to happen. The CGI was excellent, but I felt like the director couldn't make up his mind on which direction to go with the overall feel of the film. The casting was off as well, the children started to really irritate me with all their whining and crying, but again, that should get thrown on the director and not the actors. And I don't understand why the centaurs needed so much makeup. It didn't look good and didn't make a lot of sense since centaurs are half human/half horse, and not human/horse/elf ears. The whole thing felt very disjointed to me. There were just a lot of simple things that could've made this movie the classic that it deserved to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beware of the critics - Their attacking a Classic,"When examined closely, most of the mud that is being thrown at this movie by the critics will be found to attack the established timeless classic work of C.S. Lewis itself with sales in the hundreds of millions of copies. So much for critics! The only real question left to us does not concern the story at all, but rather Adamson's rendition of the story. That being said, I can tell you that Adamson's inspired work with the characters of Lucy and Aslan, Walden's Special effects and Disney's resources have created a masterpiece of cinematic literature that I believe will prove to be as timeless as ""It's a wonderful life"" or ""The wizard of OZ"". It is tasteful and humane with no unnecessary blood and gore, and faithful in its rendition of Aslan, who does something wonderful not contained in any of Tolkien's trilogies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And even though I am 26 and in my own language, a boertjie, which means that we are tough and robust, I cried in the theater and at home when I went to read that scene again.The director and creative staff that took part in this movie should be congratulated for a job well done.Thank you for making a movie that I can show my kids one day.a Grateful boertjie",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Completely Surprised:  The best film I've seen so far this year!!,"Okay; to start off I grew up with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" as a child, and was fascinated by the books and the few made-for-TV adaptation of it. But as I grew up, I completely forgot about them, and how good they were.So I went and saw the movie tonight on a whim. I wasn't expecting anything great. The trailers made the film look like an over-bloated HP/LOTR knockoff. But what a surprise!!! This film brought back fond memories of my youth. It was nice to see that they didn't butcher the story and dumb the film down (although I think there were a few more action scenes in the film then there were in the book. Haven't read the book in a while, so I can't say for sure).But what a faithful retailing, and a GREAT film in general. Everything about the film was just fascinating and beautifully captured on film! I can't see how anyone could dislike this movie (unless there the Grinch). And in my opinion; Narnia puts LOTR and HP to shame (oops. Maybe I shouldn't of said that? Lots of hate-mail.)So yeah; there you have it: 10/10. Bravo to Andrew Adamson and his team.P.S. What's with all this ""Religious Propaganda"" sh*t I see everywhere on these boards? I didn't even know that the Chronicles had anything to do with Religion in anyway shape or form, I just always found the story fascinating and well told.

Narnia: Big Gay movie?,"Let me say up front. Narnia was a great movie. Full of cool special effects, great performances (I especially like Tilda Swinton in anything she does) and just the overall feeling one gets from the movie. But then, just dissecting it, and figuring out what it all means, was my next step. I mean, the biblical connections were obvious. But then I started thinking about the closet (well, the wardrobe) and then I wondered..Is Narnia one big gay film? The kids go into the closet, close it, and are instantly transformed where everything is magical (and excuse the expression fairy-like) where everything is wonderful, just as long as you keep everything closeted. Oh yes, there will be people like the ice queen (read neo-conservatives) that will try to put a stop to the magic, so we'll have to band together to fight the bigotry!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie for the entire Family,"When I first saw this I fell in love. I used to read the books as a kid and I was more then happy they made movie out of one of the books. It was nice to see the world of Narnia come to life. I loved the cast they chose to play Lucy, Edward, Susan and Peter, and epically the witch! The biggest down fall of the movie was the poor CGI, you tell something were very fake.

Beautiful,"I used to love this as a child.

Some of the CGI is bad, I wish they would have put more effort into the animals, but besides that it is beautiful. There is so much attention to detail and it looks real. The costumes really grounds you in the 40s and then the fact that they put so much effort into practical effects and that it's shot on location for the most part. I wish more movies was made this way today. I like how they portrayed WWII and the sibling dynamics. It felt very realistic and the child actors were great in this.

"Not perfect, but not half bad either","I somehow did not watch this movie for 15 years, despite having enjoyed these books as a child and as a parent. I'm not totally positive what held me back, but it may have been the sense that even with great CGI (check), some strong performances (check), and faithfulness to the book (check) this would be hard to get totally right. I was mostly right about that. That said, we watched right after re-reading this book with my youngest, and I can say that it mostly worked. It is not LOTR (or anywhere close), but that's not a fair standard - especially for a children's book. The middle sagged, and the embellishments were unnecessary...but it was worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I'm A Christian, and I Still Didn't Like It","So disappointing! I read this book as a child and I cherished every word of it. But the movie misses totally the magic that C.S. Lewis had in mind. There are a couple of nice touches at the beginning -- the eye opening shots of German bombers approaching the city, and the photograph of the father that Edmund tries to preserve. And a great song from the period, ""Oh! Johnny"" just as the magic is starting up.But the film makers just have no stomach for a real story arc for Edmund. They miss the central theme of sin and redemption. How can you have him saved if he can't be dark and nasty at the beginning? I can't believe how wimpy the film is, almost white washing Edmund, like he is in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's not his fault, and so forth. The Turkish Delight scene falls flat -- no sense of temptation, addiction, compulsion, just Edmund sort of flirting with a nice looking lady and walking off on his own power. And so many silly and pointless touches, like the dwarf jumping him with a knife, like a teen age delinquent in a James Dean movie! Now I want to say there are some nice performances -- Georgie Hensley is PERFECT as Lucy -- her reactions are always breath taking and magical. I wish I could see the movie she was ""reacting"" to -- you have to hand it to her for her innocence and freshness. And she and James McAvoy have totally natural chemistry -- the only thing the movie got right. And the young girl who plays Susan is perfectly cast, and going to be a real beauty in a couple of years. It's a shame the script makes her look like more of a whiner than Edmund! Whose bright idea was that? But all of that pales into insignificance compared to the bad battle scenes. My gosh, I have never seen a battle scene I didn't like -- till today. I can't believe how BORING this battle is. No sense of plans, or courage, or even coherent objectives. Animals we don't know running around in circles, fighting generic looking creepy crawlies, while the White Witch pouts and poses like a high fashion model! (You know it's bad when she's hotter than the battle raging all around her.) I thought Tilda Swinton made a lovely White Witch -- but she's badly lit in a lot of key scenes and seems pointlessly silly at times. (""Do you know what -- he betrayed you! For sweeties!"") All in all, this movie just wanders around, as if afraid to come down to brass tacks on who these children really are, and what they really suffer and what they learn.If there was a Christian agenda, it was bungled so badly that no one should be offended. And maybe that was just the point!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

a few flaws but a relaxing family film,"In their first major career roles, Georgie Henley (Lucy) Skandar Keynes (Edmund) William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) star in this C.S Lewis adaptation about their characters finding a magical world in the back of a wardrobe.Having never read the book but heard rave reviews, I was intrigued to see this film and wasn't to be disappointed.In a magical fairytale for the whole family, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe has something for everybody, the mystical adventure for the younger generations, and a few good characters and experienced ideologies for adults.A question mark hovers over the acting but with first performances it is understandable.Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) is excellent as the witch, her cold personality and the character epitomizes the true essence of evil, which is what the story follows.Good vs evil is often very obvious, which is the case here with the golden spirit of Aslan and the cold white heart of the witch, giving the film good balance.The writing and mystery behind Narnia is very good. The sheer imagination of a wardrobe containing a magical kingdom is a good enough reason to go and see the film and is well established by Andrew Adamson. Though not the best direction, it gets the required effect.I'm not a huge lover of CGI being a person for realism in context and etc. There is no question that the work that has gone into creating all the creatures and scenery is outstanding. But I'm personally not a fan of it, but if you do like it, then this is CGI at its peak.Apart from a few lapses in the story and pretty bad acting, it is an enjoyable fun film for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't trust fancy strangers that you might meet in the woods!!,"This is a family adventure film based on the book and probably not suitable for really younger children as there are some scary scenes. The film is about a little girl who stumbles upon a magical world in a wardrobe that is ruled by a witch which might be evil.I would say I enjoyed everything about this film, but especially the witch character (Tilda Swinton). She is the best because she appears good, but also has a darker side too. I also liked the way they created the animals with CGI.The film is rather long and younger children might find it too much.It is a good type of film because of the way it was made, but it is also rather slow in places. I liked the music, especially when the children go to Aslan's camp. On the whole, the film had a good musical texture and fitted the scenes well. The sound of the main battle scene was also well done.

A great movie!,"Let me admit that I was wary about this movie at first. The trailers (to me)looked really really dumb, and I was afraid that this movie would be a huge flop and nobody would ever read the books again. I love the books. I loved them when I was a child, and after reading them again, I loved them even more. I wouldn't be able to bear seeing Lewis's books turned into a bunch of cheesy films that only featured too-high-tech computer graphics and dumb child actors that screamed a lot.Lucky for me, this movie was just the opposite of a disaster. Andrew Adamson does a GREAT job with the graphics, I must say, as that's what he does do best. But he doesn't make it ALL special effects, he adds warmth and love to this movie, he adds depth and feeling. By the end of the movie, you're nearly crying because you don't want the film to end. The child actors that play the four pevensie children are fantastic, Adamson couldn't have picked a better group of kids. Leading them is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy. She's absolutely great, she lights up the screen, she has amazing talent as an actress, and she's so young! That's the best part, really. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, and he's so evil and bratty at first, it's rather scary. Later on, however, he changes very much, and you can't help but like him. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are great as the two older siblings; Popplewell is bookish and annoying enough, and yet Queenly and beautiful, so that she pulls out a perfect Susan, and Moseley is awesome as Peter. He makes you think, ""Heck, I want this guy to be MY older brother,"" and that's perfect, it's just what is needed.There's so much more that's majestic and wonderful about this movie, that I could go on for hours, but I'll only end by saying this; you miss out on something beautiful and heart-warming if you neglect seeing this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a 21st century morality play with Christian elements and references to the middle ages,"It is true that my relationship with the Narnia universe is rather haphazard since I have read half the book on which this movie is based, i have watched Prince Caspian and afterwards I saw this movie which was judged correctly as a suitable one for Christmas.This movie along with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have done the most to popularize elements of the mythology of Northern European peoples as well as public school British culture than anything else. One could argue that they are powerful tools of creating a certain image of the western middle ages in the popular mind.But of course these ideological aspects should not bar someone from enjoying the sheer artistry of the movie both on account of the acting as well as the special effects and costumes. It was a feast for the eye for those that enjoy watching wonderful and terrible creatures.Sometimes the Christian overtones of the book were said to be underplayed, at least this is what I had read in critiques in magazines.It was a choice of the company for commercial reasons. As far as I was concerned at least in the case of the resurrection they could never have been more obvious:the presentation of the altar and the fact that women learn the happy news first.The device of talking animals goes back to Aesop as well as Lafontaine for those with more westernized sensibilities and it was aptly used in this movie.The schoolchildren destined to fulfill a prophecy is the main convergence with Harry Potter, the magical pseudo-medieval universe with Lord of the Rings.Both boys and girls radiate charm and intelligence, as well as the trio of schoolchildren in Harry Potter movies and I confess that as a foreigner I developed a certain feeling of inferiority towards Anglo-Saxon schoolchildren. The Hobbits of Tolkien are I think rather more humble in demeanor therefore perhaps acquiring a vaster possible audience as role models.The evil witch is typically a fairy tale personage, even more so when she appears good to further her purposes.I recommend this movie especially for Christmas time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing,"I saw this movie with very high hopes and they were met. The acting was excellent and the special effects set a new standard for Hollywood.

I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven. Each book though, unlike the LOTR series, is a completely different story with many different characters. Overall, this movie is a must see and the next six will likely be the same. C.S. Lewis is an amazing story teller in the people behind this production are amazing film producers.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where is the magic?,"First up, I know the Narnia stories. I read them first in primary school, and I read them to my children when they were young. I have also read much of Lewis' other writings, as well as Tolkien's and know about their gentle rivalry. The upshot is that Peter Jackson did a better job with Lord of the Rings than Adamson has done with the first of the Narnia chronicle, and I think it's because Lewis' writings were simpler - naive even - whereas Tolkien created an entire world, languages included.But the lack of spark transcends Lewis' material. There is no magic. Everything seems to proceed in an almost nonchalant way. I went with my daughters, and we were all a little underwhelmed. It didn't excite us, it didn't get our pulses racing, and we shed not a tear at the scenes that were clearly intended to do so. Yes we know the stories well, but we knew the LoTR story even better, and it grabbed us.Finally, some of the scenes may not be appropriate for the intended younger audience.All in all, an OK adaptation, but as one daughter commented, the BBC adaptation was less technically sophisticated but ultimately better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And just what the heck is this Narnia place anyway, other than a magic land with talking animals? I read the books as a kid and liked them. I don't remember them being as stupid as this movie.

Impresses with CGI but not where it counts,"Sent away from the city to escape the bombing raids of the war, siblings Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find themselves in the large home of Professor Kirke. Although bored out of their tiny minds, the older children are not so bored that they escape Lucy flight of fancy about a magical world inside Kirke's wardrobe. They don't, that is, until they stumble into themselves. Initially enjoying the frozen world of talking creatures, things change when the family are betrayed from within and find themselves key players in a war between the forces of good and evil for the very world of Narnia.Ironically enough it was perhaps a certain amount of fatigue from the Lord of the Rings films that made me decide not to bother with this new film series, even though I had read all the books as a child. I watched it recently on television though and must admit that, in the overall sweep, it does work. Technically it is impressive of course, with the effects being realistic and convincing throughout (well  as convincing as Ray Winstone as a beaver can be at any rate). The battle sequences and the creation of Narnia is all equally as convincing but yet it was not the design and visual delivery where I had a problem at all.No. Where I felt the film lacked was in the areas of heart and characters. The material is fine and I personally was not put off by the obvious themes from Christianity  although I can understand why some others might. If anything I was surprised by how dark it was with many characters being ""killed"" across the whole running time of the film. Problem is that it is only really ""dark"" in these very specific actions  not even ""moments"" but just in exact acts. This lack of depth sees the film be superficially enjoyable but offer nothing more beyond. Perhaps it is the comparatively short running time that does it but generally the film seems to be constantly moving forward but without ever taking time to sink its roots. For me this mean that I spent a lot of the film watching a spectacle rather than being engaging by a great story.The script is the clear weakness as it does focus on events rather than characters. In this regard perhaps it is telling that director Adamson has his background in visual effects and animated features rather ""films"". The casting process has not produced much to work with either, although in fairness the children do not have much to work with even if they had the range (which personally I do not think they did). Keynes, Moseley, Henley and Popplewell are all very English children and in this regard they suit the narrative and the style, however they do not have the range or material to deliver more than ""English children"". It is a shame because the film does feature a very strong performance from Swinton as the White Witch; she is a real presence and the film is never better than when she is on the screen. Broadbent, is OK; McAvoy is OK; Cosmo is OK; Winstone is fun; French is OK; Everett is a random but enjoyable touch but the best piece of casting is Madsen as the main wolf, his voice being very distinctive and mean.Overall then this is a technically impressive film that has plenty for the eye if you are looking for a spectacle. However if, like me, you are looking for something with depth, character and heart then this sadly is not the film for you. Having said that, I was not that impressed by the first LoTR film so maybe this series will find its depth with time and I will probably give it a few more chances to impress me with more than CGI.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strong and loyal adaptation of the classic adventure novel,"Film adaptations of classic novels often prove controversial and divisive, but I think this is a good example of how a classic fantasy adventure novel can be succesfully turned into a film while retaining everything that made the original book so popular. Taking on a special book series that brings back positive childhood memories for many is always risky and I think this film deserves a lot a credit for largely capturing the magic of the novels.It's a very well-made film, with impressive CGI and special effects, beautiful visuals and scenery and a great cast, but perhaps the most impressive part of this film is how it remains loyal to the original story. The temptation would have been there to chop and change to make the plot more screen-friendly, but keeping it as close to the original story as possible was definitely a wise choice. As fantasy/adventure films go, this has to be one of my personal favourites.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not very good but it nevertheless doesn't stop the movie from pleasing.,"I watched this Narnia movie and even though it isn't a very good film and is kinda simple-minded overall, I enjoyed watching it nevertheless. I think that it is a movie that moviegoers of any age can enjoy, even if not in a 'very' sense. I was pleased with the film because I thought it was well paced, well filmed and that storytelling was crazy fun. Not only that but other pleasing things as well are the movie's humor, the comical touch to it, the innocent wonder and the main characters' play on words. The voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan is compelling and worth a WAOUW exclamation. The voice fits the lion character perfectly. Lucy and Edmund are also compelling children characters and extremely believable. I even liked the evil White Witch whom I thought was a fabulous villain - just by her looks and calm presence you can instantly feel uneasy and feel hatred too. Well done on that, really. Oh, and last but not least is the direct visual imagery switch which I found really good and groundbreaking. Now, I'm going to say something else which I think the movie should have improved upon: I think that the wonderfully CGI designed Aslan lacks an outside character feel, which means that he should have been made into a character from or for (do you say for or from for that sentence?) whom you can feel respect and/or fear in all of his scenes in a powerfully irresistible way.

The story was touching and powerful, the acting was exceptional, and the special effects were amazing! I was never been into fantasy movies until Lord of the Rings came out, which I thought was great. This movie was also very very good. From the beginning of the movie, I felt swept away into the story. I am rarely excited about new movies, but I was about this one, and it totally exceeded my expectations.I highly recommend this film. It is based on a kid's book, but it appeals to people from every background and age.I think we are witnessing the beginning of an awesome epic series! 10 Stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia is brought truly to life.,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005, Dir. Andrew Adamson)When the Pevensie family are evacuated out to the country, they are unaware of the adventure they will encounter. During a game of hide and seek, the youngest daughter, Lucy (Henley) discovers a wardrobe which transports her to the land of Narnia. Covered in snow, Narnia is full of weird and wonderful creatures, but is watched over by the evil White Witch, Jadis (Swinton). When all four Pevensie children end up through the wardrobe, they discover that it was meant to be, as two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam must join with the mighty lion, Aslan (Neeson) to defeat the evil White Witch.Disney Pictures, Walden Media and Andrew Adamson have worked together to finally bring the Chronicles of Narnia to the big screen in a way in which everyone can enjoy. Beautiful scenery, entertaining action, good CGI and terrific performances by the kids and Tilda Swinton bring Narnia truly to life.I shouldn't have encouraged her but you know what little children are like these days. They just don't know when to stop pretending.  Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"highly watchable, faithful rendition of the book","This is flawed, but deserves to be a blockbuster. It will appeal to both kids and adults alike, and especially anyone who has read the book.Stylistically this borrows heavily from LOTR. This gives the movie an epic quality, but also increases the running time, with lots of sweeping landscape shots and shots which drift over the characters from above.The script is good. It injected humor at the right times, and was quite faithful to the book. I liked the score, but felt that it was a little bit over the top at times. The cinematography was excellent, and looked gorgeous, except for the occasional scene where the actors where slightly out of focus.The movie was well cast, the actors all suited their roles quite well. The standard of acting was good, but not amazing. The CGI was mixed - Aslan was excellent, the wolves were good, the rest was very mediocre.The movie doesn't quite flow properly, especially in the second half. There are several instances where the jump between scenes gives the impression that an intermediate scene has been cut out.But the film is forgiven for any of these flaws - simply because it was a lot of fun to watch. Definitely a cut above most of the pap produced by Hollywood nowadays.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrible,"I was really looking forward to this film, considering I was a big fan of the book series as well as a huge fan of the original BBC production. So after seeing ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)"" I was more than a little disappointed.This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, especially on the part of the two eldest children. I usually love Tilda Swinton, yet I was severely disappointed with her lackluster performance as the White Witch. The pacing of this film is the worst part. The entire movie is extremely rushed in order to reach a major epic battle scene that in the book was a mere afterthought. Though there are a few elements of war and violence, that is not what the story is about. While some of the computer generated effects look okay, most of them are way overdone and instead of serving the story, they overpower it. I'm not a book purist or anything, so I don't mind if a story is changed in order to fit more appropriately on screen, but I do have an issue with filmmakers creating entire sequences that do not appear in the book solely to showcase their supposedly superior computer effects especially when these sequences do nothing to advance the plot.This movie is bad. Plain and simple, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Not good, not even for children.Check out the 1988 BBC production and its sequels instead. While they may lack something visually, the story is much richer and more worthwhile.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over-hyped,"I had been told by everyone I know to go see this movie, my friends, my teachers, my dentist, someone at the grocery store. All of them told me it was at parts deeply profound, very entertaining and a ""beautiful"" movie. Now, I will admit I was engrossed, I was entertained. I had no concept of the life outside the theater for those two hours. But this movie was definitely over-hyped. There was no element of the beauty that was promised and it was most definitely not profound, or moving, and it did not change my life in any way. Maybe if I had heard overwhelmingly positive reviews I would have expected less and liked it better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wonderful fantasy adventure, yet there are some flaws","I have never read the original artwork by C.S. Lewis, so my review can by no means assess how true the movie actually is to the original.The movie itself does have some weaknesses, fair enough. I am used to rating movies due to their logical coherence and substantial quality, and both is to be criticized here. Yet the actual transformation is only one aspect. I approve of the underlying themes and the messages that are conveyed, and this makes me award Narnia with a solid 7.The story is simply outstanding and inspirational by all means. This is of course due to the books and not something that can be credited to the movie's producers. The fantasy and the power of magic that pervades the story might make any child's eyes gleam in admiration and amazement. This needs to be appreciated and makes Narnia a nice Christmas movie.The characters are somewhat indifferent, save for little Lucy played by Georgie Henley. The two male actors in particular seem a bit overcharged with the movie's scope. They act decently in a way that would definitely suffice for a movie of lesser dimension, but they lack to vitalize their characters with the emotional depth and convincing authenticity that would be absolutely necessary for the audience to establish some sort of relationship to them as characters. This is probably due to a lack of sophistication in terms of the kids' acting skills. Maybe the casting department should have chosen more experienced actors instead of utter newcomers.Okay, having criticized this aspect I have to say some good things about the visual accomplishments. The movie is an eye-catcher in terms of wonderful visualizations. I think it is fair to say that the visual outfit does justice to Lewis' perception of Narnia. The creatures are wonderfully designed and seem so vivid as they could have possibly been.The real reproach of my review is the coherence of the storyline though. I do concede that it is a challenge to process something as huge as Lewis' Narnia, but the story lacked considerable logic sometimes and was sort of elusive. It seems to me that the producers wanted to jam as much input into the story as possible, which hampered the natural development of the plot. How can you expect the two boys being good at fighting with their swords in a huge battle? Why are the main characters rejuvenated when they re-enter the wardrobe? In addition some scenes were indeed very corny and too stereotyped for my taste - even young kids can expect a bit more. The deep emotions were not really convincingly conveyed, which brings me back to the unexperienced actors.The reason for giving Narnia a 7 is the magic of the whole movie. Talking animals, magnificent landscapes, funny dialogs, themes of redemption and courage - this is something to be appreciated, as it might inspire children and adults alike. The whole movie might have been a bit too childish, okay, but it is not that bad as a whole.Still, there would have been many ways to make Narnia better. It is a pity that both the cast and the producers were not really able to live up to the scope and the possibilities this unique story provides.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"OK, but that's all.","Narnia is a OK movie and it will entertain children from ages of about 10-15.However what must be remembered is CS Lewis was a good friend of Tolkien, the man whose books were recreated masterfully by Peter Jackson. One gets the nagging feeling that Lewis wanted a different interpretation than the syrupy tripe that Disney manages to offer.Firstly, the two eldest children are not even endearing for 2/3 of the movie and it makes the idea of empathy and being brought along this world with them all the more difficult. The character development is thin, with the idea of Peter suddenly becoming the hero that he is, isn't really explored.Secondly there is the idea of casting. Tilda Swinton doesn't seem all there as the White Witch and doesn't seem as menacing or masterful as Voldermort, nor as drunk with power as Saruman, and it is somewhat difficult to see how she got the power in the first place. However, the animals are good and Jim Broadbent though underused, is good as the Professor.Finally there is the Americanised tripe that Disney seemed to plow in just to please. This comes in the form of Santa Claus, who turns up to give the children presents ( in the form of weapons ). There are more scenes like this one and it truly takes away from what could have been a great film, but instead seems to trip over itself.This is no Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, and nor should it have been seen as such, but while these two movie franchises had intricate plots, great casts and memorable dialogue as well as Spectacular, but not OTT effects Narnia drowns the audience in syrup and it only half comes off as it at the expense of characters and plot. A shame , as this could have so much more...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great for kids and adults,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, as did my daughter. While she has not read the book, many kids there had. It was great watching a movie that had both been read and enjoyed by most of the children and parents alike. I overheard one kid telling their parents, I don't remember that part in the book, I think they added it for the movie. It was neat to hear both of the parents say, oh yes it was, I remember that. While the story line itself captured the attention of most of the children, I know that along with the story, the special effects captured that of the adults. They were excellent. At the end of the movie, the parents were saying, that was a cool movie. I will say that some of the younger children seemed to get a bit antsy during the movie, as it may have been a bit too much for them. But there were few. I personally, can't wait to buy it. Disney did the book great justice and then some. It is a must see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"In a word...it's all about ""nostalgia""","...For me, anyway, experiencing this movie on the big screen, was a matter of reliving a piece of childhood nostalgia...and, that was the only real driving force, behind my resolve to see it.To that extent, it did not disappoint.Visually, this is a beautiful movie, which had no trouble holding my attention, on those grounds alone.Story wise, is where I started recognizing, that not all beloved books are well suited, to be made into movies, which are strictly faithful to the original storyline.There are things about the C.O.N. novels, which make it hard for any movie to gloss over (or just ignore), without leaving you (or at least me) with the sense that there are substantial holes in the plot and story.There seems to be a trend amongst some, trying to spread this notion that you can either watch it from a religious standpoint and it works great, or you can watch it from a non-religious standpoint and it works just as great. Personally, I could not disagree with this notion more staunchly, if I wanted to. I strongly disagree.It's not that the religious tones are overbearing, or that they are not kept well enough out of the limelight...It's that, if you are not reading them into the story, then you are left with the sense that there should be more there...that the story should be better fleshed out, than it is....and, this is a good lead in to the flow of the movie...which was great, during the first half or so of the movie, but, then degenerates into this experience, where you are simply having ill explained scenes hurled in front of you.If you know the basic story from the book (I do), then it may not be such an issue to you...but, if you are walking into the theater thinking, ""I'm leaving any preconceptions at the door...I simply want to be treated to a good story"", then this simply does not work well.The pacing of this movie is badly uneven, and it suffers for this.The acting is passable. Nobody will win an Oscar, I'm sure, but, nobody was abysmal to watch, either. The two younger children, are quite cute, and delightful to watch.As to the general viewing experience, I found myself genuinely sucked in, and enjoying it...but, I was constantly enjoying it by, ""in the moment"", bits and pieces...not so much so, as a larger, connected story....In fact, it is the ""connected"" aspect, that is such an issue to me...This movie feels disjointed, from one scene to the next, in a fair amount of it. I feel like I connected with some of the scenes, remembering and anticipating what was about to happen, but once the scene ended, it was like being plucked out of one world, and plopped down into another world...to enjoy that scene for what it was, and plucked away again.It just did not work, as an over all story...Something is missing, and you can tell.The movie feels epic, in some regards, but fails to fully flesh out an epic tale.Children of all ages may quite enjoy this movie, regardless...It's a matter of taste, preference and forgivability.Personally, being someone who has experienced this story from both the religious and the atheist perspective, in both book and movie form, I find myself in the awkward position of knowing and understanding the religion influence, accepting that it is there, yet still wishing it were different, and seeing this is an ultimate downfall of the movie....and the awkward thing, is that I still enjoyed it, and would likely recommend it to others, who are fans of the books. The movie has good nostalgia value, in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you loved the book the movie will not disappoint.,"While no movie can strictly hold to every detail of a book for many reasons, many times in the adaption so much gets lost it leaves one who has read the book disappointed. This was not that movie. The essence, the heart, and spirit of this story is fully alive, beating and moving through out. The important points were there! As an adult I found it exciting to watch with times of tension and anticipation, and yet I can't wait to take my two young children. This is the best adaptation of ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" yet, and while that may not say much let me add C.S. Lewis would be proud. Applause to the makers for doing such an excellent job.If you have not read the book go see the movie anyway, you will enjoy it, then go read the book.

"Great for kids, but not for a serious film buff.","First of all, I was amazed at the number of reviews that praise this film as one of the greatest of the year, and even though I am highly outnumbered, and my opinions may not be popular, I feel they must be stated as a contrary to what everyone else is saying.This movie is not a literal interpretation of the beloved C.S. Lewis book, and while he was a devout Christian, C.S. Lewis denied that the similarities to the story of Jesus in the Chronicles were intentional. Douglas Gresham, artistic and creative director of the C.S. Lewis Co, and C.S. Lewis' stepson has said ""If you want to, you can find Christian symbolism in a McDonald's hamburger,"" (http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/1105narnia1105.html).This movie takes advantage of the subtle Christian symbolism the book offered, and has brought it to the forefront, often adding in its own twists, such as the visual of the ""Footprints in the Sand"" poem at the end of the film. There is no problem with this, and Walden Media can do as they wish, as they have the rights to the film adaption, but I felt this is something that is often ignored in peoples reviews of this film.Here are some quotes from other reviewers.""The acting was excellent and the special effects set a new standard for Hollywood"" The acting is decent, but in no way excellent. It appeared to me to have been over direction of the children on the part of the director. Perhaps, he is not comfortable working with children. They did a decent job mind you, but every action, and emotion they conveyed seemed forced. It just seemed obvious to me that they were being walked through each scene by the director. I was also disturbed by the lack of worry for their brother ""Edmund the Afterthought"" throughout the movie, but especially when they are told of his, and their potential fate.With the advancements in CGI over the past couple of years, this movie was a huge letdown. The glaringly obvious moments were during the standoff with the wolves. Watch as they jump down the hill. They seem to have forgotten to shade the characters all together. Azlan was the exception to this for obvious reasons, he was very well done. It also would have been nice if they added some cold air effects coming from the mouths of the children when they're in the snowy winter of Narnia. Due to the acting inconsistencies, I just never believed that it was actually cold outside.""The musical score is appropriately stirring and moody."" I am a fan of Harry Gregson-Williams, but felt the music was inappropriate, and out of place. If I listened to this on its own, I think I would really like it, but I felt it just didn't fit. The song at the beginning of the movie was WAY out of place, and almost laughable. You can always count on Disney to try and add a pop-culture touch to the film.Overall, this is a great movie for families and for kids. Children, who typically could care less about special effects flaws, and bad direction, will be in awe of this film. It is worthwhile to check out this movie, but it would probably be more enjoyable if you brought some kids along.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magically sublime; a watchable adaption of a magnificent book,"Although I've had little time to digest the movie in full, 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' - on my first viewing - left me standing outside the cinema realising that Christmas is, once again, here.One of the greatest mistakes to make when walking in to watch this film - despite the similarities between the books - is to compare this film with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien's trilogy dealt with much more complex emotions, and the characters endured many hardships. This is not to say, however, that The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is at fault because it does not include these characteristics. C.S Lewis' masterpiece was different on many underlying levels, and was ultimately much more of an 'all-ages' book than The Lord of the Rings.The film adaption reflects this very well, and the world Adamson has brought to the screen is rich, colourful and vibrant. The characters have been cast well - I found it difficult to imagine Aslan's voice outside my own head, but Liam Neeson was an inspired choice (if you squint, it almost looks a little like him) - especially Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes specifically create a very believable performance. I couldn't help feel however, that Tilda Swinton was cast very much as a cheaper version of Cate Blanchette. Her performance is watchable, but lacks the edge and conviction of some of the other main characters.Although an odd choice, Harry Gregson-Williams creates a fitting composition to compliment the movie well, but the use of the more electronic instruments may be difficult to digest if you were walking into the cinema with preconceptions of a more natural - forward of a better word - Howard Shore-esquire score.The film does appear to move at quite a pace, and some scenes between characters that barely knew each other and then suddenly seem to have developed an incredibly close relationship within the space of several scenes can leave you feeling that maybe a little more time should have been spent on character development.Ultimately, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a magical winter film; a beautifully crafted (partly thanks to the amazing work of WETA) world that lives and breathes, and reminds you that the 'all ages' genre is not synonymous with 'just for children'.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastical Delight!,"Well I have returned from a midnight showing and I think there is an actual contender to dethrone Mr Potter this weekend. It has been stated before that this is a family film because it appeals to all ages and I could not agree more. The movie has a certain charming magic that makes it more than bearable in the ""kiddy"" parts and when the action occurs, it is very entertaining. I know there are a lot of comparisons to Lord of the Rings, well I won't bother. They are two separate movies and are good in their own rights (Well...ok...LOTR was vastly better). Stil the soundtrack was nice and beautiful, the acting-all around (from the witch, to the children, to Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan) although the best performance goes to the Wardrobe (haha-indeed!). It's a fun movie, perfect to watch anytime of year, but definitely should succeed during this Christmas season.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
C.S. Lewis would be pleased,"From the moment I saw Lucy's eyes as she entered the room with the Wardrobe I knew I was in for a thrill. What can you say about a children's (and adult) classic that has been faithfully brought to the screen? I could almost feel the pine needles pricking my skin as they backed into the woods from the rear of the wardrobe. The snow falling on Lucy's hair and eyelashes (god help me, shades of the Sound Of Music) but it really was effective.The acting (both human and animal) was right and not over done. I was lucky to see a special preview with lots of children and with some adults who remember their childhood. All seemed pleased.A note of caution. There is some violence, mild and no gore, but small children in attendance did find it hard to watch some of the battles and especially were upset with the death of Aslan. But, they recovered well when he re-appeared.Loved the book as a child and love the movie as an adult. If you do not have a child, borrow one and go to the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
in awe...,"The scope and presentation of this movie alone make it spectacular. I (unfortunatly) haven't read the books in a couple of years, and even still, I knew what was going to happen - by far the best adaptation of a book i've seen in a long time. It was The Chronicles of Narnia, nothing more, nothing less. (This, unlike some fantasy adaptations of the recent past, was true to the books, didn't rely on special effects, interjections of humour, and actually had a 'comic' dwarf that was in character... impressive) Also a bonus is the fact that the director/screenwriter appear to be dedicated fans of the books themselves - the Witch's name (jadice), while appearing on the police notice, was never mentioned by Lewis until (I believe) The Magician's Nephew. As stated, the books are basically stand-alone stories with several reoccurring (albeit important) characters... hopefully the general public (those who aren't totally devoted to the books) won't lose interest.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad Acting and mistake,"A good film, but terrible acting - 'Lucy' kept grinning stupidly the entire film and even when she was was meant to be crying it was v. unrealistic.This film was intended to grab the Harry Potter audience - but has failed in part due to a terrible child cast.

This is pure genius,"I believe this movie is as perfect as an adaption of The Lion,The Witch , and The Wardrobe that could be. The casting was perfect and the effects are pure bliss. This is not Christian propaganda ,it just takes the idea of a messianic archetype who gives his life for those he loves. It isn't selling theology its selling love. Thats not a bad thing to teach kids is it?Just because a writer uses his beliefs to be basis the moral under fabric of a story doesn't make it propaganda. If your going to complain about CS Lewis complain about Tolkien who was Catholic and that inspired his writing too. If you want to attack true propaganda attack Left Behind . All it is is just a cheap scare tactic to convert people. Leave Chronicals of Narnia out of the Propaganda label. Watch this film it will inspire you and its just a damn a Good Fantasy film and it is better than Harry Potter.

Not as great as I hoped,"I was expecting a lot more from ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" because it is a great story and there has been a lot of hype about this picture. Unfortunately I felt after seeing it that there were parts of it that just didn't seem to be as quality as I hoped. For example, Mr Tumnus is not shown in full-body and close-up, it is always a legs shot or a face/upper torso shot, or shot from far away, so we can't really get a feel for how faun-like he really looks. Another example is where large backgrounds look a bit fake like a matte painting. I felt that the beavers were a bit over the top with comedy.On the plus side though the voice acting of Aslan was wonderful, and the children were adorable. The story is well told.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointed,"The Narnia books occupy a space in my soul, and I couldn't be more unhappy and disappointed by this production. While the Chronicles of Narnia were written to delight children, C.S. Lewis made it a point never to ""talk down"" to children, and this is exactly what is done in this film. The plots of the Narnia books are child-like, while the themes concern (as do great works of literature) what it means to be human. They are anything but childish. Unfortunately, in the hands of this director and Disney, TLTW&TW has been trivialized by the unforgivable overuse of saccharine background music and typical Disney over-sentimentality. All of the power and beauty of this book has been removed--I had the sense that Disney was in such a hurry to cash in on Narnia that the dedication, time, and love necessary to take on a task such as this (the kind that Peter Jackson drew upon in putting the Lord of the Rings on screen) is strikingly, painfully absent.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
wow,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion. It has all the things that makes a movie great, with great directing, camera shots, music, effects (Narnia has on of my favorite battle scenes ever), writing, & most of all acting. The actors did a great job. All of them! It worked so well & the children who played the Pevinses (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skander Keynes, & Georgie Henley) were amazing & made a name for themselves in this movie. Georgie Henley looks EXACTLY like I imagined her in the book. Everyone pulled off their characters amazingly.And this is a good family movie also, there are some points in the movie that might scare really young ones but for the most part it's alright.

Didn't like the bickering kids,"The Chronicles of Narnia is based on the novels by author C.S. Lewis. The four Pevensie siblings are evacuated from London escaping the blitz. They discover a magical wardrobe which is a gateway to Narnia.It's been a long time since I read the books. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. The big complaint I have is the annoying, dumb, bickering, whiny, and unlikeable kids especially Edmund. It makes it hard to root for them. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) looks like he's always on the verge of an evil plan. Lucy (Georgie Henley) is a yappy little thing. And the two older ones (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell) can't stop bickering.Tilda Swinton overplays the evil White Witch early on. She is so evil that it becomes unreasonable that Edmund couldn't see. It is idiotic. She would be better off playing nicer at the start. The good part is the world of Narnia. It does the job. It has the feel of a slightly magical otherly world that is still reminiscent of the real world. The CGI looks good. With all the different creatures, they look realistic enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I was a bit disappointed actually,"Don't know what I was expecting exactly - I think perhaps I would have liked it more if I had read the book as a child as there would be an emotional connection to the story. As it is, I feel the story wasn't strong enough to sustain a full-length feature film. Maybe it is the Lord of the Rings effect...I thought the children were very pretty, but not very likable - haven't read the book so don't know if they are like that on the page? The eldest children constantly wanting to dash and leave the poor talking critters to face their fate, Edward being horrible... Little Georgia is, of course, all cute and nice. But a whole lot of pointless pouting was taking place, I say.On the positive side, my son loved it - it sure is a good film for the kiddies.

A worthy adaptation!,"Not before time this classic story has finally been brought to the big screen. In this time of sequels, adaptations, and a real lack of original ideas it seemed only right that CS Lewis's first Narnian tale should be given the big budget treatment. Under the direction of Andrew Adamson making his live action debut following two successful gigs as director of the Shrek films, this film has the requisite looks and Adamson proves worthy of a film this big, albeit lacking some of the extra flair and conviction injected into the last two Potters and particularly the LOTR trilogy.Everyone knows the story of the Pevensie kids finding a magical world inside a wardrobe, and becoming the saviours of a whole world. It's a classic tale and taps into the inventive imaginations of young children. It certainly strikes a chord with younger children perhaps more so than Tolkien's middle earth books. Wardrobe is certainly a well made spectacle but at it's 140 minutes length something between book and films doesn't quite gel. In truth the books are extremely simplistic having been aimed at under 10's primarily. This means that in order to transfer the book to screen the filmmakers have had to extend parts, add in depth. Unfortunately there isn't much depth added and as such the character development of the children, and other side characters is thin, or anorexic for want of a better word. At times the film heavily milks LOTR. In fact milking it so hard at times that some cheese actually comes out. We have the kid's given special weapon's etc as they become moved to the idea of helping Narnia. However the battle scenes seems fragmented and tacked on and the kid's barely uses their special gifts before the battle ends sharply. Really this is nothing to have the epic 30 minute battles of the Two Towers and Return Of The King running to the hills.The film though is still an enjoyable fantasy romp and feels very short despite the epic running time. It seemed to breeze by, because there wasn't much depth to it. The Pevensie kid's are good. Georgie Henley is engaging as Lucy, perhaps the most important role, while Skander Keynes is not as strong in his role as Edmund and at times grates, but being so young he can be cut slack. Willaim Mosely does well as Peter, while the beautiful Anna Pepperell (Whose surname could almost be that of a Narnia inhabitant!) is very good as Susan. What works is that all the actors are perhaps two years older than their characters in the book, and as such there is an added maturity to the performances while they still all look right for the part, something similar in the Potter films as those actors continue to grow in their roles. As for the White Witch, she is played with menace and gusto by Tilda Swinton, strangely sexy as the epitome of all evil.Harry Gregson Williams was like the director a surprise choice to do the score. However he adds something interesting to it and isn't merely content to do a generic fantasy epic score. The music really adds something to the film. Of course the effects, aside from a few sub par moments, are all excellent particularly the creation of Aslan the lion, voiced majestically by Liam Neeson.Overall this is a worthy adaptation of a much beloved book that may fall short of the standards of Peter Jackson's LOTR films and the last two excellent Potter films, but as far as fantasy films go it's a worthy watch and truthfully does as much as could be done with such simple material. While Adamson may not have been the ideal director to explore the world visually he certainly does a good job. ***½",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A truly beautiful film,"When Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings into an epic trilogy, I knew that someday soon my favorite story as a child would come to life. This film is everything I could have hoped for. The special effects were amazing. When the various creatures spoke, it didn't seem like a puppet was speaking, it seemed like the animal was actually speaking. And I don't think anyone has ever managed to make CG fur look this realistic. I am also very impressed with the centaurs. They blended a real person on what was probably CG horse. These centaurs were about 100 times better than the last centaur I saw, which was in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This is also a wonderful film about forgiveness and how families will always stand by one another, even in the darkest of times. This aspect of the film is well acted by all four children in the leading roles. No film is perfect, however. There is at least one shot where the children are very obviously against a backdrop, though I do think there is at least one shot like this in every effects laden film. And while the centaurs are quite impressive, what I think are supposed to be Minotaurs are not impressive at all, they just look like guys in big fury suits, which is probably what they are. There has also been a lot of controversy about how this is some sort of Christian propaganda story, which it's not. It's a fantasy just like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars. I'm really surprised more controversy hasn't been raised over the fact that you basically have children leading others into battle. This idea is kind of a risky notion in today's political climate. This idea will probably go over most children's' heads, but it is definitely something to think about as an adult. I saw this film in an auditorium full of children, parents, grandparents, and teenagers and the end was met with thunderous applause. This is a truly beautiful film that appeals to the young and the old in all of us.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Narnia - impressive, but a little flat.","Overall, I was really impressed with the first installment of the Narnia franchise. The CG and ""groundbreaking photorealism"" were truly stunning and a marvel that I enjoyed throughout the movie. However, I felt that the major themes of the book were not developed enough and consequently had little impact or emotional pay-off at the climax of the film. Obviously this is tailored for a much younger audience than myself, who I think will go nuts over the film, but for me I felt that there was nothing in Narnia that I hadn't already experienced from the trailer. My advice is take a kid along with you so that you can somewhat enjoy the film from their perspective too. Before I end this I will just say that I wanted to see more of Aslan going absolutely nuts and tearing the crap out of some of the weedy White Witch's minions. That would have earned the film an 8 on it's own. Andrew Adamson has already said though, ""The story of Narnia doesn't call for brutality."" That is the comment that I think even he doesn't quite agree with. I think overall the film is a little 'luke warm'. It is kind of brutal, just kind of soft-brutal. It is sort of scary, but not really. It is somewhat epic, but falls a little flat... which will make it a family box-office smash. The franchise is here to stay.-Rich p.s. Georgie Henley (Lucy Pevensie) is a remarkable actress. She really delivers her character well and makes this film one worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good. Well cast,"I very much enjoyed this movie. It helped that my 22 year old daughter saw it first. She's an avid C.S. Lewis fan and expressed disappointment that the magic of his writing wasn't captured by the film. So I was prepared to be disappointed, which for me is a good thing. I hate having movies over-hyped...it seems they never live up to it. I agree with my daughter by the way. It would be very difficult to capture Lewis' magic from any of his books. It would have to be done in the dialogue if anywhere. But, like Lord of the Rings, I was able to put my memory of the book aside and enjoy the movie for what it was. I would have liked to have seen the majesty and omniscience of Aslan better displayed. He almost seemed to be too much a creature and not who he really represented. I would also have liked to see more development of the relationships between the kids and Aslan as happened in the book. But all in all, very good. I'd give it an 8.8",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Rendition for Children and Adults Alike,"Ever since the departure of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy there has been a huge gap left in fantasy cinema since then. Now Disney is obviously trying to fill in the gap with a big screen rendition of CS Lewis' (Tolkien's college friend and fellow fantasy enthusiast) seven-part fantasy saga The Chronicles of Narnia. Though, in my mind, that LotR gap can never be filled, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe does a damn good job at keeping our love of epic fantasy going.Staying true to the book (with some extra added scenes to explain a little more depth of the story) and using a lot of the books dialogue this is an enjoyable treat for all the family. Though some of the performances are a little wooden, from the actors such as Liam Neeson for example and the kids especially. Even Tilda Swinton, who looked fantastic as Jadis, the White Witch, could have put a bit more malice and venomousness to the role. But this is the films only fault. The final battle is excellent (some bloody deaths could have been added, but that's just me) and the effects are satisfactory (I would have like to have seen some real animals used every now and then).The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great teat for the whole family leaving a sweet taste for the next installment, the Horse and His Boy. Just look out for some familiar props from Lord of the Rings like the circular sharpening stone, or, if you look carefully, the sword Narsil itself in the hands of a petrified Centaur.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Weak,"I saw this on the recent DVD release and found it very weak. I've seen others here rave about the performance of the youngest girl. It seemed to me no matter the situation, all she did was present this forced smile which left her face empty of any emotion. The other end of her two color spectrum was the the crying, which seemed more like they just sprayed her face down with water and told her to make a pinched face, again devoid of any emotion. Actually, the performances of all the children were all weak and annoying. They did a horrible job in casting these children. I haven't seen child acting this empty since Star Wars Episode One.The pacing of the movie was horrible. There was too much time spent on small pointless scenes. It then moved on to seemingly large leaps in story line. I guess there was an assumption that all viewing this movie had read the book. But, I feel this created that atmosphere others have complained about. This movie is both too slow and too fast.I was never able to identify with any character in this movie due to the weakness of any development in both character and story. So, I just didn't care.The only thing interesting in this movie was Tilda Switon's hair.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Faithful to the Spirit of the Book,"I was very pleased that Disney didn't fool around with the basic themes of the book. I had not read the Chronicles in a few years and that helped me not to keep thinking ""where is this part or that part of the book."" It was fresh and very real for me.I hope that Tilda Swinton doesn't suffer the same fate the Margaret Hamilton was rumored to have dealt with. It is said that Ms. Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West left such a mark upon young viewers that when they saw her in real life they would get quite frightened. Tilda brought that depth of believability to this role.The reason I give this magnificent film an 8: I am deducting 2 points for the over-wrought final battle sequence - too long and too involved - it didn't match the pace and balance of the rest of the movie.That said I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone about 8 years old and up.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great overall but acting was a letdown,"This film is pretty good and kids will absolutely love it. Especially if they have read the Narnia books as I did ten years ago. Andrew Adamson did extremely well for his debut feature, but he did make a huge, huge mistake in casting chidren with no acting experience. The role of Lucy Pevinsey is really important to the film, so why would Adamson and co. not cast one of the thousands of child actors around who've been in front of cameras since they were in diapers? Georgie Henley is a cute kid, sure, but any kid can be a cute. The same can be said for William Moseley, he was a little too limp to really carry off a role like Peter. Tilda Swinton is absolutely perfect though. I'd have had nightmares about her if I'd seen this as a kid and thats the biggest compliment I can think of. There is some really good CGI going on here as well. Despite a whiff of unfulfilled potential, the first in the chronicles is definitely worth a trip to the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Narnia is sugar-coated ""White-man's Burden""","...First of all, Narnia is a world of animals. Being devoid of humans, it can be understood as the idealized realm of the natural, despite being nothing but fantasy. What is interesting, is that the natural is not conceived as mere existence, but rather presupposes a certain moral value-system. CS Lewis thus is able to take his morality and paint it onto the idea of nature. He therefore justifies his beliefs by embedding them into the firmament of existence in a fictionalized world. The animals of Narnia are therefore divided into good and badand this world is wrought by a moral battle between the good lion and the evil witch.The entry of the four children is something like the ""white man's burden"". The four are somehow fated by the scripture of some manifest destiny in the prophecy to overthrow the evil witch and save the natural kingdom. What is even more perverse is the superimposition of British schemes of royalty and nobility onto the scene, echoing the arguments of ""divine right"" of old...For more: themeasure.blogspot.com, Where I wrote this critique entitled Latent Ideology in Entertainment",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not bad, but not great.","I was a big fan of the Narnia book series when I was a kid and it was not without some skepticism that I went into the theater to see this, the first big-screen incarnation, of the series. That said, I rather enjoyed this adaptation by director Andrew Adamson - who interestingly enough is a native New Zealander like Peter Jackson of ""Lord of The Rings Fame"" and considerable fortune;) Is there is something in the picturesque rolling landscapes of New Zealand that just imbues filmmakers with the passion and drive to see such large scale endeavors realized? Who can say. In any event, Adamson's previous co-directing credits for the wildly popular ""Shrek"" & ""Shrek 2"" and a strong background in visual effects were surely helped in landing him this gig on what has become (if I'm not mistaken, the most successful blockbuster of 2005). Young Georgie Henley sometimes stealing the show with her portrayal of little ""Lucy Pevensie"" and Skandar Keynes as her brother ""Edmund"" is also quite well cast and fills this the most dynamic role of the film quite convincingly. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are adequately cast as ""Lucy"" and ""Peter"" respectively but are out-shined (and perhaps rightly so) by the performances of their afore-mentioned younger colleagues. Tilda Swinton as ""The White Witch"" is flawless: cold and menacing as I remember from the book. Indeed her introductory scene as she seduces young Edmund is quite a memorable moment in the film. Look for a good voice performance by Liam Neeson as the omnipresent ""Aslam"" as well.The setting in the film are about as epic and sumptuous as you'd expect, shot in locations ranging from New Zealand to Poland, and the visual effects, while not flawless are generally satisfactory and the scale of the battle is certainly well realized. Of particular noteworthiness are some of the great creature designs by make-up artist Greg Nicotero (it's nice to see that Adamson had the good sense not go with CGI for everything).On the flip side, though, the pacing for the flick lags a bit and in the end, though I enjoyed the film, it's tough for me to say whether it really captured Lewis' world and characters quite as I remembered it, but then it's been ages since I've read any of those books;) So get out there and give Disney more money why don't you? It's certainly a film that benefits from being seen on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Experience,"I read all 7 books when I was younger and was so excited when I saw the previews for this one on t.v. My 5 yr old son saw it too and wanted to see the movie so on Christmas Day I took him. This movie was SO GOOD my 5 yr old sat through the whole 2 and a half hrs!!!! To me if a movie can make a 5 yr old sit still that long it is better then expected!!! I loved this movie and now my son wants me to buy the series and read them all to him lol. He also wants to go see it again. It is a great move for children, maybe not all that young but in general. I highly recommend this movie i enjoyed it a great deal.

Some journeys take us far from home. Some adventures lead us to our destiny.,"Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis, four London children are sent to a professor's country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch. To defeat the witch, they must join forces with Aslan, the lion God of Narnia.I was slightly disappointed in what I saw of this film. It's good, yes, but it's not really all that fantastic, compared to the first films of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter."" I think Lewis deserves better. However, it's good enough to start off a franchise (hopefully). In this first film of probably many, we're introduced to four children, all uniquely different in a good way. It feels like you would want to spend a whole movie with, which is the first thing one must do before making the movie.The CGI effects were brilliant, along with the set designs, costumes, and action sequences. But no, this is not a rip-off of ""Lord of the Rings"" in any way, although it does in the trailer. Instead, the two films are completely different, both just seeming to have epic battle sequences, one which seems to have animals fighting. The magic is decent, I guess, although I hope they can expand a little more in the future.I found the film quite good because of the allegory behind it. The film obviously touches on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, which is probably why this film was so successful during the winter season. Apart from that, I found the film quite long. The first act drags a bit and I thought they could've sped up the pace a lot better.The performance by Anna Popplewell, the youngest of the bunch, is quite...annoying. She seems like a rip-off of the character Hermione in the ""Harry Potter"" series. Apart from that, everyone else was fine. The best character in here is Tilda Swinton because her character is vicuous. I mean really vicious. I think she ranks up as one of the best villains in movies.I think the film is a decent start to the franchise. I hope the films would get better along the way, much like the ""Harry Potter"" films, as well as more magic that made people fall in love with ""The Wizard of Oz."" The look of the film is beautiful yes. It's a stunning achievement. Overall, it's a good film for the family, although it's a bit violent for a PG rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia - The Finest Film Experience in a Very Long Time,"I often read postings from movie-goers who rail on and on about ""the best movie ever."" Far more often than not, they are films of little depth, thin stories, and little artistic value.Tonight, my wife and I saw ""Narnia"" and were absolutely bowled over. This is a story - a portrayal - a delivery - that is simply overwhelming. A film of over 2 hours in length seemed to fly by. The actors - unknown to us - were delightful. Of particular note is the young person playing ""Lucy."" She is captivating - in face and charm. She carried her role very nicely, and worked well with her peers.Special effects were wonderful in animal and human form - as well as the semi-humans. And, let us not forget The Beavers - tried very hard to steal the show, and almost succeeded.There was a primary hero, but several more supporting heroes. And, much to our delight, there was a villain that we REALLY wanted to ""boo."" I don't believe we overstate our position when we cast our vote for Film of the Year for ""Narnia.""

Wow. What a shame. Who has seen the original here?,"The reason I haven't seen this remake earlier is because I heard how bad it was. Now I know why. The first thing that got to me was the acting of all of the children. Unbelievably...bad! Come on guys this is Narnia, what I grew up with, I want to feel your emotions! But I got none.The second is how all this CGI looks nice but in the end actually makes the original 1988 Narnia so much better. Firstly the acting was actually good, and secondly, there is something about seeing a physical, beautiful lion or seeing those two cheeky beavers (even though they were two actors in suits)..again physically being there instead of some CGI garbage, that added to ""real-ness"" of this fantasy land. Aslan had this presence that was shattered with pretty Computer Animation.Also, with the characters, (because they actually acted in the '88 version), their relationships between themselves were so much more real, unlike here the attempted emotion about finding Edmund again..I don't feel it. I don't really believe they cared about finding Edmund again, yet, in the '88 version...I believed it all! I am rambling here and have made massive comparisons to something I originally watched on ABC , only because given current advances in movie making they could have made this so much more. What they have given us is something children will no doubt like, but more mature movie goers like myself have to shake my head in shame to imagine if the rest of the series will be filled in this empty-shell style.The only reason this gets a 6 out of 10 is because it was a good trip back to the original Narnia, and I have not seen it in a while. I will probably watch it again tomorrow to remind myself of how good it is. Everyone else- get the original",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"lovely, touching, deeply satisfying","I went with trepidations, figuring Tilda Swinton would be wonderful and the rest would be so-so. I was delighted to be wrong. The movie really hinges on the four children, they are the center. I thought it was extremely well-cast and acted. I can't remember the actors names but Lucy is enchanting, Peter is noble, Susan is a difficult role as the practical, spoil-sport so I can't say she was marvelous, but really Edmund is where everything revolves.This Edmund was really great. I was able to care about him and hope for him in a way I never did in the book. Kudos to the kids.In the book, Mr. Tumnus was pivotal, even if briefly seen, and the movie's Mr. Tumnus was delightfully sweet and touching. There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.Aslan - impossible really to capture as he is a concept. I felt the facial expression was so true to the sense of sorrow that Aslan carries but I was not fond of Liam Neesan's voice. Somehow that did not work for me, nor did the voice of the wolf.But Aslan does convey goodness and it's transitory nature and the end brought that home so well. While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.A beautiful movie that I highly recommend to those who love adventure, fantasy and myth.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Reasonable adaptation, not as good as expected though.","I thought the film was reasonable, but nothing like what i expected. I was expecting something with the same sort of quality as Lord of the Rings, instead it was more along the lines of a straight to TV adaptation.The costumes were pretty shoddy, wouldn't of looked out of place at a theatre or pantomime and the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen. Although, saying that, the youngest girl did very well for her age.I think the old BBC adaptation was a hell of a lot better than this big money version, do yourself a favour and buy the BBC DVD, its well worth it.Overall not a bad film, but didn't live up to the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well... nice CGI,"What to say? I truly expected more. Trying to please both adult and children audiences, I am afraid that Disney fell flat in between.Well, actually I cannot speak for the six-years-olds: They might love it and I wouldn't know, but then again the whole movie is so slowly paced that your average hyperactive kid is bound to loose track between two cuts. That's Narnia's biggest problem: It's plain boring. You just never get involved.I appreciate the effort Disney made to give more depth to the story: Peter's got more doubts about doing the right thing, Edmund is more of a rebel but simply a spoiled kid. Problem is though: kids (for whom Lewis wrote his book) won't know the difference while adults, who (like me) might appreciate a little more character development, may find many issues unresolved. There are movies that appeal to both young and old, but Narnia certainly does not join the fray.One more thing: ""Nice CGI"" refers to the animals, whose animation is sometimes short of outstanding. On the other hand there are just too many obvious computer graphics. Every other minute you get the impression of watching a video game. This might be due to somebody thinking that an impressive lion's fur carries a movie farther than a realistic scenery. Well, you can't spend one buck twice...All in all, I don't know for whom this film was made (certainly not for me) and I can find no excuse to recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In this age of child predators,"Is it such a good idea that a young child goes home to tea with a stranger, even one who has hooves? Perhaps, given the age in which we live, it is not the best example to set. I grew up in England during the war in question and well remember a teacher telling us at the age of nine or so, that there was less danger as fewer people had cars in which to abduct a child, (and little or no candy with which to tempt us). Yes this is a delightful film and the effects are astounding, with a touch of ""Pan's Laberynth"", but perhaps some sort of warning could have been included. The vast majority are kind and would certainly never harm a child but there are exceptions, as we all know.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing.,"I was hoping for really good things from this movie, but it left me feeling somewhat disappointed.All the ingredients are there to produce a really good film, a good book, stunning scenery and ILM on special effects duty ...but, the screenplay is a little bland, as are the performances of the children. The director has failed to make them sparkle in their roles, just as he failed to excite with his inconsistent pacing through the movie. There seemed to be a lack of excitement throughout, with scenes building and then not moving to the next level to really excite the audience.It made me jump in a few places (hence the PG rating) and there are good things in this film, Aslan looks terrific, costumes and locations are wonderful but ultimately I found it all uninspiring.It should have provoked some real emotion within me, but didn't (the book did!)

David in the Aisle- Chronicles of Narnia,"What all started as a simple game of hide-n-seek developed into a remarkable adventure. During World War II, a family of four children are sent to live with professor, little do they know this was the beginning of a unforgettable event. Based on a book by C.S. Lewis the Chronicles of Narnia takes you in an astonishing venture with Lucy, Edmond, Susie and Peter Pevensie, staying in this new house must abide to many rules; not touching, no yelling and especially to leave the professor alone. With all these regulations instituted the Pevensies still find many loopholes, during one of there games Lucy the smallest girl saunters into the wardrobe and is whisked into a different world. A snowy paradise, upon meeting Mr. Tumnus, a half human faun, she is kidnapped, yet upon her escape she makes her way back home. Edmond the second youngest stumbles upon this wonderland and meets the cause of all the troubles, the white witch, she befriends Edmund using some of his favorite food and offers him the position of king if he were to bring back the rest of his family. Eventually all four children walk into the terrain of Narnia and hear the background story from a friendly beaver about a prophecy, a king named Aslan and an army that could defeat the white witch. With the help from many creatures and witty plays, the kids start to bring spring back to Narnia and weaken the powers of the white witch. With an army of mystical creatures, talking animals and magical weapons the two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve go into battle to fulfill the prophecy, but do they succeed? I give this film 3 out of 4 'davids.' This is a movie to enjoy with everyone, the scenes were magnificent, the story line is amazing, plus the battle scenes are glorious and they didn't even use blood, this is a must see movie!

The special effects with the animals are very believable as the talking and voice-overs are superb. The plot from beginning to end has been exceptionally well executed. Only with today's special effects could this film hit the nail on the spot so well, it is so real. The children play their parts spot on and Tilda Swinton/The White Witch with her black eyes and beautiful but chilling figure cuts a fetching but scary witch.

"Good, but Overrated.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Warddrobe without a doubt is a stunning story with religious references, inspirational statements, and all-in-all an amazing resolution.The movie, though extremely popular, in my mind, was not that spectacular and could've been much better. C.S. Lewis meant for an epic adventure filled with amazement and extraordinary visuals, which the film seems to deliver there, but it lacks in some respects.The actors used for the main roles of the children were not impressive, and were rather lacking in various respects. As for the animation of the assortment of beasts, that was by far, spectacular. The storyline is very generic, and you can tell that it's meant for a wide array of viewers. With the storyline being so general, you miss out on the important details and the reasoning, and are pretty much blatantly told the how's and when's. The basics are definitely there, but it's not a ""Lord of the Rings"" when it comes to detail, which I think could've improved the overall outlook of the film.The movie, though widely thought of as a biblical reference, is sparingly that. The book, however, definitely is a inspirational and reflective portrayal of various stories and ideals from the Bible. The movie is pretty easy to interpret and without the detail as mentioned above, you don't get the same feel when it comes to the metaphorical and representation that C.S. Lewis meant to have in it.I enjoyed the movie, wasn't blown away, but I can definitely say it's worthy of owning in your own collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True to the Story & the Message,"I always applaud directors who stay true to the story and message which this movie does. The story, adventure, and graphics are outstanding and definitely want to see it again. The tale is a classic good vs. evil but for me it also makes the point that people are not all good or all evil. Everyone has good and evil inside them. The most important thing is to realize when you are committing evil acts and ask for forgiveness from the person that your wronged. And as the person wronged forgive others who wrong you. The Edmund and Mr. Thomnus characters speak volumes about being a character with a mixture of good and evil.My only negative comment on the movie is it could have used more character development. I realize the challenge in this with so many characters while keeping the movie to 2 1/2 hours. I am sure one of my personal heroes, CS Lewis, would be proud especially how it speaks of the Christian message without clobbering you over the head with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The screen adaptation of one of C.S. Lewis' The Chonicles of Narnia: Four children embark on an adventure to save a fantasy world, plagued with eternal winter.","I think it's a good movie. It's well casted--all four leads give impressive and promising performances and the White Witch is on point. The supporting cast is really good. I'm surprised by all the well-known British actors lending their voices. That's nice.I'm a big fan of the old BBC miniseries version, so I was excited to see this adaptation. Although I like it, I was disappointed by the pace of the film. It drags in the beginning and it haphazardly speeds up near the end, which should have been fleshed out simply to emphasize the significant scenes in the latter part of the film.I find it surprising that Disney is the producer and distributor because The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is veiled in a Christian allegory. This is another reason why I'm disappointed by the film. Because of the novel's religious connotations, Disney and Anderson made sure not to emphasize that aspect of it. Nevertheless the basic Christian symbols and themes are there if you are careful to not get lost in the film.The special effects are really good, almost flawless.Anderson attempted to make an epic film and he didn't quite make it. He put all the characteristic camera shots and action sequences akin to epic films, but it was some were blatantly just for show. Especially because of the pace at the end. I don't know what the editor was thinking but cutting from shot to shot, from scene to scene so quickly.Anderson and the screenwriter seem to not be conscious of character development. That's probably making Lewis shudder in his grave.Bottom line: Good movie (I'll definitely by the DVD when it comes out), but Disney makes cookie cutter films and totally sucks anything profound out of what it touches [(i.e. this film, Pocahontas, etc.)(They do better working with Pixar, who saves Disney's ass with their films)] and Peter Jackson should have gotten his hands on it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magnificent.  C.S. Lewis would be proud.,"Though this movie is perfect for all audiences, fans of the book will be especially pleased. Nothing is omitted. The embellishments are minor, and added strictly for the purpose of lengthening the movie (the book is really quite short).The battle scenes are fantastic. Gorgeous, even, and rivaling the greatest modern movie war sequences, without being excessively gory or graphic.I just finished re-reading the book to compare the movie with it. Though the film is considerably darker, it remains an endearing and fantastic adventure for audiences of all ages.Treat yourself to this lovely piece of cinema. You will cherish your experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, but doesn't capture the spirit of Narnia","I would say that although this movie has it's entertaining moments, it can't hold a candle to the old BBC and animated versions. Although the music was quite good in the new movie, it lacked the great theme which conveys the magic of Narnia in this old TV version and also the animated version which also has a nice theme, a big mistake I thought to open the movie with an Alanis Morissette song. Without a truly great magical theme I never got the sense that it was even Narnia that the children went to whenever they went through the wardrobe.I'd heard that the new film was a very faithful version of the book, but when I saw it I thought it was far from that to me. Virtually every line from the book had been altered and it was so corny to hear Ray Winstone's Mr Beaver use of cockney slang ""geezer"". The way Mr Tumnus constantly referred to Lucy as ""Lucy Pevensie"" was also very annoying, seeming as in the books the children's' surname isn't revealed until after The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. However both the old BBC version and the animated version, take virtually all their lines from CS Lewis's book. I don't know whether I'm too picky being a Lewis fan but to me even the way the children were shown to be riding talking horses in the film was like heresy, not only are they not mentioned to ride talking horses in the book, but also in The Horse and His Boy, we are told that no Narnian would ever dream of riding a talking horse because it was seen as derogatory to them, Bree only allowed Shasta to do it because he needed him to escape from Calormen.However all being said it was nice to see with a bigger budget and improved effects, a more realistic depiction of talking animals, and a truly stunning battle scene at the end, unlike the few pathetic animated creatures that are used for the flimsy battle at the end of the BBC version, but at the end of the day faithfulness to Lewis's book is far favourable to superior effects and action.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disney at its best,"Disney has made plenty of good live action and animated movies in the past (Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, 102 Dalmations, Monsters Inc.) But none like this. This movie has its own unique style. It features great actors (Georgie Henley and William Mosely being the best)a great director and a great screenplay. After seeing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I realized they left a lot out of stuff. But this movie fetures almost every last detail. The make-up artists did a fantastic job bringing C.S. Lewis' creatures to life. No wonder they won an Academy Award! I also think Tilda Swinton makes the perfect White Witch. All the voice talents were great as well. The only flaw in this film is that some of the backgrounds look fake. Other than that the film is perfect. Two thumbs way up Disney!!!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"One down, six to go. Hopefully.","While ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (now there's a mouthful) is in no way a bad movie, it still falls short of its own aspirations. And quite possibly Walt Disney and Walden's; though there's no proof, it's difficult not to think this is the opening salvo of their me-too response to certain other movie series (we all know which ones, so I won't name them). Especially since Peter Jackson's movie(s) seem very much like an organic product; this seems more like an assembly line, though still very far away from a failure.Giving the roles of the Pevensie children to four stronger actors would have helped, though director Andrew Adamson has to share the blame; it's not always that stirring, and the story loses itself towards the end (and unlike, say, ""King Kong"" or any of the entries in Jackson's trilogy, it doesn't wear its length that well - although ironically this clocks in at a comparatively economical 140 minutes). Perhaps he's not quite as used to dealing with live actors as with animated characters like Shrek. (Although some of the CGI is suspect, meaning Aslan. If only he'd been assigned to Industrial Light & Magic instead of Rhythm & Hues.)Then again, Adamson does get excellent performances from Tilda Swinton as the White Witch and James McEvoy as Mr. Tumnus, and the stodgy beginning and slightly fizzled finale is made up for by just about everything from the point Lucy discovers Narnia; Harry Gregson-Williams' score and the voice work helps, although having Alanis Morrisette and Tim Finn warbling over the credits doesn't. I'll be back for the second movie (it's surely not going to perform badly enough to rule out the next one) but ultimately Bill Melendez's TV cartoon version from the '70s is better.And yes, I did get the Christian allegories, but it didn't bother me. We don't all have a thing against religion here, you know. :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
And the point was?,"Don't get me wrong - I didn't think this was a bad film and enjoyed it more than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.But... For me it added nothing to the book. I think this has a lot to do with the way C.S. Lewis describes everything/one so well, it's a doddle even for a 7 year old to imagine everything in a pretty 'realistic' fashion.Fine, if you haven't read the book, it makes a good children's film. As an adult I think the thickly painted allegory is a bit too much with the story often feeling clumsy and made to fit.Maybe it's just me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent stuff!,"I have to say that I've always loved the C.S. Lewis Narnia novels and re-read them only recently. Although it was before I heard about this movie. I've also acquired the BBC movies for my very young son, and when I watched them for the first time found it VERY hard to restrain my incredulity at the so very fake animals and 'special' effects. So when I saw the shorts for this movie I was rather excited, and my expectations have been fully satisfied. I went with a friend this very afternoon and loved almost every minute. There were a couple of scenes where the backgrounds don't look quite right but other than that it is just about perfect. It also follows the book so closely it's amazing. Highly recommended to all fans of the novel, you definitely won't be disappointed!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Worth Seeing, With Some Reservations","Narnia is exceptionally well filmed. The four Pevensies are arguably the most beautiful family of young children you'll see in any movie. Tilda Swinton is awesome as the Ice Queen. She combines stunning beauty with ferocious will in the role. Jim Broadbent has a small --very small-- role in the film.The computer animation is head and shoulders above any I've seen before, especially the beaver husband and wife. The majestic lion Aslan is impressive as are the fauns, centaurs, trolls and ogres who swell the ranks of the armies of the Good and the Evil. Only the wolves' mouths when they speak don't quite make it.Having praised the actors and computer actors, and adding that the sets are stunning and the climactic battle scene good, let me state what's wrong with the movie. It is faithful -- more faithful than I would have expected in a two-hour-plus movie, to C. S. Lewis's novel. And that's the problem, because Lewis's novel, no matter how revered as a children's ""classic,"" is flawed both as fiction and as theology.In the novel, you can skim past the pages where Santa Claus appears, with his flowing white locks and dressed in Victorian red-plush coat and boots, riding a sleigh with a full complement of reindeers in front, to give the Pevensie children their gifts, gifts which will prove crucial in confronting the dangers ahead of them. In the movie, you can't get away from how odd this scene looks juxtaposed with what goes on around it. It teeters on the brink of mawkish, and it strikes me as the type of scene an old-ladyish Oxford don might well have appreciated over fifty years ago.More disturbing is the equation of the lion Aslam with Christ. It's bad theology. Aslam does not have the relation with his followers that Christ had with his: Aslam's are his subjects and like it or not, he's a warlord, at least until the Great Battle is fought and won. Aslam also does not have the relation with God that Christ had. He isn't God's son, he's a lion. He's the King of the Beasts, more in line with pagan wood gods of the Romans or Druids than with Christian deities or semi-deities.But, oh my, are those children adorable and boy, do the animal scenes make it, and wow, is Tilda Swinton hot --and a good actress too. So, all in all, Chronicles is well worth seeing.It's just not worth believing in.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only Movie I've Ever Seen That Did The Book Justice!,"Fantastic!!!!!!!!! There was a lot in the movie that wasn't in the book, but unlike the Harry Potter movies (which are good, but they always mess up the plots) they did it perfectly!!!! It was great!!! All die hard fans of the books will love it! I mean a couple things were a little off, but the basis were dead on!!! A newspaper reviewer criticized the movies, saying it wasn't as good at LOTR, who cares? The book was perfect & the movie was almost as good, deal with it! It was funny, sweet, perfect & did I say perfect? I was crying when I left, because it really was Narnia! If you haven't seen it yet, stick around through the credits, there's a little more to it!

"We need more movies like this, except even better ones.","What begins as a cheesy Disney movie rich in terrible one-liners and bad CGI (the beavers were unforgivable) turns into a great spectacle of fantasy cinema some 30-40 minutes into the film. While everything after Lord of the Rings in terms of epic battles feels half-assed and, frankly inadequate, The Chronicles of Narnia does a good job at establishing a true 'heroic' feeling with our main characters toward the end and the recipe for fantasy is accurately followed. I think we need much more fantasy movies out there and now that the 21th century has opened with blockbusters of its nature, there will hopefully be more like this.My only big problem with the film was the little girl playing Lucy Pevensie. For those of you who aren't familiar with the story, Lucy is the youngest in the foursome of siblings that the plot centres on. They are the ones to enter the wardrobe that takes them to the world of Narnia; they are the heroes in a quest for Aslan. Lucy is made into some kind of prodigal heroine who dominates the course of events; she is rude, snappy and badly acted. This little brat is the most annoying character I've seen since Jar-Jar Binks. She shouldn't have been in Narnia at all - they should have left her the wardrobe and locked her up. Anna Popplewell who plays her older sister Susan, on the other hand, is excellent. It may well be that she is just average and that the rest of the cast are really poor (they are just kids, after all) - but whatever the reason, she is the one thing that kept me watching Narnia at the beginning when it was at its worst.Visually, everything except the beavers were handled nicely and for a children's movie, this wasn't bad. Charismatic actors like Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson certainly helped things along the way, making this into a worthile adventure. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It would be a shame to stop at one. This is going to be a big hit. The children in the movie were quite impressive. Especially the unbelievably adorable little Lucy. It was great to see a movie based on a book and have that movie be a GREAT one. Once again, I hope they make all seven into movies. I cant wait!! ~~PEACE",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Must every fantasy be epic?,"Certain story descriptors have innate connotations these days. ""Melodrama"" is usually used as a pejorative and the adjective ""epic"" is inherently perceived as an acclamation. The quirk of the Narnia books is that they are not epic--adventurous, yes, exciting, whimsical and funny and meaningful, but not epic. They are smaller, more personal stories, more involved with the characters' wonder at their fantastical escapism. This movie, on the other hand, insists that every plot point and interaction MUST be grandiose and dramatic and sweeping and full of portent--an approach that is at odds with the story. Santa Claus shows up, for God's sake, can't this just be fun?I think, in a post-Return-of-the-King Best Picture win, Andrew Adamson saw this film as an opportunity to transition from a director of animated comedies to a ""real"" director. Of course I think animation directors ought to be taken more seriously, just like directors who primarily work in comedy or horror--a great film is a great film regardless of genre or format--but that isn't the case, unfortunately, and Lewis's classic novel fell victim to this struggle for equity. Unlike the irreverent Shrek films, which took nothing seriously (yet still had heart), LW&W takes everything too seriously, and prestige-ifies the heart right out of the story. The opening tries desperately to convince us of its dramatic import with a sequence of the Luftwaffe bombing London--ah yes, a depiction of wartime, this must indeed be potent stuff. Never mind that in the book the bombing is only mentioned to provide background as to why the Pevensie children are staying in the house of an eccentric professor. There could be myriad justifications for them to wind up in the house with the magical wardrobe of the title. It's not a story about the fallout of PTSD and the way children who have experienced the effects of war can work out their trauma in some kind of metaphorical Fantasia--not to say that isn't a great story idea, and I'm sure there exist many books that cover such a theme, but in this film it's a half-baked thesis that never really goes anywhere or finds any kind of satisfying fulfillment. Not to mention the climactic battle sequence (which, again, takes up perhaps two pages in the book, but Lord of the Rings gave us battle sequences that were awe-inducing in scope, so let's make it half an hour long because apparently that's what fantasy movies are obliged to do) works against this interpretation, showing only the glory and excitement and righteousness of wartime conflict while illustrating none of the devastation, bleakness, and moral ambiguity.Taken on its own terms, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, I suppose...functional. It's an entertaining property, if often a bit silly in its dire earnestness. It's not badly made; there's much artistry in the sets and props, even if Adamson failed to distinguish the overall visual scheme of the movie as anything other than derivative. The performances are good. The special effects range from ""effective"" to ""middle-grade"", even considering the time at which this was made. And that song from Imogen Heap that plays over the credits at least lends a distinctively wondrous note to the proceedings--even if it is too little too late.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
lame,"very disappointed by this film. it's poorly written with unimaginative dialog; production design really below par - the white witch's dress looks like a trash can wrapped in drapery fabric; even the editing was sloppy (the kids are running from wolves, as the shot changes, we actually see them waiting on their mark when the director apparently says ""action"" and they start running again - lame!); special effects are really poorly executed - it has none of the ""seamlessness"" we were wowed with in lord of the rings (in one scene the girls are riding the lion as he runs full-tilt through a forest, the girls robes hang limp and motionless as if they are sitting on a chair...); even the character make-up was less believable than many ""b"" horror movies - tufts of fur glued to the fawn's arm look like plugs in a bad hair transplant.the film relies far too heavily on the ""cute"" factor of the child actors without developing them as complex characters or giving them anything believable to do. bland but saccharine sweet, their performance frequently reminded me of old shirley temple movies.might be o.k. for small children, but definitely not for the sophisticated child or adult.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"My Thoughts on HP, LOTR, and L,W & W","I am a Christian, and I just wanted to say that I do agree that some people who claim to be Christians act very hypocritically sometimes.It is really discouraging because as Christians, we are supposed to be consistent examples ( whether you take us seriously or not is beside the point; it's should just be our main goal )There is controversy even among us Christians regarding The Lord of the Rings and now Narnia, but I would have to say ( without judgment or condemnation; I'm just voicing my honest thoughts and opinions ) that if anyone claims to be a Christian but does not feel uneasy about Harry Potter, there is something wrong.I'm not trying to sound snobbish, but while those of you who are critical of us ""hypocrites"" lump The Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and Harry Potter together because they all contain ""magic"", there is a very distinct line separating Harry Potter from the other two.I have not seen the Harry Potter movies, but watched part of ""The Chamber of Secrets"" for a while when it was on TV the other night. I'm sorry but there is something very evil there. I cannot explain the repulsion I felt in my soul... please bear with me.The children are being taught to use witchcraft! And ( although I hear it is a little better in the newest movie ) it is treated rather lightly! The children don't seem to flinch at the presence of ghosts.There are wizards in The Lord of the Rings, but ""magic"" is something which is treated with great care. There is no God in Middle Earth, so it seems that ( since some sort of ""Higher Power"" is needed to complete the story ) Tolkien chose to use ""magic"". Although some Christians are not in complete agreement as to whether or not this movie should have our approval, there is definitely not that evil feel to it.I just read an article on the making of Narnia. C.S. Lewis said this when he wrote L,W & W: ""I said to myself, 'Let us suppose that there were a land like Narnia and that the Son of God, as he became a Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen'"". L,W & W is definitely more directly related to Christianity than LOTR, but, like Tolkien, Lewis used a different land and a different form of a ""Higher Power"" to represent the deep truths of Christianity. It's some- times more effective than trying to use today's world and the ""real God"" when trying to witness. You guys would probably just dismiss it immediately! :)Thanks for listening.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
this movie stayed true to the book,"We watched two movies in class, the new and the old versions of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"". The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was about a group of kids who were playing around, and while they were playing around they found an imaginary country. This country was called Narnia, they had to travel very far to get there and then eventually go into battle. The newer version I thought was a lot better than the old one. The new one was more realistic and had better special effects. I also liked it because you could actually understand what was going on instead of being distracted by the bad effects and of how fake it was. I also didn't like the old one because the animals looked like stuffed animals. Another thing I liked about the movie is that is stayed true to the book. One reason I didn't give this movie a 10 is because it got boring after awhile, it didn't have any real action. Also you know that any of this stuff can't really happen. I would not watch this movie again but would recommend this movie to anyone who has watched the older version or has read the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Solid mythic adventure film, but all too often striking us as having been made with one's head more-so one's heart.","Films of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe's ilk were a dime-a-dozen at around the time of its release. Unleashed upon us once the Lord of the Rings films had had their fill of our cinema screens; somewhere in the middle ground of the Harry Potter Franchise and then preceding projects such as The Spiderwick Chronicles, one can only muster up as much enthusiasm as one can when offered yet another magical, mythical adventure fraught with danger and wonder but driven by kids. The project in this case is a film based on the immortal books by C.S. Lewis; an English author who wrote about the trials and tribulations encountered in a magical land named Narnia, to which the entrance was of course granted at the back of the most famous wardrobe in literary history. One could argue Lewis was ahead of the game in this regard; writing which was released around the time of Tolkien's fictitious escapades in Middle Earth as youngsters ill-suited to their dramatic, danger-filled surroundings took on the elements. It is sad, then, that Andrew Adamson's adaptation of the first in the Narnia series is mostly as colourless and nondescript as all the other fantasy adventures in spite of its cherished, game-changing foundations.Andrew Adamson's previous two films were both Shrek and Shrek 2, and where there was more of a biting energy in those films which subverted fairy tales and folk stories. Here, Adamson has gone all out to take something back from those projects in his production of a full-on-fairy-story with enchanted kingdoms and talking animals which is played for grimaces more-so grins. The tale begins in Wartime London, a city prone to attacks by the German air force as Hitler's armies sit perched across a small stretch of water at what potentially lies in wait. Trapped in the chaos of what will forever be remembered as The Blitz are the Pevensie family consisting of just their mother and her four children: Peter (Moseley); Edmund (Keynes) Susan (Popplewell) and Lucy (Henley) – a unit already mourning the loss of the man of the family to the war and now stuck here in their garden shelter as the flak rains down.As was with many at the time, these kids are shipped out of a war torn London and into the countryside; a greener, safer locale where they may wait out the war with elderly guardians. Those unfamiliar with the historical importance behind such course of action, or indeed already aware of said item and looking for a decent dramatic depiction of it, should look no further than a late nineties production entitled ""Goodnight Mr. Tom"". The children are not a congealed unit, they argue; bicker; brand one another ""selfish"" and fall out pretty easily. Boredom and disillusionment at this large countryside house owned by a professor, who does not at all strike us as a professor, gives was to a harmless game of hide and seek wherein the eponymous wardrobe allows access to the wintry world of Narnia: a place where animals speak; war between two set sides broods and the key characteristics of the landscape and climate is snow and the freezing cold. Although as is custom in these films, the youngest discovers the secret first but no one around believes them.Narnia arrives with its own set of challenges; there are allies in the form of Beavers and Lions, of which feature the voice talents of Ray Winstone and Liam Neeson, but then there are enemies and it is Tilda Swinton's White Witch who comes to be the chief threat. Along the way, the kids in the film learn (with the design being that the message will transcend unto the kids in the audience) the value of teamwork; of working together, especially if you're of the same blood, and that accepting sweets from strangers leads to bad things... My confounded inability to recall the books as well as I'd like does nothing to guard the criticisms I have for the film, a film whose worst characteristic is that it's a tad flat and whose content is, at the worst of times, often asking to be merely disregarded as nonsense. The text's carefree approach to the material, on top of its generally cartoonish aesthetic as a palette of bright colours and a range of contrasts sets the scene to what is ultimately a bloody fight to the bloody death, highlights its child-orientated thematics of fighting on through strife and using one's powers responsibly more than I would have liked.Director Adamson works here with live action for the first time, although he breaks himself in easily with the retaining of some of what he's used to in the form of CGI animals voiced by famous people prancing around the screen looking expressive. He gets results out of the young cast, who do a thorough job in playing people put through the wringer before being asked to go and win a war that a Lion cannot against a pack of wolves and middle aged woman with a steely gaze. But the film is a stepping stone project more than anything else and the best you can say about this particular adaptation of a famous piece is that those involved do a professional job with an eye to move onto bigger things.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
C.S. Lewis would be proud of this movie,"To see this movie brought to life so fully brings a joy to my heart. As a long time fan of the series, I was worried about how this film was going to be portrayed, but they absolutely nailed it.When they veered from the book, it only was to enhance the tension at certain plot points, never to change the essence of the story.Of course, the goal of a good movie isn't only to follow the plot of the movie. It's to make an exciting movie experience. In this case, it was also important not to violate the spirit of the book. Adam Adamson didn't.Perhaps the most brilliant decision he made was to cast four unknowns as the Pevensie children. They prove unequivocally that level of fame coming in is not synonymous with talent. These children give the movie, and their characters, extreme depth. At its core, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the story of how these four children grow into their destiny. This movie nails that.By succeeding overwhelmingly in constructing the movie's core, Adamson satisfies his core audience. Which is why it is so easy to accept the other slight changes from the book -- there is a certain trust that any changes will be made by someone who is in tune with C.S. Lewis' spirit and vision.In a pre-CGI world, Lewis once said that he couldn't envision a live-action Narnia movie that worked. Thanks to Adam Adamson the rest of us can.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A solid, beautiful looking, adaptation of narnia .Its not without its problems though......","The chronicles of narnia is a visually stunning and entertaining adaptation of CS lewis's classic but while it is a good film, there's something thats stop it from reaching the ""lord of the rings"" heights it aspires to .The problem is the kids: they cant act ! Skandar Keynes and William Moseley in particular-they just cant express the range of emotions that peter and edmund go through , and these characters go through a lot !Since these kids have to carry a large portion of the film even though they're not capable of it , its a bit of a chore watching them .So its a good thing that they are helped out by such a great supporting cast !

Every aspect seemed to be considered equally and carefully.

Some reviews I've read recently generally compared the output to Lord Of The Rings, so I had some expectations for sure. I felt quite, well, like someone had stolen my cookie after the movie ended. It was all OK till about the middle of the movie and the plot development to me was a little bit too slow perhaps but still OK. Somewhere after passing the mid part of the movie I felt that the plot developed all too fast. And all of a sudden the movie had ended. What happened? For sure there are great effects here, both visual and audio, but the plot just developed so quick in the end. It felt like the director realized after filming and completing the first 1½ hour that he had only one hour left to go and he had 2/3 of the story left to tell, so he tried to find some kind of compromising middle path and it didn't please me.

But something was missing in the plot-- it seemed too superficial and rushed to me. Granted, I haven't read the book in twenty years, so it's possible that the children would become instant friends with a lion they'd never met. Or perhaps it's just my adult mind looking at a childhood story where it doesn't seem plausible anymore. Plus, the ""main characters"" (being the children) didn't seem important as leads at all. They were just sort of... there.Tilda Swinton was wonderful as the White Witch. She has such a unique beauty about her that can go from elegant to fierce evil with just a change of expression.

Get Yourself a Oneway Ticket to Narnia!,"I'd say it got almost everything right. Of course nothings perfect But all they really had to get right was being faithful enough to capture the essence of the story, most importantly it's sense of heart, which it does well enough. These characters had a hell of a lot more going for them in the rooting department than most more morden movies of these recent years and it carry's the movie and any flaws through. If they'd tried to attempt anymore then they'd have entered the ""trying to please everyone"" zone of impossibility.Somehow I found both the personality trates in Peter and Edmund and their character arcs rang true. Edmund's selfishness, the little brother who can't seem to do anything right, who must learn the error of his ways by bitter experience, forced to grow up fast and Peter's struggle to live up to his responsibilities, the boy forced to be something that he isn't certain he can be, the boy who must become the man of the family. I understand how that stuff must feel rather well. Each felt very natural, clearly the makers worked hard to get such performances out of these youngsters. I hear they even deliberately looked for kids who matched the character's persona's which obviously helped.I liked that nobody was just morphed into a mighty hero, that they remained consistently grounded and humanised. Peter not loosing his sense of humour. I loved how the actor delivered his reply to ""They come in numbers far greater than our own,"" ""Numbers don't win a war"" with simply a ""No...but I bet they help."" I'm very warm to the underdog hero who faces insane odds and who can laugh at them self and use humour as a defence no matter how grave the situation.Perhaps the only slight criticism is that the girls on the other hand were somewhat more underused, well the older one anyway. Lucy was note worthy.The voice work guys played an absolute blinder! Ray Winston ruled! That cranky little East-End beaver nearly stole the show! Dawn French served her purpose well as a good compliment to the great Ray.Aslan the mighty wise old Lion didn't disappoint me either, he looked magnificent and voiced to a tea by the master of such roles, the legendary Liam Neeson. Ah the wonders of the CGI age eh?The Villain front didn't let the side down neither. I digged the taunting wolf, always great tension when a Villain knows how to mess with the heroes insecurities, especially when it's the best kind of hero, a humanised underdog kind of hero like Peter, whom is bursting with that kind of vulnerability. This lead to some fairly decent built up tenstion and suspense.That was one creepy as hell White Witch, those eyes, it was all in the eyes and of course her shining moment came in that one all important scene, the scene that if they'd got wrong, the hole movie would have fell to pieces, yep the infamous stone table scene. And boy was it powerful stuff, no easy feat considering it was a puppet! It's A PUPPET!... oh sorry, no I wasn't possessed by British comedian Brian Conery for a moment there, I was checking your paying attenstion and of course mean't...puppet/CGI Lion.All in all, a film thats refreshingly as character driven as possible for a big epic blockbuster.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better Than Harry Potter, Worse Than LOTR","I feel this movie gets a bad wrap. I mean, if you read the books you would realize the pacing of the books is so fast and isn't paced evenly throughout the book. I thought Lucy did an amazing job, her scenes with Mr. Tumnus were amazing, Edwin had his moments, but the other too gave very weak performances. To be fair though, they had the least dialogue to work with and what they did have wasn't very good, they weren't well-developed characters and it shows. The two most memorable sequences were the sequences between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus and the sacrifical sequences. If the rest of the film had been treated with such care it would have been a spectacular film, perhaps rivaling the LOTR films. The much touted CGI characters also shine, the voices perfectly match the character and their animation in terms of emotion is great. Unfortunately, the film is marred by pacing issues, some uneven CGI effects, some poor dialogue, and some uneventful action sequences. On the whole, I thought this was a step in the right direction and am looking forward to future films in the series. Definitely a film your kids will enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THE film of the season,"I LOVED this film. I'll admit, I'm a Narnia fan and have been for years and had my own preconceived notions of what and how Narnia should be, how all of the characters should look, act, and so on. So naturally, I went in with very lofty expectations and a ""show me"" attitude. I am more than happy to say that this film surpassed any and all expectations I had really does C.S. Lewis' work justice. Everything right down to the scenery was perfect and the acting was spot on. Only a few really *minor* issues with one or two of the outdoor scenes looking painfully obvious as being shot with a blue screen and matte paintings, but other than that, this film was excellent and I would gladly pay a good amount of money to see it again.Also, stay for the credits...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ignore the religious tub-thumping; this is one for the kids,"As an adaptation of a much-loved saga of mythical realms and fabulous beasts, largely filmed in New Zealand by a New Zealander, this first Narnian chronicle was always going to invite comparisons to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings juggernaut. But where Middle Earth was shrouded in gloom, Adamson's Narnia is a more welcoming place; a winter wonderland that children would love to explore, White Witch or no.The tale begins in dark times as the Pevensie children - Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter - are evacuated from blitzed London to the country mansion of twinkly Professor Kirke. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (well-cast debutant Georgie Henley) stumbles into a room furnished only with a huge wardrobe, at the back of which she finds... a snowbound forest. And has tea with a faun called Tumnus.Of course, Edmund poo-poohs her story until he follows her and is lured into doing the bidding of wily white witch Jadis (the spikily splendid Tilda Swinton). If he brings her his siblings, he'll get as much Turkish delight as he can eat. Now that's sweet-talk.When the Pevensies arrive en masse, Tumnus is gone but a kindly Cockney beaver (voiced by Ray Winstone) tells them that only they can fulfil a prophecy to restore peace to Narnia by joining the righteous forces of the noble lion Aslan. But Edmund's treachery sets Jadis and her wolves on a relentless hunt to catch Peter, Susan and Lucy before they reach Aslan's army.Much has been made of the book's Christian overtones, but while the movie retains the story's core elements it goes easy on the preaching to provide well-intentioned and wholesome entertainment - you know, for kids? Admittedly, the self-sacrifice and subsequent resurrection of Aslan is laid on a bit thick and 'Jadis' does sound like 'Judas'. But it's possible to overlook the biblical themes to enjoy a basic tale of good-versus-evil.The pacing is brisk and the denizens of Narnia are nicely rendered (though the green-screen work is a bit shonky), from the earthly beavers and wolves to minotaurs, griffons, centaurs and cyclops(es?).Grown-ups will appreciate it as a cynicism-free breath of nostalgia... but they may have to keep an eye on the kids when they next go shopping for bedroom furniture.Just a few questions to ponder: where's Aslan been the last 100 years when he's needed? Why aren't the beavers afraid of humans wearing fur coats? How come Lucy's potion heals the most horrific wounds but not a cut lip? And why are all evil creatures - white witches excepted - ugly?

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are evacuated from London during World War Ⅱ. So, they have to live in an old country house in countryside. One rainy day, Lucy found the big wardrobe in this house. Lucy steal in wardrobe, then surprisingly snow covered forest stretched away endlessly before her eyes. The snowy land is called Narnia and this land under a rule of white witch's law. Therefore Christmas never come. Four children decide to save the Narnia with lion, the true ruler of Narnia.It's based on novel written by C.S Lewis. I watched movie, then I read the book. This movie reproduced novel in detail, but little be different. Because it not perfect, you may be discouraged. If you love Lewis's novel, you have own image of Narnia...

"How to turn a 190-page kid's story into a 2.5 hour ""epic""","I wanted to be generous and give this 5 out of 10 but this film really doesn't deserve even that extra star to rate it as mediocre.Let's start from the top: The film opens inside the bomber planes of Germans, dropping bombs on London during WWII. It next cuts to a scene of a mother frantically herding her four youngsters (the 4 who protagonists of the film) to their bomb shelter. In this scene, Edmund disobeys and runs back inside so he can grab a picture of his dad, who is fighting the war. There is a close call with a bomb, followed by Peter admonishing Edmund with the line ""why can't you do as you're told?"" (or something like that). This scene is followed by a long and boring goodbye scene at the railway station.On the one hand, I like the fact that these scenes place the story in their proper timeframe; essentially, they act as a historical backdrop to the tale. On the other hand, however, they're not precisely necessary. They're nothing that a couple of text stills or voice-over narration couldn't have accomplished. One might argue that they give the film emotional weight (or some such crock), but they really don't, especially since they don't really have any bearing later. In my cynical opinion, they're an excuse to give Peter something to say (the aforementioned line to Edmund) that he will say later (though not in any meaningful way); a popular Hollywood convention, apparently. Also, I might add this is a kid's book. Why the need to open the movie with such grim scenes as the WWII bombing of London? Again, unnecessary.However, this stands apart from the main story, so no real harm done...that is until they get to that main story. Changes are made, seemingly at random. Presumably they are done to enhance the drama of the story but all they really do is impede narrative flow and create scenes that are simply wrong. For example, there is a scene involving the four children in the Beavers' dam, getting the scoop on Narnia from the Beavers. Before this scene there is a scene with Edmund and the Witch, with the latter showing the former where her castle lies, between two hills, quite a ways away off in the distance. In the Beavers' dam scene, Edmund is shown to look at the hills, still quite a ways a way. Later in the scene, Edmund sneaks off to report to the Witch. His absence is quickly discovered by his siblings, who follow with the Beavers. It is quickly seen, though, that that prodigious distance to the Witch's house wasn't very great at all, as Edmund is soon shown to be at the castle, with his siblings and the Beavers close behind! Did I somehow miss the teleportation scene? I won't even comment on how this deviates from the book; the scene, by itself, is just ridiculous. In another scene, a fox (a character invented for the movie, as is the scene he is in) helps the children escape by throwing the pursuing wolves off their trail. On moment, the fox is telling the children and beavers that he will throw the pursuing wolves off, the next the wolves have arrived and demand the fox tell them where their quarry is. He tells them they went north, but it turns out that they are in the very tall tree towering over them. Again, I must have blinked and missed the crucial scene where the fox sprinkled fairy dust on the pursued.Then there's the problem of acting. The four children aren't terrible but they're not very good either. And two of them (the elder two) are made out to be whiners. I guess you can't blame them too much, especially as they're made to say and do things not in the book (they might have fared better if they stuck closer to the original text).But how do others, more experienced actors fare? Not all that well either. Tilda Swinton does not make a very good White Witch. In fact, she doesn't seem to know what to do with this role, underplaying it to the point of distraction. Also, the physical match between book and film is poor. Similarly, James McEvoy, paints a very limp portrait of Tumnus. No real conviction or anything of interest there either.The other main gripe I have with the movie is its mimicry of the Lord of the Rings movies. Lots of armor and weapons and posturing and clashing of armies. Unfortunately, it's all pretty dull and hackneyed (and, please...beavers in armor?)Overall, there's not much of a sense of fun about the film. Everything seems either overblown or underdeveloped. Too much effort has gone into making things look real and not enough into making things wondrous. For instance, a key piece of dialog by the Witch (one in which she calls out for the creatures in her army), is absent. It's moments like those that made the book so much fun that are noticeably missing from the movie.I don't mean to nitpick this film to death and come off like someone who thinks the movie should have followed the book to the letter. That is not precisely so, although I don't think there's any excuse for not doing so in this case. Sure, there are parts of the book that could have used embellishment or even improvement but there was no real need to drastically change or add anything. Wasn't the reason the Lord of the Rings (or book to film) couldn't be adapted faithfully that the books were too long? Well, there's no such excuse here.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Slavishly faithful to the source material, a little perfunctory but mostly pretty good","Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, I adored these books when I was in the fourth grade. I am a good deal older and more cynical now, but I recall the books with a great deal of affection. I was wary about the film, both because it seemed like an attempt to cash in on the success of the Potter and LOTR films, and also because the books never seemed particularly cinematic to me (so much of it being things that only make sense from the point of view of a child).The film opens with shots of German planes in the sky during the Battle of Britain. We're introduced to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go scrambling into the bomb shelter adjacent to their London home. It's a nice touch, a context that is only mentioned in passing in the book but which benefited from a more explicit showing now that WWII has faded from our collective memory. The film then proceeds with the events of the book, matching developments very closely. The four child actors play it all with a very English sort of reserve, which is a nice departure from the ""needs their Ritalin"" kids of many contemporary films, but it also mutes the sense of wonder sometimes. With the exception of a few moments between the very young Lucy and Tumnus the fawn, the kids accept what happens to them and how their lives are changed with relative nonchalance. They're good, and it's good to watch them as they endure and develop, but they're hard to relate to.Turning to the ideological content of the film, the Christian metaphor becomes pretty explicit (perhaps even moreso than in the book). It didn't bother me per se, but I can see that becoming an issue for militant atheists. It IS a propaganda piece for the values that C.S. Lewis associated with Christianity at its best, but even as an agnostic I have respect for most of those values. I was bothered somewhat by the strident militancy of the last third of the film. There's a blend of childish awe and violence in the battle scenes that doesn't sit well with me, though to the filmmakers' credit they are just reproducing the tone of the book. But it's such a naive view of war, and it's so bizarre to set up these kids in a setting that plays like something out of Braveheart or Return of the King except with the miracle of no blood being shed. The mixing of violence and innocence, with religious overtones, is fundamentally disturbing to me.Still, it's a good story well-told, and the filmmakers show a deep reverence for Lewis' writing and tremendous special effects know-how to bring it into motion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who even likes Turkish Delight?,"So...yeah. I wanted to review the most ""popular"" thing on here I hadn't yet reviewed so...here we are.I saw this in the theatres but I am eternally irked by the memory of this movie because one of my teachers showed it so us as some kind of module. It was ""English"" class and it wasn't even ""media studies"" and I remember finding the experience just annoying. I remember that teacher as being kind of a twit which is a pity because that term I had only just been replaced into the upper tier class. She once made people on my table stand up for not answering to a question. I didn't even hear her... How do these numbskulls get the position of,-- oh right, the low pay.So...yes, what is there really to say? It's an epic fantasy blockbuster and I suspect has aged very well in that respect. I don't feel any particular desire to read the book, partly because I want to explore more esoteric fantasy but this was good enough is what I'm saying.I could take it seriously and the movie aspired to a high standard in its writing but never took itself too seriously so if, like me, you found Jackson's Lord of the Rings an odious experience, this is sort of that but done well.And it's not too Jesus-ey either.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The soundtrack is in a league of its own with its own unique feel and its own unique melodies.

Enjoyable but not memorable,"In my opinion the movie is quite well done, well acted and visually impressive. It was a good diversion that did successfully get me into this fantastical world.The primary thing I found unsatisfying was with the four protagonists as I can't remember any movie where the main characters do so little and are so unimportant to the unfolding of the story. In my opinion, they are present but not much more.C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkein were apparently friends and both LoTR and Narnia were written about the same time. In LoTR the characters constantly make difficult decisions that determine their future, they make significant sacrifices and their strength of character and body are tested from start to finish.In Narnia, with one significant exception, the characters are lead around from the start to the finish. The meet other characters by chance and each linearly gets them where they need to be next. They are destined for prestige in Narnia before doing anything beyond showing up.Each of the four kids have interesting personalities but in my opinion at the end of the movie they are all the same undeveloped stereotypes as they were at the film's opening. Having not read the books, I don't know if I would have the same concern there or if the film version sacrifices so much that it is lost. My hope would be that the book does far more in this area.For such a large budget and classic story I was very surprised that it would lack something so basic to story telling. At least that was my experience with the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A magical film but.......,"Filming a book is never easy because a director has no way of knowing what is in your mind's eye. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is hailed as a great piece of work because although he may have imagined it differently than from you or I he did managed to bring Middle Earth to life and you could believe it exists. So it was with some degree of expectation that the magical land of Narnia would also shine on the screen. Shine it does but not as wonderful as you may hope. The sets are fantastic, the CGI is god-smackingly good and the battle scene is superb. Where the film falls down are on the things you cannot quite your finger on. For starters, Narnia does not seem cold enough during the evil white winter, Tilda Swinton (as Jardis, the White Witch) doesn't seem evil enough , Aslan (although superbly CGI) doesn't seem majestic enough and the film does not seem magical enough if say compared to Harry Potter. The children actors are at times are a little wooden but do a good job. Regardless if you can get over the nit picking it is great film for kids and adults who know the story. Also it was the first film I have seen that added material to the book in a beneficial way without taking too many liberties. More of B+ than a A-. There is cartoon version made in '78 and I would recommend watching that as well if not just for the music which is so perfect for the story and a real shame that this film did not have that cracking soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Average,"I saw this film yesterday with my children aged 8 and 5, both girls. They both really enjoyed it. I thought it was average. The character of Lucy was well portrayed by the young actress. However, Edmund, Susan and Peter were way off the mark. Bad casting? I don't know but I found that I didn't care one jot what happened to these three. I was actually hoping that the White Witch would turn Edmund to stone when she captured him. I also felt the same with Aslan. When he was sacrificed, I didn't care. I don't think the screenwriters were able to convey any meaningful relationships between character and character or characters and audience.The White Witch was excellently cast and played, mind you. She was very convincing. The worst part of the film was the beginning. The relationships between the siblings was very weak. It seemed like the writers were rushing it along to get into the main body of the story. Even when Lucy had gone 'through the wardrobe' for the first time, there was a part where her brothers and sisters were disbelieving of her. I was thinking 'Just get on with it!' Once they'd all gone into Narnia, the film picked up a bit. The scenery was breathtaking and the special effects were great. I think these were the only things that saved the film from being awful. I read all the books when I was younger and enjoyed them immensely. Wish I'd seen the film then as I think I would have enjoyed it more! Children will love it but adults?

I never thought a movie could capture the book I loved so much as a child. This one did so, far surpassing all my expectations.

Decidedly dull,"I just saw this film last night and I have to say that I was very under-whelmed. Yes, it's a children's film - I know. But, other so-called children's films seem to entertain adults quite easily (most of the animated Disney films as just one example). I would concede that my enjoyment may have been spoilt by the fact that I was aware of the negative publicity surrounding the film. All the way through I couldn't help but notice the heavy-handed religious symbolism. The sickly-sweet sentimentality was also quite hard to wade through. For the first time in quite a while I found myself longing for a film to reach the end, which was pretty predictable and far from exciting - despite the impressive visual effects. My teenage kids thought it was OK and they didn't notice the Christian sledgehammer, which backs up my point that the publicity might have ruined it for me. I hear that there will be more Narnia films appearing in the cinema over the next few years - but not for me, thanks.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Allegory blowback and a few other issues, but still worth watching","Sorry, but I don't have a totally glowing review of Narnia. Given the response among my pals and me here in Taiwan, I'm sort of curious what is going on in the minds of the folks' who check in to post these 20-thumbs-up reviews.One local response in particular summed it up: One of my buddies said he's getting sort of tired of the relentless barrage of Manichean sensory overload flicks. I can see his point. They may have a cuteness factor to soften them (e.g., cute Hobbits in Ring, or the kids in Narnia), but the big thing now seems to be starkly dualistic fantasy white-hat/black-hat CGI-enhanced action.That said, I understand that the Narnia books were supposed to be a Christ allegory, and can see the attempt to set forth at least the basic ideas that shape and inform the plot development, especially the one involving Aslan and Edmund.Before continuing, I should point out I didn't read the Narnia chronicles, though I have read Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, and The Great Divorce. And I've seen both the BBC and American productions of Shadowlands.It seems that even someone as capable as C.S.Lewis can't recast a sacrifice myth so that it makes sense.It's going to be interesting to see how American fundamentalists (in particular) will respond to this. When the White Witch refers to the universal moral principle to which even Aslan is bound, won't they flinch at this as a usurpation of God's sovereignty; a kind of ""cosmic muffin"" pantheism? Then the problem enters in that, if the moral principle is truly universal, it applies here on Earth as it does in Narnia. If we can't (and don't) transfer honorary debts here on Earth, how can Aslan take Edmund's lumps for him, romantic though it may seem in a parallel universe, in living color, and on the big screen? And, to the best of my knowledge, these elements are the crux of the prevailing Christ myth espoused by most folks that call themselves Christian. In general, the net effect of the scenarios with a spiritual payload suggest to me more of a Hindu/Buddhist message e.g., where the illusory treats the White Witch manufactures for Edmund are the Hindu ""maya."" Moving on, a few more observations.Other commenters have kudos for the kids' acting, but I remember the palpable relief I felt when Jim Broadbent hit the screen, and I got to see a little *real* acting for a change. The kids were OK, but really that's all. Well, perhaps except for Edmund's character (see below).I thought Peter's character transition was mismanaged. He starts out as this hapless kid with a dazzling sword thrust into his hands and then suddenly is supposed to be a formidable foe to enraged, strapping, battle-hardened, armor-encrusted, chimerical beasts. Perhaps this is where my unfamiliarity with the original books has me at a loss; it may be that Lewis more carefully crafts this transition, and makes it more believable. Perhaps this was a tricky thing to engineer in the screen writing, so they just hoped the viewer would obligingly bridge the gap. Well, it sort of stuck out for me, so there you have it.Much else in the movie is great. I really liked the way Tumnus the faun was understated; nicely directed and acted. The sets were fantastic, both in Narnia and Earthside. The music was good, though I didn't care for the selection that ran during the opening sequences/credits; that blockbuster-requisite one-style-fits-all guaranteed heartstring-tugger sound felt out of place for the period and situation; no doubt the product of a session between the producers and industry consultants. It sort of started me off with a bad taste in my ear. Too bad! You'd think I wouldn't care for the heavily produced images, but they were so very, very well done that they generally didn't feel ""imposed."" Excepting the allegory blowback issue mentioned above, a lot of the story and character development is great. I love Edmund; he's a great character, and his contrast with the other characters gives a great illustration of venality, and makes that love that accepts him and shepherds him to a better spiritual place all that much more deep and truly loving. His character was well directed and acted, especially in light of the fact that it was so difficult.OK, enough for now. Thanks for reading.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, but far from classic.","I must admit, from the first shot that took you up into the cockpit of the German Bombers over the London rooftops, I had high hopes for the this film. Beautiful opening, I thought, emotional, and set up the relationships between the characters quite well while maintaining good pacing. Unfortunately, as the film continued, it started to drag in its attempt to fit all the characters and the plot elements into what turned out to be at times a tedious experience.Admittedly, this is well crafted film, and it's meticulous workmanship can be seen in every shot and transition. The actors and CG characters all do a wonderful job of maintaining the fantasy that is Narnia. You won't be seeing any swaying cardboard cutouts and badly rendered crowd effects in this film. But perhaps I have been spoiled by the likes of Peter Jackson and even Chris Nolan with his recent take on the Batman franchise, but this version in all its loyalty to the work of C.S. Lewis somehow missed an element of magic which comes from a directors authorship.In other words, this is not an enduring creative masterpiece, but rather palatable adaptation An adult vision of a children's story. It never creates that distinction between Narnia and the real world, and by creating a Narnia that is as believable as that London Flat, it actually took away some of the wonder that could have made this film as enduring as the original work by C.S. Lewis. The director did not choose to show this world as it would have appeared in the eyes of a child. . .the over bearing whiteness of winter snow in contrast to a damp musty country estate, the incredible and unbending evil of the manipulative white witch that distorts her beautiful features to one of animal like menace.Remember how in the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's world suddenly went from black and white to technicolor in the turn of a tornado. Ah. . .there's the authorship that transitions a classic work of literature into a classic film. So in the way that every shot was predictably framed, in the same way that every cut was just the right length, and every costume just as it would have been in C.S. Lewis's world, it became a technical affair which for someone like me who already knows the plot quite well became. . .well. . . boring.But then again. . .this is a well made film. Few would call it a blasphemy of the original version laid on paper and not celluloid. But this version is like a well made suit. Beautiful, but a suit never the less. Perhaps I went the the theater seeking not a suit, but rather, a pair of wings. . . not quite proper dress etiquette but that's what makes it magical.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Falls short of a better film, but good","A decent film, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' is at times captivating, but, it falls short of delivering a better film. I haven't read the book since I was about 10, and I saw the cartoon on television -which I really enjoyed- before that. However, this review is not to look at the film adaption of the book and to say what was done wrong and what was removed; it's been too long ago for me to really remember the story to go into that detail! I am rating this as a film. Design, pacing, and acting and the three main areas that I'll cover in this review; each had varying levels of success. Although some of the film design was done very well, I did have some problem with some of the CGI and realism. Some of the design was done exceptionally well, and some of it wasn't. For example, the scenes of the children crossing the river, the lion, and the creatures turning to (or from) stone were quite well done, but I had some problems with the CGI beavers and some of the other critters. The beavers did not look realistic, but it looked as if they were made to be realistic without facial expressions (or limited expressions). The lion was done well, and CGI in other films is also done well, but it seemed to me as if the beaver got the short end of the stick (no pun intended) when it came to CGI. The battle scenes also involved some less-than stunning CGI compared to what I've seen in other films. Costume design and set design was generally very good from the castle to the beaver's home. There were some very good shots; in particular, the shot of the curtain falling down from the wardrobe while Lucy pulls on it is very good. The film did have some trouble with brining the camera into the scene; it seemed difficult to really get involved in the film in some places because the characters seemed distant while better camera use could have brought the audience more into the story instead of making them feel like outsiders. Pacing was another unfortunate drawback of the film. There was often a sense that some events were slow while the action scenes got less time. Not related to pacing, but I did notice consistency issues. Lucy provides one of the characters with a hankerhief, which is later retrived from another character and then by the same character at the end of the film. In principle, the character who presented this at the end should not have had the item anymore. Acting was done well throughout except for a couple of instances involving CGI, including the character who becomes alive again after being turned to stone. Overall, it's a good film for children, and it reminded me of Disney's older children's films. It also reminded me of Lemony Snicket -- I guess it goes to show that children enjoy films where children are in unfortunate circumstances and become the heroes. I hope more films like this continue to get made. It's certainly not a perfect film, but it is not too bad. I give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun film amazing design, let down by some truly horrible special effects.","Just got back from seeing this film and I have to say, overall, I enjoyed it. Some of the imagery was exactly as I imagined it when I read the books, the White Witch and her castle, Mr. Tumnis and the Beavers. It's a very well made film, not sure if Andrew Adamson should direct real people, but this was his first time, so we'll see what he does in the future. As for the design, Weta has again created amazing creatures, armor and weapons and some of the effects are beautiful, such as the Beavers, but, some of the effects are appalling. The wolves, seen better animals on the PS2, Aslan, the one creature who should have been top notch, so-so, no life, no character, too much facial animation...real lions don't have that kind of muscle structure. Next time, go to Weta, ILM just can't cut it anymore. Anyway, no more complaining, fun movie, take the kids. they will love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding - on a visual level,"If you feel uncomfortable at a (very) thinly veiled Christian message then don't see this film or if you do, be prepared to give it a chance. It's standard good overcomes evil fare but lifted by some superb acting. I went determined to leave any cynical preconceptions behind and simply to enjoy it for what it was - a good adventure story. I read the book as a child (9) and loved it, returned to it at 25 and felt put off by what seemed to be the worst sort of mealy-mouthed Christianity. The film hasn't changed my overall impression of the story as a Christian allegory likely to annoy the hell (no pun intended)out of anyone with atheist tendencies. As a confirmed agnostic, several bits did make me cringe inwardly, but I was able to enjoy it as a superb piece of film, rather than anything with a Message. If this is the first of a series, I await the sequels with interest.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
excellent,"The movie was awesome (my best friend likes William Moseley's acting). I really think the movie was really good with the CGI and that the actors and actresses were cast wonderfully. The director and producer did a great job, It was by far the best movie I've seen this year. I would also like to see the other six books in theaters. I'm reading the books and I am enjoying them so far. My friend also loved the movie and she is also looking forward to seeing the the other six books in theaters soon.

"In a nutshell, I would say the movie was...  Just OK'ish.","In a nutshell, I would say the movie was... Just OK'ish. As a huge fan of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Potter"" films, an epic fantasy movie such as this should have blown my socks off, but it just didn't seem to have any heart.The movie starts in World War II England. Four kids are sent out in to the countryside to live away from the main brunt of the German bombing campaign. The children are quite bored, and they decide to play a game of hide and seek. When the youngest attempts to hide in an old wardrobe, she enters a mystic wintry world of Narnia. A land full of half animal, as well as fully animal creatures who can chat it up, as well as cyclops, and other various creatures we expect to find in such tales of fantasy.Tilda Swinton does a quite competent job as the wicked white witch. Well, lets face it, just watching her beautiful face would be enough entertainment to half carry a movie. In fact, all of the acting is quite solid in my opinion. Also, the effects of the show are quite masterful, a job well done by all on that front. Where the movie comes up missing is how it uses all of the wonderful attributes it has. These are wonderful and magical images, yet we never really care that much about either the children or the entire world of Narnia. Sure, they seem nice enough, and the White Witch seems quite evil, but we never seem to get into the characters outside of rather shallow characterizations of good and bad. Its as if Disney tried to make a Lord of the Rings film. They kept all of the imagery and the structure, but they forgot the heart.Now, I must confess. I nave never read the books myself, but even if they also never really let the reader get into the characters, I still blame the film makers, whose job it is to go beyond the source material and make a truly entertaining film for its viewers. I am unsure if the writers and directors were just not competent to this task, or if they truly felt like all they had to do is give us a few funny and cute lines of dialogue for us to understand why these human children decide to risk all to help them, or conversely why all of the ""good"" creatures of Narnia are willing to die in combat under the leadership of some seemingly random humans.Another sadly missed opportunity was the final somewhat anti-climatic battle. While the first half of the movie is unforgivably slow to build towards some action scenes, the war itself involves a good idea of creatures running at each other, but rarely do we get to see any actual combat, or even contact between combatants! My mind was a wonder at the thought of a cheetah, rhino and centaur good guys duping it out with various half bull, cyclops or bat people. But, none of this is actually seen. Instead we get to see a lot of heroic poses and grunts from a multitude of admittedly wonderful looking mythical creatures. But, as I said, without gaining an investment in any of the actual beings we are watching, these poses come off as images some CGI technician thought would look good.The ultimate realization of image over substance and hopefully not a hint of things to come in fantasy film. With that being said, I am sure it will make tons and tons of money considering the marketing megamachinery behind it connecting it to the recently very popular ""Christianity in film"" trend. But, it will never truly take the place of our beloved Lord of the Rings franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical,"I originally was not going to comment on ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" but as I was reading through the reviews one caught my eye that stated the children cast in the movie could not act. That made me click on the ""review"" button. It's quite the opposite - the four children (although I suppose neither Peter nor Susan are a child) fulfill their roles stupendously, especially Lucy and Peter.The film is wonderfully shot. The climatic scene is beautiful and throws you right into the middle of the story line. Perhaps what makes the movie so wonderful is that all ages can enjoy it. The expressions, tones, and actions of the characters make the sometimes difficult English vocabulary self-explanatory and simple to follow while providing enough sophistication to satisfy more mature crowds.Another enchanting aspect of ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is the special effects, which play out like eye candy. All of the amazing creatures looks so realistic that it's hard to believe they could be anything but alive. It's even more fascinating when you think they all came out of the mind of C.S. Lewis. Aslan's animation, for example, is brilliant.Without giving away any of the story line, I will say that it is unlike any other fantasy movie you've ever seen - but don't trust me on it. Go watch it yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Story setting nice but characters did not endear,"Saw the movie preview screening on 6 Dec 2005.Some quick bites:This is a personal view : I never read the book so perhaps the characters would have been more endearing on the silver screen. Kids will probably love this movie but it didn't seem well-tailored for the adults (or perhaps adults who haven't read any of the books before). From the perspective of a clueless viewer such as I myself, I couldn't help but feel nothing of the plight of the foursome (in truth, Lucy was not too bad and was acceptable) and couldn't find much redeeming factors even at the very end. Perhaps with the hindsight of prior reading, I my change my views.CGI's were top-notch especially Aslan who looked uncannily life-like.I've always had a soft spot for fantasy-based movies and this was no exception. It had a fairly solid storyline although I must admit that some scenes could do with more brevity and moved the movie at a quicker pace.Special mention must go to Swinton's portrayal as the White Witch - she was totally in her element, fleshed out her character superbly and was truly a piece of excellent casting by the directors. Though suspiciously a bit like Kate Blanchett in style in LOTR, Swinton played the evil role superbly and was easily the star of this movie.My kids will love it for sure. But just a 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too juvenile for youthful fans.,"Too juvenile for those of us who were fans from our youth. Great for kids 12 and under - great cinematography, but really poor script and acting from a number of the child characters. I found myself sitting in my seat more interested in some of the effects and film shots rather than being enthralled by the story. The script attempted very dumb humor after some very interesting character play in the beginning. The film also, in my view, attempted a very ""Lord of the Rings"" cinema feel; this has been seen in some other movies, attempting to make Peter Jackson's work a style of movie rather than the interpretation of one series that it was. I think I would have rather seen Jackson's take on this movie, but he was too busy directing ""King Kong"", I guess. The movie showed promise, but the lack of such promise was realized when the title ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" was emblazoned across the screen in a branding-type manner. The movie is more about a brand than telling a classic story.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Chronicle of Mediocrity in the Making?,"The Chronicles of Narnia...One of 2005's highly anticipated movies, Narnia chronicles the adventure of four siblings during wartime Britain who stumble through a wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they end up fighting alongside Aslan the Lion against the evil doings of the White Witch.There are two ways of seeing this film, from my perspective. Firstly, let me put it positively. I made a comment to my friend when I came out of the cinema, ""When I came out of the cinema after watching Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone, I was vomiting blood due to watching a complete cinematic disaster. I came out of Narnia thinking, 'ok, not bad.'"" It's not a bad film. But it's not a great film either. There is a certain barrier that Andrew Adamson seem to be unable to lift the film above it. Many of the cinematic sequence are deserving of wows and pows, like the build-up to the final battle, where the eagles soared and the animals charged. The animation of the beavers, and the other animals, were close to perfection.But there was magic missing. Narnia felt very much like a frayed edge of a beautiful portrait. It just wasn't smooth enough, or great enough. It left me wanting more. A good example of the same feeling would be Bryan Singer's first installment of X-Men. The film made me want more, and unsatisfied. But X2 built up from it nicely and turned out to be one of my favorite movies.So perhaps Narnia can build on this film. It's not a bad foundation, and if Harry Potter can slowly improve over the years (Goblet of Fire, the 4th installment, is pretty good), Narnia certainly has a greater potential to do even better.6/10(this show didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thelionthewitchandthewardrobe....,"Chronicles Of Narnia Shane Gannaway One of the most daunting tasks a director can possibly try to tackle, has to be that of a movie that was based on a book. It's not just the regular movie goers he has to please, it's the thousands upon thousands of fans that he also has to satisfy. I can't say whether Andrew Adamson did a quality job of putting the book's magic on charm on to the big screen. I've never read the book. He did put something on there though. And while however beautiful it is, it has its flaws.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, is as a good friend of mine put ""a visual feast."" The movie is amazingly stunning in visuals and CGI. This helps bring some magic to this movie. The animals are amazingly done, looking extremely lifelike. The faun, or as some might know him, Mr. Tumnus is also very well handled. The way they added goats legs onto the second half of James McAvory is flawless. This movie doesn't lack on the visuals. It's got plenty of eye candy and many people probably won't mind watching it muted.If the movie is not muted, then you have to sit through what seems like could have a solid story. Instead you are rushed through an adventure that was seemed to be squeezed into two hours for no apparent reason. The obvious Christian allusions are all still there, but there is a sense of rushed-ness as we fly through this film. There are times when you may watch certain scenes and wonder why they are in the movie at all. Basically, besides the rushed story it's the small things that start to grate. The fact the at a little girl no older then 10 can make a bulls-eye with a knife. The never convincing fake snow that the audience sees so much of. The feeling that Narnia was toned down a little, just for the kiddies. This movie is rated PG, so I don't know what I expected when I went to see it. It is though, a very violent movie. And the only reason it keeps this PG rating is by taking out in what would have been some very gory scenes, all blood. I hate it when this happens. When a movie is toned down, when the artistic value of film is compromised, just for more ticket sales, I get angry. And a kitten dies. It's a horrible thing. Anyway, that's what Narnia does. They tone it down and speed through all the while impressing you with some pretty sights and sounds. Like I said, I haven't read the book. It's my belief though, this book should have been made for the people who first enjoyed it, and not the little kids Disney usually shoots towards.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good.,"Okay I saw this with my mom my sister (who's two) and my best friend. And I LOVED it! This movie seemed very well put together and honestly, it had me thinking the same thoughts as some of the other people who saw this.Okay mostly the thing that got to me was The White witch saying she was queen. I have no clue (or maybe I'm just stupid) why I chose to buy that because I remember reading the book about a few months before this came out and kept thinking she was the ""nice"" person. And to say when I read this, I hated it.The actors were wonderful. Georgie cracks me up on the commentary, Skandar I just love, Anna's like the girl who's the older sister, and Willam is the older brother/boy everyone loves. I have watched the movie with the commentary a few times just to get a good laugh (I am talking about the DVD) I say this movie is wonderful. 10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid children's fantasy epic,"This major theatrical adaptation by Disney of THE LION, THE WITCH and THE WARDROBE is not only faithful to the book, but an entertaining adventure film in its own right. It stands right up there with LORD OF THE RINGS and the HARRY POTTER films. Four siblings are shipped off during wartime to a distant relative in the country, and quickly discover a wardrobe that opens onto an alternate world, called Narnia, populated by talking animals and mythical creatures like griffins, centaurs and mermaids. The ruler of Narnia, a wise and compassionate lion named Aslan and voiced by Liam Neeson, is being challenged by the evil White Witch, played by veteran British actress Tilda Swinton, who may be a new face to many viewers here. After various adventures involving a helpful faun, fox and beaver family, a pack of extremely vicious wolves and Old St. Nick himself, the children join Aslan's army and do battle with the witch and her gruesome minions. The final battle may remind you of the final battle in LORD, but keep in mind LION was written before LORD. The actors playing the children are adorable and believable as siblings, the actors voicing the animals are for the most part OK, the special effects are seamless, and the music works 90 percent of the time. My only real complaint is the night scenes were much too dark, to the point I literally could not see what was going on in some scenes. I wonder what the director could have been thinking. Anyhow, see LION. This big-budget version (there are two previous TV adaptations and a wonderful cartoon) would not exist if it were not for HARRY POTTER, but LION is head and shoulders above the Potter films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant! Absolutely Brilliant!,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has been my favorite book since early childhood. This adaptation is true to the book and brings Narnia to life stunningly! There are very few deviations from Lewis's text - and those that are present simply move the story along more smoothly. Only uber-fans of the book will even notice the slight deviations. (I said, ""Hey, that line isn't quite right..."" It's that level of minor detail changed!)Using technology invented for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the crew of this film created all the amazing characters and events of the book in a most realistic fashion. My husband, Mr. Picky, thought a few of the backgrounds were too CG'ed, but I wasn't even aware of the effects - a sign of a very well-done CG film! The battle scenes were spectacular, and reminiscent of those in Braveheart, though with far less gore. (Note to parents: Be familiar with the book/story before bringing very young children. There be monsters herein, as well as battles and deaths...but nothing too gory. Just know what your kid can take!)I highly recommend this film to any fan of fantasy... Lord of the Rings fans and Harry Potter fans will NOT be disappointed. To Narnia fans, you absolutely MUST SEE THIS FILM! I know we plan to see it a few more times ourselves and we already plan to add this to our DVD collection the minute it comes out! 4 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
LOTR's for the entire family!,"The adaptation of ""Jack"" Lewis' story was extraordinary for a major motion picture. Although a few liberties were taken (like the Fox playing such a big part and no mention of the ""Emperor by the Sea"") all in all it was remarkable.The best thing about the movie, in my opinion, was the fact that it is so good and yet very family friendly. For example: I have a fellow co-worker who took his 5 year old. His son can never sit through a 90 minute movie let alone one as long as LWW. But with 1/2 hour to go he said to his Dad, ""I got to go potty, but I'll wait."" He was that captured by the film. LWW is of that quality... Lord of the Rings excitement but for every member of the family. Don't miss this flick!Here's my synopsis:The acting was very good to excellent. The film visually was stunning. The special effects were very good to excellent. (one or two cgi missteps were noticeable) The Directing was excellent. The adaptation was excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
CS Lewis would have had mixed views of this film,"Cs lewis would have approved of the wartime beginning and period feel and it is a very English film. However he may not have liked some of the departing from the plot, but some of this provided necessary drama. Great performances from Liam Neeson as Aslan and James McAvoy as Tumnus. The White Witch is never really frightening and the children aren't convincing. Seems very like lord of the Rings at times, especially the scenery and battle sequences. A well directed film that doesn't hide the dark side and religious connotations. great for children and some humour for adults. best performance must go to the animated wolf Maugrim, very frightening",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just about average,"I grew up with the Lord of the Rings and the Narnia books. When they first announced the Lord of the Rings movies I just thought they were going to mess it all up, but they didn't. It's about time a real movie adaption of the Narnia books were made, and I can't say I'm too happy about it. I had high (probably too high) expectations. I must agree with all of you that state ''the acting sucked''. I didn't like the actor who played Lucy, and the others did a mediocre job. The story is great, but they didn't capture it too well. Visual effects...Yeah, they are doing their job. The musical score were fulfilling and well made. It's no Gladiator or Star Wars, but it's quite nice. Can't say it fulfilled by hopes of a great Narnia movie, but we can only hope the next will be better. Six stars out of ten.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could be better,"I don't remember much from the book, except that I liked it when I was younger. The movie started very good. I liked the whole beginning with the children in the big house, then Lucy discovering Narnia. That was all beautifully done. I was afraid that the talking animals in Narnia would be annoying and unreal, but they weren't, that was also done really well. But then halfway in the movie, it changed. There is talk about a prophecy and then there is a great battle. But all the time I wondered: what are they fighting for anyway? You don't know anything about Narnia. Apparently there is at least one city, but you don't see it until the end. Where do all these creatures come from? Where do they live? And then the prophecy. Somehow I didn't really know why it had to be fulfilled. They had to defeat the white witch, but what had she done? You don't really get to see anybody suffering under her reign.So my conclusion; The story is built up well, but then really hurries through the end without explaining who and why. It's a shame because it could have been so good.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An excellent movie...for kids.,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, was an excellent movie for children. But for me, it just wasn't worth the hype.That result could be partly my fault, as I went into it expecting Lord of the Rings. The visuals were great, stunning landscapes. However, there wasn't one ounce of blood. Not even a drop. Which made the battle scene unbelievable.Even Aslan, who tells peter to ""Clean your sword"", clean what? There was no blood anywhere.Aside from that element it was a good movie. Not amazing, but not terrible, as I thought it would be. There are no frightening scenes so it should be good for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Narnia -  Very Good, Could It Be Better?","First, the overall rating of the movie is good to very good. Narnia is true to the original story and well done. The production values are good and so is the acting. So there aren't any clinkers to trip up the audience as the story progresses. I do recommend it. I want to make this clear up front before I begin to criticize it since most of my disappointment stems from expectations. I don't expect others to have the same expectations that I had for the film.However, Narnia has been on the horizon for some time, as has been the new Harry Potter film, Goblet of Fire. The difference is that with Potter I already knew what to expect  super design and production values, good to very good acting, and somewhat trying adolescent themes :^). With Narnia there was the hope that it might be entertainment of epic proportion. After all, the story lends itself to that end. It didn't seem to me to achieve that goal.In the inevitable comparison between the Potter film and Narnia, Narnia comes up short. While there are equally stunning scenes in both films, the impact of Narnia is less. It is in the wonderment department that Narnia falls down. Watching the film, one has the thought that director is no Peter Jackson. The action flows, all the elements are there but the magnitude of the impact is not as great. The casting is good and I have no complaint there. The director has a good eye for faces and uses it in his film.I was going to say originally that the film did not have enough inspiration or creativity in it. But upon additional thought it was clear that there is much to admire in the film. A lot of the sets, costumes, and makeup designs are superb. The integration of computer graphics and actors is well nigh seamless. Any inspiration that is missing seems to come in framing the shots or the storyline. In fact, if it was possible to have Jackson re-cut the film, he might make it twice as good. All the elements are there after all. It just seems to progress from event to event in a way that sometimes makes the story plod a bit.It will be interesting to see if Narnia does well and, if it does, where Disney will go with the series. One thing about the Potter franchise is that the films have been consistently good - something that moviegoers know happens but rarely.There is the issue of whether the film is suitable for children. Although the gore is not excessive, there are lots of battle scenes. And the makeup/design of the monsters is quite good, certainly good enough to scare young children. I am guessing 8 and up would probably be fine. Anyone younger and the violence or monsters could be a bit much or the quiet parts may make them fidget rather than stare properly. Children vary, of course, but I saw one Dad with his 3-year-old there. This film is just too much for a child of that age.All of this commentary is from the perspective of someone who has read the books. I know the significance of Aslan to the series and the import of the allegories. I find I can't guess the reactions of people who are not familiar with the series and it will be intriguing to read some of those reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Faithful and Inspiring Fantasy Which Brings Out the Kid in All of Us,"C.S.Lewis died the same day John F. Kennedy was shot, which partly explains why his passing went unnoticed. Known to the academic world as a literary critic and to the religious world as a defender of traditional Christianity, Lewis nonetheless deserves a high rank among literature's great story tellers. Countless children have thrilled to the story of Lucy and Peter and their siblings discovering the magical land of Narnia where it is ""always winter and never Christmas"" by passing through a musty wardrobe while visiting a remote English castle. Now that tale has been cast on the big screen, and what a production it is!The graphics work especially well with the live action stars because any evidence of animation adds to the dream quality of the story. The battle scenes are simply breath-taking and the pending attack by wolves frightening even for adults. This is not a movie for preschoolers but one which ought to be required viewing for every teenager with any interest in literature or the Christian faith.This movie works on so many levels that it is difficult to highlight its successes. The child actors are exceptional and the make-up for imaginary creatures leaves viewers as believers. The scenery from New Zealand, and Czech Republic, and Guatemala, and Los Angeles (oh, I forgot Poland!) suggest someone had a lot of fun tracking down film locations.References to the Blitz and Turkish Delight bring a charming English quality to the film, but it transcends all nationalities. The only reservation one might have is the blending of myth and history in the modern day miracle play (Saint Nicholas is real, as are unicorns and fauns and satyrs, which may raise doubts about the symbolic lion or the reality of the White Witch in real life) yet this is a story about human nature. Edmund is Everyman who blunders his way into betraying an innocent friend of his sister for the sake of sweets. We see innocent and credulous Lucy, the ""daughter of Eve"" in all of us, who hardly doubts for a minute the reality of what her child like faith has revealed to her.Don't miss this show for gorilla!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter The Previous Generation,"The Chronicles Of Narnia was a revelation when it was released in book form, and none more so than The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe, and the transition from book to screen was always going to be a difficult job, and when announced there was tales of people both excited and worried. Thankfully, any worries there was are easily disbanded. It is not a film that would be in the Top 10 movies of all time, but if you want a movie to watch with the Family on a Saturday or Friday night, this is a beautiful movie.The Witch is brilliant, and will easily creep out any young child, while the animations of Aslan are brilliant, with Liam Neeson getting a home-run, as his voice easily replicates the power that Aslan is meant to represent. The children are well chosen, with the uneasy mix of youth, bravery and actual acting ability.A good comparison to The Lord Of The Rings, but will never exceed the Lord Of The Rings, but you can be confidant in the fact that, should you be missing the Lord Of The Rings, you can turn to The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.

An Excellent Movie that I would recommend to anyone,"I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. I have read just the one book in the series, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, so I am not too up on the rest of the stories. My wife really wanted to see this one (she has read all the books) and she wanted to take our son, who is almost five, to see it. He also knows the stories from videos. We tend to trade off on what movies we see: one time it will be my turn (sci-fi, horror, mystery) the next it will be hers (chick-flick, etc).I thought this was an excellent movie, very well made and well acted. The special effects are well above par and I look forward to seeing it again. I will not give anything away regarding what happens, because I hate reading things like that before I go to see a movie. I will say that there are some laugh out loud scenes and some tear jerker scenes.Do yourself a favor, see the movie. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only for fans of the book or for young kids,"This is an alright fantasy film and those versed with the books might find it a lot more entertaining but I didn't find it all that great. The film is geared primarily toward a younger audience and parents who want to have something to see with their brood. Those expecting the epic scope and depth of The Lord of the Rings will be disappointed. Both sagas are fantasies, and both feature dramatic battle scenes, but The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is sanitized. The conflict of armies is sketched rather than developed, and many of the themes are presented in easily digestible chunks. The acting is fine, although lacking in the recognition category. The biggest stars are Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent, neither of whom would be considered a ""household name. Liam Neeson has a sizeable vocal part.

Nice to see a childhood story brought to the big screen,"I read the book almost 15 years ago (for English class) and have forgotten most of the details. However upon watching the movie, i suddenly remember small details which brings back some fond memories of the story.The movie however is simply an above average movie. The acting are good but not great. Tilda Swinton is quite good in a surprisingly limited screen. There simply aren't enough screen time to built char (especially with 4 main chars!!). Why Edmund would betray his siblings is a bit lost if based solely on the movie. Him being bewitched with Turkish delights also is not in the movie, the movie simply shows it as just another 'perk' if Edmund was to bring his brother and sister to the white witch. The CGI is good but not great, maybe because it was too clean to make the PG rating. Its makes the battle looks cartoonish which is a shame.If they had made a longer movie and spent more time developing chars AND put in some blood and gore into the battle, the movie would be much better (ofcourse that would make is less of a kids movie and probably make less money for the studio) Nevertheless the movie is quite enjoyable and worthy to bring a wonderful childhood story book to life.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
catching some Z's,"i don't know if it was just me but did anyone seem to think that this movie was just plain and mediocre. it was so lazy and unimaginative, all of these types of movies just seem to think that throwing a clichéd battle climax in at the end redeems its totally boring 2 hours or so before it.. i fell asleep at the complete mechanical approach to this movie..just what i immediately thought of it, it was about only 30% to Kong.i think it was a bad idea making this after lord of the rings which was over the top enough.its a dime a dozen..just my opinion is all!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
They tried too hard..,"This movie is good, no doubt. But I think they all tried too hard to top Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and other major movies that they just sort of bummed out.The special and visual effects were tried to their limits. You can tell too easily that it's all computerized.The acting could use some work. But for being young and having main parts, the kids did good.The plot was well-done. Close to the book, that's my main thing. I love the books by C.S. Lewis and I was hoping to movies would be just as good. But this one feel short of my expectations. But then again, maybe they're too high.Something that upsets me, is that they are making these movies out of order. They should go along and follow the books in any way they can.At least this movie didn't ruin any of the books. :) Good, but needs improvement.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantasy world that is not so dark and dismal,"I entered the theater a little worried. I began reading CS Lewis when I was 12 and I had already read the first book to my 6 year old daughter so the cat was out of the bag on Christian morality in our world of myths of legends (as well as a good dose of pagan nature worship). But I was unsettled by some of the reports on the news about how the Christian right had been targeted by Disney for this film and that it managed to get a PG rating (putting it somewhere in between ""Because of Win Dixie"" and ""Racing Stripes""). So, I feared that my beloved books would be zealously Chistianized for the sake of the massive Evangelical movement in this country and its many many dollars. To my delight, I found the same wonderful level of Chistian sentiment in the film that are in the books. Nothing offensive (to me at least), no dogma, no lectures, no secret Jesus messages beyond the original ones that Lewis included. And as I breathed a sigh of relief that this wasn't another ""Vegi-Tales"" the film washed over me like a bath of fantasy come to life. The mythical creatures were delightful and the world of Narnia was worth saving. And I loved Lucy (but I never felt much for Peter or Susan, not in the film, not in the books).After having watched The Lord of the Rings many times and even the Harry Potter films way more than I needed to I was beginning to grow weary of the fantasy world that was once wonderful, now a dark and forbidding place filled with evil. Peter Jackson's love affair with Orcs, demons and the Dark Lord is forgivable (because Tolkien was obsessed with it too, although Tolkien also created a Middle Earth that was so beautiful and ancient and amazing that you wanted to go there, to live there, but who would really want to live in Jackson's Middle Earth, full of ghosts and loneliness and decay). But Narnia managed to have the villainy without creating a hopeless world of darkness. Again, it felt like the books. And I didn't miss the blood and the slime that Narnia could have had. For me it was a real success.Now, let's hope that they are quickly shooting the next few books so that they can catch these kids before they get too old.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent movie,"A very satisfying movie. I read the book as a child, read it aloud to my children, and finally went to see it. The movie is a wonderful rendition of the book. The casting is right, the scenery is right, the costumes and dialog are right. The Talking Animals look right and sound right. Nearly all the scenes from the book are there with most of the C.S. Lewis dialog.There has been some talk about the Christian messages buried in the original text. They are still there in the movie, at the same level of intensity as in the original book. The intensity is so low that as a child I never even noticed the messages as I read the book. Rereading it as an adult, the message is plain to see, but not obtrusive. Neither Lewis nor the movie become preachy, it is a good, exciting, and well told action adventure movie. It comes out right in the end. If you liked the book go see it. If you never heard of the book, go see it anyhow.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
LOTR for children,"During World War II, a mother sent her four children inland to ward them off from German bombing. They are sheltered by an elderly professor who lives in a castle. Playing hide-and-seek around the house, the children, through a seemingly ordinary wardrobe, reach the magical land of Narnia, ruled by an evil witch. They soon discover that they are destined to defeat the witch with the help of various mythological and fairy-tale creatures and free Narnia from slavery and eternal winter.""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is the first film in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" trilogy, based on the novels of C. S. Lewis. The story is something between a classic fairy tale and epic fiction similar to Tolkien's, but simplified and more appropriate for children, with an obvious but unobtrusive religious subtext (Aslan/Jesus).The similarities with ""The Lord of the Rings"" are not accidental, because the author C. S. Lewis was a friend of Tolkien and both were members of the same literary club, where they were exchanging ideas. For that reason, the comparison with Jackson's films is inevitably self-imposed during the viewing, and in relation to ""LOTR"", this (and more or less everything else in the genre) seems pathetic. I think that ""Narnia"" would leave a much stronger impression if it was filmed before ""LOTR"". Now it seems like a step backwards.The four children-actors performed their roles quite satisfactorily, especially considering that this was the first, or at least the first serious role for everyone, except Anna Popplewell. Most likable is then ten-year-old Georgie Henley, whose many scenes are extremely convincing because she didn't actually act them, but they put her into the scenes without prior preparation, in order to get her natural reactions.Among the more famous names are Jim Broadbent and James McAvoy, and the undisputed star of the film is the magnificent Tilda Swinton in the role of the main villain, the White Witch.In addition to the above, a large part of the film falls on imaginative and very beautifully done CGI characters from fairy tales and mythologies, and the landscapes of New Zealand are a real feast for the eyes. If it was directed by Del Toro, to whom it was originally offered, this would probably be a much more impressive film experience.However, the goal was to make a family film for an audience that includes the youngest ones, and that, with honorable exceptions, as a rule, is to the detriment of us adults. My ten-year-old kid loved it. A strong seven from me.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An excellent film,"All I can say is wow. This movie impressed me beyond my comprehension. Now don't get me wrong, I knew it would be good, but I sure didn't expect it to be exquisite. I went in the theater without knowing a thing about the movie. I had never seen a preview, never read the book, never heard anything about the story, and from the moment the adventure began, I felt just as engrossed as the main characters were. One thing that scared me is all the hype. A lot of times, hype scares me. I mean, everyone was talking about it, putting it up on a pedestal, so I expected mediocrity to be honest, but after seeing it, I felt more satisfied than I ever have about a movie.The musical score, although not as epic as Lord of The Rings or Star Wars, felt very appropriate. I had never heard of the composer before, and it was a bit of a shocker that Disney chose to use him (Stephen Barton) over a few of their usuals (Klaus Badelt or Brian Benison) I have never read a book by C.S. Lewis, but I definitely caught the references to Christianity in the movie. It was so apparent that even non-Christians that are familiar with the bible in the least bit would pick up on them. I have heard a lot of people claim that Lewis was a Christian, hence the reason there are so many, subtle, and non-subtle references. This film was the first since Lord of the Rings, which grabbed me and took me through the adventure, and immersed me in the world of Narnia. The computer generated graphics, in my opinion, are equal to that of Lord of the Rings, if not better. One main difference from, which I feel appropriate to cite, is the fact that this feels more like a fairy-tale than the Lord of the Ringstrilogy. That definitely isn't a bad thing though. Liam Neeson voiced one of the characters, which added so much to the movie. And for the first time in a long time, a movie almost caused me to cry. It's not necessarily because there are sad parts, but when you get so engrossed, and feel like you are there, it almost makes you emotional. Very, very impressive.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's no lord of the ring, but it's nice to look at.","I seem to remember an OLD cartoon that did the story more justice than this film. In fact--and I'm not usually one to say this--the book is way better than the film. But for those without a vivid imagination, the CG is (or was at the time) the best. <--(period) I understand how a film like Lord of the Rings had to remove some extraneous areas even at 3 hours, but The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe isn't nearly long enough to warrant the omitted movie content.In any case, it's worth watching if you like the book. It's worth watching if you didn't like the book. It's worth watching if you've never heard of any of the books. And it's worth watching again because it's so beautiful. I give it only 7 out of 10 because I was disappointed that the story that I loved wasn't fully realized (IMO).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"See the previews, all you need","The effects were real spotty. I'm sure most of us are familiar with this story from our childhoods and it's a simplistic one. I know that I went to see how this well known story was transcribed to film. Truthfully, it's hard to sit through 2.5 hours of the story unless there's some darn good eye-candy to go with your tub of popcorn.The green-screening or whatever it was was awful. Seriously, you know those old movies where someone is driving and it's obvious that the passing scenery was projected on the background -- this level of ""wizardry"" showed up numerous times. I was deeply disappointed by that -- It felt like Disney resurrected the Snowball Express (circa 1972) special effects team.See the previews -- they are indeed great ... but then you've seen it all and there is no need to see the flick itself.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The idea of the story is interesting because it is talking about a story of another world. The small girl had found a new world behind the wardrobe and told her brother and sister to go play. I think their acting is very good because a child like 5 to 13 years old could act like that. Their special effects are very good because they could make a lot of animals look real. Their effect for the ice melting and breaking also makes it very good.

The movie wasn't very entertaining all the way till the battle which occurs near the end.But as I said earlier the visual effects were superb!

The One movie to see in theater,"I usually do not take the time to write reviews for films. I have not liked one for long time. So I went to the theater with the following expectations: Yes the graphics will be great. However, I had low expectations for the acting and plot. I had no clue what will the directing, music, sound effects, and picture will be like. I believe my expectations were clearly justifiable since I have read the book, I have seen the BBC version, and we all know about the deficiencies of remakes. The following were my impressions after I have seen the movie: I loved the Movie. It exceeded all my expectations. The acting was excellent; then I realized that Aslan's voice was performed by Liam Neelsen. How can you go wrong with that? The children actors in the BBC version were very good. They raised the bar for any remake. But the actors in this movie were excellent, especially Lucy and Edmond. The Music is fabulous and the picture is one of the best. The battle scenes are beautiful and the graphics are wonderful. The supporting actors are all good. I was very surprised that the movie was very faithful to the book. The author plot and intention was the heart of the movie. I really thought that C.S. Lewis was actually the director. One more observation, the movie was so entertaining and every scene was so beautiful, I left that movie hoping for the second and the third part.I watched lot of movies and if there is one I recommend you see in the theater for the last one year, it is this one. It is one movie which teens will love, children will adore, parents will adore, and Single Adults will want to watch again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing!,"I have never read the books and I never really knew anything about them either. In October, I saw the play at the Children's Theater, and I fell in love with this amazing story. So, when I saw the previews for the movie, I got really excited. Then, I finally saw it, and I was awestruck. It was AMAZING! The acting, the script, the effects, the overall mood of the movie was breathtaking. I, being an inspiring filmmaker actually got chills as the world of Narnia unraveled itself before my eyes. I knew as I was watching this movie, that I wanted to create the same effect for audiences. This movie is simply magical. Yes, it's a little childish, and yes it resembles some Lord of the Rings themes, but don't go into the movie thinking about those things. If you sit back in that seat and just watch the film, you will be flung into a magical and mythical world from which you will never want to leave. I wanted so bad to be inside of Narnia...I wanted to talk to Aslan...I wanted to fight the White Witch. In the end, that's what movies should do. They should make us WANT. They should make us WANT to be some part of the world that had been created for us. They should make us WANT to help the characters or in some cases hurt them. They should make us WANT to experience the film not just watch it. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe makes me WANT to do all of those things, and most of all it makes me WANT to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe greatest weakness lies in the lack of tension throughout the projection, but it is a good adaptation","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe had a budget of US $ 180 million and raised more than four times that amount at the box office around the world. Although it was the first of seven books to be published, in 1950, it is curious to choose to be the first to be adapted for cinema, since it is, according to the chronological order of the fictional events determined by the author after the completion of the whole plot, the second. It was followed by The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (also the second to be filmed in 2008) the following year, and so it continued with a new release each year, until 1956, with The Last Battle. However, it was in 1955, with The Magician's Nephew, that Lewis explains how it all started by examining the origin of the magical world of Narnia.This adaptation, written in eight hands, by Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and director Andrew Adamson himself is practically a transposition of the book into images for the big screen. There are practically no adaptations of the story in the feature film. Unlike The Lord of the Rings, by JRR Tolkien - friend of Lewis -, in which characters were cut while others had their story time extended, in Narnia each frame has its equivalent paragraph on paper, resulting in an incredible adventure through distant lands, divine and magical in a parallel and proper time in the middle of the Second World War that plagued the real world in the middle of the 20th century, a time when the stories were written by CS Lewis, in works with great purity, full of messages and meanings and with a lot of adventure, giving millions of readers around the world the right to dream and hope for a better world.Against the film weighs the fact that Andrew Adamson neglects the interpretations. Experienced unidimensional by their young actors (the only one that stands out - and yet, for her charisma - is little Georgie Henley, who resembles Drew Barrymore in the time of ET), the four heroes embody rigidly defined types: there is the serious brother who considers himself responsible for the safety of others; the teenager who always tries to act with common sense and adopts a maternal attitude towards the younger ones; the challenger, who, disgusted by his father's death, assumes an aggressive behavior; and the charming youngest who sees everything with eyes full of magic. They are, therefore, characters clearly created to perform specific functions throughout the plot - and the interactions between the brothers (particularly between Peter and Edmund) sound artificial, as mere narrative conventions: they must fight so that the eventual reconciliation is used as expected closure of history. The supporting cast works very well in the film with great performances by James McAvoy as the kind and friendly Lord Tumnus, Tilda Swinton being threatening and charismatic with the White Witch and the imposing and dramatic Liam Neeson as Aslam.This predictability of the script, however, is not the main misconception of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, whose greatest weakness lies in the lack of tension throughout the projection. From the beginning, when we see the Nazi squadron flying over London, the film takes on a harmless atmosphere that keeps the viewer safe that nothing bad will happen - and the fact that it is aimed at children does not justify this harmless atmosphere: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was produced for the children of the 1930s, much more innocent than ours, but it created an authentic, palpable tension. In fact, even the White Witch of this film pales in front of the Evil Witch of that animation, since she has her power shaken by the simple presence of the four children in Narnia (winter begins to subside as soon as the Pevensies step into that world). And even the battle scenes fail to make us fear for the safety of the heroes, who just seem to be playing warriors, aware that no one will hurt them seriously.There are interesting elements in The Chronicles of Narnia: it is curious, for example, to see how children escape one war only to fall into another; and the film is subtle in showing the look that Peter gives British soldiers, revealing his discomfort at not being able to fight for his homeland (something he will do only in Narnia). On the other hand, it is inexplicable to realize that the White Witch, instead of getting rid of her fiercest enemies, just immobilizes them, as if she wants to see them return to harm her in a more delicate moment. And when Peter asks General Otmin if he is on his side, the answer ('Until death') provokes curiosity; after all, what did the boy do to deserve such devotion? In fact, a similar doubt arises when a certain character is killed by the villain: in addition to not feeling the impact of that sacrifice, we still find the suffering of the two figures who cry over his body strange: why are they so dismayed if they didn't even know him so well?Andrew Adamson, the same as Shrek (2001) and his sequel, Shrek 2 (2004), delivers his training as a visual effects specialist by showing greater concern for the visual than for the film's narrative: visual effects, for example, are impressive (digital animals are impeccable) and the art direction is big enough for a production of this size. The final battle is a great example of this. The myriad of races in combat is eye-catching. Rhinos, centaurs, griffins, orcs, hyenas, leopards, faunas, giants, vampires and even a couple of beavers, among hundreds of other species, face each other wildly. All without a drop of blood, of course. After all, it is a film for children. But the action there is sufficiently exciting and courageous. Everything happens in daylight, under a beautiful sun, without fear of opening up computer graphics. On the other hand, Donald McAlpine's photograph ends up reminding too much of Peter Jackson's trilogy, especially in the sequence in which we see the army of villains manufacturing their armaments. And if the choreographies of the fights between thugs and good guys sound unconvincing (there are many poses for little action, as you can see in the duel between the Witch and Peter), the Harry Gregson-Williams soundtrack sins for excess from the beginning, when the children run away from the housekeeper to the sound of a disproportionately tense and grandiose song - and if the soundtrack exaggerates so early, imagine where it comes from afterwards (I can't remember a moment of the film that is not accompanied by the Gregson-Williams orchestra).The film, as well as the book series, is known for having several Christian parallels (sacrifice, the danger of sins, the greatest force capable of changing the course of things, the ideal of repentance ...) perfectly match the Disney formula of making cinema. Many will realize this, as the values and acts practiced by Aslan are similar to those of Christ. In sacrificing himself in place of Edmund Pevensie to free him from death, the parallel resembles Jesus' sacrifice on Calvary (showing his humiliation before death) to free human beings from eternal death. He also resurrects as well as Jesus, in addition to the fact that the White Witch represents the figure of the devil and the wolves represent the demons. Also mentioned is the fact that Aslam is the son of the Emperor-of-Beyond-the-Sea, who would be the Father of the Holy Trinity. Children can be seen as Jesus' disciples and, of course, Edmund as Judas Iscariot, the traitor, and King Peter as Peter himself. The two girls are also the first to see Aslam resurrected, as well as in the biblical narrative. It is the pure reference of good against evil and the Bible, which gives us lessons in friendship, fraternity, courage, trust, forgiveness, and above all, love.Much longer than the ideal with its 140 minutes of duration, this first part of The Chronicles of Narnia is tiring and nothing involving. And although it may seem like an irrelevant complaint, I confess that I was not comfortable seeing Santa Claus giving weapons to the four children (including the youngest!), Claiming that these were not ""toys, but instruments"". We know that the world has just reached a new and frightening degree of cynicism and hopelessness when even Santa Claus starts distributing weapons to his little fans.The main problem of the film is that the action is very direct, objective, without many nuances. It is a film made for children, focusing on children under ten. To enjoy it better, it is recommended a low degree of demand in relation to the plot and be content to marvel at a really impressive look. But, for those who are used to sagas like Harry Potter - or the aforementioned The Lord of the Rings - it is almost impossible to contain the disappointment. And even though he won an Oscar (Best Makeup) and has won two sequels so far, one wonders how long his producers will have the breath to continue with this investment, because at least until now the world of Narnia on the big screen has not awakened the same interest obtained by the books.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great film,"I have never read the book at all, so was completely unaware of the plot line etc. However, I was captivated by the story and the production itself. I thought all the cast acted superbly from youngest to the old professor. I liked the adventure, the humour and the scale of it. Great film, no wonder it is doing great business. I thought the young actors really seemed like a family, with typical sibling rivalries and interaction. THis was a great help in believing that Edmund would go off with the White Witch, having been annoyed by his brother especially. I loved the beavers humour, that gentle ribbing of one spouse to another. I thought the production design was great, with that medieval look to the tents, the armour etc. The terror of Aslan's sacrifice and death was a surprise and I though it was well handled. I am looking forward to the making of Prince Caspian - and I might get around to reading the books - or will that spoil my enjoyment of the next film - a good question!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pretty good, minus the Passion of the Lion.","The Chronicles of Narnia - Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis. Four London children are sent to a professor (Jim Broadbent)s country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch (Tilda Swinton). To defeat the Witch, they must join forces with Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), the lion God of Narnia, and the great battle between good and evil.Good things first. The film is well directed for the most part, though it could've been made more touching. It, in the wake of numerous Harry Potter films, Lord of the Rings, and a slew of mediocre epic wanna-bes, manages to keep the ideas of magic and grand scale battles interesting. The music and locales offer a different sort of character and charm from other movies. Swinton is drippingly evil as the Witch. Though she looks like Galadrial without eyebrows and dilated pupils, her character is radically different and deserves appreciation. The children are all earnest and cute and British, though they all have some points where I just wanted to reach into the screen and slap one or two of them. There are some adorable critters in the mix of everything. I loved the adorable little Beavers (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French, one of my beloved British actresses) and the Fox (voiced by the charming Rupert Everett). Liam Neeson voices Aslan (Why is he always typecast as mentor figures?) with earnestly and authority. The final battle is pleasing to the eyes and the adrenaline of all, and manages to be satisfying in spite of it's PG rating. (On a minor note, why are all these experienced warriors so willing to be commanded by a couple of teen boys? Silly.)Now on to the mediocre stuff. I found myself grimacing at the absurdity and spectacle of the sacrificing of Aslan. Really, what the hell is this? The Passion of the Lion? Disney already killed a Lion in one of their films, and they did it better that way. I haven't read the books, but I don't care if it IS in the book. The scene is just silly. I get the allegory. On the third hour the mice nibbled at the Lion's ropes, and he became alive again. Dumb. Another thing that concerns me, for a film that takes place during World War II and strives to show us the importance of sacrifice, Narnia is pretty lenient on letting ANYONE die unless they're bad. Good people don't die. And that's where the boys are separated from the men, and Lord of the Rings is placed a notch (well. several notches) above Narnia. War involves sacrifice. It involves pain, and Narnia glides over that like it's the glacier lake. Oh, and having a scene that shows Santa giving a 6 year old girl a dagger is just plain wrong. Excellent to take a child to, and alright for everyone else, Narnia gets a B.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A decent start; I have high hopes!,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode, is a decent start to the Chronicles of Narnia movie franchise. I was sufficiently entertained that I will watch it again when it comes out on DVD, and I am looking forward to the next Narnia movie! This movie falls short of excellent because it tries too hard, and the strain shows. The film-makers were in the unfortunate position of having to convince the studio execs at Disney and Walden Media that they could do a good job making The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode. The problem is, I am not a studio exec. I want an excellent movie, regardless of how much money it might make.There are only a few changes made from the book. They shortened up the timeframe a little, showed things that are only hinted at in the book, and increased the tension and drama in a few scenes. None of these changes were bad decisions, but many of them weren't integrated into the plot very well. Rather than feeling the added tension and drama, all I was thinking about was that the screenwriters had made these changes purely to try to make the story better. On a micro level, the movie delivered excellent individual scenes and characters, but the elements didn't quite connect together to make a great movie.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode hits one of it's most emotional notes before it even gets to Narnia. The movie opens with warplanes bombing the city of London, England, terrorizing its inhabitants. Fearing for the safety of the children, the citizens of England have implemented a program whereby children are sent out of the city to live where they will be safer. This dramatic scene introduces us to the four Pevensie children, played by four superb young actors.In spite of great source material and a very handsome budget, the quality of the acting is the main strength of this movie. The children's performances are so very sincere and whole-hearted that I didn't even think about what an excellent job they were doing until after the movie was over. Peter is the perfect older brother left in charge: not quite sure of himself as a leader because of his youth and inexperience, but absolutely determined to follow in his father's footsteps and do his best to keep his younger brother and sisters safe. Edmund is the surly younger brother, chafing under Peter's authority and trying desperately to validate his own worth. Susan is the older sister, mothering the two younger ones the best a 15-year-old can, and cute Lucy, so adorable, yet brave and adventurous, is the youngest, for whom any one of her brothers and sisters (except perhaps Edmund) would lay down their life in an instant.Another excellent performance is put on by the actress playing the White Witch/Queen of Narnia. When I saw previews for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode, I wasn't sure if I would like the way the White Witch was played. I thought she looked too much like an actress in glamorous make-up. But the full realization of her character, in the context of the movie, was completely satisfied convincing.The Witch's general, a minotaur, and her captain of police, a wolf, were developed into more complete and satisfying characters than in the book. There is an added scene between Peter and the wolf captain that makes their second, climactic meeting more meaningful because of the relationship the two enemies have developed.There was a lot of talk on internet discussion boards to the effect of ""they'd better do a good job with Aslan's character."" As with the rest of the movie, Aslan is good, but not excellent. He looks like a real lion, he is majestic and interacts with live actors well, but he doesn't feel quite as alive as he should. If he were a human actor, I would say that his make-up and costume are excellent, and his voice is good, but he's just not that great an actor. I applaud the film-maker's efforts though, and with this experience, I am sure they will do a better job with Prince Caspian.Andrew Adamson and his fellow film-makers have showcased an impressive array of talent in making The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode; now if they can learn to work together a little more fluidly, and the studios give them the opportunity, the big screen future is very bright for The Chronicles of Narnia.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Wrong Director, The Wrong Producer","I watched the movie twice, first at a multiplex and next at a economic single screen theatre. May be I didn't notice how good the movie was the first time, but no,I found more faults and wished Peter'King Kong' Jackson had directed the film. Were it were not for the 10 minute war sequence, Narnia would have been one of the major disappointments of 2005. Especiallly when the plan is to bring out six more movies.Irrespective of the box- office collections it garnered, Narnia is below par . Andrew Adamson doesn't get the characterization right. It takes a while for Aslan to appear, and therefore, not much time remains for the character of the king and not a mere jungle lion to encompass the audience. When Aslan and the White Witch go inside a tent for a meeting , there is an awkardness, as we see a Lion and not Aslan. Similar thoughts occur in the war sequence, the children would be believably dead than so unbelievably skilled to fight war. A little bit of practice and they are ready to battle! Unfortunately Disney hasbagged the rights for the movies, as a result there will be no blood where blood should be, and mild violence. The dilemma for the producerswas the question of doing away with the christain influences of the story or retain it. The result is a ambiguous reference to religion. The father Christmas scene is a drag and could have been crisp. It seems a scene out of a TV series. The air - raids, and the following scenes, in the opening sequence, takes up precious time of story teling. It is a while before all the children walk through the wardrobe. When they do, screen time is running out for the other characters to come. The final scenes of the crowning and "" Long Live"" cries is again awkward, and unintentionally ironic. Although Narnia... like the Harry Potter series, will be popular, but not everlasting cinema. Prince Caspian(2008), the next movie in the sequel, is been directed by Adamson again, hope he realises where he went wrong last time. Of course there is always Shrek.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent!,"I loved this movie from the first scene to the very last frame! It was such a true, loving, serious recreation of the wonderful book with THE MOST AMAZING VISUAL EFFECTS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! Aslan the Lion is quite possible the most amazing visual effect I have ever seen (although I have not seen Kong yet) but he was so realistic and emotive, I completely believed he was a living, breathing, feeling being. Not to mention that the overall look of the film is gorgeous and the action and peril is so well done! The kids do a great job for the most part, especially the youngest girl, who steals the show. There is something in this movie for everyone. Go see this movie! You will be entertained and amazed no matter how old/young you are!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautifully done, a wonderful adaptation sure to please!","This movie is a beautiful retelling of the original story, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" which was my favorite childhood book. Of course there are some slight omissions and additions, but it stays true to the book for the most part. Rupert Everett's fox character was my favorite addition. I do love Liam Neeson as Aslan but personally, I think he could have made Aslan stronger and less subdued. Tilda Swinton is fabulous and believable as the White Witch. She is beautiful and yet does a terrific job of invoking fear as well. The children were wonderfully casted but Susan's character could have been a bit less whiny. Father Christmas was perfectly portrayed. I cried, I laughed and wanted to see more. Remember to stay in the theater to watch the credits! Hopefully, there will be more movies in this series to come and I do hope they win some Oscars. A perfect holiday movie to bring your children to!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most disappointed,"First of all i was quite looking forward to seeing this movie. I read the book as a child and once again not so long ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Watching the movie was a complete different experience. For the movie I was not expecting to see any kind of standard of what Lord Of The Rings offered but at least something that looked more convincing than what this movie actually offered.The visual effects in my opinion were what really let the film down. I thought they were appalling for a film of this scale. I do not think any of the creature effects looked effective enough to make them believable, you could tell they were animated, likewise in many films these days. In this movie I thought i was watching a pixar animated film in certain scenes. I'm very surprised the effects were nominated for an academy award. I thought the outstanding visual effects for Star Wars - Revenge Of The Sith were strongly overlooked in this category.Apart from that i did not feel that the characters of the movie were portrayed in a way in which you cared for them or not. Reading the book was a complete opposite. I just wasn't that bothered when watching the movie.What i did like about the film was the art direction, the design of the queen's lair was impressive and the look of Narnia itself looked good but that was about it for me.A lot of people may disagree with this review but i strongly feel that this movie could have been made a lot better considering the budget that was available. Lets see what happens with the next movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emotional,"Please do not confuse reviews from people who haven't read the book with ones from people who have.Those who have read the book are more emotionally attached. I cried several times through this movie - MUCH improved on the late 80's version. Powerful, emotional, TRUE to the book except for a few stray bits.I was thoroughly impressed. The visions I saw on the screen were very similar to those in my head as I was reading the book. The use of colors was wonderful, and the battle scenes were outstanding. I thought the CGI effects with the animals was very believable.Thank you for giving me a chance to see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I don't get it, why do people like this movie??","I watched this movie expecting something awesome; I was hoping for a cool combo of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, instead I got a long and tedious corny cheesy movie, full of ugly bad acting kid actors, a dumb story, horrible script, and OK visuals.I was trying to figure out if this movie was a kids movie or grown up movie, it definitely isn't for both. It is too long to be a kids movie, and too cheesy and corny to be a grown up movie. There are way too many tears in this movie, and sobby music, which really gets to you eventually. Some of the lines are so cliché that you will already know how a whole conversation will go the second it is started.Tilda Swinton does a pretty good job acting, and James McAvoy for the short time he's in the movie, and thats as far as it goes for good acting on the part of actors in the movie; the rest of the acting is accomplished by the voice actors like Liam Neeson and Ray Winstone.The only actual good part of the movie was the end. It did have some pretty cool action scenes and graphics, as well as a little twist in the last minute.Overall I didn't regret watching this movie, but if you're into fairytale type fantasy movies, some better alternatives are The Golden Compass, obviously Lord of the Rings and obviously Harry Potter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much hype.,"When I first heard about a film based on the books by C.S. Lewis, I was hoping something as good as LOTR by Tolkien. Those two ere good friends and thus maybe the films about their books would be in the same category of great movies. Not by a long shot The setup and imagery of the film are very good. Loads of well detailed places that can leave you in awe. The castle of the witch is nicely detailed and I thought the wolf guards were well done.However, the flow of everything else is lukewarm. The characters of the children are OK, but they are missing with those outside the children. Nor does the film explain a lot about the children, at least not in the beginning.Plus, the fights and battles certainly don't inspire much out of a person who loved LOTR. Instead, they were disappointing and mildly funny in a bad way.Overall, this is average. And for so much hype, that is not good. ""C""",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe","The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The With And The Wardrobe is based on the novel of the same name by C.S. Lewis. The film takes place in England during World War 2 and is about four siblings. There names are Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. To keep them safe from the war they are sent away to live with a professor. One day while playing in the big house Lucy discovers that if you enter the wardrobe you will enter a winter land called Narnia. Her siblings do not believe her, but finally they look for themselves and see that Lucy was not lying. The siblings make friends with the local creatures who tell them that the land is cursed by the evil witch Jadis who has cursed the land to always be winter time. The animals protect the siblings from Jadis and they are introduced to a lion named Aslan who shows them that they are the only ones who will be able to save Narnia from the evil queen. The end results in a battle between good and evil and the fate of Narnia rests on their shoulders. The film has good direction, good performances by the entire cast, good cinematography, good art direction and good set decoration. The film started out really promising and I thought I would quite like it, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I thought the film was well made and it is a good looking film, but mainly I had trouble with the film's pacing. As I mentioned before, when the film started out I found it quite interesting, but as it went along I felt it dragged and soon it became slower and slower to the point where I was getting bored with the film. I feel that if perhaps the film had been trimmed and edited a little better that this may not be the case. I felt the end (especially the battle scenes) just went on for far too long and I just lost my interest. The book that this film is based on is quite popular and I'm sure that many people will really enjoy this film. I say this because I' am personally very picky when it comes to adventure/fantasy films. Really popular films such as The Lord Of The Rings just do not interest me and I think that this is a film that falls in the same category. I 'am sure that many adventure and fantasy film fans will enjoy this movie and me not really being a fan of the genre will stick with my opinion that I did not like it. However I do feel that I could have liked this movie with a little better pacing and editing. But as it stands I can appreciate the direction and the way the film looks, but other than that this film was just not for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I expected a childish story from C.S.Lewis,"OK, I didn't read the book and I didn't see the 1988 TV adaptation. Shame on me! However, I did watch this film and I was averagely impressed by it.First of all, the special effects. There are not so many, but they are subtle. The movie has a lot of animals and they all look like animals (for the first time ever) and there are some clever computer light manipulation and actor physiognomy mapping to make it seem natural.The story. It is a children's tale. Don't expect much from it. It doesn't explain things and it has a lot of ""lucky strikes"" typical of a story that is not meant to scare or excite, but to make a point. It has children that fate has put in a very important position and they are more or less forced to act it out, learning a lot about themselves, family and building character. It has a lot of inconsistencies and it fails to keep you into the tale. I found myself shouting ""Use the bloody bottle! Shoot the damn bow already!"", though, so I guess it all depends on how far you are willing to go.The actors. Tilda Swinton again plays a powerful creature with mental issues. She does it well. Actually, the movie would have been bad without her. It does make sense in a movie with four or more main positive characters and only one villain. The children... are OK. The big sister is terribly annoying, but maybe that's just me. The others in the cast are either animals (like the beavers from the Milka commercials :) ) or have secondary parts.The conclusion: a book intended to be a Christian allegory for little children is transformed into a movie. The audience is little Christian children. There isn't much else to be said. Maybe even old Arabs will enjoy it as long as they understand it is a simple tale with lots of inspirational music.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A  Great  film  for  the  whole  family,"I saw this movie as an animated children's program about 20 years ago, so I knew the storyline pretty well. This version was brilliantly done, and the special effects really brought the original story to life. The acting was top draw, and the casting of Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was spot on, It was if the character was made for her. Filmed in New Zealand with spectacular scenery this movie was a real visual pleasure. Ray Winston and Dawn French were brilliant as the voices for Mr and Mrs Beaver, with Winstones cockney charm a delight for cinema goers. James Macavoy was splendid as the faun Mr Tumnus he really captured the essence of the character. And Liam Neeson was the perfect choice as the voice for Aslan.The children were all very good and convincing in the parts they played. Especially little Lucy who was a real little cu-tie and perfect for the part. THE LION WITCH AND THE WARDROBE Is a Children's classic and this movie does it credit, an excellent movie I would recommend to everybody who enjoyed their childhood.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Faithful to all who venture into Narnia,"When I had first heard that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" would be hitting theaters, I practically shouted with glee. It had been about seven or eight years since I had read all the books, and the upcoming film persuaded me that now was a good time to revisit the land of Narnia, which I encourage all to do (it takes a steady-paced reader only three to five hours to finish the book).I had anticipated that the movie was going to add its own bits and pieces here and there, since the book is not so heavily detailed on the actions of its characters (the emotions and feelings, however, C.S. Lewis delves into particularly). I was correct in assuming so, but I believe the additions to the movie were very effective from the cinematic storytelling standpoint, the only scene that seemed a bit far-fetched being the melting ice river. Overall, the movie is a faithful representation of what the book is, which is what I had hoped to see upon watching it.Though apprehension comes with knowing the movie will star four child actors, the children did exceptionally well with their roles. They were not perfect by any means, but their overall performance was crafted very well. The voice acting was superb, and even though I always seemed to imagine Aslan's voice as a much deeper, booming voice, Liam Neeson delivered well and stuck on to me after a few moments.The computer generated effects were mostly outstanding. Yes, the battle scene was definitely not as glamorous as Lord of the Rings, but the size of the battle in Narnia was just right; ultimately, much of it was left to the imagination of the director and screenwriters, since C.S. Lewis covers it only briefly. What they did come up with fit well into the scheme of the film.I believe that the film is best viewed right after having read the book. Though many movies based off books have failed miserably in the past, today's slew of movies is being helped greatly with modern technology and the fantasy genre in particular (a la LOTR and Harry Potter) benefits well from it. Narnia has now reached its time for the same conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Favorite movie,This is an amazing film! It was an interesting movie because at the part of Lucy finding out the wardrobe made me want to know about what is going to happen later. This is a powerful movie. Since the beginning it made it interesting and I was hooked by the author that makes the movie. It makes me so proud that Lucy found out the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Four children in the movie also face lots of difficulties and hard times. I like this movie because it looks very realistic. I also like the part when Lucy walks into the wardrobe and is surprised. I would recommend more people to watch this movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just Not Interesting,"This horrid adaptation of C.S. Lewis' classic tale is a bland, cookie-cutter modern fantasy flick that makes shameless attempts to cash in on both Christian religious dogma and horrifyingly average special effects at every turn.The British TV versions from the '80s and early '90s were almost *infinitely* better. Here, Edmund is more than a self-absorbed brat; he's also a coward. And the White Witch is not scary-- she looks like she escaped from a very, *very* cheap porn film. And then there's Mr. Tumnus, who, here, comes across as some kind of creepy pedophile (hey, the White Witch does, too!). Not to mention the fact that Liam Neeson (while a great actor) is *no* suitable Aslan.Then there are the battle scenes-- oh wow. These scenes make Rob Zombie flicks look like cinema deluxe! Throw in some poor character animation and even more *dismal* performances and you've got yourself one insipidly *hideous* film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia - magic comes true!,"I just went back from the movie. It was so crowded...just like Star Wars EP3. The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe novels were my favorite when I was in elementary school. I remembered after reading all the series of novels, I wondered why there was no one making movies (not mini TV program) for Narnia. Until now, thanks for ILM and WETA's cooperation. At last, the magic comes true! The director Andrew Adamson and all other creative crews visualize the story in novels. Basically, I think the adaption of this movie from the novel is excellent. Such as the white witch, she is just like what was in my mind while I was reading the novel. I think most readers will not be disappointed. I find it is a Disney movie and it is for kids; thus there is no blood and much violence in this movie. (Unlike the lord of the ring trilogy, it is basically for adults and it is quite violent and bloody, but Istill love it, and it is very realistic) I think I can say it is ""the lord of the ring - kid edition"". The movie score composed by Harry Gregson-Williams is great and touching. Special effects and Visual effects are extraordinary. They are quite realistic. Most of the sequences are just like what they were in my mind while I was a child. After seeing it, I was moved. Finally, this classical stories are on the wild screen just like the lord of the ring, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and so on. I heard most other people saying that they love this movie when leaving the theater. I do really look forward to the next Narnia movies! Go see it! No matter you have read the novels or not.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent attempt but must try harder,"I came to The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe with some trepidation as I adore the BBC series that was done some years ago and did not think it could easily be topped by simply introducing some CGI. I was right.However, in it's defence, it was better than I was led to believe it would be by other peoples responses to it. I think that if I had come to it fresh or just from reading the book I would have got on with it a bit better.One of the main problems I had with the film was the children themselves. Now I always found Peter and Susan vaguely annoying in the book/TV series for being too 'goody-goody' so I wasn't surprised at my dislike for them. But Edmund had always been my favourite character by far and I found him detestable in this. And not simply in the way you are supposed as he is a traitor etc because, as I said, I liked his character in the book. Lucy I found a little too wide-eyed and vacant but she grew on me throughout the film. I think I just found her a little too young for the role, it made it a little unbelievable.Now to the other characters. Good job with the beavers, they were spot on. Mr Tumnus seems to have been transformed from a likable if initially misguided character into a creepy slightly paedophilic figure which disturbed me somewhat. The wolves I found too 'cute', nowhere near as scary as in the TV series (yes, OK, they were more realistic (especially since some real!) but not terrifying like they should be). Dwarfs, ghouls, fawns etc all OK, didn't stand out as particularly good or bad.Tilda Swinton spot on as the white witch. Could not have thought of anyone better to cast in this role. She always has a menacing, slightly psychotic air which is perfect. Not convinced on Liam Neeson as Aslan, I thought a deeper, more authoritative voice would have been better but I got used to it.Now I don't know how long the TV series was but this film felt far too condensed  it's a long time since I read the book but I got the feeling there was a lot missing, I just can't quite place what.I also disliked the battle scenes, they seem to have fallen into the CGI trap of 'lets show what we can do and how impressive it can be' rather than showing specific parts of the battle with key characters in detail. There was a little bit of close-up but nowhere near enough to show the true intensity of a battle.One thing I did like is that I found that they kept the whole Christian thing quite low key (I know others didn't think this from the posts on the message boards but I did). I never spotted this in the books as a child and when I learnt it as an adult it disappointed me greatly as I am not Christian and do not agree with Christianity. It ruined the books for me to a degree when I thought back over them and I thought they did a good job stopping it from taking over the film.Here's hoping they manage to improve on what they've done so far and make Prince Caspian better  hopefully the children will have grown into their roles more improving that side and I'm praying (excuse the irony!) that they avoid the 'just throw CGI at them' approach for the battles.Overall, well worth watching if you haven't seen the TV series, otherwise you may want to avoid if that lies close to your heart!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Childs Feast of Imagination.,"This wonderful movie will do for the Children of today what Star Wars did for a whole generation of kids back in the 70's. If you're an Adult, then Narnia could disappoint.Primarily a Children's movie, this is not to be forgotten, that the story is based on the Children's classic: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, taken from the series of books The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis.Transcending a storyline from a children's book into film doesn't seem that hard a task, concerning Narnia. Grown ups will love it all the same, but Children will be Astounded by it. The Magical Land that is Narnia will have them riveted to their seats in a Spellbound Wonder. Imaginations will be set lose and the desire of involvement shall be justifiably Magical.On leaving the cinema, my wife and I, thought it a very good movie. The only negative criticism was that to the end of the movie, it was just a movie for Children, which we expected and knew.This is no Lord of the Rings by any means. Standing proudly on it's own two feet, this very easy plot and what seems to be very simple character development is all to familiar with Children's adaptation's. For us, the movie started to wane a little after the crossing of the iced river.The introduction of the characters, along with Lucy and her Kin was done very well, practically the humour of the Beavers, where have I seen ""that"" relationship before? Very funny, and will Children understand it, I wonder. They will, eventually. This is our point, after the snow had settled there was hardly any kind of stimulation, for us anyway. It continued onward on one level, even the battle scene was fair but harmless. I would not expect a bloody feast, as I have said before this is no Tolkien. This movie brings Children to the Fantasy and Magical Splendour that is C.S. Lewis. Both very Individual in their own right and both with exceptionally Intelligent writing Minds.The young actress Georgie Henley was truly amazing, where did they find her? Please don't say Ilkley, West Yorkshire, England. It's a rhetorical question. Another Child star to look out for, as with other Child Actresses of her age, such as Shirley Temple, Dakota Fanning and the then young lady born in Jerusalem, Israel, Natalie Portman for example.Well-done young Lady.I hope that this movie will delight and entertain the young and the new generation of Cinema-goers, to be kick started by a movie that is visually captivating will be a memory to behold. You have to start somewhere, for me it was Star Wars. So lets hope that C.S. Lewis's work on the Big Screen will stir their growing imaginations, as his books will always do.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Always Winter But Never Christmas,"As a child, I was never a great lover of C. S. Lewis's ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". The books were always too preachy in tone for my liking, and if there was one thing that was guaranteed to kill a book stone dead for me it was the suspicion that the adult world were using it to put forward some morally improving message. My suspicions were confirmed when a classmate of mine, a boy whose great ambition, even at the age of ten, was to be Archbishop of Canterbury when he grew up, explained to me that the whole series was essentially one long extended Christian allegory. (And yes, he probably did use the word ""allegory"" even at that tender age).I have never been tempted to revisit the books in adult life, so was surprised that I enjoyed the film version of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" so much. The story opens in London during the Second World War. Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, are evacuated during the Blitz to a large house in the countryside, owned by an eccentric professor. While playing hide-and-seek one day they discover a wardrobe which acts as a gateway into the fantasy land of Narnia. Once there, they get caught up in a power-struggle between Aslan the Lion and Jadis, the evil White Witch. White witches, of course, are normally portrayed as being on the side of good, as opposed to the evil black witches, but in the case of Jadis the adjective relates not to her moral character but to her love of dressing in that colour and to the fact that under her rule Narnia is an icy wilderness, a land ""where it is always winter but never Christmas"".From what I can recall, the film follows Lewis's plot fairly closely, so for those who like that sort of thing the religious symbolism is still there. Aslan clearly represents Christ and Jadis the Devil. There are parallels to the Fall of Man, with a bowl of Turkish Delight standing in for the apple, and to the Crucifixion and Resurrection. This symbolism is, however, applied lightly enough to enable the film to be enjoyed as a family fantasy adventure rather than as a beginner's guide to the Christian religion. Lewis was a colleague and close friend of J R R Tolkien, so it is perhaps appropriate that ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has something in common with Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which was also shot in New Zealand, especially during the battle scenes near the end. It is, however, somewhat lighter in tone than Jackson's mighty epic.On the acting side, the one really outstanding contribution comes from an icily seductive Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Aslan comes across as a bit one-dimensional, noble and heroic and not much else, but that is less the fault of Liam Neeson, who provided the voice, as of Lewis, who wrote him like that.Lewis's mythology was essentially a hodge-podge of various other mythologies, especially Greek, so the film features such creatures as fauns, centaurs, griffins, minotaurs, dwarfs and various talking beasts, and the computer-generated imagery is able to bring all of these vividly to life. One thing which did not strike me as a child was just how surreal Lewis's world can be, possibly because surrealism was not a concept with which I was really acquainted at the age of ten. This is, however, something brought out in the film version, particularly in the early scenes where the children enter that eerie snow-covered world, a world where Victorian lamp-posts mysteriously sprout in the middle of a dense coniferous forest, where rather camp fauns invite you back to their homes for tea and cakes and where beavers talk with cockney accents and eat fish-and-chips. Who could fail to enjoy a world like that? Perhaps Lewis, the staid, conservative, devoutly religious Oxford don, had more in common with Salvador Dali than he might have liked to admit. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable and true to the original stories with a few exceptions,"I enjoyed the film a lot but for me there were two glaring weaknesses. The first was the way Aslan was portrayed. There was very little of the glory and majesty of the Aslan of C.S. Lewis' books. This is a major weakness, although perhaps one that never can be conquered on film. It was for this reason that Lewis himself was vehemently opposed to the stories being filmed. The second weakness was not so important but still disturbed me. The first time Lucy sees the wardrobe it stands out as being something special. Although this may be along the lines of other fantasy films, it is not in keeping with what Lewis wanted to portray. The wardrobe was a perfectly normal wardrobe with no magical qualities whatsoever.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unique, enthralling, and beautifully realized.","There is much I could say in praise of this movie, but I won't repeat what others have already said.One of its best features, for viewers of all ages, is that it doesn't condescend to children. Charming as it was, SHREK -- from the same director -- did not expect children to handle much beyond a few familiar fairy-tale staples. THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE immerses them in a world wholly different from anything an American child knows: WWII England; the clothes, settings, and language of the place and time; Turkish delight, centaurs, even the ""wardrobe"" (which today would be called an armoire) and its mothballs. Many filmmakers wouldn't have touched this tale unless they could transpose it into contemporary America and either change or explain its alien elements. They wouldn't trust children to ""get it.""But, to children, all the world is new. They are ready, nay, delighted to enter into a wondrous, magical world and take it on its own terms. What they don't understand doesn't matter. What matters is wonder. The creators of this film trust their audience. The result is more thrilling than any dumb-downed, words-of-one-syllable version would have been.And the film is beautifully imagined. Most of us probably don't appreciate what it takes to adapt such a richly envisioned world to film: what to cut out and how to fill in what the author didn't describe. This movie succeeds remarkably. Its Narnia is true to C.S. Lewis and should be equally enthralling to viewers who have never heard of either.If the idea of cheetahs, minotaurs, children in medieval armor, and other unlikely creatures rushing together into high-stakes battle intrigues you -- if you've never grown too old for wonder -- this movie is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Four Go To Narnia...,"I enjoy classic children's literature almost as much as the grown-up stuff and have read C S Lewis' full Chronicles of Narnia, although not for many years. Still, did this latest blockbuster adaptation thrill me as the book did...certainly it did.The story is initially quite slow-paced, obviously laying out the children's characters and attempting to individualise their traits for the viewer until Lucy accidentally backs into Narnia and things as would expect pick up from there. It's a pity that the movie was made in the wake of the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord Of The Rings"" series, where little people / children also encounter magic, talking animals and have to face up and face down the forces of evil in a foreign land, so that some of the scenes and situations seem a little second-hand to viewers, like me, of the others.So maybe, with their lack of familiarity, that's why the four children here seem a little stiff an strange in their attitudes, whilst remembering all the time that kids were very different and had different outlooks 70 odd years ago. The acting of the children is perfectly acceptable but I just didn't feel they any of them made a lasting impression in at least this viewer's memory, with the possible exception of the young girl playing Lucy.As you would expect, the anonymity of the children in the leads is compensated, like in Potter, by having big-name British character actors in the more substantial supporting roles. These include a quite scrawny looking Tilda Swinton as the wicked witch, the dependable Jim Broadbent as the aged, knowing owner of the house which contains the magic wardrobe and, rather oddly, young hot-shot James McAvoy as the impish faun Mr Tumnus who darts in and out of the story.The special effects are very good on the whole in the scenic depiction of Narnia and its inhabitants bar one or two obvious matte background shots and the C-Gen grand battle at the end is convincingly done if perhaps not up to Peter Jackson standards. That's a great weapon old Tilda has, by the way! All the talking animals are well rendered too both in movement and of course speech synchronisation.As I said above, it's a shame that the Narnia adaptation didn't get green-lighted before Potter as I think there's better story-telling afoot here but this big-budget feature has managed to spawn, if belatedly, to date two successors. Let's hope all seven get made, none of the books certainly are long enough, if memory serves, to be split into two, or three come to that.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Important film from an important book,"Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task, but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently, Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, Adamson's ""Narnia"" wasn't quite up to snuff.I count myself among those who cherish ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" having read them as a child and having re-read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion, this film adaptation not only falls short, but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.Here are the general categories (including some specific examples) where I felt the film didn't deliver: Screen Adaptation - Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or cliché. Example: The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. (It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund - we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice!) Also, in the book, the mere mention of the name ""Aslan"" for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost, as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a ""fantasy"" movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch: in the book, the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. (They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Blast from my past.,"Thought the movie was excellent. I read the books in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade and thought they were fun reads back then. Before I saw this movie, I had wished this movie would have been made/released when I was younger, so I might appreciate it more. Turns out it didn't matter. I had a great time and really thought the movie was worth the 7 bucks I dropped on it. I recommend it to anyone that has the smallest bit of imagination.Take your kid, friend, girlfriend; all will enjoy the movie.I can't wait for Prince Caspian. No doubt, more will be released based on the success of Lion, Witch, Wardrobe.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' a triumph - a faithful adaptation of a true classic.,"Congratulations to Andrew Adamson and his entire cast and crew! 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a marvellous film, managing to be that rare thing - a movie which remains faithful to the book, realising the story with wonderful visuals and imbuing the film with real spirit.Based on children's books, the movie is a children's movie, (albeit fairly scary in parts!) yet all the story elements remain in place, with no dumbing down and little of the added sentimentality which so often chokes children's movies into cloying sweetness.The sets and scenery are magical, the children very well cast, the White Witch chillingly evil, and the animals and creatures which populate Narnia imaginatively rendered, including the majestic Aslan. Adamson has injected a sense of humour and a fresh look into an extremely well done adaptation, and created a film which will thrill both devoted fans and those new to Narnia.Loved it!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not a bad movie, but not amazing either.","I suppose I allowed myself to build too much anticipation for this film. I believed it would be as good a movie as I had seen all year. Well, it wasn't. That's not to say it was bad, per se, but there was nothing truly excellent in this film save the effects. As an adaptation from a novel, the film is, for the most part, very faithful. There are only a couple of changes made that I had a problem with, and these were tiny and did not distract. But at the end of the day, this film is just average. This review isn't all doom and gloom, there are some nice positives. As I stated earlier, the effects are top notch and I don't ever remember explicitly recognizing them. There is a lot of very funny humor. Tilda Swinton is magnificent as Jadis, the White Witch. And parents should not be afraid of taking smaller children to see it as the film is not scary or bloody to any great degree. Go see it, it will entertain mildly....just don't expect to be blown away.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding Book Adaptation,"Children's fantasy is a most difficult genre to adapt for the screen, because the agendas of book and screen are so different. Fantasy allows such swift and non-rational changes that capturing it on a movie screen is much more difficult than painting the pictures in your head with words.Even with all the nice trailers, hype and good reviews, I went to see this with no small amount of trepidation. I first read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe about 40 years ago, and I've probably read it more than a dozen times since then. I was afraid that no amount of skillful CGI could make a convincing Aslan. More than that, I was afraid of a Disney-fied movie that washed out the messages in the movie, or included propaganda for various causes.I was wrong. This film succeeds in bringing Narnia to life beyond my wildest expectations. Aslan is believable, as is the witch.Most wonderful of all, however, is what they have done with the plot: almost nothing. There are quite a few changes in things for flow, but not a single one significantly affects the the story. No wonder, with a member of the Lewis family watching over every word and every scene. (I'm sure there will be ""purists"" who will scream because the beavers look like real beavers instead of furry people who wear clothes, who object to other little things as well, but who nevertheless missed the movie.) I can't judge how someone who has never read the Narnia books would read it, because they are written too deeply into my soul to set aside. I think those who had not read the books would nevertheless love the movie, but I cannot be sure. If you have read the books and wondered if the movie is up to the books, wonder no more.It is possibly the best book adaptation I have ever seen. The Lord of the Rings was an excellent adaptation, but it took a lot of liberties with the characters and plot. I think, on the whole, the adaptations were good, but there were several places in that most excellent trilogy where the characterization changes bothered me. Not so here.These are indeed the beloved characters and story from the book.Don't miss this film. Go see it in the theatres, if you can.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally bringing the magic alive,"Every now and again you come across a film that is so beautiful that you just don't want it to end. Even in a fully-seated cinema, you forget that you are there with people. The screen swallows you, the story engulfs you, and the whole film's sole purpose seems to be to tell you, and only you, a story.I recently had one of those experiences when following the Pevensie siblings on their journey through Narnia, in the form of the 2005 release of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.There is no doubt in my mind: taking on the magic of C.S. Lewis is beyond the mental capabilities of most directors. When it was announced that the director of the Witch and the Wardrobe had not made any ""real"" feature-length films before, I dreaded the results deeply. How would the maker of Shrek and Shrek 2 translate his skills into transmogrifying one of my favourite childhood memories?I should not have feared.The Chronicles of Narnia is a film that couldn't have been made 10 years ago - it relies so heavily on special effects and digital tricks that even attempting to make it without all the digital trickery would have resulted in a B-movie, regardless of its budget. With his experience as the special effects guy on several of the Batman films, Director and producer Andrew Adamson did manage to put together one hell of a display.With all the visual do-goodery in place, and one of the best stories ever told to drive it forward, there wasn't a lot to make the Witch and the Wardrobe fail... And of course, it didn't. Striding from strength to strength, effortlessly combining the magical with the mythical, the impossible with the improbable, and the beautiful with the gorgeous, this was 2 hours that couldn't possibly have been filled with more heartwarming surprises.I'm not the kind of person who cries often, and especially not on films, yet this film had my eyes welling over half a dozen times - that's how beautiful it is.After I came out of the cinema, I ended up texting an old friend of mine. Her response summarised the film and how I feel about it better than anything else could have: ""There's always a Narnia somewhere"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Was Peter Jackson to busy to make this film?,"Awful dreck. I read the books as a kid and I really wanted to like this movie. But, I am sorry to say that I have been disappointed by the film makers.Whoever told these folks they had a good script for this movie? That person should lose their job immediately. It is CS Lewis, for God's sake, how on earth could they mess this up? The story of Narnia is rich, fulfilling and extremely gripping and entertaining. Mr. Lewis wrote a marvelous tale of fantasy and adventure that surely any trained professional screen writer could adapt into a marvelous movie.Not so the case here. This movie was full of boring clichés, idiotic dialogue, boring scenes of nothing, then too fast scenes where actions take place so fast you can not be sure exactly what is happening and why.These people should have studied The Lord of the Ring films. I mean for the cost of a weekend rental they could have had an epic movie making seminar and maybe they would not have ended up with this mess of a film that is right now playing in the background on my lap top.Writing this review is more entertaining than this watching movie.What is up with the acting in this movie? Seriously, not a good performance among the cast is to be had. Everyone seems as bored as I am right now. I just could care less about any of the main characters. Honestly.I will say the one thing I was impressed with was the lion. Good special effect. But that is it. The actor doing the voice of Aslan sounds like he is reading a long menu and can't decide what he wants to order.Well, watch it if you must. But you should read the books. As I said, they are fun, exciting, well imagined and written.I hope someone who knows how to make a great epic adventure film comes along and has a go at Narnia. And dear lord I hope these film makers have no plans to continue the series. They should all be fired.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"With Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia Is Adventure-Lite.","Four children walk through a wardrobe and discover a land of mystery and enchantment. After the youngest learns that her friend from the land of Narnia has been kidnapped, she pleads for her brothers and sister to help rescue him. Once meeting the creatures that live in Narnia the siblings soon discover that they are some kind of prophecy written heroes. The Kings and Queens of Narnia that are said to rid the Witch of her evil reign with the help of Aslan, the lion.Narnia seemed like the perfect film of the year that had adventure, excitement, and fantasy all rolled into one entertaining film. Based on the books, which are loved by millions, Narnia had a huge step to overcome in pleasing it's devoted fans. It's too bad that in a world with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia is adventure-lite. It's scope seems bigger then what it's reality is. Even when judging it against another book turned film, Series of Unfortunate Events, Narnia seems to be lagging behind in last place.To begin with, the children are not likable at all. The little one who is suppose to be cute is annoying, the younger brother is a pain in the ass, the older sister has too little screen time to make any kind of connection, while the oldest is just too dumb. Not to mention that all the actors playing them were annoying to listen to. Other then the main characters, who we are stuck with no matter what. The supporting cast, the witch, the Faun and the deep and perfect voice of Aslan, Liam Neeson make up, a little bit, for what the children actors lack.Nothing really exciting happen in the film. When you have a fantasy film such as this, that promises an adventure, you would expect something a little bit more then what the result is. It takes thirty some odd minutes for all the children to finally get into Narnia, after that they encounter a beaver and learn what the place is and who they supposedly are. After a quick run in with some wolves, and the younger brother in the hands of the witch, nothing else happens, save for the final battle. The kids are safe in their ""terrirtory"" where the heroes of the film train for the final battle. Then the final battle occurs, which is something right out of a card game Magic: The Gathering.There's not too much of an emotional attachment to any of the characters, so when one is near death, we can't seem to care. This installment is a weak first entry to something that could be a successful series. Narnia does contain beautiful images, ranging from snowy mountain tops, to green valleys. It's a beautiful film, with great special effects, costume designs and set pieces. They have created a wonderful world where these creatures live in. Go into Narnia expecting a wild adventurous time, then you will be disappointed. Hoping to expect to see a massive battle scene, skip it, it can't hold a candle to anything that Jackson served us. See this, for beautiful images or if you're a fan of the material, whether you will be satisfied or not is up for debate, as I've never read the books.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great movie, lived to expectation","i gotta be quite honest , i went to this movie fearing the worse , after all this story is my all time favorite, i guess i read it 10 times and i was fearing that it will be done as bad as King Kong, but boy was i wrong. the movie was not a masterpiece but it did show all the depth of the story , it times it moved slowly but the pace was reasonable , and i didn't need to check my watch at any point in the movie, the first time since i watched hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. the directing was amazing although the graphics seemed cartonish at times expected due to the HUGE amount of graphics that needs to be generated. the director did well by making the movie less violent than the original story to make it more suitable for kids. the only pick on that movie is that it was made for people who have actually read the story, anyone who haven't would struggle to catch up at some points or just end up feeling it's a lame kids movie, but for people like me who loved the story the movie was absolutely sensational. if you love the lion the witch and the wardrobe go to the move and you will not be disappointed that's my advice. it certainly was some sort of a refund after the huge KING KONG size disappointment in KING KONG. i will certainly go see this movie again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good adaptation...not enough depth,"i read the book (and was obsessed with it for many months) when i was 5 years old and have to commend the director for staying true to the original story.where adamson fails is in his attempt to create an epic film. you could tell that he tried - using cinematographic elements you'd see in true epics like the lord of the rings (sweeping vistas, dramatic music, etc). he unfortunately did not succeed in this attempt.with so many characters and so little time one never really gets an opportunity to really know any of the protagonists which left me lacking a strong connection to any of the good guys. we spent a lot of time with the white witch, though, and she is by far my favourite character.in a truly epic film most, if not all, of the actors need to do a stunning job. in narnia, quality varied from actor to actor. the performances of the actors playing the four sibling protagonists are mediocre at best. tilda swinton (the white witch) and james mcavoy (mr. tumnus) are notably good performances. then again, the fabulous tilda swinton gets to play an evil bitch...? what better role could there be for her? i've read many comments about the special effects/cgi and how great it is. and it is indeed so on all the main characters (the beavers, the lion). i found the work on some of the more fantastical creatures to be lacking, however. the best example of this is with the general of the white witch's army. a few times it looked like they were using live actors in second-rate costumes instead of high quality cgi.finally, the book is loved by kids and grownups worldwide but, because of some violent content, the movie is most certainly not meant for young children. so you've got a movie that doesn't have the substance/depth to appease adults but isn't suitable for children either. while it's mainstream and religious appeal will likely make this movie a commercial success, from a creative/artistic perspective it's clearly stuck in a strange twilight zone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie!,"I really loved this movie! I saw it just today and it was simply outstanding. Though it wasn't like the book a lot, it was really great! From music, to acting, this movie is a must watch for LOTR fans! There were a few problems though: 1-it was a kind of fast movie 2-adding some more sequence and time to it, would not hurt 3-the acting could have been more better (but considering it was the children's first movie, that's okay) all in all this is a must see movie! Aslan's voice was done by Liam Neeson, and that's a good thing because everything matched so perfectly well together. And as the movie starts on, you sit at the edge of your seat, dying to know what happens.(that's because it's way different from the book, and I knew I sat at the edge of my chair!)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining and generally worth the watch,"Having not read the book, I cannot comment on how true to it this motion picture version is. Being that The Chronicles Of Narnia are regarded as literature classics much in the same esteem as The Lord Of The Rings and such like, I would estimate that there have been some changes to the narrative as it didn't grip me as much as The Lord Of The Rings did and thus as much as I was expecting.With regards to this, I found how Edmund's initial betrayal of his brothers and sisters a little inconceivable. I was expecting it to transpire that he was brain washed or under some spell from the Witch. Alas in the film, this wasn't the case and the motives for his treachery weren't revealed, save from the fact that he was picked on by his brothers and sisters and the promise of Turkish Delights.Many of the interactive dialogue sequences between the 4 children became noticeably unnatural on several occasions. Party aided by some slightly wooden acting, if I may be so bold as to suggest. If these lines are true to the book, it would seem that C.S. Lewis didn't have a knack for inventing natural interaction of siblings. But that is perhaps for me to find out should I ever read the book from which this film is based.How 4 children can blossom into swash buckling heroes, willing to lay down their lives and become rulers of a land they know little about, disregarding their home world and origins in the space of a few days (as the time line is not established) was also a little difficult to comprehend, even in a fantasy setting.But none the less, I am not going to harp on about the things that a feel were bad about this film as the vast majority of it was excellent. It is very entertaining boasting fantastic performances from Tilda Swinton portraying the Evil White Witch and Georgie Henley as a very adorable Lucy. The video and audio effects are incredible and the battle scene is very intense and reminiscent of the Pelennor fields battle from The Return Of The King though no way as gruesome.I enjoyed it very much and recommend it for anyone that has a pallet for fantasy movies and stories.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best screen adaptation of a novel yet,"I recently purchased the unabridged Chronicles of Narnia and began reading them to re-familiarize myself with a tale I hadn't heard in well over 20 years.I eagerly read through to the end of 3rd book (A Horse and His Boy), and reviewed The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe before going to watch the movie tonight.I was absolutely amazed at how accurate and visually descriptive the movie was of the book. There was almost nothing left out of the movie from the book, and only a very little added. Except for the embellishment of a couple action scenes (which were extremely well done and very well gouged to the Narnian world), most additions were only to keep the pace quick enough to keep the average movie watcher interested.The only problem I had with the screen version, occurs at the very end, but its only a slight omission of what amounts to one paragraph in the book, (I was hoping the movie might have detailed this point). Maybe the sequels will add fill in more gaps later ;-).10 Stars all the way!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"As someone who did not read the book(s) and had low expectations, this was fairly well.","Some parts of the movie were pretty much what I expected, Fantasy for kids. But especially towards the end it gets pretty 'epic' at times, even for adults.Other big Fantasy franchises like 'Harry Potter' or 'Lord Of The Rings' come to mind as comparison and after watching the first 'Chronicles Of Narnia', it feels like the little cousin of these. Can it keep up with them? Partially it can, but not in whole. I still do sense potential here.The CGI is believable and good. Liam Neeson as Aslan - I can live with that. Tilda Swinton as White Witch was a pleasant surprise. Child actors were mostly good.All in all, this movie is better than I expected it to be. Not everything was perfect, but it was inspiring enough to be good and shows potential for the prequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ugh,"As a child, my Narnia books were treasured above all others. I lovingly read them cover to cover over and over and over again. My excitement at learning that ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" was being made into a feature length film was only surpassed by my disappointment upon seeing it. This poorly acted (except for Georgie Henley) rendition of one of my childhood favourites was so chalk full of preachy goodness and disgustingly saccharine sentimentality that my teeth ached by the end of the film. I give it 3 stars out of 10 only for the character of Lucy and the White Witch, the rest is pablum and badly (mostly) done cgi.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Its not a bore but sometimes we have to skip scenes,I watched the movie because it was a classic. The plot was good but the movie would be perfect if it was a little short. In some scenes nothing special was happening so I skipped them. They tried to add humor in the film but they failed. The acting was great. The ending battle was good. Some scenes were emotional but I'm not a fan of emotional movies that's why I don't find the movie that much entertaining. Its a good movie but again its too long. The scenes in Narnia were gorgeous. I would especially point out the white witch's acting. It was outstanding. Everyone has their own opinions.OVERALL IT WAS JUST GOOD.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Works...,"Slightly better than i though it would be, but still rather forgettable. I think this film works really well as long as it doesn't try to be epic. The relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumbus. (and isn't that a cozy home he has, quite like imagined) also pproved. The relationship between the kids has its moments, approved too, especially as long as they are in England (the two younger kids being much more likable then Susan and Peter). And Narnia as longs as its swept with snow. Badgers. White Witch. Definitely approved. Now, the second half doesn't suck or anything. But it doesn't really sparkle with creativity. Where is that special realionship between Asland and the girls? And Where is the lions sense of humour? Does everything have to be so squeaky clean in a Disney film and wasn't that battle corny? It works. But not much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantasy,"Harry's fault once again, I guess. It seems the shadow of the Potter movies are as big for this one as it can get. While a fun movie, that you can watch with the whole family (spoofs aside), it seems pretty ridiculous too, if you think about it. But then again it is for the younger ones, isn't it?It is a kiddie tale after all, so try and watch it with youthful eyes (or a kid by your side). It will be a different experience. Especially if it's not watched cynically. That can be fun too of course, but you can do that the second time around, can't you?

I did not read book but was told it holds true to Lewis' vision!! The children all English and unknown to me provided great acting!!! All I know is I would be willing to pay to see it again!! I feel the animals provide a great mixture of realization. There are plenty of sly quips.

The animals were very well done. It's hard to tell at times that the animals are not real. You can see where all the money went.I didn't think the final battle was all that great. It was just a lot of animals, whom were not central characters,running at each other. It was so generic; you've seen that type of battle numerous times in adventure films.FINAL VERDICT: It's a fun adventure.

four kids that started out in one world ended up in another.,"In this movie there were four main characters named Susan, Lucy, Peter, and Edmund- they were all brothers and sisters. In the beginning their mother sent them to live with a professor and his wife so that when the war was going on in their original town, they wouldn't get hurt and would all be safe. The setting of this movie took place in the professor's house until Lucy went through a wardrobe and ended up in a whole different world. I thought that this was a good movie, because it kept you really interested. In some parts you just didn't know what was going to happen next. The characters were played well, and it was a very easy movie to keep up with; at all parts you knew what was going on. In some parts of the movie you could easily predict what was going to happen next, but there was only a few that were like that. I think that the book was good also, but if I had a choice of reading the book or watching the movie, I would probably read the book. This is because the book kind of gives you a lot more detail, and there are more parts that where said or done that wasn't said or done in the movie. The book was good, because in the book you couldn't really predict what was going to happen; in the movie you could predict.

Should Have Been 2 Films Really,"Whilst you can get a lot of complaints about a film running too slowly and nothing really happening, this isn't one of them.Things almost happen too quickly, there is always something happening, which unfortunately detracts from the film. There is no real time to establish all of the detail from the book and translate it effectively into a screen play.Having said that, the characters were acted well, the effects were spectacular and the appeal is universal.I would love to have seen this as 2 films, concentrating more on the characters essential to this book and the upcoming chronicles.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful,"I expected a lovely, lavish children's movie along the same lines as Harry Potter with huge chunks likely to be omitted. Once I started watching I just no longer cared. The acting was absolutely fantastic and Tilda Swinton was an absolute joy to watch. I cried, I laughed, I admired the courage of Peter. The little girl who played Lucy was a pleasure to watch.For those unaware of CS Lewis's masterpieces, this is the second book of seven ""Chronicles of Narnia"", about the four Pevensie children who accidentally stumble across the Land of Narnia and a tense situation between Aslan (voiced wonderfully by Liam Neeson) and the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).The Christian Allegory so many press articles seem to be picking up on is there and very blatant. But so what? What I saw was a fantastic retelling of CS Lewis's book and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The two and a half hours just flew by and I wished it could have been longer but no doubt the fidgeting children would have been a nuisance.

"""If it's a war Aslan wants, it's a war he shall get."" - White Witch","There really couldn't have been a worse time for 'The Chronicles of Narnia ' to be released in theaters in my opinion. It was released right on the tale of the much more elaborate 'King Kong' which will no doubt beat the hell out of it with box-office numbers. I really didn't know what to expect from 'Chronicles of Narnia'. In my mind it could have either been a really great action-packed, visually stunning film or it could have been a childish sappy-as-hell flop. Well, my thoughts after leaving the movie theater playing 'Chronicles of Narnia' were somewhere in between, but closer to the positive. 'Chronicles of Narnia' has real excellent special effects and action, but in a way the film takes itself way too seriously. There are parts so sappy they make you feel almost embarrassed to be in the theater, but there are parts so amazing from a visual effects stance that you can't take your eyes away from the screen. Although there are parts of 'Narnia' I didn't really get into it, I enjoyed it for the most part.'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' takes place during WWII. Four children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skander Keyes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley), are transported out of England to safety to live with their Uncle the professor (Academy Award Winner Jim Broadbent - Iris). While staying with their Uncle, the kids discover a passage way to another ice-covered fantasy world (Narnia) in a old wardrobe closet. In the land the it is up to the four to save the good guys led by a gigantic, fierce yet wise and lovable lion, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) from the evil White Witch who calls herself the Queen (Tilda Swinton - The War Zone, Broken Flowers). The film also features a lovable beaver who helps the kids (voiced by Ray Winstone - The War Zone, Sexy Beast), Father Christmas or Santa Claus who also helps the kids (James Cosmo - Trainspotting) and Mr. Tumnus, a half-man/half-goat (played by James McAvory).Like I had mentioned previously the action and effects in Narnia are amazing to say the least, but the story kind of drags. I felt in my heart that the beloved children's story could have been adapted to film better script-wise. The acting is kind of a mixed bags. The adult actors are all fantastic - Jim Broadbent, Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson, Ray Winstone and James McAvory, but the kids kind of split. Skander Keyes and Georgie Henley are the two-standouts of the kids who both give great performances, while the two older kids William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are to put it nicely ""less impressive"". Andrew Adamson's direction is surprisingly very good, with a lot of neat camera tricks and cinematography.If you are into the action / fantasy films I can recommend 'Chronicles of Narnia', but only after you've seen the modern-day masterpiece King Kong (also in theaters). 'Narnia' is a film to take the little ones to and I don't find anything wrong with it that wouldn't be appropriate for kids 5 and up.

"crispy on the outside, raw on the inside, typical, Disney trash.","The acting for the most part is green. The dialog is poorly executed and the chick who plays the Evil White Queen of Narnia (tm) appeared to be acting in a smaller movie than she thought she was acting in. The effects are... hmm... decent... but not as well done as they were hyped and the epic battle scene was rather cliché. Though, it is Disney and I can almost understand why there would be a conscious decision to pull out some of the intensity for the sake of the children.Overall, I'd say that this is a case of crispy on the outside, raw on the inside, typical, Disney trash. And now that I have lowered your expectation, hopefully you can enjoy it more than I did.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pretty Cool, Needs more Centaurs, though","This was a pretty awesome movie. They definitely should have put more Centaurs in it, though. It was cool to see a centaur fight a minotaur, but that was just at the big battle at the end. The whole movie should have been centaurs and minotaurs fighting. Centaurs are way cooler than little English kids. The lion, Azzlan, he was cool. The goat boy, portrayed by Justin Timberlake, was okay. The Ice Queen lady should take a shower, and use Pert Plus. This just proves that White Women with dreads are evil. Anyway, lots of ""blahhh"" stuff in this movie, with a few incredible fight scenes and tons of cool centaurs. ""King Kong"" is about 40,000 times better, so go see that instead. Then, after you've seen Kong, and you're bored, go see this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My opinion,"Most people already know the story so I won't recap. All I really want to say is that I have waited 25 years for this movie.. and I was not disappointed! If anything my dreams were exceeded. The casting was incredible, there is nothing about any of the characters that I would change. The scenery was fabulous. The special effects were great. I was worried about the use of so many CGI characters but at no point did I feel that they caused any distraction and their implementation was perfect (IMHO) I am a big enough fan of the series that I did go out and buy the BBC version (on VHS and then on DVD when it became available) simply to have SOME cinematic rendering of the text. It wasn't bad for a television series directed at children. But this movie does much more justice to the full grandeur of the book.I am looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Too fast paced, but nice acting","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was way too fast paced and movie did not really get deep into minds of main characters. Movie did not explain characters' reactions or decisions very well, hence not answering the question 'why?'. It is a huge mistake especially in this case, when there really are the right answers: in the book. Of course it is good to give the viewer a chance to think by him/herself, but when this is done and characters for first time act unrealistically or dramatically other way than the viewer thought they would do, movie becomes something that viewer considers... stupid.As a whole, it was not a bad movie. It only was too quick one. Main actors performed well.Animation was nice, though Aslan sometimes looked more like a cat from Pixar movie, rather than being a photo-realistic lion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Fabulous!,"I took my 12 year old and 8 year old sons to this movie and we all enjoyed it immensely! What an awesome film! I had seen the older videos and this is much much better quality wise! So many really neat special effects and such a great story! There were places the audience laughed, and places that drew a tear to the eye, and places that had us on the edge of our seats! GREAT movie! I am sure it will be a timeless classic! The children who acted in the movie were very good and convincing as the main characters, and the White witch was scary and evil, but not so bad that young children couldn't see the film. I felt the scene with Father Christmas could have been done better, they went over it a bit too quickly. Aslan was so realistic! It made you feel as if a real Lion were talking! SO good! The battle scenes were very well done and so exciting. I highly recommend this film. It is so refreshing to see a family movie with no bad language or sex in it these days.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The gentlest of young adult blockbusters.,"It boasts solid CGI and general design, and the adult casting is impeccable. Still, this adaptation's biggest asset is its faithful reminder of how great the original story is. It doesn't change much, and what it does change is largely positive (Edmund's death). It's far from perfect; Peter is annoying, Aslan is a bit tamed down, the battle is overlong, the musical score is bad. Nonetheless, Lewis's brilliance mostly shines through.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good God That was terrible,"OK saw the film and URGH, i honestly cant remember the last time i saw a film this terrible i wanted to walk out so much but its a long walk home so i stayed and really wished i'd settled for the walk home.I tried to just see the film as a nice entertaining big budget family film, i haven't read the book(well not all of it my friend stole it from my bout 100pages in) so the start of the film was almost reasonable not overly straying from the excellent and gripping opening of the book i'd started to read not long ago. Then it just went downhill really really REALLY far downhill, the acting throughout was utterly terrible, the cgi disgracefully poor, the bad rip offs of lord of the rings almost as laughably poor as the scene stolen from harold and kumar! i tried looking at the film as an afterthought from a film student's perspective after all that is what i am, i really wish i hadn't done that now as that just made it even worse if it was possible.I guess the one and only well 1 and a half good things the film's got going for it Jim broadbent is fairly spot on at bringing the delightful professor to life, and the half goes to the half decent reasonably chucklesome beavers.Save your money don't go see it, read the book and let your imagination take you to narnia rather than a terrible movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Has bite but lacks charm.,"I saw this at a special midnight preview screening. The place was packed to the rafters with not a child in sight.The film is shot on an epic and majestic scale of 2:35 and every inch of the wide framing is packed with rabid detail. It looks gorgeous and the lighting is splendid, the costumes are colourful, the landscapes reveal wonder upon wonder, the creatures are stunningly created and the script moves along at a cracking pace. The Walpurgisnacht-esquire scene will creep out most people and I recommend any parents to be vigilant when it starts. This is a fairly provocative and terrifying orgy of violence that could well disturb many kids.The major flaw is the uninspired score and the lack of escapist magic and charm. The four kids in the film are anemic and devoid of any real emotion. This hampers any connection or engagement with their characters.I still prefer the old animation from the 1980's over this multi-million dollar venture.Still, it's not all bad and there is much to enjoy and savour. There's even a sly reference to KING KONG and many nods to THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Take your kids and spend a couple of hours in the world of the Wardrobe.Above Average.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why did they cast Swinton?,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe could have been a nice little (almost) family movie. The story is not brilliant but OK, there are some likable kids as heroes - although they don't do that much heroic stuff - and there is a lot of magic and special effects for eye-candy. Without thinking too much about it you could just cheer for the kids and enjoy a happy end.But then there is Tilda Swinton as the white whitch. Although she is stuck in some ridiculous wardrobe and with some borderline ridiculous dialogue, it takes about ten seconds of her mesmerizing performance to make you realize how mediocre all the rest is. When she is on screen everyone else pales in comparison and I found it near impossible to root for the heroes. In some scenes she also projects a villainy that for my taste was well beyond a PG rating. All together her presence was kind of a reality check which is not very becoming for a relatively flat fantasy story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Fabulous!,"I've waited since I was 8 years old for this book to be made into a movie. I say now, with complete conviction, this film was worth the wait! Disney did a spectacular job in retaining the integrity of the C.S. Lewis' beloved story. It is absolutely wonderful! Breathtaking photography, acting and computer imaging! You feel like you are beholding real fauns and centaurs. The actors were perfectly cast, especially little Georgia Henly as Lucy and James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. In the end you are left wanting more and Disney appears to have left the wardrobe door open for a 2nd visit to Narnia. A dream journey, I will await once again with great anticipation. In the meantime, I will just have to go see The Chronicles of Narnia a 2nd and 3rd time. Bravo to Disney Exec's for choosing these books for film development. Everyone in our theater was clapping and whistling for a job well done. GO SEE THIS!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Have your kids read the books when they're 10 instead...,"Finally got around to renting this. My thoughts, not necessarily in order:The GoodGreat production values, beautiful scenery, effects. The acting is, by and large, fabulous. The kids hit all the right notes, Liam is perfect as Aslan, Mike Madsen is perfect as a wolf as well. Very good adaptation, very true to the novel.The BadThe soundtrack is awful. Couldn't they have come up with something better than that terrible moaning at inappropriate moments? It's actually really jarring in places. Possibly because of the novel, the pacing is horrible. It really is a boring movie in some parts.The DisappointingI remember reading these books lovingly as a ten year old kid. Watching them on the screen as an adult sadly disappoints I think, in part, because the sense of wonder is drowned by the heavy handedness of the material that a ten year old would likely not pick up (or ignore in favor of Lewis' wonderful sense of imagination). When Aslan said ""It is finished,"" I nearly fell out of my chair laughing.The movie also suffers in comparison to the ""Lord of the Rings."" Once you've seen an army of Uruk-Hai and goblins, armies of minotaurs and tigers just look, well, silly.Bottom line: Rent it. It's worth seeing once for the kid actors and the spectacle but don't expect it to re-create the sense of wonder you felt as a kid.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

First, some critic (I actually know his name, I just don't want to embarrass him) said something stupid like ""...this movie falls well short of ""The Lord of the Rings."""" I thought to myself, ""Go figure."" The Director and creators of this film did not set out to eclipse LOTR as the best fantasy film of the day. If you compare ANY fantasy film to LOTR it falls short. Bad comment. The same critic also said ""...the religious symbolisim is disturbing, and obvious."" To that I shall reply with the thing Liberals tell everyone about there crap filled movies ""DONT WATCH IT THEN!!!"" If it bothers you, nobody can force you to watch it. I just think that it is funny they say that to everybody else all the time, but then that comment doesn't apply when it is used on them. Hysterical.

We walk through the wonderful wardrobe at long last!,"What I mean by that is that C. S. Lewis' The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is FINALLY on big screen. I'm so happy and relieved.I very much loved the film. Immediately, I say go see it. I say it is an INSTANT classic. Everything, honestly, about this film is wonderful: The acting, the music, the animation, the scenery, etc. See, I'm not displeased at all.I always loved the BCC form of The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe and the cartoon. but it was so truly cool to see it like this. If Mr. Lewis was still alive, I... believe he would really like this one.Now the actors and actresses were all very excellent. The children and teenagers who played the four Pevensies (Henley, Popplewell, Keynes, Moseley) are very good at acting, really. Swinton makes a perfect fit for the tall, calm and cruel Jadis, the White Witch. And Neeson does a wonderful job for the voice of the divine, strong but loving Aslan, the lion and the King of Narnia.I'm so pleased with everything about this film and, most of all, just happy Narnia's has gone to theaters after all this time and I hope they will make the fellow sequel books into films too. Here they are: Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse And His Boy, The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle.

This one always leaves me a little flat.,"""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is never that satisfying a watch for me. I know a lot of people enjoy it. It does have a few really good moments. But overall, it just kind of lays there. A couple of the characters don't really work. The music is not that hot. The movie is a fifteen or twenty minutes too long. There is a seriousness to the movie that doesn't really work. That's why it's great whenever Mr Beaver shows up. He lightens everything up. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a bit of a rarity. It's a ""Part 1"" that's weaker than it's sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Even when it almost takes itself too seriously to be fun, it still is an enjoyable experience","Andrew Adamson, who gave us animated gems such as Shrek and Shrek 2, directs his first movie involving real actors with mixed results. The first entry in C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is certainly a good movie to watch, but somehow lacks the magic of movies that stay with you after the film is over.It's not easy to adapt a famous book, but in that aspect Adamson and his team of scriptwriters manage to stay faithful to the novel although still the story has suffered a few minor changes. The plot is simple, four siblings travel to a magical world using an old wardrobe, they will have to free the land of Narnia from the eternal winter that Jadis, the White Witch has sent.The acting is good for the most part; experienced actress Tilda Swinton dwells more into mainstream movies and give her usual great performance as the White Witch, giving power to a character that is always diminished by the majestic Aslan, who clearly is the star. Liam Neeson does a good job as his voice, giving him dignity, but at the same time it focuses in the messianic side of the character.This would not be a bad thing if it not were by the fact that Adamson focuses more in those aspects of the story, leaving poor development for the children and the adventure aspect of it. Too much time is given to how great Aslan is, that there is few time to explore that sense of adventure every kid has in it.The movie takes itself too serious as an epic to a point that it almost forgets is aimed for the fun of younger audiences. It feels as if they were trying to make the story a new ""Lord of the Rings"" epic when the story doesn't go that way. Fortunately, this never gets too serious to become a problem and the movie still manages to be entertaining.The film is not a masterpiece, but it can be entertaining for younger audiences. Do not believe the hype, it's not a perfect movie, just go to the theaters with an open mind, and don't expect any more than entertainment. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Engaging adventure film,"Fine adventure film based on C. S. Lewis novel about two brothers and two sisters who magically enter a land where they must join forces with a lion king to fight an evil queen. The unknown actors who play the children are all quite capable without trying to be too cute. Swinton is perfect as the cold-blooded ice queen. The director keeps the story moving along at a good pace, as we are introduced to strange characters such as talking beavers and creatures that are half-horse/half-man. There may be some theological undertones but the movie, to its credit, does not dwell on them. Ultimately, however, the story gets pretty absurd, specially with the events concerning the lion.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"beautiful, great acting, soulless","I'm a Narnia fan (have re-read all the books every 2 years or so for fifteen years now) and went to the movie excitedly and open-mindedly. It's hard to satisfy fans who know the stories so well and love them as they are: but Peter Jackson completely satisfied me with Lord of the Rings, despite the changes he'd made. So I was hopeful.I was very struck, as others have posted, by how beautifully-made the film was. The acting and voices, too, were superb, as were all the effects and props. Yet I am completely dissatisfied.Why? It seems the ""soul"" has been excised from the story. Why did the director (or screenwriter) make so many bloody changes that seemed to contribute nothing to the story, or even detract? For instance, why was Aslan's ""children why are you following me"" line changed to ""shouldn't you be in bed""? That seems a definite unimprovement, and was echoed by many other changes. Was Disney's PC squad on the loose, cutting out anything that seemed too religious? Regardless of the cause, all the deep spirituality and gravitas--the things which made the books spellbinding (and I'm not even a Christian, but rather a Baha'i)--have been removed or changed. Meanwhile, much angst was added that wasn't in the original story, such as Peter's repeated squeamishness, and all the too-dwelled-upon sibling stuff. And then the gorgeous Narnia that was created, including special new touches such as the phoenix, was flashed too briefly before our eyes.I think this movie sapped the soul out of Narnia, despite the brilliant work done by nearly everyone involved. The culprits seem to have been story-monkeying, and a failure to allow us to experience what is truly enthralling about the Narnia story, including a failure to allow us to dwell long enough in what of Narnia had been brilliantly created.Alas, with a salute to the acting, cinematography, and rendering, I sigh and go back to the books. The door is still open for someone to capture Narnia. I hope that by ""The Voyage of the Dawn-Treader"" and ""The Last Battle"" someone gets it right. Put the soul back in. It's not Christian, it's spiritual, and please leave it that way, gravitas intact.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delightful!,"The big screen adaptation of the 1st novel under the chronicles of narnia series by C.S.Lewis is a winner.All aspects of film making, from the cinematography to the art-direction to the editing to the rousing score all come together to deliver visually stunning and immensely satisfying movie experience.

A special word here for Tilda Swanson who plays the role of the Snow Witch.I cannot imagine anyone else in that role,after having watched her.

Exiting the movie theater, I had one thing in mind: this film is just very poor. The universe is poor, the story is incredibly predicable, (most of) the characters are irritable and shallow, the direction is blurry  And some moments are too long (30 min could easily be cut out without any damage to the story).

Visually spectacular,"I have just returned from the midnight session of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"". I read the books in 1991, so I could remember there being some wardrobe, and a lion or something, so wasn't sure how I'd find it. But turns out the memory is a great thing, and seeing, say, the lamppost, would instantly bring back the memories of the story. There will surely be many comparisons made between it and Lord of the Rings, and it's a shame that it comes out in the same week as King Kong, because it is a visually spectacular film with a compelling story that they've kept true to from the books, but is being overshadowed by the massive publicity surrounding the great ape. The animals created in the movie are incredible, especially the wolves, and while it is certainly more of a family-oriented movie than the LOTR movies, there were so many scenes where I wish I could have freeze-framed and just looked at all that was there - every scene was so detailed.

Good but not great,"As a movie it is a good. As a representation of the book it is mediocre. Most of the wonderful words and dialogue from the books are dumbed down in the movie. The beavers, wolves, and Ginarrbrik are especially awful (corny dialogue, badly animated, etc). It seemed like the people who made the movie were not huge fans of the book (they may have liked it, but you could tell that they did not love it).Visually it was pretty nice (besides some of the animations), but basically, whoever wrote the script needs to be replaced before the next movie comes out. C.S Lewis would have never written some of the crap the actors were made to say in the movie.Certain small details I enjoyed (never closing the wardrobe door, as is stressed several times in the book...the white stag...etc). The final battle was well done, but the fight between Peter and Maugrim was very anticlimactic. It was well cast...the children and the witch were very well done...though I thought the professor could have been better (he was a bit too goofy).It definitely could have been better...hopefully in the next one they will get someone who can better interpret the book to a screenplay and ditch the corny dialogue...especially when the original dialogue from the book is so wonderful and strong!

The process of the events reminded that movie.But they failed.They couldn't even get closer. Despite all these facts,As a Turk I got honored because of ASLAN. ASLAN is the Turkish word translation of the English word LION which is the main character of the movie.Moreover Turkish DELIGHT was many times used during the film.If you haven't tasted that before,be sure that you have missed a unique taste.Also the tents of the lion's territory and the handwork over them was almost the same as what our Turkish ancestors used once upon a time.Then the question is ""is the writer a Turkish fan?""",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great kids movie!,"I liked The Chronicles of Narnia, I think it was entertaining and magical, something that i find interesting is why so many grown ups went to see this film, then they want to judge it on their level, and that is not possible. We have to remember this movie is for children, and yes, maybe the story was not very deep and logical, but i think that for the kids level it was OK. The movie had it's funny moments, people reacted to it in the theather, so i guess they connected with it. The little girl Lucy was great. so was the witch. very cool the combination of all white with the black eyes without eyelashes. the battle was a little strange, and in the end I don't know why they needed those kids because they didn't do anything actually. if you notice there was no blood during the whole battle (again it is a children movie). It is inevitable to compare it with LOTR because you can feel the same atmosphere.

An Unexpected Treat,"This was meant to be a ""stocking-filler"" - just a movie on a cold Christmas holiday afternoon. A children's story from over 50 years ago - probably with so many anachronisms and cuteness it might even be kitsch.Having already suffered the appalling massacre of JK Rowling's 4th book, I knew I could manage anything. However, when ""Disney"" came up in the opening credits I settled down for a good snooze. Definitely this was not a film this ""Grumpy Old Man"" could possibly enjoy!! Well how wrong I was!!! The cast was excellent. All credit to the 4 children, great young actors. The animation was stunning and the scenery, wow!! I was enthralled right from the start.There were a few tongue-in-cheek pieces of ""modern"" dialogue - but I found them to enhance the believability rather than the opposite. I would have to be a real old *** to find fault at all.Reading a couple of the (very few) negative reviews for this film  I wonder just what those critics expected from Narnia.

It really has grown on me,"In the past 5 or so years numerous novel adaptations and family films have come out. Two of the most popular book series ever written, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, have been brought to the screen and gained considerable amount of praise.

Henceforth, I waited a long time to finally watch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and when I first saw it, I was a tad bit disappointed but since then the film has grown considerably on me.The story follows that of four British children during the Battle of Britain. Their mother, seeing it to be too dangerous to remain in London, ships them off to the countryside to spend time with a crazy uncle in a large but boring mansion. There the children try everything they can in order to pass the time. One day, the youngest, Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and falls into a magical land known as Narnia. Soon all of the children enter into the world and are brought into a battle with Aslan, a mighty lion, against the evil Jadis the White Witch for safety of Narnia.After I first watched it I found the four children to be rather wooden. They seemed bored and not familiar at all with the books. They seemed just too boring to be enjoyable or at least main characters for the movie. After my third viewing my mind changed. I realized something, I'm not familiar with British children personality and even less familiar with their acting skills. Once I realized this I realized they weren't at all wooden and boring, they simply weren't what I was used to from child actors. I realized how strong of performances they actually gave, especially William Moseley who I now believed portrayed an amazing Peter.The special effects for the film are tremendous. The visual effects department really out did themselves with this film. They generated amazing animals and creatures for the film that looked entirely authentic and believable. What also made the film is that not everything is computer generated. Most of the characters were in makeup and wore costumes, not lame CGI characters fighting. General Otmin had one of the most incredible looking costumes I've ever seen. I was highly impressed by the art department and effects department with the film.The film is not without flaws. I found some parts to be rather dry and boring especially the early parts of entering Narnia. Don't get me wrong, the set was amazing and visually stunning, the dialog was just a bit bland. Skandar Keynes really did not give a good performance. The kid tried his best but it just didn't feel like he was into the movie that much. He had the same dull expression on his face and rarely seemed to be trying. Moseley did the best of the children actors but even his inexperience showed just a little.Now the film does have several strong points. Tilda Swinton proves yet again she is one of the top British actresses out there and can do a variety of roles, including a pretty scary White Witch. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan (Aslan is CGI) is very good. Neeson shows he has some skill with voice acting. The Battle of Narnia, which is close to the end, is visually stunning and filled with amazing special effects and acting. I love battles in films and this fantasy battle was a rare treat. It was interesting to see animals doing combat (all staged and CGI, no animals were harmed making the film) and seeing the magic C.S. Lewis intended being brought to life with this film.I strongly recommend the film for the lovers of the book. Some people may think it is a kids film and while there are many cute scenes and cuddly looking animals there are several frightening moments and some pretty intense battle violence for a PG film. There is virtually no language, there's a lot of cuteness to the film but also a valuable lesson to also be learned from it. I won't ruin the message though, you've got to watch it. Overall a very good film that could have been better but is still good as it is now.3.5/5 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Mouse does the Lion,"Some suits at the House of the Mouse had this idea of bringing to film this fantasy epic on a mystical world, based on a well-known book series and have it done by a Kiwi director. That's great, but the problem is, this idea has been done already. Even though ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is actually a good movie, the concept is lacking in freshness.There's not a second in the movie we can't shake off the sensation that we have seen something like this before, and better executed. It's also hard to forget Disney's marketing has more influence in this movie than its artistic merits.The Jehovah's Witness-y side of the story is also a marketing element well implemented. People tired of getting hardcore Christan culture constantly shoved down are not going to be bothered by it, and Bible-Belt families will be delighted.Again, this is a good picture. A great live-action debut by the director and a bankable new franchise for Disney to milk. Until the public gets tired of the literary-fantasy-epic trend, (which could be not that far in the horizon).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My fears were unjustified,"Let me tell you some of the fears that I had concerning this movie before watching it. Firstly, it would undo all the great work that Lord of the Rings had done for the fantasy genre. I felt that this would be a hit and run attempt to cash in on the recent interest in fantasy based movies. Secondly, it would be too childish and lack interest for adults. Thirdly, having seen the children in trailers I was convinced that I was going to find the children annoying and would want to give them a good slap.I can tell you that my fears were totally unjustified. The film took me back to my childhood,wishing for a magical adventure with an opportunity to show my valour and courage. This was no mere attempt to cash in on the work of the Lord of the Rings. This film was thoughtfully made and an extremely faithful adaptation of the book.The film was enchanting and made excellent family viewing. Although the interest for children is obvious,I believe that the film had enough going for it to interest adults as well. Kids will marvel at the wonderful special effects and magical storyline. Older children and adults can find meaning in the allegory of various religious messages which were interspersed throughout the film. The final battle scene was big in scale and fantastic to watch.The acting from the children was excellent. They were not in the least bit annoying and I regretted my earlier desire to give them the back of my hand. The White Queen put in an ice cold performance. She was elegant, commanding and ruthless all at the same time. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan put in a roaring performance and was in everyway majestic.If there others out there who have not seen this film, who have similar fears to those that I had, I recommend that you give this film a chance to change your mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not usually a fan of these types of movies, but it was decent","I had seen parts of the movie years ago, but I decided to watch the whole movie which was not as boring as I expected it to be. The idea of a fantasy world inside of a wardrobe is a bit weird, but ignore that and remember that the movie is fiction. The story was intriguing and simple to follow and there's various types of interesting characters which I liked. I can see what the author was trying to do with this novel where he wanted the children living through a war to experience happiness by escaping into a fantasy happy world. Maybe it was a bit too long than it should've been, but other than that not much negatives about the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disappointed,"I was eagerly awaiting this film. Sadly, it disappointed me. The special effects were wishy-washy. Sometimes they would epic(Aslan, the battle) sometimes they were less than believable(The fox and the beavers mostly). The acting was good,Edmund and Lucy were phenomenal(I still don't believe that Georgie Henly had never acted a day in her life before this). Peter was good, but you can only act so good to a sub-par script. Susan annoyed me, she wasn't that annoying until later books. The witch was a good actress, but the way they made her look is ridiculous. Tumnus reminded me of a child molester, the way he looked at Lucy creeped me out. Aslan was wonderfully voiced by Liam Neeson, he lifted the entire movie. Oreius was a good addition to cast as well. The costumes were like the special effects, Great(The entire Narnian army)and terrible(The Witch's dresses, enough said.). Overall, Narnia is a hard movie to judge. With signs of being great, and signs of being terrible. The battle at the end was a good action scene, it lifted the movie along with Aslan.

A War In a Fantasy land,"I definitely wasn't expecting a movie of such epic proportions when I wen to see Narnia. But indeed it turned out to be exactly that. True, if you are a LOTR addict, then it will constantly remind you of LOTR. But still it's worthy of a praise. The soundtrack/score is mind blowing, utterly mind blowing. The acting is good, pretty mature, the camera works, special effects is also neat. Overall its a real damn good movie.As for the story, well, 4 kids, are under a professor during World War 2. One day, whilst playing they accidentally discover a wardrobe which is a portal to a fantasy land, the land of Narnia. There, they understand that a witch has been ruling for a 100 years and they are a part of a prophecy, which states that they will overthrow the witches' rule of Narnia. Against their will, they are caught up in the battle, and they fight bravely, finally killing the witch, and ending the rule. Afterwards, they become the rulers of Narnia, and they rule well, for many years, until one day they again accidentally stumble back into the wardrobe, back to their own world in the 1940's.

A sweet and faithful adaptation,"I've not read the Narnia books since early adulthood (over a quarter-century ago), but this adaptation has inspired me to do so. The young actors are superb, and the cinematography seamless and sound. I sincerely hope they continue to be faithful to Lewis' incomparable stories. Oh ... and LOTR fans should, of course, refuse to make comparisons. Lewis and Tolkein, though friends, wrote from very different points of view and with very different audiences and intentions. Other than the facts that both stories are fantasies, and both deal with (on some level or another) Christian themes, there is little to compare. Rather, the Narnia books and the LOTR stories are wondrous bookends to the vast field of allegorical fantasy. Enjoy each for what they are. I'm looking forward to the next installment of Narnia, and (hopefully) Peter Jackson will soon turn to making ""The Hobbit.""",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breathtaking,"Very rarely does a movie leave me speechless when the credits begin rolling, but this one did.Where to start? Beautiful scenery, some truly extraordinary sets and scenes. The world of Narnia was superbly portrayed, with fantastic visual effects and animated characters.But of course it was the performances of the main characters that truly held up this film and made it what it was. The four lead children are all charming and highly convincing in their roles. It is clear to see they are all talented actors. They are all exceptionally natural and give truly heart-warming portrayals of their characters, displaying a wide range of emotions.Tilda Swinton is suitably terrifying in her role of the White Witch, and Liam Neeson's voice was just right for the role of Aslan. All the other characters, such as the beavers and the wolves, were all done fantastically, but I can't mention them all!From the moment the film started, with the dramatic music accompanying the air raid in London, I was gripped till the very end. Tears were brought to my eyes more than once, and I felt like bursting into applause in the middle of the film several times, such as during the battle scene - though I refrained for fear of appearing like a complete idiot.It is very difficult to describe one particular thing that made this film so appealing; it truly has to be seen to be appreciated. One of the best films I ever seen!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A good movie, but a bad adaptation of a book.","This movie is the film adaptation of one of the most famous books of C.S. Lewis, who wrote a series of novels called ""Chronicles of Narnia"". In this film, four brothers enter a magical world of talking animals and find that their coming was prophesied and should defeat a terrible witch who enslaved the country in a long winter.Directed by Andrew Adamson (who directed Shrek), has a script by Ann Peacock, Andrew Adamson, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The cast was headed by Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Tilda Swinton (The Witch), also relying on the voices of James McAvoy (Tumnus), Liam Neeson (Aslan) and Ray Winstone (Mr. Beaver). It won the Oscar for best characterization in 2006.I've always been of the opinion that if we want to tell a story correctly, we must start at the beginning. That's not what this movie did. In fact, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", despite the fame, is not the book where the chronicle begins. The story begins before this events, in the novel ""The Magician's Nephew"". But okay, we have seen prequels before (Star Wars, for example). What I never saw was a successful film where the events are not properly explained to the public. Throughout the film, we understanding that we know very little about Narnia (like the four protagonists), but it might be good to know more, understand how that witch has earned its position and what happened in that world before the arrival of the four humans. This kind of mysteries didn't work in this kind of films, unless they are exploited in a very skillful way in the script, which was far from the reduced ability of the team that wrote it. I also believe that Lewis's book could have been better explored and understood. Apparently, the staff and the director were afraid to exploit the book and end up filling the film with Christian allegories (yes, he's full of it and this film also, even if it wasn't the intention). Despite these flaws, the film works well enough to delight the audience because we all have a little child inside us, and all children have dreamed of something like this. The special effects and characterization are irreproachable, the costumes too, and the scenery is straight out of a true fairy tale. This movie is all that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is not: it's a fairy tale, not a war epic in a strange world. For all this, it's a film that deserves to be seen often, although those who have particular taste in C.S. Lewis books might not like so much.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie for the ages!,"Sure, we have mega blockbusters like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, both of which were excellent movies in their own right. But the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe shines in it's own right. A true masterpiece among the ages that deserves just as much praise as HP or LoTR, probably even more.I won't go into a synopsis of the movie, seeing as how most of you have either read the books or have seen the movie already and know it's plot. The accidental discovering of an enchanted land ruled forever by winter by the evil White Witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton in all her icy splendor) prompts the Pevensie family (with little Lucy first discovering the land) to eventually realizing their destiny and joining forces with the powerful Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), ensuing in one of the coolest battles in cinema history.This film was very magical indeed. Not only does it capture the essence of the book very well, it also adds it's own little touches of Disney magic here and there. Hard to believe you were watching a Disney-made movie, but that's what it is. Truly cinema magic. I also felt that it was more drama-free than Harry Potter franchise and much more joyous and cheerful then the Lord of the Rings franchise.Looks like Disney has struck gold once again with this one.

Review of a cool movie: The Chronicles of Narnia,"Cool movie .It's a fairy tale. Naive, kind, sometimes ridiculous, but I think it's a cool children's as well as a teen movie. Here everything is as it should be-there are good and evil that oppose each other. But there are some small nuances , I think the film is still interesting , but it would be possible if it were already made tougher and more intense . And it's not clear why the children fought for what Narnia. The actors did not cope with their role a little, some overplayed and Lucy, since she was a child there, could not be much softer and sweeter. But I liked: the scenes in the professor's house, where every frame was like a postcard; the moment Lucy got into Narnia and the very sight of an absolutely fascinating lantern in the middle of a winter forest; Mr. Tumnus with his umbrella and most importantly - his insidious lullaby with a 3D laser show in the fireplace. It was all beautiful and fabulous, to the point of shivering and goosebumps. Of course, the scenes in Narnia were beautiful because the director added humor there, but since the story of the film turned out to be too gloomy, not much of a grunt humor hurt and did not manifest.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Solid, but unremarkable","Finally got to watch this last night and, while I enjoyed it, I was underwhelmed. I will admit, right off the top, that I enjoy the LOTR and Harry Potter books more than Narnia. Narnia is aimed at a younger audience, which I am no longer a part of, and are much preachier, which is to be expected.The story was presented quite well, from what I remember from the book. The talking animals work well, although I felt that the beavers looked a bit cartoonish. The wolves were excellent.Overall I was surprised at the lack of a WOW factor. There were no scenes that I looked back on as visually impressive. The CGI'd creatures were beautiful, and the flying ones I liked particularly, but good CGI is now a basic expectation of a big budget movie.The characters are very two dimensional, although well played by the actors. Lucy's grin was annoying at times, but many 6 year olds are annoying at times, in real life. The Snow Queen was striking, the dwarfs were cool, but, in the end, I was left wanting more.I will watch this again, I am sure, and I will go to the sequel(s), but this will never be a movie that I put into the DVD player myself. If I am in the mood for some epic fantasy, it will be The Two Towers. If I am in the mood for a fantasy aimed at children, I will put in Harry Potter.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good,"Though starting of at a very slow pace, Narnia gradually gets interesting. Defects are numerous, the music standard, and the acting is sometimes poor, but, on the other hand, the special effects were convincing, especially for the animated characters, such as the lion (which was surprisingly believable), some wolves, and other various beasts. Many scenes, throughout the film, are very ""cliché"" and some have a slightly odd look, due to inadequate color balance between actors/landscape/effects. Costumes, Items, Weapons could have had better designs, or at least some cultural/esthetic signs. The monsters were also a touch uninventive, and looked more like toys rather than beasts. Anyway, the story remains a nice one, which makes this movie good and definitely entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Truly magical, and one of the very best films of 2005!","Disney's highly anticipated Chronicles of Narnia, has several decades worth of fans who are waiting eagerly for this adaptation.My friends, the hype is definitely worth it, the story, the acting, the visual effects, all marvelous.Narnia, as many people know concerns four small children who take up shelter in a professor's house.While playing hide and seek, one of the children, Lucy, stumbles upon an old wardrobe in the professor's house. That wardrobe leads to the magical world of Narnia.From there the four children take on an adventure of epic proportions, with talking animals, and all sorts of fantasy creatures.This is what each of the four Harry Potter movies have each wanted to be so far, and failed to do!

Fantasy movie old style,"An enjoyable movie perfect for the whole family.It is an archetypal fable for children, full of children heroes, wondrous creatures, a beautiful nasty witch, a king lion, magic, battles, good and evil, adventure and action. The movie is entertaining and visually charming, and the visual effects are not overwhelming and do what they should do - help to present the story in a believable way instead of becoming the star of the movie.All actors are OK in their roles, especially Tilda Wilson, believable as evil witch, and the young Georgie Henleyhe as the youngest sibling, whose face and expression reminded me of Judy Garland when she was a child. Really, her face conveys so much magic and tenderness, she is so expressive, that the role really suited her, and gave the movie that magic innocence that it needed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
140 minutes of my life that I'll never get back,"Where to start? The sole reason I went to see this movie was because my mother had 4 free tickets and she invited me and a friend. I had no expectations other than that I was pretty sure that it was going to be a LOTR-type of movie for kids. And I was pretty much right. But it still S-U-C-K-S.First off, the acting was terrible. In my opinion, Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was the only highlight of this movie, and she was the only reason I didn't fall asleep during the movie.The child-actors were impeccably....awful. They spent 180 million dollars on this movie. And for what? Most of it was computer generated, and even that wasn't done well. The green-screen use was a load of crap, and I have seen better in my media class in my school. And with such a huge budget, they could've spent some dough on teaching William Moseley (Peter) how to carry and wield a sword without looking like a victimized redneck retard who's about to stand up to his father in a domestic quarrel (even though the sword would have been misplaced in such a situation).I wont bother picking on the other actors, because anyone that saw this, and anyone that will, will know what I'm talking about here. When I saw this movie in the theaters, I didn't realize all the allusions to the bible for some unknown reason, but after reading some comments in here, I totally agree with all of them.The battle sequences were short and monotonous and boring. Not were they any exciting, and it all seemed like the director tried to make something like Peter Jackson did with his magnificent LOTR trilogy. This movie doesn't even come close. not even.BTW, does anyone agree that Mr. Tumnus first seemed like a pedophile when he met Lucy the first time? Tilda Swinton and some of the technical aspects of the movie were the only good parts about this, but what does that matter when the story and storytelling is horrible? The only thing I could think of when leaving the theater, was how much one could've gotten for that wardrobe on some auction. And the only reason I give it a 2 in rating is that it had one part that was completely superb - the end credits - it marked the end of this cinematic equivalent of a turd. Skip this turgid mess.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Needs  better music,"It needs better music, and the character's personalities are twisted up too much for my taste my taste. It had good effects, but seeing that it's based on a book, I don't believe they should carry the weight of a movie. Aslan needed to be much greater. The book refers to him as ""good and terrible."" The children would ""catch a glimpse of the golden mane, and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn't look at him and went all trembly."" The Aslan in this movie looks like a realistic, sad little Lion. This movie needed more imagination. With computer graphics, I can't understand why everything has to be focused on the goal of looking so realistic, instead of out of this world. I t is after all, Narnia, right?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Kids' Movie Where You're Not Supposed to Think and You're Not Supposed to Do Anything but Escape for Two Hours and Return to Your Life Afterward,"The fantasy genre provides us with a way of viewing the universal conditions of the world, the environment, governments, and other large-scope subjects with an objective eye. Somehow, all we seem to get out of it nonetheless is the spectacle of these stories, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Northern Lights series, the Narnia series. There is a lot more that could be done with The Chronicles of Narnia. I am not sure of whether or not I'm talking about the original work by C.S. Lewis as well as this film version or just the latter, because I have never read the books. From what I've seen here, and thus from what the new generation of children are seeing, is innocent abandon. There is no real import in the concept of a wardrobe that arbitrarily leads into an alternate world without humans full of mythological creatures and talking wolves and beavers.I feel as if the concept should've been put in the hands of Neil Gaiman, who once wrote a novel told from the point of view of a bus. I am thrilled by the idea of a humanless world, but not by populating it with humans. I enjoyed the non-human characters, and I enjoyed the audacity of the filmmakers who allowed Tilda Swinton's witch to be a truly vicious villain, an icy, power-hungry and completely ruthless baddie. I was affected by a scene between her and Aslan, a wise and idealistically good lion, and I can imagine how much children would be bothered by it. But for what? Is this the three English siblings' fortunate escape from the harrowing WWII from which they've been sent away by their mother?Everything about the story seems entirely unsystematic and with no real underpinnings, except that Aslan seemingly represents Christ for devout Christian C.S. Lewis. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch as if to represent Satan. Why does time go on in Narnia and when the siblings return to the reality of the British manor home they have only spent a few seconds of reality? Why is the alternate reality called Narnia? It is all a haphazard succession of building blocks leading to what to which all of the fantasy adventures lead: the big battle between these creatures and those creatures. Pure good and pure evil. Black and white. Love and hate. More diverting scapegoating and jingoism for the kids who recently lost their father and are only left to bicker with themselves till they stumble upon a parallel world, which to them is an emotional distraction more than anything else. They could make their goals to retreat back into the wardrobe, but they would rather consume themselves with drama that is far removed from their own. Is there anything wrong with that? No, it's natural. But why would fantasy settle on such common human weaknesses when it supposedly transcends every other everyday convention?It's a kids' movie where you're not supposed to think and you're not supposed to do anything but escape for two hours and return to your life afterward. That is not the way we are supposed to look at things. We cannot turn our minds off, no matter how hard we try. Children absorb everything. They absorb histrionics and dramatics. One appeal of the story could be that its magic and myth are determined not by the arbitrary world-building technicalities that many fantasy writers pull from their sleeves, though that certainly still occurs here as much as in Tolkien or Rowling's stories, but by the markedly English tenacity of the human kids. I do love that this film, like countless other kids' movies, humanizes and familiarizes animals of all kinds. But the story offers not much in the way of acceptance or moral dichotomies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good vs evil?,"This movie was good if your trying to go to a ""family"" film but i wasn't i wanted to lord of the rings type good vs evil battle for the world but this wasn't! The point where Aslan comes back to life was the MOST IMPORTANT part of the book and it was treated as nothing in the movie! Plus the white witch was obviously evil but Aslan was not obviously good. This was not a obvious good vs evil thing. This was not supposed to be a ""family"" film. This book was showing a Biblical metaphor for Jesus (Aslan)counqering death and saving the world. I think that the whole movie should be redone and raise the rating to pg-13 and show a battle between good and evil.

Children's Escapist Fare,"There's one good rule about the writing of children's stories, that you should never treat children like children. I believe that is the reason for the success of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia down through the years. And it's the reason for the success of this film, sure to take home some Oscar gold this year for special effects if nothing else.Before writing this review I did a little research on C.S. Lewis. I found that he had started writing this first story of the Narnia Chronicles during World War II. Lots of British families did like the Pevensies, ship their kids to the country side to escape the bombing of cities. They sent them abroad if they could afford to.What Lewis did was bring his Christian background and a vivid imagination in creating an escapist world for four kids who were in an unfamiliar area in the first place. These kids faced the real prospect of losing one or more parents and siblings. Enough of them did.Like American kids grow up on cowboys and Indians, British kids grow up on Knights of the Round Table and Robin Hood. Add some animals who all have the souls of humans, some mythical creatures, a wicked witch, and the King of Beasts and put these four Pevensie kids through a magic door and you've got Narnia.By the way I don't think it's an accident that Aslan, the Christ figure in the film is a lion. Remember the British national symbol is also a lion. Lewis didn't have the saviour of the kingdom be a Russian bear or an American bald eagle.I'm also sure that the success of the first book had a lot to do with the fact that it was published in 1950 at the height of the Cold War which a lot of people thought could get hot any minute. Parents wanted escapist stuff for their kids and for themselves as well. I'll bet reading all The Chronicles of Narnia was a secret pleasure.I think this film will be a guilty pleasure for a lot of folks.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You really should go see it.,"Wow, this movie was incredible! As a childhood reader of the books I was greatly impressed because it stuck to the novel's events and time line pretty well.The animation was great, the costumes were great (The White Witch is crazy cool) and it's great for adults who have or haven't read the books and for kids who haven't or have read the books as well. Both types of audiences will enjoy it.It's worth seeing: The acting is good by whoever plays Edmund, the younger son and Peter the older one, and Lucy's character was cute and believable.C.S. Lewis would be proud of his series' adaptation. I just hope they'll continue to make the rest of the books into movies because it's greatly entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Peter Pan remake,"All children in a London family are transported magically to a distant land. Here they find a conflict between the evil ruler and the outcasts. There is combat. There are magical weapons. There is a favorable outcome. The children return home and are welcomed.Is it Neverland? Or Narnia? Captain Hook has morphed into the wicked white witch. Is it the crocodile or the lion that the antagonist fears? The Indians of Neverland are replaced by talking animals. Like the movie of Peter Pan, the combat is bloodless and is not likely to scare children.But don't let the similarity to Peter Pan keep you away. The acting is very good. Georgie Henley (Lucy) is a delight. The special effects are very good. The plot is simple and dialog is easy to follow, very unlike Lord of the Rings. It is good entertainment for all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charming epic fantasy until the last big battle scene...,"There's an epic quality of grandeur about the wintry landscape of Narnia, the land ruled by The White Witch (TILDA SWINTON), existing beyond the handsome wardrobe chest in a stately home in the country where four British children are assigned temporary shelter during the war.The youngest girl, played by GEORGIE HENLEY with great charm and humor, is the first child to hide in the wardrobe and to discover the land beyond. The others soon join her, accidentally, and the tale takes on a darker turn as they learn the rules of the kingdom ruled by The White Witch and her cohorts.Performances are all first rate, the CGI is incredibly convincing in making all the creatures look and behave in humanized ways, and the story is compelling from the start. Once you start watching, you won't be able to turn away. But the last third of the movie tends to overdo the huge battle scene that rivals ""Lord of the Rings"" for blood-thirsty excitement. Very young children may be disturbed by the realistic special effects that make the violence so real.Overall, it succeeds in being a fantasy that weaves a spell of enchantment thanks to the superb craftsmanship of costuming and settings.TILDA SWINTON does a remarkable job as The White Witch, looking like a pale ghost in her all white attire and playing the role with not a shred of sympathy for her viciously cruel character. Among the children, WILLIAM MOSELY stands out as Peter, the oldest child, who reaches maturity as a leader.Summing up: Delightful fantasy from the C.S. Lewis book.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An enjoyable fantasy film,"I haven't read the Narnia books so I didn't know what to expect about the movie. Surprisingly, The Witch, The Lion and The Wardrobe was an enjoyable and lovely picture. It was not the best fantasy film I have seen but I liked it very much.The story was very typical but well-made and compelling. There were some very impressive and touching scenes although some of them were too scary for kids. It's same with Potter movies: they're meant for children but sometimes, at their scariest moments, you start to think if they're really suitable for kids. Or maybe I just overreact. Anyway, this movie really made a huge impact to me.Especially I liked the warmth of the story. It was visually stunning and good-looking but it also had a heart and a soul. I really cared the characters and felt sadness and joy when they felt it too. That's something that you don't find the Potter movies. Also the world of Narnia was charming and full of the sense of wonder. It was very easy to me to be wrapped up in this magical land of miracles.Kids were good in their roles. Also Tilda Swinton was excellent as the White Witch. I liked the way she played the role: no shouting or exaggerating looks but unassuming and well-balanced performance which made her character very scary. Instead, Jim Broadbent was just the annoying professor.However, the movie was not perfect. I think it was quite over-long. Especially in the middle of the movie story didn't seem to move on. Also some of the funny lines were unnecessary and even stupid. I was not satisfied the ending. It was too over the top. (Okay, this is the fantasy movie but still it was too silly, even for fantasy!)Some of viewers have criticized The Witch,etc. because its Christianity. Well, I'm not a devout Christian and I don't like too religious movies. Still, I didn't feel Narnia's Christianity irritating or too preaching. I think it was well integrated to the story and filmmakers didn't underline it too much. Besides, the movie can be watched even without thinking its Christian message.Conclusion: The Witch, The Lion and The Wardrobe is better than most of Potter movies but cannot match the LOTR -trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My take on Narnia,"I have been looking at the ratings for this movie for the past few weeks and as much as I wanted to see this movie I didn't get a chance until today. The ratings were decent so I was expecting a decent movie but I didn't get a decent movie, I actually think that this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.I think the rating doesn't pay its respects to this awesome movie. I haven't read any of the books therefore I can't compare both although for someone who has never read these books I must say I was shocked on how beautiful this entire adventure was. I seriously can't remember the last time where I have been at the movies and haven't at least once looked at the time during the movie or left the theater with an ""awww"" feeling about it. I actually felt like I wanted to take part of this amazing adventure.I got to the movies about twice a week and after watching King Kong I fought it would be impossible to beat but Narnia did that simply for the story and the point of the movie.The effects were well done, the characters were true and so realistic which is what made this movie incredible.I would vote in 10 on 10 because not once did I ever have a negative comment which is rare in my case :) What I like about this movie it completely removed any worries in my mind, made me think of my youth and how imagination can be at times.I think that this movie is great for all groups of ages because no matter what we all have youth in us and I truly believe you will at least enjoy this!

Smartest writer of the last century makes a movie.,"First off C. S. Lewis is a beast. Mere Christianity is a fire book. But Narnia is as well!! Fun concept of this super cool magical world that's somehow accessed by a wardrobe. These 4 kids are thrown into this sad place where a massive war is gonna take place. Pretty crazy.Execution of the book is pretty good, that's why this movie is so low is because of the execution. The pacing was just a bit slow and there were parts that didn't NEED to be in the movie but were. CGI and other effects were actually pretty good for 2005 though!Acting, Lucy does a tremendous job and sells her part quite well, I actually think she was a much better actor than the older kids.There is some very sad parts of the movie with people dying, and the injustice of Asland, but also some very good warning scenes too like the very end, and seeing asland come back and the faun guy come back too.Honestly the cinematography is one of the best parts of this movie, just so many unique shots and unique shots that push the narrative as well! My favorite shot is when aslan is talking to Edmond and the sun is behind them. It's such a warm good shot and it's also important to the movie showcasing how awesome aslan is.Music is fine, editing was actually pretty good, there were some sound match cuts that go really hard but that's about it for the technical side of things.You know how I said the cinematography was the best part, I meant of just the technical things. The theme of the movie is the best by a long shot. Cs Lewis purposefully wrote it as a parallel to the gospel. The way aslan takes Edmonds death is just amazing and that is by far the best thing about this movie is how it's just a fantasy fun way to show the gospel.I would prefer to actually not watch this movie again, like at least right now, where as the 8, 9, 10 tier movies I would watch again right there. Thats one of the reasons this movie is lower on the list too.Honestly a very good and fun movie (just on the longer side), I love cs Lewis and his books are great and I would recommend this for a fun family movie night.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia = good,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, finally made into a movie. And a fine job too. I cant actually say that I've ever read the book. But the movie is really good. This movie contains really tense moments. (Not spoiling, because every good movie has them.) The movie is a PG because no matter how much slicing or stabbing, the is no blood. Unlike the Lord of the Rings. But this looks quite like LOTR in many respects. And if you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. I went and saw this movie today and it is long but a lot of it is fresh in my mind. It was a really great movie. Very sad, very happy and some bits are quite scary. But the whole way through this movie you will watch and enjoy. I left with a big grin on my face. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Excellence of CoN,"The Chronicles of Narnia was fantastic! I am a big fantasy book fan. When I read the books, I thought they were wonderfully written, with vivid imagery and made a wonderful story. When I heard that Hollywood was making a movie of it, I as a bit uneasy. I love Harry Potter too, and after I saw the third and fourth movies and saw how they butchered the story, I wasn't sure if I wanted Hollywood to make a movie out of another wonderful fantasy novel. Then I saw the movie. The Chronicles of Narnia movie was the book reincarnate; it was perfect. None of the story was changed too dramatically and there weren't a lot of superfluous additions. Personally, I loved The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe and can't wait for The Horse and His Boy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantasy for infants,"One of the great things about fantasy as a genre is that it can be used to satirise aspects of our own world that we find repugnant. However, the trap of all fantasy films is that a certain grounding in reality has to take place. When a plot device is used, its function must be explained. When a character is able to perform a great feat, the reasons and means must be laid out. Before I go on, I should point out that one video critic laid out a series of rules for judging motion pictures by their titles. One such rule is that the longer the title, the worse the film will be. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very, very long title. And in spite of having a special effects budget that would have had C.S. Lewis salivating, it becomes a very average, ordinary film. Then again, Lewis only gets it as bad as his more famous contemporary, relatively speaking.There is another saying in creative work that when you adapt something into a new medium, you inherit the source material's flaws. Lion inherits quite a few of them, not least of which is Lewis' childish conception of a fantasy world and how it works. Characters are repeatedly killed, turned to stone, or otherwise unpleasantly dealt with. Prophecy, magic, and general plot devices are used to undo all these events. Gee, a world where there is no conflict, no death, and no consequence. You can keep this world, mister Lewis, because it sounds like the same thing as being dead to me. Admittedly, it has been a while since I read the novel on which this extended Play School was based, but I do remember a serious problem with being able to deal with consequence or change there, too. I know this will come as a shock after I have talked about how fantasy epics such as The Lord Of The Rings suffered from the director's wholesale mauling, but this is one case where a big difference from the source material would have helped.Another amusing moment comes when a Santa Claus figure, riding a sleigh into the edge of a forest, hands three of the four children tools for their quest. He tells us that MoneyMas has not been celebrated in Narnia for a century, since the oh-so-evil White Witch came to dominate this land. The audience they are quite obviously aiming this film at might be too young to appreciate this, but as films like Bad Santa helped us appreciate, MoneyMas is only a celebration when you have succumbed to the brainwashing. So Jadis does not celebrate MoneyMas? Okay, get a fantasy creature army going on me, because I do not celebrate it, either. One more amusement is when Dwarrow are shown in the film as simply being diminutive Humans (and yet the presence of regular-sized Human children and adolescents seems so significant). Granted, this is Lewis' fantasy world and not necessarily meant to make physiological sense, but sending such creatures into battle does not tend to strike me as a good tactic.Unfortunately, it is the battles of the film that let it down the worst. After years of viewing such delightful films as RoboCop, violence without consequence easily equals boring to me. And as I indicated earlier, consequence does not seem to have been a word in Lewis' vocabulary. There is no situation from which our characters cannot be given a reset button. Nor, it seems, is there any blood when a five hundred pound lion leaps on a woman who has to weigh a hundred and seventy pounds, tops. And therein lies the fatal flaw that has killed every fantasy film of the past ten years. Lion tries so hard to appeal to that mythical audience of all ages, and winds up appealing to nobody. Tilda Swinton does her best to appear menacing, and she does a decent job in some sequences, to give her credit, but the script literally undercuts her at every turn. It would have been interesting to see how Lion and the next Harry Potty film would have clashed together at the box office, because heaven knows they are made with the same mindset.Words fail me when I try to describe the positives of this exercise in driving in the middle of the road. The film is slower than dragging a dead lion across a yard up to the end, when it suddenly attempts to give the sleeping adults in the audience some positive memories by staging a very ordinary battle sequence. To the credit of the director, he manages to resist the urge to shake the camera about, but the framing of shots is still nonsensical from the point of view of anyone who wants to see anything. To be fair, the film also manages to give viewers a sense of the chaos and suffering that drives the children into rural England in order to set up the action. It is rather amusing to hear Roger Ebert, a man who has been criticising films for several decades, describe Lion as a film sitting on the line between traditional family fare and some new kind of action-oriented family fare. To me, this is symptomatic of the MPAA's utter inability to recognise that there are adults in the audience, and they also have a right, as one expects when they pay obscene amounts of money, to be entertained.I gave Lion a four out of ten. I was gnashing my teeth over whether to give it a five as I gave Jackson's abysmal attempt to put half of The Return Of The King on the silver screen. I even said to another audience member that Lion was a better film, as it certainly had a better sense of pace and flow. However, I lowered the score to four when I realised that so too do most test patterns.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ehhh it holds up alright I guess,"Okay so this explains a bit of a backstory as to why I re-watched this in like 10 years. I took a class for my junior year of college about the writing of C.S. Lewis. This included essays, autobiographies, books, and one of Narnia books, Voyage of the Dawn Treader. When I took that class I never read any of the Narnia books until then, but I was hooked in reading them afterwards. However it took me a while until officially reading them. Then after one long road trip to and from Oklahoma I decided to read the first two Narnia books (chronologically speaking). And while it is written in a way for a more younger audience and some extremely on the nose Christian imagery, the books are pretty dang good, so far. So it was after I finished the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe I was curious as to see how well the film adapted the book, as well as re-watching a movie I had somewhat fond memories of.Needless to say...they hold up about as well as I expected. Not exactly great but not terrible as well. Certainly not as bad as some people made the films out to be.So let's get the first thing out of the way first, the child acting, with one exception, is not very good. Even with bumping Peter and Susan's ages up in the books (both are about preteen age), William Moseley as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan are just not very good. None of the line delivery is believable and they have super dull expressions with the world around them, although to be fair on them director Andrew Adamson can be blamed for this too. William is the worst out of the four as so many of his super serious lines he is given comes off as super laughable. The only one out of the four that is the most tolerable is Georgie Henley as Lucy, but even then she does give a mixed performance. At worst she is wooden and over enunciating, but at best she does capture book Lucy very well, and at least she does feel like she's trying more than the other three. Skandar Keynes does an alright job at times as Edmund, but there are times where his delivery is just not good. Most of the other live action actors do a good job here, like Tilda Swinton, who does a great job at capturing the White Witch, James McAvoy and Jim Broadbent. The voice acting is also decent too, Ray Winstone and Dawn French are pretty great here. But Liam Neeson makes a disappointing Aslan, feeling rather cold and under performing as the voice.The production is pretty great, as it does feel a lot like what Narnia is described in the book. I felt like I was transported in another world. The costumes were excellent, and even most of the visual effects hold up fairly well too for the animals, although there are a ton of bad green-screen composites here. As far as an adaptation goes, it's actually pretty good. While the movie never recaptures the way Lewis describes and narrates in the book, there is an attempt here that is worth praising. There are a few changes here and there, Peter and Susan do get more development than in the book as well as adding more family drama in here that's alright, they explained a lot better why Aslan sacrificed himself to the White Witch, a lot of the Christian imagery is made less ham-fisted like in the book. Although they did manage to beefen up the story with more action scenes and they never made it clear that Edmund was under an enchantment, which is why he betrayed his siblings. But overall it's not terrible of an adaptation. It's loyal and the concessions they did make to fit the screen.The big problem with this movie besides the child acting is that it is VERY clear that the movie wants to be the next Lord of the Rings. So much of the movie dramatizes events from the books or add more stakes in translation, which isn't necessarily bad, but it is clear the intent of Disney wanting a franchise on their hands to compete with the Harry Potter films. And honestly Andrew Adamson, who most people know for co-directing the first two Shrek films (yes...really), he is no Peter Jackson. Which goes double especially for the action scenes that feel incredibly derivative (although having a PG action film certainly doesn't help that matter). I do feel that in terms of fantasy adaptations being released in the 2000s after Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia does hold up far better compared to the likes of Eragon and the Golden Compass, far worse films. But I think that the movie would have been far better if they didn't try to copy another formula and just had a distinct voice for the film.Regardless, it's not exactly a bad movie, but it is held back from far greatness. Still it was a trip watching this movie for the first time in years, so for a nostalgic trip to hold up fairly well, I couldn't ask for anything more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia movie not up to CS Lewis idea of struggle between good and evil,"I went to Narnia expecting it to be near or at the level of the Harry Potter and Ring movies. Not even close due to the weak scripting and\or casting of the four Pevensies. Lucy was great and the only believable one of the four. Peter was cardboard good, Susan was way to ""good"" and Edmund was not nearly ""bad"" enough. CS Lewis believed in Evil, not maladjusted children who suffer mainly from sibling rivalry. The Witch WAS believable because she lusted after power and would literally destroy herself to get it. This was NOT CS Lewis's idea of the struggle between good and evil; it was a Disney version of Christianity that Lewis would have rejected as simplistic and misguided - sort of a cartoon version of Screwtape Letters.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's no Lord of the Rings, but still good","OK, so it's no Lord of the Rings, but is it good? I dare say yes. There are several strong performances, especially from Georgie Henley and William Moseley as the children Lucy and Peter and the magnificent Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. The effects are mostly of good quality, but there are some imperfections and logical flaws. When the movie reached its climax I begun thinking ""Oh no, It's a lord of the rings rip-off, only in a lighter version..."" But then, to my surprise, the final battle was a breath-taking, well-directed and well-played epic encounter which will rate among the top ten screen battles of all times for years to come! (of course below such battle scenes as we remember from Lord of the Rings: Two Towers and Saving Private Ryan but still...) Narnia is great fun and will probably be even more fun for children. The religious symbols are very strong however, and this makes me dislike some parts of the original story (which I consider to be inferior to this film) Especially the parts concerning ""heavy magic"" and ""sacrifice"" are hard to swallow for non-Christians, but still... it's a good movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thank you for starting the movies in correct order!,"Thank you, Andrew Adamson (or whoever made this decision), for starting the movie series with the correct book and thus putting the movies in the correct order.

These books were written for children and should not be compared to books written for adults.Adamson's movie adaptation was excellent. The talking animals were not distracting in the least.

"All in all, good movie","The Chronicles of Narnia is a beloved fantasy series of novels for children and adults. I'm glad to see the first movie translation was done well. Although, there are several parts to this movie that are lacking, special effects not always the best, overall it is very enjoyable. I hope for better efforts for the subsequent novels, but the first outing is admirable. Coming from Disney, however, makes me question whether they can improve or even maintain the quality seen in the first film.This is a great family film, although the action might be too intense for real small children. Some of the characters are simply delightful, and Georgie Henley, as Lucy, impressed me with her young acting chops. The cinematography is very stunning throughout. I was glad for the open, sunny feel of it that helped point this towards being a children and family film rather than a darker, young adult version.I think Disney may have stumbled upon a winner series if it keeps those behind the creation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I can only cross my fingers and hope for a continuation and improvement on this great start.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is a worthy rendition of the book that is loved by millions. Congratulations to Adamson in bringing this master piece to the screen. Also hats off to the children actors who did a wonderful job portraying the Pevensies, especially Georgia Henley. I give this movie a 9/10 because of its loyalty to the book Lewis's vision.

A Stunning piece of cinematography.....People go see this..NOW,"I went to see this movie Yesterday, and well, WOW! Even with the screaming children, cellphones going off in the dark, and overexcited mothers, I was completely drawn into the world of Narnia. For a person who has read the books many times, this movie was as big to me as Harry Potter.I must say that the Children are the main players in this movie. They capture every emotion, every detail. They EVEN LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER. I also must give a shout out to the boy who played Edmund. In my opinion he was the best outa the entire group. Tilda Swanton as the witch was brilliant. HEr make-up, costumes, and acting was superb. All though I felt as though she wasn't getting the right mood for the witch. In some moment s she was nicer then she should of been.As for Aslan, well..WOW! They pulled him off without it looking corny of puppet-like. Liam Neeson as Alsan, was a great choice. As well as all the other voice actors. They gave their characters more depth then in the book.But what I most noticed was the music. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL FOLKS! GO BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! The Narnian music was lyrical, beautiful and heroic. The battle scenes were just that more because of the music.So, all in all, go see THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.

"Very good in many ways, but.....","Much like LOTR, the whole film is somewhat less that the sum of its parts.There where too many trims to the final production, too many little bits and pieces that I just wanted to see, having vivid, yet thirty year old memories of the books, leading to (in my eyes) less than adequate character development of many important characters and or scenes.Its almost like speed-reading the books, a little detail is lost here and there that reduces its over-all value.Having said all of that however, if you are not over familiar with the books, its an excellent movie, the CGI surely sets new standards, the scenery is superb, and even the young actors do a very good job.Had it been a little longer, it might have been close to perfection.Worth a rental, your kids will adore it, and probably get more out of the books as a result.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film that I'm sorry I'm close to hating,"Now I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Like many other people I was mesmerised by the book when I was young and when I heard that they were shooting in New Zealand, I did think for a little while that they may have been borrowing a little too much from Peter Jackson. But I decided that these was going to be nothing like LOTR because the book was its own and so would the film be.How RIGHT I was!Unlike the film version of LOTR, this film left me with an empty feeling in my stomach and for a number of reasons. First things first,as 'Ward deBussac' correctly said, an epic cannot be found just in special effects. And in the case of this film I wasn't at all satisfied with what could be seen as the easiest way to achieve a 'crowdpleaser' (in terms of blockbuster films). The film seem to veer from excellent (beavers and Aslan) to the extremely poor (seeing the outline of the children bodies and the green screen as they 'cross a mountain'ad some of the sets looked like they had been stolen from some school plays). When it came to the special effects I felt a flurry of mixed emotions and I really feel that the beautiful scenery of New Zealand was not put to as good a use as it could have been.My next major problem concerns some of the acting. The oldest's acting was deplorable. A cardboard cutout could have done as good a job. I know that sounds a little harsh but I was extremely disappointed. Then there was little Lucy - yes she was mesmerised. We get it!That same look became very tiring after a while...and what was with the smiling while she was 'crying'? Better than Peter? Yes. Cute? I think not. The actress who played her is more cute in real life than the younger girl she was playing. 6 going on 16 is what I saw.I felt that Tilda Swinton was given too little to work with in terms of her character...and instead of being the frightening figure I remembered from the book she was left looking rather petty and small...hardly a formidable enemy. She was more imposing at the London Premiere!There were parts of the film that I enjoyed such as the beavers purely because I love both Dawn french and Ray Whinestone. However,like many others I felt that there were over important characters that were just swept over or barely acknowledged such as Father Christmas (that scene looking particularly out of place) and Aslan wasn't as imposing of affecting as he could have been.Overall, I desperately wanted to tell people that I enjoyed the film and that I fully recommended it. But alas my expressionless face said otherwise. Like Harry Potter films before, Narnia left me feeling tired and disappointed and desperately hoping for better book adaptations ahead. Go Memoirs of a Geisha!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Whimsical delight,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a magnificent movie, a paradoxically quick epic that doesn't rely on the viewers' being familiar with the source material. It's about four young London siblings who are sent away from home after the Blitz to live with relatives in the country, and who stumble upon an amazing new world entered through the back of an old closet.Anyone who's read C. S. Lewis's books will instantly fall for the elegant way this story is told, from the gorgeous scenery to the wide-eyed innocence and brilliant performances of its mostly young cast. Often with a group of young actors, there's little to distinguish one novice thespian from another, no quirks in personality other than the most rudimentary. But Narnia's Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are each their own person; and what's more, each grows in his and her own way throughout the movie, however subtly.Tilda Swinton is riveting as the evil White Witch, dancing a mighty thin line between hammy and calculating. I believe her screen gravitas alone gave encouragement to the young foursome, headed by Georgie Henley as Lucy, the waif who first stumbles upon the then-frozen land of Narnia. But as I said, each of the Pevensie kids distinguishes themselves in the film, no small task when the indomitable Ms. Swinton is aboard.The movie would be little more than a live-action cartoon, though, if not for the fantastic, realistic CGI used for the animals, particularly that of the enigmatic lion Aslan, voiced by the great Liam Neeson. Not to be outdone, Ray Winstone's Mr. Beaver was a true Cockney treat. All of the graphics, though, were quite believable with nary a moment's hesitation. Well done, indeed. The Chronicles of Narnia should garner a Academy Award nomination for visual effects or set design, I would think.The movie is fairly rated PG for some frightening moments, but it's nothing your kids can't handle (probably). If you've read the books, you know there's one particular scene that might be a tad upsetting to the juniors, but rest assured all will be aright one way or another in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Review!,"I think this film is very neutral to watch since I am not into stuff such as fantasy, creatures. I liked the fact that Narnia is behind the closet but I do think the ending is boring because if it contained a twist or an odd ending, it would have been on my mind but no. The acting is splendid but I do hate the facial expressions they make just because it creates an uneasy feeling in me. Otherwise, this movie has really good concepts due to the creativity of creating a whole ice world prop. Overall, this movie is not the best but one thing I could say is that it is indeed enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty Good,"I have not yet read the books, but my husband really wanted to see the movie so we went last night. I thought the movie was pretty OK. It seemed to drag a bit in the beginning, but once the kids arrived in Narnia, the action picked up over the last half or so of the movie. I thought the boy who played Peter was very good, and has the look of a young Heath Ledger. All the actors where very good, with the White Witch being super. I thought that the animation was good, although I had seen a ""Making of"" special on TV, so I knew where the animation was. I have purchased the complete Chronicles of Narnia and am looking forward to reading them all before the next movie, hinted at, comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantastic tale deserves a fantastic movie,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (LWW) may superficially appear to be another youth inspired romp through arbitrary, meaningless and random prototypical fantasy elements (eg. Harry potter) but is instead an incredible realization of an incredible tale.LWW succeeds in so many ways that its overall quality as a fantasy epic in the vein of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the classic Lord of the Rings is thoroughly apparent.Acting in the picture is tremendous and little if not none of the acting can be faulted for being unauthentic. The voice of the King Aslan done by Liam Neeson in conjunction with likely the best computer graphics effects today (surpassing even the convincing Gollum of the Lord of the Rings) stands as one of the high achievements of the films character portrayal. Susan Pevensie also masterfully plays an intelligent yet worried girl who throughout the film transforms into a young woman of courage. The actors chosen for the various roles seem perfect for their respective roles and in this case the White Witch played by Tilda Swinton is a unique yet powerful choice that justifies the peril of Narnia and its 100 year winter.The landscapes are beautiful and appropriate while all the while being believable. The majority of the movie was filmed in New Zealand much like the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy and so the incredible scenery of the country shine through the movie and are heavily exploited in constructing the incredible scenes of the movie.The music used during the films (as opposed to the credits) is comparable to the tremendous work of Howard Shore in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Harry Gregson-Williams does a tremendous job in constructing an atypical score of beautiful singing and moving orchestral pieces whose excellence is reflected in its ability to complement the non-musical aspects of the movie without overtly standing out. In fact it is not until the soundtrack is heard independently of the movie that one realizes the strength and quality of the musical complement of LWW; such a scenario is ideal. Epic yet unusual is a notion that may be used in describing the score of the LWW.The visual special effects of the movie are so moving and incredible that labeling them as effects does not justify there reality. LWW commands 'special effects' no longer be weighed independently of the heart of film but instead an integral and in the case of LWW an additive component of the story. Creatures such as King Aslan and both mythical and non-mythical beings bring the movie alive and allow the fantastic nature of the CS. Lewis tale to be genuinely visually explored. Moreover real-life actors interact with computer graphically created characters flawlessly and further cement their reality and film existence.The only drawback to the film will be if it isn't followed by a sequel from the CS. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia series. A tremendous film for any fantasy enthusiast and casual movie-goer alike. The greatness of the film is likely to make a strong impact on the majority who enjoy it and permeate the mind only to expand one's imagination.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Has it's Flaws, but Still A Lot of Fun.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the tale of 4 children in London who get sent to live with a professor in the London countryside to avoid the bombings of World War II. There the youngest, Lucy, finds a magical wardrobe that is the entrance to another world called Narnia, a vast landscape of eternal winter placed under a spell by the evil White Witch (who is portrayed marvelously by Tilda Swinton.) Her siblings, Peter, Edmund, and Susan all do not believe her, until one day they all find themselves tumbling through the wardrobe themselves. Once in Narnia, the White Witch, who is the self-proclaimed ruler, tempts Edmund to betray his siblings in exchange for goodies. As the other 3 try to find Edmund, they come to find that as children of Eve, they are the ones who will fulfill the prophecy of Narnia and bring end to the 100-year winter.Narnia: tLtWatW, like many other series of books set to film, feels a lot like a demo to something much larger. Much like the Harry Potter series with The Sorcerers Stone, this film works more like something that is setting the solid foundation for the Narnia's yet to come. The film has a very surreal and intriguing feel, yet it lacks in a lot of critical areas, such as acting and development.The cast of Narnia is almost entirely made up of unknowns and that works both for and against it. With the obvious sequels due out, we now have a lot more time to know and love the 4 Pevensie children. However, their time in tLtWatW is obviously spent getting a feel for what is expected of them, and that isn't to say that makes their performances bad per say, just curiously lacking. The character development of Nanria is hurt primarily by the hurried pace of the film itself.From the very beginning the viewer doesn't care too much for the overly obnoxious Edmund, and the film never really gives Edmund time enough to make a second impression. Also, the advancement of courage displayed by Peter, while admirable and enjoyable to watch, unfolds in too short of a time without much reasoning. The roles of the children, with the exception of the always-lovable Lucy, just cant seem to keep up with the fast passed enchantment of Narnia.While the look of Narnia itself, at first glance is stunning and quietly beautiful, a closer look shows a much more static environment that leaves a lot of room for capitalizing on in the next installment. For pure enjoyment sake, Narnia looks great, and has a lot of nice touches, but to achieve the level of the aforementioned Harry Potter sets (who was also lacking in its first attempt) there is a large amount of static to be removed from the sets and a higher level of set to actor interaction that must be achieved.The good thing however, is that with the previously mentioned, none of them are particularly big enough details to take away too much from the overall look and feel of Narnia.It might sound like I am I being a bit hard on Narnia: tLtWatW, and I really don't mean to be. This film is a lot of fun and has a lot of enjoyable aspects. The creatures the children come across; the beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the Nanria equivalent of Santa Clause, a centaur, the frightening and magical White Witch and of course the great lion Aslan, are all beautifully done and are what really make Narnia so much fun.The special effects are another aspect of the film that deserve a lot of credit, they are done extremely well by sfx group WETA, and they are the backbone in bringing the world of Narnia to life. There is one particular scene where Edmund calls an archery air strike on the advancing enemy, an air strike that shows the magical transformation of arrows into phoenix, that is very much applause worthy.The only fault that I hold Narnia: tLtWatW inexcusable on is the uneven bridge between the literature and the film. The film adaptation of Narnia leaves a lot to the minds of those who have not read C.S. Lewis's novel. When Lucy first enters Narnia she encounters Mr. Tumnus not 15 feet from the wardrobe entrance, which is in no way secretly hidden from the inhabitants of Narnia. If the land of Narnia is under the curse of eternal winter, why don't the Narnians just leave? Is it because they are forbidden to go through the wardrobe? It can't be because they don't know about it, with 4 children just passing through it and all. And why is there a war waging in Narnia, what happened there? It's the obvious questions like these that director's just cant chose not to answer on the assumption of everyone already knowing the story.All in all, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a film, if not taken too seriously, can be a lot of fun for everyone watching. While the film lacks in a few areas it has more than enough in its favour to make it worth your time. There are not many films today that can be honestly enjoyed by the whole family, and Narnia is one of those films. Narnia: tLtWatW left a lot of room for advancement, and with other obvious future Narnia films yet to come, we can expect fantastic things from this series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

the ice queen is a chester,"Nothin' GRAPE but pretty decent. I wanted to watch this after seeing harry potter and lotr thinking it was gonna be a similar experience of fantasy film franchises. This a l m o s t got it, but it's kind of missing something.Edmund is probably the best character because he goes through a lot emotionally, while the other kids don't really change all that much from start to finish. All of the kid acting is pretty good for kid acting and I love all the characters (ESPECIALLY TUMNUS HE'S A DREAMBOAT). The CG is mostly okay? but sometimes it sticks out a little and at first I wanted to give it a pass since it came out in 2005, but then I remembered that LotR and 4 harry potter movies had come out before then and looked way better. I'm not saying Narnia can't be good because they did it better, but it could've been a lot more polished.Everything else is pretty good and it makes for a fun fantasy movie to watch with a friend. My sister and I were cheering and yelling the whole time at different points (especially when the ice witch was basically sexually harassing edmund, my god), and it's good enough for what it's trying to do.dreamboat edmund, peter, and tumnus btw",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really really cool!,"Hey yo, Well this is my first comment and i think it is the best if i start with Narnia. I would definitely put this movie as the first in my list after LOTR and HP. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell really play their character really well but the one who stole the spotlight would be of course Georgie Henley. She can really make everyone go ""ooowwwwwww!!!"". In my opinion, this movie is not totally cheeky and childish, in fact there is so much drama and character development in just over two hours time. This would be a really good contender against HP = Goblet of Fire.But there is one thing that really capture my attention about this movie, that is the symbolic of Christianity. It is so clear in this movie that. Even though Narnis doesn't have the evangelism factor, but still it was a good encouragement to most Christian out there. All i could say about this movie is that this is a great movie for everyone who has read the book nor haven't read it yet. Most comment i heard from those who read it says that it doesn't live up till their expectations. In my opinion, what the?! How can anyone thought that what they read is what they will get from the movie. Maybe today's society expectations is to high and demanding than ever before. I think this movie is great and there is no other words too describe this movie anymore.CATCH THIS MOVIE OR YOU WILL BE SORRY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""He's a beaver, he shouldn't be saying anything!""","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBEAn Andrew Adamsson blockbusterWorld War II is raging and the four Pevensie children are sent away from their mother to live in the mansion of the eccentric professor Kirke (entertaining, if wasted, Jim Broadbent). During a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a wardrobe that leads to a different world. It's Narnia, a land which has been plagued by winter for hundreds of years, ruled with an iron fist by the evil witch queen Jadis (Tilda Swinton). The Pevensies must defeat the witch and take their places as kings and queens of Narnia.I can't tell you how sick I am of movies with never-ending titles. If it isn't something as overlong as CON: TLTWTW, it's Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Fun With Dick and Jane, or The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl in 3-D. All I'm saying is, a movie title should have quality rather than quantity.This is truly a film where acting almost comes last. An effects fest, NARNIA opens up with a mostly CGI sequence showing the German bombs falling over London. We are after that treated with talking CGI beavers, CGI wolves and foxes, CGI castles, entire CGI landscapes. WETA (previously worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy) has also done a great make-up work, starting out with a nervous James McAvoy as a faun, all the way up to a huge battle between everything from cheetahs to minotaurs in the finale. Fans of fantasy shouldn't be disappointed: There are few mythical creatures that you won't find somewhere in NARNIA.Moving on to the acting, however, this is where the film almost falls apart. For all the talking CGI animals, NARNIA simply does not contain a single believable performance from the leads. Voice acting aside, it often feels like all we see is a bunch of amateurs trying to act. William Moseley is simply laughable as Peter ""the magnificent"". He handles the ""older brother"" act fairly well for a newbie, but when he's suddenly put in full body armour and in charge of an army, it just doesn't work. Much more believable is Georgie Henley as the youngest sister. Anna Popplewell's interpretation of Susan is pretty ho-hum, while Skandar Keyes is far below average as Edmund. Much younger actors than him have created believable characters (read: Hayley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense) and the casting is just horrible.Tilda Swinton's White Witch, supposedly the biggest main character in the movie (the CGI lion aside) is nothing special. She is definitely not awful, she just misses something to make her character memorable (although writing also should be blamed for this).The biggest waste is probably Liam Neeson who shows up in the last 20 minutes to voice a computer generated lion, Aslan, the messiah of the film. Even he seems to have a hard time putting some emotion to his voice acting, and his voice seems out of place, plain and simple.Andrew Adamson has had no problem delivering the goods with his half-raunchy, hilarious comedies Shrek and Shrek 2, so why doesn't it work in NARNIA? Well, it's quite simple: While the Shrek movies were satirical parodies, Adamson wants to make NARNIA the next big epic in the vein of the recent Lord of the Rings films, something he is just not capable of, especially considering that the novel was a cute and cozy children's story. The Narnia novels are amazing in their own genre, but Adamson has got it all wrong: they are just not supposed to be epic adventures.The final battle feels like a cheat; since this is supposed to be a Disney movie, there can be no real violence or gore except for some faint flashes. The witch's death takes place off-screen, which is just lame. As mentioned before, William Moseley is completely out of place as the hero-of-the-day and only manages to look silly.Overall, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a complete waste of time. There are some really good effects, but if you're looking for anything memorable, forget it. NARNIA is a run-of-the-mill blockbuster which is very disappointing considering Adamson's previous work and the amazing novel. Except for a small cameo by Rupert Everett, resurrected from Shrek 2, there's just not much fun here. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""What were you children doing in the wardrobe?""","This movie joins the legion of films based on books I was supposed to read as a younger kid, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a solid adaptation of the CS Lewis novel. For this uninitiated viewer, I found aspects of other fantasy movies sprinkled in the story, with some elements of greater theology thrown in there for good measure. Tilda Swinton plays the evil White Witch (though we never find out how she becomes so powerful or how she recruits her followers) who proclaims herself the ruler of Narnia. The kingdom resides in the back of a wardrobe in an English countryside home where four children flee to during World War II's Battle of Britain bombardment of London. While trying to hide from the housekeeper, the children enter Narnia where they become entangled in the war between the white witch and animals of Narnia, lead by a lion named Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). The kids, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are used by the Witch to proclaim war against Aslan's forces, setting up a battle sequence right out of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. The prodding by the White Witch reminded me of Darth Vader in the Star Wars movies, perhaps shedding light on the source material for George Lucas and his mythology. There is also an undeniable religious slant to the pivotal Aslan scenes, as the parallels between Aslan and Christ cannot be overlooked. It's not a bad thing, and critical viewing of this movie could be used to discuss stories of the Bible without overtly discussing potentially dicey topics. Overall, the movie is entertaining, though a tad long, I thought some scenes could have been trimmed, allowing the story to flow better. The beavers (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French) are not only funny and bring some levity to an otherwise heavy movie, but the animation is top-notch, producing believable beaver tour guides for the characters and viewers. Lovers of the book will like this movie, while other viewers may be entertained in the levels of mythology featured in the movie and their relations to theology.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A wonderful story of family, forgiveness, sacrifice and salvation","When I saw the first trailer for this film, back in July, I was so excited! It reminded me of what I felt when I saw the first trailer for Lord Of The Rings. And like LOTR, it did not disappoint! This is a wonderful film, beautifully told and phenomenally illustrated! One of the best films of the year, easily and in my personal top 2. Georgie Henley as Lucy pulls off the best child acting performance since Dakota Fanning in I Am Sam. Watching her eyes light up as she sees things tells so much, even when what she is looking at is probably a CGI green screen. This film is an instant classic and a masterpiece sure to go down in history. For a children's tale, the battle scene is a little graphic and some of the creatures look like they are right out of Lord Of The Rings! Therefore, I highly recommend this film to anyone ages 13+. It contains a wonderful story and a strong message of family, forgiveness, sacrifice and salvation. A+",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not as good as it thinks it is,"I'm not going to go over the ground so many of the other comments have made, although several of the comments frankly baffle me. Tilda Swinton was great as the ice-cold Machiavellian ruler, but fell far short believably beguiling Edmund. Why he should have considered trusting such an obviously ill-intentioned character was incomprehensible, and I put this down to her simply not understanding what her character was up to. I read the book the best part of 30 years ago and recall her being sweet and enticing rather than simply ordering him to betray his siblings. (Surely, being just a little older than myself, she read the books as a child? They were all the rage in the late 60s with younger kids, as LOTR was with older ones.) My other big gripe is with the SFX. Did I really see the same film as the one those who praised the CGI, the landscapes and the animals? A significant amount of the blue/green screen work looked cheap and unfinished - it may have passed muster 10 years ago, but not today! I've never been a fan of anthropomorphous animals (except for the occasional cartoon), but with the possible exception of the beavers, the sounds being made did not believably emanate from the animals' mouths. I found this particularly weird given Adamson's experience with CGI animation.Of course, many of the reviews here (and elsewhere) have compared this movie to the LOTR trilogy or the Potter franchise: Disney probably doesn't discourage such comparisons, if they're favourable. Regrettably, in my mind, such favourable comparisons are misplaced: LOTR's scope and geography beats Narnia into a cocked hat, and the mass battles of Jackson's trilogy have set a very high benchmark; Narnia doesn't come close with its battle, which I couldn't even call ""eye candy"". Potter is a very different animal, the continuing storyline being its main attraction, and characterisation built over the series as the trainee witches and wizards mature. Attempting to show such growth in the limited running time of a single movie was always going to be difficult, and given even my foggy recollection of the book, much development was lost at the expense of under-whelming visuals.A fairly crude measure of my enjoyment of a film is how long into it I am desperate for a break and how often I need to check my watch, and by that measure, this film fails rather spectacularly, as I lasted no more than half an hour before my attention wavered. LOTR and all but the first Potter movie came off admirably in comparison, but even that did better than this piece of over-hyped bandwagon-jumping.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia met expectations!,"My kids and I went to see Narnia on the first day and were hopeful that Narnia would be as good at being Narnia as Lord Of The Rings was at being Lord Of The Rings. We had read both series of books to our four children prior to them seeing the movies. My kids were very disappointed with the late '80's BBC, low-budget adaptation. The depth and humor that C.S. Lewis brilliantly added to the characters--with which my children desperately wanted to identify with was missing from the BBC film--but not from Adamson's (Disney's) version.What a pleasure to watch a 2+hour movie with all my kids and not have to take anyone to the restroom! No one was fidgety or bored. The characterizations were exactly what my kids were hoping for--they were as depicted in the books. From my teenager to my three year old, all were sad when the final credits came and they were immediately ready for the next Narnia picture...and to think this devotion was founded without excessive blood, nudity, violence, cussing or adult situations.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply magical,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an enchanting tale of magical creatures and places, a battle of good and evil, and of four children coming to terms with both being in a strange new land and their great importance to it. Originally a children's book, there is much for both younger and older viewers to enjoy.Like many English fans, I grew up with the old BBC television series, which was corny, hammy and wooden in the extreme, yet ultimately endearing and magical. Sunday nights were never the same after it finished. So it was with a slight sense of trepidation that I went to see this sacrilegious new version of one of my favourite books as a child. As it turns out, I needn't have worried, for director Andrew Adamson has blown the Beeb's version out of the water – as was expected by most. While most obviously the film benefits from a mega-budget the BBC could only dream of, the acting of the young leads is also superior. Here, Lucy (Georgia Henley) is even more wide-eyed and innocent, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) even more of a snotty little so-and-so, and Susan (Anna Popplewell) more mother hen-ish and reasoned. But there seems to be also a rather unlikeable quality to Popplewell's Susan; she seems much whinier than many fans will remember from the books – and it is supposed to be Edmund who is the unlikeable one. The best acting of the four however comes from the eldest; William Moseley's Peter here is less assuming or decisive. While he still takes great care of his siblings, the oldest Pevensie is portrayed by Moseley as being a more reluctant hero, taking more seriously his duty to his brother and sisters than that of saviour and King of Narnia – adding previously unseen depth to the character. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the voice of Aslan; his regal, dulcet tones perfectly fitting for the magnificent lion. But the show stealer is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Many have complained about her hair being blonde rather than black, but that is all that there can possibly be to complain about her performance. Her icy stare and cold demeanour, coupled with a restrained performance (in a role such as this it would be very easy to attempt to echo Barbara Kellerman's over-the-top performance in the TV series) perfectly capture the seductive and later chilling essence of Jadis. Ray Winstone, Dawn French and Rupert Everett provide a (greatly required) slightly lighter side to the film as the voices of Mr and Mrs Beaver, and Fox (a new character). Winstone especially is terrifically funny as the geezer beaver with the cockney accent.The narrative itself is simple and easy to follow, as befits a film which is primarily a children's story. But still, Adamson handles the action extremely competently, especially considering this is his first live-action film (he is primarily known for directing the Shrek films). Obviously there is a heavy allegorical slant to that of the life of Jesus Christ which some may find distasteful, but if you can get past that then there is a terrific story to enjoy, and visuals for your jaw to truly drop at. One of the most important sequences in the book is when Lucy steps into the wardrobe and emerges into Narnia for the first time. The sheer wonder felt by the young girl at seeing this entire snow-covered world in the back of a piece of furniture in an English country house is shared with the audience. The creatures too are excellent, centaurs and fauns blending seamlessly their human and CGI body parts.There is a smattering of new material in the film that appeared in neither the book or the TV series that may have die-hard fans spitting feathers, but the added scenes, including a stand-off on a slowly-melting frozen river and a prologue in wartime London, serve to add necessary depth to the characters. The final battle scene is also considerably extended from the two pages it had in C. S. Lewis's book to a battle to nearly rival that of Pelennor Fields (the first of many Rings comparisons).The score is beautiful; Harry Gregson-Williams has created a musical setting to nearly rival anything produced by Mr Shore. However the lack of anything choral or a stand-out phrasing to serve as a signature for the film means that the soundtrack alone will probably be better suited to background music rather than your full attention. A piece with the drama and power of 'The Bridge of Khazad-Dumb, for example, would have topped off the soundtrack very nicely.But this is only a minor criticism; Andrew Adamson has created a magical interpretation of the ultimate fantasyland, an accurate translation from page to screen, an exciting and captivating story and enchanting characters. As the original story was rather short, he does not need to get bogged down in detail and can therefore proceed through the film at a brisk pace, picking up speed to reach full throttle in time for the final battle. Although the film is over 2 hours, the time will simply not be noticed.A useful side-note for cinema-goers – watch through the acting credits for an extra sequence with Lucy and the Professor (an under-used Jim Broadbent – not often you can say that about him!) which may provide teasing hints for the future of the franchise.Roll on Prince Caspian!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Disappointed, to say the least","As much as my wife and I were looking forward to the recent release of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" I very disappointed with the movie, even judging it on its own merits and not comparing it to the book or previous movies. However, as primitive as the 1998 movie version of this book was, it far exceeded ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" in so many ways. In this movie, the casting was horrible, the dialog was terrible and emotionless (especially Tumnus  James McAvoy), the actors unattractive (Tilda Swinton and Georgie Henley), and most importantly, the Andrew Adamson (director) didn't capture the essence of the C.S. Lewis book. There was too much focus on Mrs. MacReady (minor character) and not enough focus on the Professor. The audio of the special effect characters, such as Aslan, Beavers, and Fox, was too close to the audience and not in place with the setting of the scene.I would have given the movie 1 of 5 stars had it not been for the special effects, which were truly amazing. Talking animals, flying beasts, hybrid goons, and a fantastic battle scene added to the excitement of the moment and I temporarily forgot how awful the rest of it was.The movie ending doesn't allow for a smooth continuation, and I seriously doubt they'll get the funding to do a sequel.

Beautiful,"I have no words to describe it. Actually I left the movie theater a bit dizzy. That movie was one of the best ever made. It's just a pity that not everybody understands the meaning of it all. It's a big metaphor about the story that's in the largest treasure of all: the Creator's Word (commonly known as 'Bible'). I could see it through all the movie. When the Pevensies come to Narnia, it's enslaved by the white witch. It represents the world, enslaved by the devil. Aslan represents The Creator. We can see temptation, the fall of the human race, betrayal, and then come forgiveness (to Edmund, meaning to all of us), love, sacrifice (representing the sacrifice The Lord Jesus made for all of us, taking all our faults over Himself), the resurrection and how The Lord had victory in the battle against death and hell (before the sacrifice, it even shows Aslan walking alone and sad in the garden, like The Lord in the garden of Getsemani), the battle between angels and demons (it's interesting because they were all the same creatures in the beginning, but some of them surrendered to the witch), the breath of life (when Aslan breathes over the dead creatures and bring them back to life, the river that comes from the throne of the King, and etc etc etc. It's wonderful how The Lord can use anything He wants to spread the message of His Gospel. Even something like Disney. I hope this comment will help people to understand and enjoy the real meaning of that movie. C.S. Lewis was a blessed man indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
very enjoyable,"Heartwarming, intense - a great story. Some parts were more faithfully captured than others, but this movie has plenty of widespread appeal. There is minimal gore, but enough action. Overall, the kid acting wasn't bad, and Tilda Swinton was truly spectacular as the White Witch. At times the story seemed to jump ahead without much explanation, but so does the book. Also, the movie jumps ahead at many of the same places that the book does - but provides more back-story at others. Aesthetically very pleasing, although perhaps not as technically polished as something like the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On the other hand, it was nice that the movie didn't rely much on sweeping visuals. The visual effects were there when needed. Great sound, great soundtrack. Few complaints if any. I think that if anything people might be turned off by the fact that holding to the book also causes the movie to seem kind of anachronistic sometimes. But it was nice not to see the movie suffer because of a need to be updated for contemporary American culture or anything like that. I personally would have appreciated more realistic violence, but I think that this qualifies as a family film, so it works.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
even the beaver had a suit of armour,"I have never read the books. I really looked forward to seeing this film. I cannot say enough how horribly disappointed I was. A talking lion. Talking beavers. More CGI than I have ever seen in any one film. And absolutely at it's core, no story whatsoever. Pretentious and sanctimonious prattle. Completely unbelievable. I would have given twenty minutes -- any twenty minutes -- from any of the LOTR films then The Chronicles of Narnia. This is clearly Disney's attempt to cash in on what began with the Harry Potter films -- their foray into epic children's stories and the cash cow that they have generated. Brought to you by the man that gave the world ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"", no less, who sat in a dark theatre watching LOTR and drooling over Peter Jackson's masterpiece and thought in all his naiveté, in all his conceit, ""I can do that too.""",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm a Chronicles purist and I thought it is worthy of an Oscar!,"This movie is AMAZING! I love the books and have read them many times and although it does not go strictly by the book it follows it pretty darn well. The acting is great and the special effects are sensational! Before I saw the movie, I was so scared that they were going to hire kids who could not act, but when I watched the movie I was stunned. They were great and may I say Peter (the oldest boy)was pretty good look-in! Anywho,... not once during the entire movie are you bored. Throughout the movie I was laughing, crying, or gripping my seat. You always want to know what is going to happen next. Go to your local theater and spend 8 bucks, it is worth it. If you only see one movie this year, see The Cronicles of Narnia!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
wow!,"Absolutely wonderful! I loved it! Obviously Narnia is portrayed differently than what's in my mind but it was awesome overall! The actors did their parts very well. Go see the movie! It's the best! :D I would've expected Aslan's mane to be more longer to create that gentleness but it's all good. And, the witch's castle was so cool-all that ice and that prison! I loved the part where all four of them are seated on the thrones with Aslan dictating, it was glorious. Oh yeah, the faun, Mr.Tumnus-he was coolio! ;) Great movie!By the way, I went for the 6:45 show and it was sold out! I had to get in for the 9:30 show and even that one had a huge line and it was packed. I am definitely going to get it on DVD when it comes out.The website is wicked too. There are games to play, and much more!Adamson should be happy! This is huge! I love this movie because it has a powerful statement. I wonder what C.S. Lewis would think if he knew what was happening to his books (or at least one of them). But, I do hope they continue the series. But, the sequels shouldn't be a bore. I mean look at all the other series! Most of them get boring after the first one or second.You know what? I think I had tears in my eyes at places but sssshhh! No one would have seen it because it was dark. :)Go watch it! It's breath-taking!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Script & Storyline,"My fairs of this being a Disney production was that the story would be changed to a point that it would lose the magic for me and my children. To my surprise this was not the case and in fact I was very pleased to see that the movie stuck closely to the book. I understand that Disney was only able to secure the rights to the first of the books and that this was a test to see how true they could be. Given the quality and the faithfulness to the book I expect and hope that this will be the first of the six or seven books. The casting was very good with all the characters holding true to the books. An outstanding performance from the Ice Queen, and Lucy added credibility to the movie. The CGI was of a quality we have all come to expect making it seamless and invisible.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent movie that shouldn't be lumped into any category,"I've read the book and I had a clear remembrance of the BBC version of this story before going into the theater to see this film. I was ready to be disappointed. I kept hearing on the news and reading about how this is such a strong Christian allegory. I am rather angry that this movie was marketed only as that. First and foremost, it is a wonderful story of childhood adventures and growing up in a wonderful fantastical series of events. I am a Christian and I've known CS Lewis was a great Christian writer, and yes, the events in this movie may mirror that of Christian beliefs, but, it should not be called a Christian movie. I believe that this film has been done an injustice by telling people it is a Christian movie. It limits its audience and its capacity to inspire outside of the (sometimes rather closed minded) realm of Christianity. It is a work of art written for children. My eight year old kid brother does not grasp the Christian allegory and I don't think that he needs to right now. He loved the movie and the book. He likes Lucy because she is adventurous, he relates well with Edmund and he sees Peter as a role model. I've found him standing on his bed holding a play sword and pretending to fight in the great battle just like Peter. He sees courage in these children and relates to them. That is what this movie is about! Inspiration to overcome fear and see what you are really capable of! The Christian allegory is one event in this movie, and yes, it is moving as it reminds us all about Jesus, and I don't want to belittle that, but the people this movie will most effect are the kids. If you go to see this movie, take in the full scope of the story and don't focus alone on the Christian side. Every aspect of this film is filled with uplifting messages and they should not be missed while you are focused on the allegory. The acting is amazing, the set design is beautiful. The story stands alone as a marvelous example of hope and courage. See it for the enjoyment of a great story! Not for your religion.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Through a child's eyes,"I liked it. I liked the Christian analogy. I liked the symbolism and the message of redemption. It was entertaining and the performances, direction and special effects were excellent. Enough said about that. The movie, Narnia, held my attention as a Grandma; however, I was a little concerned whether my 7 year old Granddaughter would be able to hang in through the long hours. I was also concerned that some of the scarier parts would be frightening to her. Well, she hung in and wasn't particularly scared except when the (I'm trying to avoid a spoiler) lion was put on the stone. It's not for a child younger than 7 and it's not for every 7 year old. I did think the conversation that came afterward was a beneficial one. Explaining why this movie was an analogy to Christianity was a good opening to a discussion about always trying to do one's best and how God's forgiveness is always there for us.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a vacuous vehicle latched onto by philistine fools,"Disney's approaching the philistine mega & evangelical churches was a disgusting marketing ploy along the same lines as the equally disgusting yet aptly bloodthirsty worshiping ""Passion of the Christ"" - it's all a sign of the times. A time when corporatism and warmongering and religion go hand in hand. A time when the worship of money and power match up quite nicely with what was wrought from 2000 years of bloody history from organized religion.But what the mega & evangelical church pastors didn't bargain for perhaps was a plot-less heartless mess of the film. Knowing how it was being used by the churches & Disney cast a wide shadow which almost prevented me from seeing it. But I did see it Christmas day. And what I found was a soulless movie. A movie which matches up with the soulless corporatist warmongering which modern conservative churches wallow in today in America. There was no plot. No feeling. The talking animals were absurd, and their talking disgraced & demeaned what our fellow animals really are - just as Disney's films did in the past.The only useful thing I got out of the film was thinking again about the whole absurd nature of the mythical Jesus's resurrection. Lewis makes a vague reference to it with when the lion sacrifices himself. But what does he sacrifice himself for? Why does he do it? Because of an arbitrary and chosen law. An adherence to ""old magic."" ""It's all poppycock,"" I thought, ""just as is what Christians claim happened with their mythical Jesus, in paying for sins passed down to us by our fathers. The concept that sons & daughters must pay for the sins of their fathers is a reprehensible concept,"" I thought some more.So perhaps the church preachers succeeded in having a message conveyed, by latching onto Disney's corporatist fascist greed in a disgusting marketing attempt to use religion to market their mess of a film - but the message conveyed is perhaps not what the preachers wanted perhaps. The synergistic marketing conveyed a message that organized religion in America today primarily worships at the feet of fascist corporatist warmongering. And the film itself, with it's vacuous & wrote nature, shows that it's little more than a self serving vehicle for the corporation known as Disney, a vehicle which the philistine evangelical churches latched on to to serve their own selfish interests.The poor person centered teachings of the mythical Jesus are far removed from these blatant but vacuous attempts to suck ever more of the uneducated & increasingly disenfranchised American workers, into an ever increasing sense of self denial & delusion - but a state of self denial which serves New American Fascism. Yes, fascism is on the march in America, and sadly Lewis's Narnia is yet another victim.For comparison, the Narnia story as conveyed on PBS a few years ago was more interesting. But I recommend not wasting your time on this latest mess. Instead, go buy the expanded DVD versions of Lord of the Rings, and maybe check out the PBS Narnia version from your local library or buy it - if you were a fan of the written version. But don't waste your time on this wannabee imitator - on this vacuous soulless sham of the film latched onto by preachers who love war, money, and corporatist power wrought through disgusting marketing synergies. Bletch. Away from me you trashy film. Away from me thou philistines.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a rewarding journey,"I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking & well-made movie. It successfully beckoned this adult viewer on a journey into the imagination & a world of fantasy. It has a great amount of relevance to the modern issues of child & adult alike. It was dramatic & absorbing in its unfolding story. Thereby appealing to young viewers, but too, held more complex messages for older viewers of any age. It works well on multiple levels, appealing to different kinds of viewers & their personal lives & concerns.It was also so true to life with the youngest of the children being the one whose concerns were initially overridden & derided. But too, it was this girl who actually was most open to the whole adventure that was about to engulf all their lives. How true of the nature of so many family & school situations, where such young minds are not appreciated or taken seriously or unjustly crushed, in our logical but deceptive world of experts, all bringing their common weight of superiority to dismiss any alternative thought, especially in a younger child.Yet this innocent girl is the one who finds this world & its curiousities joys & terrors more quickly & fully, while the older children are still struggling to look beyond their sense of self-importance. Isn't this so true of human nature in general? Especially in the modern adult world where any minority belief is mostly harshly scrutinised & criticised & dismissed. This movie offers a gentle message that the imagination & individual creative thought can be encouraged in us all. As surely as each of these children is duly given special gifts & talents that may help their individual personalities, & each other, even their broader community.The character of the God-like hero of a lion, covering for his kingdom & its constituents, is most thoughtful & impressive. A wise leader who literally serves his kingdom, as the best of leaders do! Also impressive were the use of special effects & magnificent scenery, with intriguing creatures & beautiful colourful costumes.All in all, those who take this journey to Narnia with an open mind & heart, will be rewarded for whatever gifts & sense of wonder that they bring to this very enjoyable & effective movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical,"I personally loved this movie. The acting was great and although I know many people would want to disagree with me I thought that the characters were well developed, especially young Lucy. The special effects did not leave as much to be desired as people claim in fact they were quite good other than the use of the blue screen in some places. My two 9 year old were with me when my husband and I want to go see this movie and their eyes were glued to the screen the whole time, they actually passed up getting a refill of popcorn for fear of missing part of the movie and that never happens. There are some movie which are good, some which are bad, and some which are magical. This is definitely one of those magical ones. The type where you walk out of the theater and there are no words to describe the movie. Ignore the critics this movie is one in one million.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Utterly disgusting, a shameful mockery of the beloved fantasy classic","Many years ago a great literary genius captured children's imaginations with an astonishing fantastical masterpiece inspired an old vision of his in which a faun was standing in the snow holding an umbrella.In 2005, Disney  after watching for years the excitement and wonder that the Harry Potter adaptations had conjured up - became jealous of Warner Brothers for their incredible ability to create such an incredible fantasy series that people of all ages could enjoy and used this novel to try and do the same.The results are ghastly, clearly all these people are interested in is making just another depthless action blockbuster and since they can't be bothered coming up with their own story they've borrowed someone else'. Here we see that in chasing this nightmarish dream the director  Andrew Adamson  has abandoned the story, the richness, the warmth and the characters and left them to rot while he tries to cook up an entire film based purely on special effects and stunt work. Well I must say he's failed at that, the cheaply done CG animals are so lifeless and fake that they make plastic figurines look like the real thing. The same can be said for the painfully numerous action scenes which are slow, irritating, completely unnecessary and appear to be merely dodgy tricks to fill in time.The cast is almost no help at all; most of them give such bland performances that the marvellous array of different characters just becomes one big tedious mess. I doubt any of them have even read the book let alone understood it, and they seem to have just gone with the obvious stereotype. The best example of this is the clueless Tilda Swinton, who gives such a revolting performance that she should have her Oscar confiscated. Jardis is a tyrannical monster of a woman that seeks to control all of Narnia no matter the cost, Swinton turns her into a harmless ditsy little fairy princess.Though that said there are a few exceptions: Georgie Henley is just perfect as Lucy, the young actress portrays the character with all the sweetness, innocence and vulnerability that she deserves; James McAvoy does show the tentative, emotional and brave sides of Mr Tumnus very well; and Jim Broadbent does a fair job in the role of the professor.But all in all this is nothing short of pathetic, aside from those three actors there is not a smidgeon of talent to be seen in any areas of this film and it is a terrible adaptation of C.S.Lewis' treasured rare gem.However, devoted fans of the book do not despair: there is a splendidly done 1988 BBC television adaptation directed by Marilyn Fox and starring Sophie Wilcox, Jonathan.R.Scott, Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Barbara Kellerman and William Todd Jones.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""...Narnia"" was Amazing!!!","I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a few months. I absolutely loved it!!!! It was very well done and there were few changes to the story (which I was worried about). The special effects (in my opinion) were excellent. And the casting was incredible. I loved how the movie remained so close to the book, with a few slight alterations that worked. I also loved the comedic moments that were built in to the movie.

Stupendous...,"...is the only word I can use to describe this picture. It's glorious to see how well Lewis' creation is brought to the screen. Everything is believable, from the recreation of the Blitz, to the children themselves, to the Wardrobe (which looks exactly as I imagined it when I read the books so long ago!) and every facet of the recreation of Narnia, the landscape, the creatures, the White Witch, the Lion, the faun, and the Beavers!What an achievement. I was weeping with joy when it was over. I was so afraid that Lewis' gorgeous books, which mean so much more than they appear to on the surface, would be diminished by trying to make them into film, but they are enhanced. I want to go back and read them all again! And I can't wait for the next film!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I want to go to Narnia,"I read Harry Potter Goblet of Fire and found the movie rendition to be severely lacking in detail. I read Chronicles of Narnia and felt the director did an excellent job capturing all the important points of the movie.I took my 11 and 14 year old kids to see this movie yesterday and they, like me, loved the movie immensely. I would probably hesitate taking any child younger than 10 because some of the battle scenes are quite intense; that having been said, I don't recall seeing any blood or anything like that so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.The set locations were breath-taking and really captured the magic of a place like Narnia. The animation/computer special effects were for the most part excellent, especially the animals. There is one particular scene where the main characters stand with a vast scene behind them and it's quite obvious they're standing in front of a blue wall and the image was imposed afterward. Other than that though, brilliant.For kid actors, these guys did much better than the Harry Potter crew did their first time out; they were a lot more convincing in my opinion.Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant,"Haven't read the book of this but saw an animated version many years ago. I was blown away by this adaption.The story follows a family of 4 children, sent away by their mother to live with a professor away from the war zone that threatened their lives. The house is pretty sterile, the professor stand-offish and it seems the kids will be bored out of their brains. While in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy, the youngest child (and star of the movie), stumbles across a wardrobe that leads somehow into the magical land of Narnia. When Lucy returns and retells her adventure, everyone thinks she is crazy, but eventually they discover Narnia exists. As they check out Narnia, they become caught up in a battle. You'll need to see it to find out more.The movie is an adaption of the CS Lewis classic. The movie version, due to Disney's brilliance, brings great power and passion to Lewis's story and I'm pretty sure he'd be happy with the portrayal. Many may not know that the message behind the story is the message of Jesus, portrayed through Aslan. It shows us the purpose of Jesus' life- to die as a sacrifice for others. The story also features many themes close to Lewis' heart- forgiveness, redemption, the search for truth.Excellent movie for the kids- there are a few scary scenes with some animals and some battles, but most kids 7+ should be fine. Excellent effects too.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Totally awesome!,"So, I've never read the books. I tried to read them when I was young, but it couldn't hold my short attention span. But I was totally pulled into the film and the good part of not knowing the books was that I wasn't at all disappointed. In fact, it was so good it made me actually want to pick up the book and try again...something I haven't ever really considered doing. After it was over I was tempted to sneak into another theater where it was playing and watch it again. I can't wait to take my family to see it. The battle sequence was cool...but the parts I liked the best were the personal moments between characters. I enjoyed the fact that I didn't know very many of the cast members; it was refreshing to see new talent on the screen. It helped me to be more into the characters. By the way, what is it with fantasy movies always being filmed in New Zealand? I know that this one was filmed in a lot of places, but mostly, it seemed in New Zealand. Weird.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overly sophisticated acting on the part of the children,"My wife and I were very disappointed with the Narnia movie.During the first 45 minutes particularly it was very labored.Throughout the movie the children acted in an overly polite speaking style, which bordered on the robotic. The two oldest children appeared to have a physical age of 15-16 years, yet they spoke and acted like children of a considerably younger age. The youngest girl appeared to have a physical age of 7-8 years,but she spoke like a sophisticated 12 year old. When the children tramped about in the snow they exhibited little discomfort from the cold temperature despite only wearing flimsy clothing. The highlight of the movie proved to be the lion and the witch and the costumes of the other various characters, all of whom prevented this movie from being a total disappointment for my wife and I.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Narnia"" is a beautiful and amazing Hollywood Blockbuster.","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe"" is about four children who are sent away to live with a professor because of a war going on in London. Once at the professor's house, Lucy (Georgia Henley) suggests that they play hide and seek. Lucy runs into a room which contains nothing but a wardrobe closet. Out of curiosity, Lucy opens the wardrobe closet and discovers that this closet leads to the world of Narnia.When ""Narnia"" first began I will admit I felt quite bored but it wasn't long before I got involved with the story and the beautiful set designs and locations. I also must admit, I have never read this book before yet I was very well aware that it was based on a very popular series of books. As a film, ""Narnia"" really impressed me especially for a Hollywood Blockbuster. What I liked most about the film was how beautiful it was! The director Andrew Adamson really captured the beauty of the set designs and filming locations.Normally I feel special effects lately are so over used. The last ""Star Wars"" and ""King Kong"" are both perfect examples of how special effects are used to much and actually make a film lag because of it. ""Narnia"" on the other hand used special effects but used them wisely. I also think that the special effects in this film looked more realistic then ""Kong"" and I think they added more to the story. The entire battle scene was captured brilliantly.The acting was very good in this film. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch and played the bad character like the role was tailor made for her. The children in the film Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) all did fantastic jobs. Not to mention, Liam Neesen who voiced Aslan the lion. Liam really brought the lion to life. Good job all around.I can't comment much on the writing since it was based on a book and since I never read the book, I can't say whether or not the screenplay was loyal to it. However as a normal Hollywood ""Big Budget"" Blockbuster, I will say that I thought the script was very well done especially when building the story and character development. As I mentioned earlier the director behind ""Narnia"" is Andrew Adamson who was also the director of both ""Shrek"" films. He did a great job directing and capturing all the beauty and emotion of the film.So in conclusion, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a near perfect big budget Hollywood film. I for one really enjoyed the film and now can not wait for the sequels. I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed the last ""Harry Potter"" film and I think the reason is because it seems like a grown-up type of movie that some kids can enjoy too. The violence in ""Narnia"" probably keeps some parents away from taking their kids to it but I think that's a good thing. This movie is definitely one of the most beautiful films I have seen all year and on top of it is probably one of the best blockbusters I have seen as well. I recommend this movie to all who enjoy fantasy films or well made Hollywood blockbusters.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a 9/10. Definitely one of the best big Hollywood blockbusters I have seen in the last couple of years.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Rich, generous adaptation of the book","While I'm not too familiar with the book or the faithfulness of the film to it, I'm told by reliable sources (my sister) that it is faithful in important parts-such as the death of Aslan. I found the film very enjoyable and rewarding. While living in England as a little boy in 1981 or 1982, I saw the original BBC adaptation of the book and was blown away by it. Now I'm very curious as to what it was I saw that so amazed me as a little boy. Perhaps it will appear quite hinky or cheesy now-perhaps not. Be that as it may, this film I found very enjoyable. Adamson, the director of Shrek, uses special effects as they should be used-judiciously. While the effects were sometimes unconvincing-such as one shot in which the children are standing in the foreground with the sky behind them-possibly while the children were walking toward the White Witch's home.By and large though, I found the film to be an exuberant and lively endorsement of the adaptation of books. The book is such a classic but yet it seems to have been quite happily received. I found the director kept the essence of the story-between good and evil-in focus and this holds the focus of the story quite clearly. Adamson keeps the compelling story front and center and does not get waylaid by the temptation to animate or enliven a film with flashy but ultimately unnecessary special effects. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch deserves an Oscar nomination, in my opinion. She was so effective that one can imagine that she might get hate mail in which her character is confused with her real personality. She seems scary and that is the sign that an actor or actress has fully inhabited a character. One really dislikes her and roots for Aslan and the children.Ultimately though, I would give immense credit to director Adamson for restraint in the creation of this film. He could have easily submitted to the temptation to enliven the film with special effects but he realized that CS Lewis had already written a book that, if adapted quite honestly, would play powerfully by itself. This is a wonderful and inspiring film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Magnificent Lion, the Evil With, and the Magical Wardrobe","Wow. Simply wow. That is all I can say after having the luxury of screening this movie a day early. The visuals are gorgeous, the music is beautiful--everything is simply amazing. This movie takes us to the world of Narnia. I will say that as a movie, this is excellent. Those unfamiliar with the book will enjoy it. I did read it, and I will tell all of you who have read it as well--you will not be disappointed. Sure, some dialogue is left out; some scenes are cut and/or extended; and some things are not explained--but this is the MOVIE version of Narnia. If we want it exactly as the book, we might as well just read it again. This film stays true to the important and outstanding parts from the book, and I was simply awed. Tilda Swinton plays an excellent and very cold White Witch--she was indeed convincing. Her portrayal of Jadis is very well-done. The scenery, the magical creatures--just stupendous. People are calling this a miniature Lord of the Rings. Well of course--C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien were friends, so it would make sense.

Haven't had so much fun since Willow first opened...,"A year of overdone franchises, pretentious biopics, and realistic downers at the movies ends with this well-timed, refreshing piece, which is even more amazing considering it is indeed the most fantastic allegory of the Greatest Story Ever Told.In short, the four Pevensie children escape the war-torn suburbs of early 40s London, joining their relative, an eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent) and his governess-like assistant at his countryside manor. The kids have trouble appreciating one another, despite the harsh circumstances they have just faced. Gradually, they discover that the spare room wardrobe is actually a portal to a world beyond their imagination, the world of Narnia. They find themselves on the run from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), caught up in the centennial struggle between the Witch and the icon of justice, Aslan (Liam Neeson), and most importantly, becoming a family again.Despite its most serious origins, this story is just plain fun. I may be biased--I've read the wonderful source material from C.S. Lewis thrice. If accuracy in comparison to the novel would bother you, stay away. This is truly a big screen interpretation, but done most respectfully by Andrew Adamson, the director best known for the Shrek films. (Yeah! I know!) He shows quite a departure here, showing love and reference for the original story in this interpretation. Although a few stars are involved, one of the big reasons to see it is for the previously unknown talent, including breakout performances by James McAvoy (Mr. Tumnus), Patrick Kake (Oreius the Centaur General), and, of course, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley as Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy respectively. Breathtaking visuals, that quite frankly, outdo the best of Potter round out the mix. The final battle is not to be missed. Finally, nothing from the original work that was left out of the film will be terribly missed. (I was delighted, in fact, that the Christmas Party was not attempted. Arguably, the saddest part of the story.) The audience aimed at is certainly children, but don't be surprised to find yourself enchanted as well. Even though you may not like to, please, PLEASE stay for the credits to see the epilogue, straight from the book, as well as some nice compositions. A very good time.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant,"Wow this film absolutely rocked! The whole setting, the gentle snow falling from the sky, the lampost warming the atmosphere, Narnia and beyond and little Lucy finding the magical land. When Edmund follows his sister into the wardrobe, and the crunching of the snow beneath his feet, this movie made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. The White Witch played by Tilda Swinton done a fantastic performance giving us a cold, icy Queen full of fear and anger. Her still eyes gave an entrancing feel. The four children especially young Georgie Henley gave a fantastic performance, giving emotion and detail within their character. Dawn French was so funny as Mrs Beaver, the whole Scene set was perfect, an inspiration in film making. The simple yet enthralling story captured the heart of many young and old, and especially mine, making me very happy to come from Belfast the home of Narnia Creator, Clive Staples Lewis..",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best. Movie. Ever.,"This was the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I saw it 6 times in the theater and it just got better every time. The music, directing, acting, special effects, and costumes make Narnia seem so real. I absolutely loved it. I hadn't even read the book before seeing it, but it sure did inspire me to read all of the books (finished The Last Battle last night). One of the reasons why I love this movie is because it's so beautiful to watch. The scenery and the cinematography are so amazing. If someone asked me to pick my favorite scene, I couldn't do it. All of the scenes are my favorite. It's a movie that works on so many levels.

A beautiful rush of emotions and fantasy!,"I just went to see the midnight showing, and first off, let me say, it did my heart so good to see it *jam packed* full of college students! In fact, the only people there were college students, or people of equal age. =) I remember hearing critics and fans say that marketing young people, specifically males between the ages of 15-25, would be difficult . Never fear! The atmosphere was electric with whoops and hollers and clapping and open crying (yes, a lot of it on my part as well!). So there we go! I have to say that the acting was superb! I had no trouble buying into the characters. In fact, I didn't see them as anything but characters! I didn't have to think, Oh, this is Tilda Swinton from Constantine, or this is an unknown actor playing Peter. I just looked at them as The White Witch, Peter, Tumnus...etc. They all flowed wonderfully together. I even wound up forgetting that Liam Neeson was Aslan's voice. It just turned into Aslan. The special effects were amazing. I was looking at them to study at first, but finally just gave up, and was able to accept it all as real. The only shots I didn't do this with were the shots from a distance, and the animals looked animated. The fox wasn't nearly as well done as the others, but it still looked top of the line, though not photorealistic. The other shot was a blue screen of the children on the stone bridge looking out, it looked fake, but it was a quick shot, and pretty much the only blue screen shot that was visibly fake. Out of a CGI intense film, that is amazing I think. The cinematography and score were beautiful, breathtaking and awe inspiring. I couldn't have been more pleased! It all went together seamlessly. For a little gushing now....okay, yes I bawled and bawled. =) When Lucy first entered the wardrobe, when she met Tumnus, the Stone Table (ohmy!), and the battle. I just couldn't help myself. And hearing the beautiful Aslan roar was amazing. The cinema was literally shaking! Fans, to forewarn you, not everything is in there. Yes, I do agree, hands down, that this is an extremely faithful adaptation. And I don't think they could have done better. However, as an extreme Narnia fans since the age of 6 (I'm 21 now), I was a bit saddened that certain parts aren't in there.~**Spoiler**~There is no romp with Aslan after He comes back to life. I must say this saddened me most of all. That is the one and only scene I was truly longing for, and alas, it is absent. But, because of the battle going on at the time, I understand it. Also, I wish they would have said the infamous line, ""Safe? Course He isn't safe, but He is good."" Although they do make a nice try at it between Tumnus and Lucy at the end. And they do not explain to the children that Aslan is a Lion. Wish they could have done that. However these are tiny little pieces, and although important and very special to me, like I said before, I can understand it.Overall....SUPERB! I am so very happy! The job was brilliantly done. I am hoping for an extended edition DVD, because indeed it did feel a bit rushed, which I must say surprised me. The scenes seemed a bit short, not quite as in depth, but everything was done beautifully....and the gushing of emotion, the clapping and the happy, light and beautiful storytelling is put forth in a beautiful film that I believe will become a classic. I am very well pleased indeed!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonder,"This film is so many things that it is difficult to put them all into words. The story of a little girl who goes to a magic land has delighted readers for fifty years now, but never before have filmmakers had the technology to convincingly create the things C.S. Lewis imagined with such clarity. The special effects and creatures are marvelous.The acting is also laudable. The children deliver obviously heartfelt performances, particularly commendable because the story requires them to display so many different emotions.The score contributes to the beauty of the film, adding a subtle layer of mood that never overpowers the action.The story is well told, fast-paced and moving. As huge fan of the book, I am not disappointed.Finally, I believe there is something transcendent about this movie. It moves beyond the realm of most children's films, even good ones, and explores themes of loss, courage, death, fear, weakness, and ultimate sacrifice.I leave every viewer to find out for himself or herself what it all means.What I believe you'll be sure of is that it definitely means something, and it just might take your breath away.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
From the golden realm of childhood to the silver screen,"One of the most prominent stories from my childhood brought to the big screen and missing hardly anything, if anything at all, from the original book by C. S. Lewis.At times I found memories of wonder and excitement surging through my head, as the story unfolded but having been long since moved to some dark and distant corner of my psyche.The children playing out gallant heroes portrayed the very essence of what the characters are supposed to be; executing their roles in natural and believable way.And although the film is full of special effects, it at no point relied on them to tell this classic tale.A must see, not only for our children but for the big kid that lingers in every one of us.Maybe tonight, as did when I was a child, I'll reach into the back of the wardrobe and firmly tap the back... Just in case.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A big shiny package with nothing inside,"I have never read the C. S. Lewis novel from which this film originates so I am going in cold and judging the film on its own merits and have no idea how closely it adheres to its source. The film starts off quite well with a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way misses its footing and ends up delivering a rather empty viewing experience. The end result fails to achieve the emotional depth or scope of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (films it appears to want to emulate), the imagination of the Harry Potter films, or even the ambition of the more recent The Golden Compass. The opening is fascinating and sets the stage nicely, taking the four central characters - two brothers and two sisters - from war-torn London to a more pastoral setting. The youngest child, played by the adorable Georgie Henley, stumbles onto a wardrobe that opens into another realm filled with talking animals, ice queens and epic battles of good vs. evil. Naturally, she compels her siblings to return with her and aid the forces of good - embodied by a wise, noble lion voiced by Liam Neeson - against the forces of evil, led by Tilda Swinton's queen. Unfortunately, it is around this point that the film begins to falter and lose its initial impact. The visuals range from good to merely adequate, with the battle scenes particularly smacking of CGI phoniness. Purportedly there is some pro-Christian agenda at work in Lewis' novel, but one really has to stretch to find it in the film as it just never seems that deep - in fact, it is amazing how quickly the film evaporates from the mind after it concludes. Swinton is suitably malevolent as the queen, but despite that none of the characters ever truly seem to be at great risk from her, which results in a veritable dearth of suspense. By contrast, Neeson appears to have become entombed in the role of wise mentor and desperately needs to stretch himself. He has become a veritable cliché. James McAvoy is charming as an impish faun who befriends young Henley, but then he is off-screen for far too long. The biggest problem lies with the central characters. The film works well when the emphasis is on young Henley, who is the most appealing and accessible of the siblings. Unfortunately, the second half punts her into a supporting role in favor of Skander Keynes, as her conflicted brother and the younger of the boys. Keynes's role requires some degree of acting prowess to carry one over the contortions his character is forced to go through during the running time, but he seems to only have two reactions - very surly and slightly less surly, which confounds any evolution. The older siblings have it even rougher. Blond pretty-boy William Moseley seems on hand only to appeal to the teenyboppers in the bland hero role and the film/story never seems to know what to do with the older sister, played by Anna Popplewell, so she instead just seems...there, like a prop. And therein lies the film's problem as a whole. It ends up performing the same function as a Christmas gift box wrapped in sparkling paper that holds nothing inside. It is lovely to look at for a short time, but then one is ready to move on to something with substance.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bravo!  Excellent fantasy film for children.,"First of all, I want to say...let this film stand on its own merits! It is not Lord of the Rings reborn, nor is it the same sort of fantasy as Harry Potter. And while teens and adults will enjoy the film it is definitely aimed primarily at a younger crowd or ""family"" audiences. Some reviewers have called this film ""boring"" and I can only think that they are either trying to appear sophisticated or they are judging on the wrong level. I went the day after it opened; the theatre was completely sold out and, being a matinée, I would say that at least 50% (& probably more) were children ranging in age from preschoolers to age 12--but they were so mesmerized by the film that you wouldn't have known they were there. No fidgeting. No crying. No getting up & down. No talking. And when the film was over, the audience broke into applause which doesn't happen often.I went to see this film with a bit of trepidation: I had enjoyed the BBC miniseries years ago and doubted a 140 minute film could equal it. I am happy to say that I was wrong. Although the CGI is a bit shaky in certain parts (notably the centaurs) and the ears for Mr. Tumnus & the centaurs being done on the cheap, overall Disney and director Andrew Adamson have brought the fantasy world of Narnia to life so well you have no problem suspending disbelief for it.The casting of the child actors is, for the most part, ideal. Unusually for these times we are presented with non-bratty, non-smart-mouthed characters--a refreshing change. The young actors do a great job of portraying the more innocent, less sophisticated kids of the 1940's. Georgie Henley, in particular, is perfect for her role of Lucy Pevensie, evoking the wide-eyed wonder of a young child discovering a magical land. The scene in which she first discovers the wardrobe and then goes through it is well-handled by the director. William Mosely as Peter gives the weakest portrayal & the scenes in which he wields a sword are simply not believable.Tilda Swinton as the White Witch makes for an excellent villain. Her glacial stares send a clear message that she cares for nothing but herself and her own goals; her costumes distort her shape, especially around the shoulders & neck, giving her an inhuman look.Aslan, the CGI'd lion, is totally believable and Liam Neeson's voice can raise chills on your spine.Finally--yes, this story is a Christian allegory. If you are a devout Christian this film will speak to you. Aslan's death and rebirth in particular. However, the film works as a plain fantasy as well and if one is not a Christian (as I am not) the spiritual aspects don't get in the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantastic fantasy for the whole family and a REAL love story!,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a wonderful movie with wonderful characters. I had read the book when I was about 12 years old and had forgotten a lot of the story. All I could remember how wonderful Aslan the lion seemed (who even as a twelve year old I picked it out that he resembled a Jesus/God-like figure) and it was the same in this movie. The White Witch was pretty scary but not too scary for little children. Overall, this movie captured my attention and my emotions but as a Radio/TV/Film major I was slightly disappointed with some of the scenes. I expected a little more Lord of the Rings quality but felt it didn't quite reach its level. (Maybe I am too critical from being in the business.) However, we could all use a story about the battle over good and evil, the Messiah, and learning about family love/loyalty!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing,"THE BEST movie I have ever seen! The story is pretty much bang-on par with the book. I read the book years ago, but from what I can remember, and also a friend of mine who read the book more recently agrees with me - there are some slight changes, but they did not really take away from the story at all. The scenery is breathtaking. The plot line was extremely well done. Weta Workshop once again did a stunning job on the details. Casting was impeccable - there was almost no famous actors in it to take away from the brilliance of the original story. This movie: wow is the only word to describe it. This movie is simply amazing. A must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfection,"It's been about 40 years since i read the books. They were among my favorites ever and while reading them, my visual mind made up its own movie. So i was uncertain about going to see this movie. But it's perfect. It's all the images i saw in my head and more. It's brilliant. I'm a very critical person about entertainment and literature. But i'm hard pressed to come up with one thing i didn't like about this movie. Maybe the choice of adult actors in the first sequences, but they weren't very much part of the story. The battle scene at the beginning was really well done, better than most depictions of England during the war. At first i thought the witch wasn't working but, wow, she really got better. The centaurs are the best Hollywood's come up with yet. Completely believable. As are the fawns. Great. But the most important part, the one i was most worried about, was the lion. And he was perfect. Wonderful. Awesome. This movie should win all the prizes.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Hide and Seek, Anyone?","A little game of hide and seek can be surprising. Four English children are sent to a countryside mansion during World War II to escape the bombings. While there, they discover, through playing a game of hide and seek, a way to visit Narnia through a wardrobe. Narnia proves to be a parallel world undergoing a crisis similar to that which faces their own world. The plot then takes several fairy tale like turns including the delightful faun, a whole menagerie of charming animals who talk like humans, a scary witch queen, centaurs, and finally a medieval battle similar to those found in the Lord of the Rings. But, C.S. Lewis clearly intends to use this story to share his heartfelt theology of grace, to which he devoted much of his life. Of course, Aslan the Lion is used to represent Christ the King in this parallel world. And Aslan, like Christ, is the real meaning of sacrifice and resurrection in Narnia. So, C.S. Lewis shares again, in effect, the miracles of meekness, prophecy, grace, suffering, and glory of the Gospel in this fresh story of triumph. Mere Christianity is not so mere, after all. Meanwhile, the animation of this film is nothing short of breathtaking while the script and actors are all first rate, even the talking beavers.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been better,"I was very excited when I saw the trailer for Narnia, mainly cause this is one of my favorite books and it looked like it was very well done. The first half of the movie or where they were at the proffesor's house was according to the book and the actors they chose for the kids were very good all of them believable, Lucy was the innocent, Edmund was the bully, Susan was the sensible one and last but not at all least was Peter the heroic one. However Liam Neeson was not believable as Aslan and I don't understand why they didn't get somebody like Anthony Hopskins to talk for him. Jadis was not believable as the charming evil witch in the beginning and I feel that they didn't give her a good enough introduction. The biggest mistake were the relationships. Peter and Edmund didn't seem to have as much hatred towards each other as in the books, and there was way too much hugging and crying, in fact I felt like they were concentrating more on making this a blockbuster then making this a good movie. There was no playfulness in Aslan as there is in the book and they didn't make Aslan as respectable and fun as they could have, again I felt like he didn't get a decent introduction and therefore when the whitch killed him I wasn't sad at all. The part where the girls were crying over his death was long and I got sick of it. Jadis looked ridiculous in those clothes which seem to be cut from an 80's magazine. I definitely think that they should have spent more time on the script and less time on making this a Hollywood movie, I don't know if it is the producer or the directors or even just because this was a Disney film. So to sum up this movie left me lukewarm like annegirl8 said and this could have been a much better movie if they wouldn't have made it so lame. Kids movie not for the adult fans.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Leaning to Fight For the Good Against the Evil,"In the World War II, four children are sent by their mother to the countryside to escape from the bombing of London.

When her two brothers, Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), and her older sister Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell), cross the passage to Narnia, a prophecy is fulfilled and the rebel forces leaded by the lion Aslan and Peter fight against the evil witch.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a good story, where moral values of honesty, loyalty, sacrifice, freedom, friendship and love battle and win dishonesty, betrayal, selfishness, tyranny, betrayal and hate. The special effects are amazing, with the most weird creatures. Unfortunately the young Georgie Henley is too weak for the lead and very important role of Lucy, wasting many scenes with her constant smile.

I was afraid it might be too scary (ie Lord of the Rings) or complicated for him to understand.

I was also worried about the length of the movie and if it would hold his interest this long.Boy am I glad we went. We both enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to others.

I encourage all children to read the book and throw the movie in the fire...,"Everyone who has read the book will agree with me, the movie is rubbish: There is no magic, Aslan is 'just' a lion. The books have a lot of room for your own imagination: anthropomorphic animals and especially Aslan are just things you can't film. And if you can, you're one hell of a Filmer, this one just couldn't.I quote C.S. Lewis himself in a letter from him to producer Lance Sieveking: 'But I am absolutely opposed  adamant isn't in it!  to a TV version. Anthropomorphic animals, when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare. At least, with photography. Cartoons (if only Disney did not combine so much vulgarity with his genius!) would be another matter. A human, pantomime, Aslan would be to me blasphemy'Nowadays, because of technology, animals don't turn into buffoonery like C.S. Lewis says, but he is still right about Aslan.There is no spirit in this movie!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Leave it to Beaver(s),"A truly inventive, oft times breathtaking journey into the fertile mind of C. S. Lewis. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is refreshing; it tells a ""simple"" story in a simple manner yet is anything but simple. Four siblings need to be placed in a home during the blitz in WWII and come to the huge manse of one Professor Kirke. There they find a huge wardrobe which sometimes acts as a portal to another world. I never read these books as a child but will go back and read them now. The story is allegorical and symbolic to be sure, but for those of you that do not want to be bogged down with that - have no fear it isn't needed at all to enjoy this. The rest of the story takes on a Lord of the Rings scope as good vs. evil in the form of the four youngsters(now in a mythical world called Narnia) and aided by Aslan a giant of a lion fight the wicked White Witch and her evil minions for supremacy. Director Andrew Adamson, also from New Zealand(like Peter Jackson), is able to pull off much in this his first full-scale non-animation film. Previously he directed both Shrek films. Adamson hits a couple of slow patches early on but his world that he created comes bursting to life on the screen with vibrant colors and weird, fairly believable characters. There are many weird creatures such as a centaur, a pair of cockney-speaking beavers, and a pack of deadly wolves. The film ends with a typical battle scene but that is done rather well at any rate. What makes this film work besides the energetic direction and the imaginative script is the acting. The four children all do a reasonably good job: a must when having youngsters perform as protagonists. None of them is particularly detrimental. The young girl playing Lucy is particularly good. Liam Neeson lends his mighty voice to the Lion - a feat of filming. The two digitally created beavers are also most impressive and bring lots of subtle laughs to the proceedings. But the real star if you will is Tilda Swinton giving lessons on how to be wicked and look as pale as ever. Swinton plays evil almost too well. Jim Broadbent plays the professor and even though his role is minor, his presence is necessary. A very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Chronicles of Narnia,"When I was 17 years old I was given a trio sets of books written be C.S. Lewis. They were paperback.

"Honorable to C,S, Lewis'  Vision","At times I view myself as a writer, mostly as avocation, but a writer nevertheless. When a beloved book is converted into cinema, especially a beloved book, I view it with apprehension.I imagined what Tim Burton would have done with this book and I simply shuddered. I can hear him now, ""No, I must make this 'my' Narnia."" While I recognize Burton as an imaginary and talented film maker, he is someone who does not normally respect the work of others. Fortunately for us all that he did not make ""Narnia."" When a film maker looks at this book, he is faced with the same challenges that Peter Jackson faced with the Lord of the Rings. First of all it was a book that belonged to J.R.R. Tolkien, and more recently the Tolkien family. Secondly it is a series of books that belongs to the generations of fans that sustained the remarkable publishing history. So it is with ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Andrew Adamson is a fine cinematic story teller as proved with both Shrek films. Here he took a book with tens of millions of owners, and made a film that carefully walks the line common to all of the owners. It was a joy to watch his rendering of the story, and caring not to water down the more 'dynamic' portions of the book.I am amazed that Disney, better know for witches and ghosts, would allow a movie such as this to be made under their banner. The movie turns out to create a much better legacy than Michael Eisner deserves.Three cheers for Mr. Adamson",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply Magic,"At the tender young age of 7 I remember sitting down every Sunday evening to watch the BBC's adaptation of Narnia and so 16 years later it was with trepidation that I ventured to the cinema to watch Narnia FINALLY on the big screen. From the opening credits to the last it drew me in and I was immediately taken back to my childhood. The acting is marvellous, the special effects amazing, the scenery is breathtaking and the music is powerful and invoking. Funny at times, it is also deeply moving and in some parts quite distressing (for this, I must wander why it got given a PG certificate). However, if like me you are a child of the 80s with memories of the TV series then this film is a MUST SEE. I felt like was 7 again and wishing that I were Lucy so I too could go into the wardrobe.

Surprisingly Transfixing!,"To any Hollywood executive reading this: PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE NARNIA!!! When I first saw the trailers to this movie I thought it would be a nice movie but it appeared to me to be more geared toward younger audiences. I thought that because of the apparent target age it might be somewhat slow and so I figured I might try to catch it on video and watch it when I had nothing better to do. As chance would have it my plans were altered and I ended up watching it at the movies on Christmas day and I must say I was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning of the movie until the very end! I now plan to recommend this movie to everyone I know.The special effects grabbed my attention during the very first minute of the movie (the blitz scene was very well done) and I remained awed by them until the very last scene (the one after the credits started to roll). The battle scenes were astounding and the talking animals really did not come across as one-dimensional as they appeared (at least to me) on the trailer. The transition from reality to fantasy was gradual and easily accepted. After a few minutes of watching I actually found it easy to accept that the animals were talking! In short, the movie made it very easy for me to immerse myself in the fantasy world of Narnia.Aside from the movie magic the story was nothing short of beautiful and was a *greatly* welcomed change from the despair-filled, over-sexed, foul-mouthed trash that Hollywood mass-produces these days. This is a wonderful story of hope, redemption, and forgiveness. I must say that if more movies like this were made I would find myself gladly returning the theater with more frequency. It would also be easier for me to pay the ticket prices these days if I knew that after buying a ticket for a movie like Narnia I would actually leave the theater with a feeling of peace and hope, and not filled with angst/despair.The movie combines a beautifully meaningful story with remarkable special effects. The battle scenes were magnificent and I absolutely loved the storyline. This is a feel-good movie and I recommend this to everyone and anyone who loves watching *GOOD* movies!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not absolutely terrible, but nowhere close to good.","While I loved the work of C.S. Lewis, I was not expecting a masterpiece out of this movie seeing as though it garnered much pop-culture hype, Burger King endorsements, etc. But I still thought it would, or perhaps more aptly, could very much be a good film considering the original material they were working with. It saddens me to say that I was wrong. Well it doesn't sadden me that much. Just that one of the great stories of modern literature was so terribly adapted. But I'll get back to that.For starters, I feel the filmmakers did an extremely poor job of accentuating the emotional mountains and valleys that take place in Lewis' original work; The discovery of Narnia, the death of Aslan, the resurrection of Aslan, etc. I could go on and on. All of these, terribly executed. We see Susan and Lucy absolutely weeping over Aslan when they've known him for, what, two scenes? Also, how is the audience even supposed to care by then, especially if strangers to the story? And the discovery of Narnia. When the children all discover Narnia for their respective first times, their on-screen action basically says,(in bland monotone) ""Oh. Wow. Looook. A maagicall land called Narrniaaa..."" Where is the wonder, awe, excitement? In the films, it is nowhere. It seems at almost every major turn of plot, plot clichés and digestible drama is used instead of bringing out the full power of the situations.I won't do a big section on dialogue, but I'll just say that I'm glad I rented this movie and wasn't in the theaters because, on multiple occasions, I could just not hold back explosions of laughter. Again, clichés and digestible, ""I've heard this line 1000 times in 1000 movies"" lines seemed to dominate this film.GRANTED, this film does not absolutely fail. Tilda Swinton did great. And, while some may disagree, the overall acting wasn't bad at all. It was as good as the script allowed it to be. Well almost. But you know what I mean. Anyways, like I was saying, this film does not fail completely because of ONE thing, and one thing only: The story. Like I said before, Lewis' original work is just simply classic. Heck, even a comic flip book based on The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe couldn't be TOO bad.All in all, I was extremely disappointed in this adaptation. I know some people get sick of LOTR comparisons, but there's no way you can not compare the two. The LOTR films captured the heart of Tokien's writings, with drama, intellectuality, AND accessibility. TLTWATW just seemed to capture the heart of the box office. Nothing more.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Adamson truly brings Lewis' masterpiece to the modern audience,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was simple an amazing and captivating film, full of life and representative of the deep imagination of C.S. Lewis. The parts were well-cast, the animation was incredible and appropriate, and the battle scenes were quite exciting.All of the characters were represented well, especially the four Pevensie children. The four child actors truly understood their characters and brought them to life. Tilda Swinton as Jadis seemed to be off at first, but soon became quite convincing as the White Witch, demonstrating her wicked and relentless nature through her calm but stern personage. While James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus seemed to be the weakest and most scattered character, he did possess enough charm to play off his seemingly flat expressions. All the voice-overs were great, and the conversations between the beavers offered timely comic relief. Liam Neeson as Aslan seemed at first to be almost too predictable, but his booming voice worked great with the awesome appearance of the lion.In terms of animation, the movie was a true triumph. The creators chose just the correct mixture of realistic and clearly CGI animation to present the animals and beasts in a fashion that reminded the audience of the fact that while they were fantasy creatures, they appeared to be perfectly in place in the magical world of Narnia. Not once throughout the movie did I think to myself that the animation looked ""fake"" or ""overdone,"" and it was the way in which the animators depicted the entire world of Narnia, the landscapes and creatures, that made it appear so delightfully real. I especially enjoyed the facial expressions and speaking of the creatures, which was very realistic.Finally, the movie was completed by the awesome battle scenes that took place near its end. In true Lord of the Rings style, Weta Workshop crafted a fully-armed battle that could stand up to those of the Jackson series. However, a comparison of the Lord of the Rings' battles and the one in Narnia cannot truly be made, for the movies are completely different. Narnia was much more a fantasy than LOTR, simply because it possessed a real world and a fantasy one, while LOTR was completely fantasy. It is for precisely this reason that the battle scenes, full of minotaurs and ogres, centaurs and satyrs, worked so well, and were seen as not only appropriate but a true triumph of modern animation.Overall, Adamson should be highly commended for bringing the genius work of C.S. Lewis to life in this movie. I only hope he will agree to make more movies in the series. If you haven't seen it, you must, and prepare to be truly captivated by the magical world of Narnia.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia a Rip-Roaring Triumph,"C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has bewitched audiences for fifty years, and - after seeing this movie - I'm sure that the legacy of Narnia will live on for many years to come.From the opening scenes set in London, with a beautiful score by Harry Gregson Williams, it is evident that what we are about to see will be powerfully realized. And so it was. The film, directed by Andrew Adamson, is in turn is breathtaking, scary, funny, entrancing and poignant.Featuring a stellar cast of renowned British, New Zealand and American actors, performances are fabulous. As the four children, William Moseley, portraying Peter - the teenage boy torn between childhood and manhood - and Anna Popplewell, as the motherly sister Susan, are fabulous in their roles. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes deliver stand-out performances, showing talent and skill beyond their years.Tilda Swinton, as the White Witch, perfectly captures the icy and chilling menace of her role. Audiences sympathize with James McAvoy, as the friendly faun Mr Tumnus. Ray Winstone and Dawn French put in a delightful turn as the Beavers. Liam Neeson is perfect as the great lion Aslan.Andrew Adamson's imagination has not been limited, and his rendition of C.S. Lewis' modern fairytale perfectly captures the magic and mirth of the original novel.Bringing C.S. Lewis fans to a state of ecstasy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a triumph for the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It changed my life!,"This movie by far has been one of the best movies that I have seen all year! If you still have yet to see it, what the heck are you doing sitting at home! Go see it because it is a guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and the special effects are truly amazing. It all looks so real that you would really believe that Narnia is an actual place. The plot is awesome and it really stirs emotion. That one of the signs of a good movie, when you feel something during it. All through this movie it was sheer excitement! I will definitely buy this film when it comes out on DVD. This was truly one of the blockbusters of the year!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I liked Georgie Henley. Otherwise, an Ordinary Movie.","We watched The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. How was it? Let's just say that the first half was good. I liked the mood created by the music, which was really nice and consisted of smooth woodwind noises.But then the movie just got bad. I really didn't like some of the messages of the film. I didn't like it how the professor says that it is ""logical"" to trust in your family. What if your dad sexually abuses you?. Genetic relatedness means nothing. The kindest person in the world may be someone with completely different genes to you and the most evil person in the world may be your brother, sister, or father. Saying, ""Trust in your father. He knows what is good,"" may sound nice, but what if you were giving this advice to Adolf Hitler's hypothetical children? The way Edmond all of a sudden changes I thought was weird. Still it all seemed unrealistic. The worst part about the movie would be the battle scene. It's the same old thing we've seen in The Phantom Menace, Lord of the Rings, Troy, Alexandra, and maybe more movies. When some concept is popular, the media executives really milk it, don't they? Whether it's martial arts wire-fu or reality TV, surely people must get sick of the same thing over and over again. I was yawning throughout the whole battle scene. We've seen it all before. Some other people are saying this movie was more incoherent and sanitized, and yes I suppose these are fair concerns.I should also add that Georgie Henley, the girl who played Lucy, was strangely realistic in her acting. She was also a very likable character.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't Compare It To LOTR (Let It Stand On Its Own),"When I first saw ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" in theaters, I left with a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. The reason? At the time, I couldn't help but comparing it to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series. However, after reading Tolkien's classic novel again and then re-re-watching this movie, I can now see it as a great adaptation that is very true to the source material.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the Pevensie family siblings, who are shipped off into the English countryside to avoid the carnage of WWII. While at the mansion of their eccentric uncle, they find a wardrobe that mysterious leads to another world called Narnia. Little Lucy (Georgia Henley) goes in first and meets a Faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). Then Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stumbles in and meets a much more nefarious personality...the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), self-proclaimed ""Queen of Narnia"". Later on, older siblings Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley) discover Narnia and find themselves in a conflict that they themselves have been deeply prophesized within.The Narnia books were made for children (but well-written enough for adults to enjoy the experience), and that is exactly what this movie is like. If you try (like I once did) to compare it to LOTR, it will never measure up because you are not comparing like quantities. LOTR is an epic drama, while the Chronicles are a lighter-hearted children's drama. This film really captures that spirit, what with the great special effects, the sibling interplay, and just the general whimsical- ness of the overall production. It's ""played straight"", don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fun involved too.What might just stand out the most, though, is the acting. Little Georgia as Lucy almost steals the show at some points with her incredible emotional range for such a young child, while Skandar's Edmund is spot-on as the mischievous Edmund (a character who is so important in showing that even in Narnia it can be difficult to tell the good from the bad sometimes). Also, casting Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan, the true ruler of Narnia, was a stroke of genius. Each time the great lion speaks, it will send chills down your spine.So, even though I didn't fully appreciate this movie when it first came out, I can now see it as a faithful adaptation to its source novel. Both mediums are meant for children and not to be compared to older, more adult fare. I don't know of a child alive who wouldn't be captivated by this movie, and I'm sure that's just the way C.S. Lewis would have wanted it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing Movie. The book was excellent - The movie was terrible.,"I was expecting a lot from this movie, given the hype and the fact that the book is brilliant - The movie however was terrible.I really felt as though the movie rushed through the story WAY too fast, and never came close to what the book offers. The battles also felt hollow and rushed. I also felt that the story was americanised and toned down for a Disney audience. You didn't get a true feel for Narnia at all in this movie, nor did it build the characters enough. It seems to me to be one of the biggest wasted opportunities in movie making possible. It was hard to believe that someone could ruin such a good book. I really wish Peter Jackson had made this movie. So much was missing in this movie - The movie really felt like a cheap Lord of the Rings wannabe. If you are at all interested in Narnia, please read the book and don't waste your money watching this rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pure imagination,"Full of imagination and beautiful pictures. ""Narnia"" is a high fantasy world and the plot in this is full of high fantasy rules. Sadly it feels like the story in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has no room to breathe. The characters although many and very imaginative, they don't have the opportunity to shine. We get only a glimpse of who they must be. Even the sibling protagonists are underdeveloped and there's practically no chemistry among them. I get this story is full of allegories and allegoric imagery and full of imagination and beauty but sadly only some stuff gets to come across. It sadly doesn't translate perfectly from the paper to the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great movie which will appeal to adults too,"I intended to watch this when it was on the big screen but somehow never got around to it. Watched it on commercial TV the other night. Despite that huge handicap (incessant ads, banner ads etc.), I was totally enchanted by this movie, hence the 10/10 rating. Based on a series of books which I haven't read, I must say that as a movie, it worked wonderfully. In fact, it's even better than any of the Harry Potter movies I've seen (another book to cinema series of tales).Set during World War II in England, at the time of the German air-raids, it's the tale of the Pevensie family. The children are sent to the countryside to avoid the worst of the blitz. The children comprise the elder role-models Peter and Susan, along with their younger brother and sister Edmund and Lucy. I must say that Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie is absolutely adorable. Don't let that description put you off...these are English characters, not those highly annoying 'cute' kids American popular culture likes to foist on us.In this movie's favour is the humour...I was often amused by exchanges between the characters-like when Lucy first meets Mr. Tumnus.Anyway, from the grim opening of this movie, it eventually explores the fantastic alternative universe that is Narnia...a land of mythical creatures, both good and evil. On that level, this movie is a great adventure with great spectacle and terrific CGI effects (computer generated special effects-of places and creatures).Not exactly sure what age group this movie is pitched at, but I think it is a PG movie...perhaps a bit to dark for very young children-it does get into 'heavy' topics at times, which very young children might get upset by.Another big plus for this movie is the complex depictions of the characters. The eldest children are sensible. Lucy is good and Edmund has a more interesting trajectory to follow. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is brilliant-one of those 'complex' characters I mentioned earlier. She also happens to be more menacing than Darth Maul!One very small gripe-a little annoyed at one of the mythical characters that made an appearance in this moviesomething for Virginia, perhaps?Anyway, this was such a promising opening movie that I will definitely see the first sequel next week, at the cinema. Sometimes you watch a movie that you know will or may become a franchise. More often than not, you make up your mind to not watch anymore in the series. The sequel will have to be really bad to kill this franchise.P.S. I've seen the sequel to this movie and will post up my review now.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What is wrong with everyone?,"What is wrong with everyone? why do so many people give this movie such high praise? I just got back from seeing this and i can honestly say it was the biggest disappointment of the year. I went in to it with high hopes as i loved the books as a child but within half an hour i was waiting for it to end, it was only two hours long but felt like it was four hours. I thought it was to slow, to long and badly acted (with the exception of the witch who was alright), But the main problem was that none and i mean none of the main characters was either likable or engaging. It has been a long time since i have see a collection of such grating children. Perhaps we've been spoiled by children's movies of late but but i expect them to aim a little higher.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Perfect Movie,"Just watched The Chronicles of Narinia, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The director and screenwriters of this movie came up with the perfect movie. Everything, as usual, begins with a dramatic scene - the separation of children from their parents, and then the plot unravels. The film was written in 2005, but the picture is very realistic and smooth. There are 4 children in the main roles in the film: Lucy, Edmund, Susan, Peter and so there is the hero Aslan, who appears in the form of a lion. This film is very amazing and exciting from the first seconds, you can say I watched it excitedly, the film is incredibly interesting, everyone who wants to watch it will be very satisfied, so I advise you to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Real Classic,"This still remains my favourite book of all time and I have read it countless times, even as an adult. I saw this movie many years ago and have seen it a few times since. I really think it is a great version of the book and it did CS Lewis proud. The child actors are great. Yes, some people will find the way they speak annoying but it's faithful to the book and period. Aslan is done pretty well as is most of the CGI. Tilda Swinton gives a great performance as the White Witch. I just find it all rather enchanting and magical really. It makes me feel young again, slightly sad in a way that you have to get old but at the same time rather uplifting and feel good. A timeless classical that will never age or grow old.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As delightful as Turkish Delight,"This movie still has a profound and meaningful effect within me, even after 16 years! I watched it when I was around 6 or 7 years old and I still remember every scene, the visuals and special effects still hold up astonishingly well to this day and the colours, casting, set, props and costumes are still amazing! I remember having a big crush on the White Witch, beautifully and masterfully played by the marvellous Tilda Swinton. She played Jadis so well, she had me rooting for her even after the sorrowful Stone Table scene which had me in way too many tears as a child. I rewatched it today for the first time in years and I was almost moved to tears as my memories of fascination and awe came flooding back and seeing every word C. S. lewis wrote come to life before my eyes after reading the book as an adult. The movie left me in enchantment as a child and still leaves me in a magical trance as an adult! The adaptation is just as good as the book, if not better and if I could rewatch it for the first time, a million times! I would! I vividly remember when my father would hide Turkish delight in our wardrobe and come out of it pretending he just came back from Narnia and I'd always go in and look for it but disappointingly failed to find it every time. Even now as a 20 something year old, I still check every wardrobe I see, hoping to find that lamp post and the magical world beyond it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I am PAINED by the potential this Movie misses out,"My heart aflutter, I settled in the seat for what promised to be, well, a modern classic. The movie does have its moments - the special effects are terrific, the overall ""environment"" created splendid and the ""feel"" of the film is technically excellent. The music is enjoyable.But frankly, thats where the accolades end. I am pained that a film with such tremendous potential could fall so flat that finally it was an exercise in patience to sit through the whole 140 mins. Having said as much, it is worth a see ~ but with MUCH lowered expectations than what the studios and marketing drones in Hollywood would have us collectively believe the delights the film holds.I found in Tilda Swinton's portrayal of the Evil White Queen absolutely excellent ! She was interesting, and a character who though evil, one could not help silently rooting for at some level. A brilliant actress indeed.The 4 children, who were the key players in the plot, should all be sent to the Prisons of Askaban - where perhaps they might pick up some acting tips from the excellent cast of the Harry Potter films. I have seldom seen such a pathetic and uninspiring performance as from the two boys who were supposed to carry the film. The little Poppelwell girl did a half decent job, but she ain't no Dakota Fanning. Frankly I found the animated characters far better at acting real than the children in fulfilling the roles allotted to them.All in all I would recommend this film as it is well made technically and well, because i am a fantasy movie buff. But please watch it with a nice big tub of popcorn and a large coke - you'll need them to get through the more dragging parts.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical!,"This is a such a great movie, especially for kids. It's fun and exciting and draws you into the fantasy. But you don't feel like they're holding back for kids. This really ignited the innocent kid inside of me. Good to see technology catching up to the imaginations of writers so we can see these visions on screen.And that aside they did such a good job adapting the book it's kinda insane. The mood is perfect and they way they portray Aslan... Even his voice sounds like Lewis is describing Nesson. They didn't change much. Really in the book you don't see the final battle and in this you do because it's a movie and it works better.I remember when this came out atheist didn't want their kids to see this because of the Christian aspects. I'm technically an atheist, but I don't like to call myself one because I don't like associating myself those people or with any group for that matter. But this isn't going to make your kid Christian. The Adam and Eve reference is brief and in a movie so full of stuff that kids don't know what they're talking about this reference will be included in there. And if you are so atheist that you can't understand the good messages that come out of religion or you don't even want your kid to wonder if there is a God then I don't think this family movie is your biggest problem. I like that they didn't remove this aspect because that's what CS Lewis believed in and we should respect other points of view and artist integrity.All in all great fun for the kids and the kids in us.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia,"I don't usually write reviews but with this movie I have to do it, it deserves it because of how important it was in my childhood and seeing it today it has special effects and CGI of good level compared to current movies, and we must recognize that the soundtrack is one of the best there is! It is very exciting, simply beautiful.

Ray Harryhausen 40 years later,"Greetings again from the darkness. How wonderful to see a family action/adventure that makes sense to those of us who have not contributed to J.K. Rowling's enormous fortune. Director Andrew Adamson (of ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" fame) brings to life the enormously popular stories of C.S. Lewis. ""Narnia"" is a thrilling ride with a story, a message and some amazing characters and action.From a technical standpoint the battle scene challenges most anything accomplished in the ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" movies. The effects make me believe this is what legendary effects specialist Ray Harryhausen envisioned as he worked his magic in the ""Sinbad"" movies and later in ""Clash of the Titans"".Lewis did little to hide the biblical allegory, going as far as calling the 4 children of the prophecy the children of Adam. Good versus evil, sacrifice for the good of others and the confused doubter all play a part in the story. It is, however, initially a bit off-setting to experience talking beavers and wolves and a sly, deceitful fox. The impact is that we care very much for the characters and their desire and reluctance to do the right (and courageous) things.The four children are all pretty much unknown to American audiences and newcomer Georgie Henley is marvelous as bright-eyed Lucy Pevensie. She is the heart of the film and of the family. Tilda Swinton is perfect as the White Witch. She is a real life Cruella Deville on steroids. She has the icy stare and cut features that Adamson's first choice Michelle Pfeiffer lacks. We really dislike her ... and that's a good thing!! Liam Neeson was brought in to replace Brian Cox as the voice of the majestic Aslan, and a better choice is difficult to imagine. Other voices that stand out are Dawn French and Ray Winstone as Mrs. and Mr. Beaver and Rupert Everett as the fox.Parents be warned that the battle scene is very intense and some of the visuals will frighten the youngest viewers. On the bright side, most adults will enjoy the film every bit as much as the kids in the audience. Now will someone please figure out a way to make C.S. Lewis' ""The Screwtape Letters"" into a film?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Striking, Elegant and Incredible","I'll keep this short.The movie is beautifully done. Visually it is stunning, with several 'gasp inspiring' moments. The direction is fantastic- especially with the use of music and silence and sudden chaotic action. The musical score fits perfectly with the movie and is unique.All the acting is very credible- especially by children so young. Tilda is amazing (naturally). Also, I thought I may hate Liam as the Lion, but I honestly didn't.The Christian allegory is all there to be sure, but I don't think Christianity has a monopoly on the theme of self-sacrifice for the greater good. That theme is used time and again in good storytelling. And in the context of this movie, it is utterly powerful.And best of all, the story hasn't been tampered with (too much). Granted there are some differences, but overall the storyline stays very faithful to the book (unlike the most recent Harry Potter movie).This Buddhist DEFINITELY recommends this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great adaption,"I was a bit skeptical about this. I was afraid it would go the Harry Potter way because of the length of the book problem, and be utter crap. But this was brilliant. It may be a bit slow at times but they captured the story well. Jim Broadbent has a small role and is so adorable as the Professor especially when you think about the roles he's done in Moulin Rouge and Bridget Jones. I also thought Lucy was just as sweet although sometimes she seems like shes smiling when shes crying. The animation was amazing from the beavers to Aslan and it wasn't used excessively (e.g they used real people in the war scene -at least when they were cheering - not computer mess). But let me criticize. Tilda Swinton is a good actress but I felt like the Queen was like a Xena Warrior Princess wannabe and some of the lines were so corny I wanted to laugh. I was disappointed when Lucy enters Narnia for the first time as I felt she could have expressed more surprise and made it like a Dorothy entering the coloured world of Oz scene - which by the way is so magical it always gives me goosebumps. It was a good thing humour was added though and it is definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Move Over, Harry. Aslan's Back.","This movie has to be.. one of the better things I have seen in a long time. Definitely one of the best movies of 2005, in my opinion. The advance did not sell out quite like Goblet of Fire, but the fans seemed to be even crazier, clapping like mad every time Aslan was on the screen (someone even let out a wolf-whistle/cat-call, which resulted in much laughter from everyone). There were even a few cosplayers (people dressed as the characters), believe it or not. Well done, too.The visuals were simply amazing as all hell. The creatures looked quite alive. They alternated between real animals, real animals with realistic movements (see: Babe), and full CG, the latter of which was extremely realistic. Make-up and costuming for creatures like the fawns, centaurs, minotaurs, orcs, goblins, etc. were mostly well done, in some cases, amazing. The White Witch, played by Tilda Swinton (Gabriel from Constantine) did an extremely superb job. I don't think they could have found a better actress to play the part. She was extremely cold, cruel, and distant, something only she could pull off that perfectly. Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn from Star Wars) voices Aslan and does a better job than Sean Connery could ever hope to.Fans of the book or the original movie will notice a few changes. Nothing major. Basically, they made the story better by adding a few more intense scenes of action where there were previously boring segments of nothing. Some talk was cut short to keep the story moving at an even pace, so you won't get too bored with this one. A mighty fine film, something you must all see!Overall, I liked this one better than Goblet of Fire. Some people will probably disagree, but it really depends on what elements you like in a story. I love me my Harry Potter movies, don't get me wrong, but something about this was just so wonderful and enchanting that I can't help but walk away a bit more impressed. It gives Lord of the Rings a run for it's money, and seeing how all seven books have been optioned for film development, I can't wait for the rest!Long story short: SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Half-assed CGI and dopey Disney style fighting,"The original CS lewis books listed great battles but Disney serves us up a very watered down and bloodless version of the CS Lewis epic tale. This is most watchable film interpretation to date but it doesn't follow the book properly. I was disappointed with the battle scenes and the unimaginative swordplay that always ""killed"" without ever drawing blood. LAME.For little kids who are ignorant of the original books this movie is a fine outing for them. For adults who haven't read the books it will be OK. And for those of us who are literate in CS Lewis we will always hold the books far above this fart of a movie. This rendition of the tale makes simply makes the books even that much more inviting.THE BATTLE SCENES: Some of them were duplicates of footage from the video game Age of Mythology, along with the characters(Minotaurs to name just one) and their armor styles.

Had Me Climbing Into Wardrobes,"One word comes to mind when I think of this movie; magical. I'll never forget the first time I traveled through the wardrobe into Narnia with Lucy. I was completely enchanted by this new world. The snowy woods and the lamppost will always be one of my favorite images/scenes from a movie. I wonder how many children have wondered through wardrobes hoping to find such a magical place as Narnia. C. S. Lewis created a magical world of fantasy and Disney took one of his stories and created a masterpiece. These characters and places stick with you. It's hard to see a lamppost or snow falling in the woods and not think of Narnia. The scene where Lucy stumbles upon Narnia is done so well, we are filled with wonder right along with her. The characters are so likable and we get fantastic performances from a cast we don't get to see a whole lot of in other projects. Every line is delivered with such sincerity. I couldn't help but be moved at times by it. The battle sequences are epic and exciting and even emotional. The soundtrack compliments every scene and captures the beauty and emotion of each moment. Anytime I listen to the music from this film, it takes me back to this magical land, just as any fantasy movie soundtrack should do.

bad no matter the religious content,"This is the first movie where I BADLY wanted to leave the showing despite the fact that I had paid money for it. I didn't because I feel that that would have upset the kids actually liking the movie. Narnia is full of Christian mythology, and that is appalling on many levels, but the reason for why it is awful is the poorly told story. The best part of the movie is truly the beginning. The reference to WWII was suspenseful and eye catching. In those scenes you could see the harsh reality of the children's daily life and pity them. The rest of the movie is boring and badly told and frankly pointless. Where does Aslan come from and why would he return because those four kids had walked into Narnia?? How did the white witch come into power and how come she could make the world cold and harsh? What is her motif? What is the point of this movie?? I left being upset that for once I hadn't believed the reviewers saying that the use of special effects was overdone, but they are right.

I am surprised it didn't get as many great reviews, but there are several other movies after this one, so I'm glad that it was a continued movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Christian Values,"For this media review, I am reviewing the Chronicles of Narnia movies and how they represent the Church's seven media keys. The website, Beliefnet, came out with an article called ""What's Christian about Narnia?"" In this article, the writer shows that their is a balance of christian values in C. S. Lewis' book, ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"". Then the writer begins to talk about how the movie is based on Christian values by showing attitude awareness. Later on in the article, the writer demonstrates the dignity of the human person by writing about the different characters in the movie and how they were respected by Aslan. The writer demonstrates that the film is truth-filled by writing, ""Aslan's admission, shortly before he is killed, that he is ""sad and lonely"" recalls Jesus' telling his disciples ""My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."""" This quote shows that C. S. lewis parallels his story to the Gospels. This article also demonstrates that this film and book is inspiring by writing, ""Lewis, however, never intended the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" to be read simply as a coded retelling of the Bible. He insisted that he didn't set out to write a ""Christian children's story."" Narnia came to him first as a series of images--a faun, a lion. That an unmistakably biblical narrative emerged is perhaps a testimony to Lewis's own formation, a reminder of how deeply steeped he was in the Christian story."" This film is skillfully developed by incorporating Christian parables and Gospels into the movie and book. Here's an example: ""Aslan's admission, shortly before he is killed, that he is ""sad and lonely"" recalls Jesus' telling his disciples ""My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."""" At the end of the article, the writer is motivated by and relevant to experience by writing, ""For those of us who proclaim the Christian faith, Narnia makes a fine Advent devotional, inspiring in us a little of the awe and discomfort that the Incarnation demands."" Overall, the book and film ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" demonstrates the Church's seven media keys and the writer of this article shows how.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
worst movie EVER!,"This movie is a total disgrace and made me sick! the story seems good but, well still don't go see this movie (read the book). it will haunt you for ever, the techniques used seem to out date my year of birth by at least 20 years and are very, very, very annoying if you ever have seen any special effects in other movies ( the caveman will probably love it: ""*points finger* ohh beaver moving on my wall! W00T!!!"" ). if you like these special effects like in the lord of the rings or starwars well then better take a sleeping pill or keep a loaded gun ready. not to shoot oneself, but to shoot the directors. those ppl don't deserve to live a happy life anymore and should be deeply ashamed of themselves. as for the actors, if the had seen some of the wardrobe they should have resined. its better to live on the streets and beg for food and money then to play in this movie. in my honest opinion this movie qualifies for all raspberries ever given away or that will be given away in the future.ps I wished all the ppl in this movie were Japanese. the Japanese have the decency to commit suicide after they disgraced themselves an their country and suicide seems about the only way out, this movie is just inexcusable....PPS only explanation for ppl not rating this movie a clear 1 is that they must be either drunk, stoned or insane. no sane person can like this one unless its his or her first and only experience with a movie.take care, I'm gonna drink some and pray to God I wont have nightmares of narnia... if Hell exists it is narnia.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great C.S. Lewis adaptation,"""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is the long-awaited modern adaptation of C.S. Lewis' fantasy novel. Rumors of the film floated around for awhile, and no doubt the success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies encouraged this film's production. The BBC produced three Narnia films in the late 1980s and 1990 that captured the stories nicely, but were lacking in quality special effects. This adaptation captures the story nicely and has the special effects to match. With modern CGI effects the filmmakers are able to render the creatures of Narnia to be more believable than the people in suits of the BBC movies. The film captures the land of Narnia beautifully and has a great score to complement the scenery.The casting choices for the film were appropriate. All of the child actors were believable, and so were the actors and actresses that played or voiced the creatures of Narnia. Liam Neeson is an apt choice to voice Aslan and brings the needed authority to the character. Tilda Swinton was also an excellent choice as the White Witch and is appropriately menacing in the role. I enjoyed Jim Broadbent's performance in his minor role as Professor Kirke.The film is faithful to Lewis' novel and develops the material well. The film's battle scenes were well-staged and paced. The story developed here is not an epic of the same scale of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but is an exceptional fantasy story none the less. ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" nicely captures C.S. Lewis' novel and I await the next film in the chronicles, ""Prince Caspian"", with great anticipation.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An epic transposition of reality in the fantasy,"Normally, I'm never skeptical towards child-target movies, but I were (little) afraid to waste 5 euros in the ticket of ""The Chronicle of Narnia"". A big budget and good advertisement not always mean a success.What a great surprise ! The first 10 minutes, the rush during the war is emotionally stunning! I felt myself involved in the story since the first scenes, the sweetness of Lucy, the consciousness of the olders and the complex character of Edmund.Writers of the script deleted the blood and the cruel scenes (present in the original book of Lewis) to package a bittersweet gift for children and ""parents"" non-voted to bloody action. This is an aspect I appreciated a lot. Children (and adults too) don't need any additional violence than the ordinary aired daily on TV.An entire paragraph should be dedicated at the witch Tilda Swinton, a glacial actress I always loved in her past films; and her role in Narnia seems to fit her like a glove.I found ""The chronicles of Narnia"" very instructive principally for (another) war between The Good and the Evil, but the experience of Edmund and his redemption, the love between brothers (or friends) is an universal rule, in Narnia like in the real world. The crystal winter where the land is trapped, the repression against the fauns are a representation of totalitarian regimes raised in Europe before World War II - and the springs can be read as the return to the peace. Don't we forget Lewis wrote the books around 1950, when the memory of the World War II was living.All the actors, from the witch, the children and the minor characters fit their roles perfectly, giving off a sensation reality even in a queer world like that (inspired to the Italian city of Narni).The negative side of this movie, very little, maybe are the 140 minutes, too long for a child and some boring scenes. Anyway I enjoyed this movie very much and I surely recommend it for the families, the adults and for the Lord of the Rings lovers too !A must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow!,"After i saw this movie on Thursday, there was not much i could say. I was speechless. This film is definitely worthy of the book, and follows it very well. It begins amazing from the start with the World war, england bombings and the four children having to leave England. It is then when they must go to the mansion with the wardrobe. Narnia is not only a great action movie, but also quite funny. The whole theater laughed exuberantly at several parts of the movie. As the book continues, the laughs continue but larger emotions come into play. The director does a wonderful job switching emotions from tears to smiles. Of course the most amazing part, in which ever one will be talking about is the war scene. This was spectacular! The graphics are amazing and the scenes feel realistic while maintaining a PG rating. Last off, the ending does not fall short or have less impact than the ending in the book. It wonderfully finishes the film. Also, it's important to stay in the theater after the credits, there is one more small scene. The movie is brilliant, however there are some parts where people who haven't read the book may be a bit unsure of whats going on ex: the white stag, i suggest you read at least part of the book before watching this breathtaking movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a wonderful surprise,"Aside from a few continuity errors, there was little wrong or missing from this live action adaption. My 12 year old (who just started getting into the Narnia series) loved it. My 33 year old fiancée who is not a fan of fantasy enjoyed it also.The Beavers were perfect! Aslan (while not exactly what I had pictured in my mind's eye) was pretty good.Amazing special effects that often made you forget that you were looking at CGI.It is nice to be able to see a movie that is actually worth the cost of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disney shouldn't make anymore of the Chronicles,"This movie was way, way, way below my expectations and was a pathetic final product for the amount of money spent on its production. It seemed like I was watching a wildlife preserve rather than a magical kingdom with all the animals randomly appearing throughout the movie in the corners of the screen. The CGI was crap. It was so unrealistic, they could have used stop-motion techniques like in the Nightmare Before Christmas and it would have been 10 times better. There was also a shortage of dialogue. I suppose the actors and actresses had a difficult time remembering their lines. Most of the scenes that involved character interaction were nothing more than people staring at each other, then crying or smiling, then hugging. The fight choreography was embarrassing. If you can fight the way Peter and Edmond did to win the fight for Narnia, then you're probably fighting in the land of pansies.There was absolutely no character development whatsoever and there was not a decent introduction to the story. Without at least a little background or plot outline, nobody cares about what will transpire for the next two hours! Which creatures are on whose side? How did the White Witch come to power? Why are the children staying with a professor that appears to do nothing but smoke a pipe and lock himself in his room all day? It seemed like whoever edited the movie went back and re-spliced additional footage from scenes that went too long and placed it into the original version of the film to break up the action, causing the flow of the movie to suffer terribly. I read the books a long time ago as a kid and thought that they would eventually make great movies someday. But Mr. Adamson was definitely the wrong choice to helm this project.Spielberg could have made this movie a blockbuster with one hand holding onto ET. Narnia's fantasy characters were also crap. Seriously, they must have hired 1st year makeup students from liberal arts colleges to design the creatures with spray paint, play dough, hot glue guns and heads from dead animals. And Liam Neeson as Aslan? Sorry, it just doesn't work. He doesn't have a voice with a lot of forcefulness. Get somebody like Sean Connery for crying out loud! If you haven't read the books, you'll just plod along with the movie and you probably won't care at all for Lucy, Susan, Peter or Edmond, or even Aslan when he gets sacrificed, or what happens to Narnia for that matter. The producers were obviously trying very hard to make this movie feel exactly like the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The castle designs, panoramic shots of the battlefield and camps, and the camera work are such a rip off from Peter Jackson that its nauseating. To top it all off, people in the audience were laughing at how comical the acting was, especially when Susan kills the White Witch's henchman (talk about a dwarf with an attitude problem). It was one of the worst action scenes I have ever seen that involved saving someones life in the nick of time. This was a huge waste of $15 for my wife and I. Don't see this movie unless you take something to enhance your movie going experience before entering the theater.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of money.,"$180m ???? god, what a waste, what the hell were they spending it on? Turkish delights for Edmund? Well, from watching the film, all i can say about the production values, is that you're definitely not getting $180m worth.Sure, the visual effects are great, especially the wardrobe.Aslan just cracked me up when he first spoke, the horses and all the other animals too. They just look ridiculous talking.As for the direction, it was terrible. The film did not have any suspenseful moments nor any funny moments.1/10 KING KONG IS WAY BETTER!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A triumph. Even better than 'Rings' and  miles better than 'Goblet',"Who could ever have believed Disney would do it? Make a faithful, magical, complex, touching, funny and exciting screen version of Lewis's children's classic. But they have. What is so terrific about this film is that the children--all portrayed with remarkable unfaked authenticity--beautifully portray the tensions and problems of any siblings. We feel their difficulties, their rivalries, their problems--not manufactured movie-type problems but the usual conflicts apparent in any family. And the tensions between them mirror the split in the magical world in which they find themselves. I never dreamed that one of the very greatest children's books could make it to the screen in such a consummate way. Tilda Swinton is superb as the White Witch and the story, built around a great human myth that is not necessarily or exclusively Christian, is simpler and finally more satisfying on a human level than 'Rings;. Oh and Harry Potter' pales by comparison. This is a hundred times more enjoyable and more original than 'Goblet'.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narnia Movie,"When I first watched the old cartoon version of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe I instantly fell in love with it. When I saw the upcoming film based on the book and cartoon I was instantly excited. I got my hopes up and my standards set high. After seeing the movie, each standard was met and I wasn't disappointed. The movie goes hand in hand with everything the book and cartoon film had to offer. Nothing goes off of the original and it was an excellent movie. This is a wonderful family movie that everyone will enjoy. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and lets your imagination run wild!

Burn it,"First lets get one thing across. 'Epic' movies are not created by great effects alone. It takes a great story and flow to create a good movie. This had neither, considering what it had to work with.Now, I've seen the BBC version of this movie, and if you can stomach the effects of the time (and budget) you'll understand why it's a way better movie. They took the time to go through and develop the story properly, the 2005 edition is nothing more than a jazzed up movie trailer; you get the point, but for the most part its not a full story.The movie jumps around from action scene to action scene, the way i'd expect bad boys II to do, but no flow to it whatsoever. I mean, how can you take a teenage boy who can barely wield a sword and accidentally kills a wolf to being commander of an army of 5,000 or so going up against an army of 50,000 and still not die? It wasn't believable in the slightest and I say BURN IT!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie worthy of Lewis' classic story,"Narnia: a world created in the mind of C.S. Lewis and transferred onto paper to be shared with the rest of the world. For the longest time it was believed that his world, along with the world of fellow Inkling J.R.R. Tolkien could not be done any justice on a two dimensional screen. The imagination of the writer in combination with the reader was by far superior.However, both worlds have come to life in a big way. Thanks to some spectacular CGI characters and landscapes, Narnia has been transferred from the pages of this beloved children's series onto the big screen.Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are sent off to the countryside during the bombing raids over London. They are taken in by a professor, and find his house suitable for playing hide and seek. During the game, the youngest Pevensie, Lucy, discovers a wardrobe and finds her way inside, only to be transported to the land of Narnia.While there, she meets one of the Narnian's, a faun named Tumnus. He tells her why Narnia is in the condition that it is, and then allows her to go back to her world.Lucy then tries to convince everyone else of this world, but nobody believes her. Edmund is the next one to find his way into Narnia, and meets Jadis the White Witch. After giving him something to drink and some candy, she sends him back to bring his brother and sisters to her.It then happens that one day all the children find themselves running for cover after a mishap into the wardrobe. It is then that the adventure begins.Other than some scenes where it was obvious that a green screen was used, the integration of live action and animation was simply amazing. The mythological creatures not only looked real, their movements were fluid and extremely believable. And considering the cast was made up of mostly unknown names (other than a couple big names) the acting was superb on all counts.It may not be a film quite on the scale of Lord of the Rings, but make a note that it is a franchise well on it's way for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I easily recommend it to all ages,"As quoted in the press notes...""And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off...she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air..."" With that, C.S. Lewis sends young Lucy Pevensie into the magical world of Narnia. Likewise, once the big screen version of the wardrobe materializes, moviegoers follow Lucy into this alternate universe.That's the true beauty of Narnia - it isn't portrayed as just a figment of the children's imagination; it's a completely believable, imaginary world. C.S. Lewis never told the reader how he was supposed to perceive it; Lewis was content to leave a lot to the imagination. Even the final battle for Narnia is described in fewer than two pages.And that's the true beauty of the film - it takes the source material and fills in the blanks that had previously been left to the reader's mind. Visualizing in your head the fight between Aslan's army and the witch's minions is a joy for the creative, but watching a massive battle involving centaurs, minotaurs, dwarfs, giants, and a wide variety of other mythical creatures is truly a sight to behold.C.S. Lewis theorized that if a book is worth reading when you're five, then it needs to be equally worth reading when you're 50. The same holds for the movie - I gladly recommend this regardless of whether you're five or 50 or anywhere over, under, and in between.What makes The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe so accessible is its focus on topics that we can all relate to in some form - betrayal, forgiveness, selfless sacrifice, family, and loyalty. For Christians, the allegory behind the story certainly gives the film more meaning as Aslan, the Christ figure, battles the Devil's representative - the witch. But those who aren't as spiritually inclined will find this to be a great epic story of a battle between good and evil. The spiritual parallels are easy to recognize, but they're never heavy-handed.Fans of the book will notice that the movie has implemented some minor changes, and you may be puzzled by some curious exclusions (why was there no Giant Rumblebuffin?), but overall this is a faithful adaptation that should live up to and probably exceed your expectations. What is there not to like? The actors are great (particularly Tilda Swinton as the witch and the adorable Georgie Henley as Lucy), the CGI is remarkably impressive (Aslan looks very real!), the battle is genuinely exciting, the world of Narnia feels real, the creatures are given life without ever becoming cartoonish, and the moviegoer is treated to a two-hour vacation from whatever stress or hardships he or she may be enduring.There aren't a whole lot of movies these days that completely suck me into their world and force me to concentrate on the characters and the story rather than on the actors that I'm watching. Tom Cruise will always be Tom Cruise, and Angelina Jolie will always be Angelina Jolie. But for two hours Tilda Swinton is the evil witch, Georgie Henley is a little girl whose reactions feel real and sincere, and Aslan feels like more than just an impressive piece of CGI.This is exactly the kind of movie I want to see more of. Go see it. If you think you're too grown up to enjoy this and can't let your imagination get the best of you then perhaps it's time for you to, in the words of Todd Snider, grow back down.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Well done, kept the integrity of the book nicely","Having grown up reading the Chronicles of Narnia, from The Magician's Nefew through to The Last Battle, I was quite pleasantly surprised with this film.I have an issue with making good books into bad movies. That did not happen this time. I understand that sometimes the books are just too full of characters, or sub-plots to be able to make a 2 hour movie without loosing something. I was quite happy to see that this did not happen with this movie.""Gone With The Wind"" is a perfect example of what I meant. The book was so powerful that they did the whole book on film. Then proceeded to cut/edit about 4 hours worth of the story, possibly more. The end result was still over 5 hours long. Fortunately, they managed to keep the flow of the story without damaging the integrity of it.Then you take ""Flowers in the Attic"". They not only trimmed the original book, they mushed all four of the books into a very poorly produced 1 3/4 hour movie.I was very happy to see that not only did they keep the integrity of ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"", I was able to anticipate scenes. Scenes which were important to the story in the novel.I understand that C.S.Lewis was a Minister, and had attempted to use these books as a way of teaching Christian Morales. Having read all 7 books repeatedly since I was 6 yr old, I honestly do not recall any attempts to teach me better Christian beliefs or morales.The movie dos not have the feel of being anything more than a really well done Fantasy. If you are boycotting this film simply for religious reasons, perhaps you should watch it before you judge it.I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in this well written and so far, well produced, series.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

We took it just for what it was and did no comparisons to anything else - previous movies, other stories, the books. The acting and special effects were completely wonderful. We had no complaints for any of the graphics.

I love this movie!!,"I loved every minute of this movie and cried several times. I think it captured the book so well and was true to every detail. I would suggest that everyone read the books first not only because C.S. Lewis wrote such an incredible set of books, but it will allow you truly appreciate the movie and get over the whole talking animals bit. I thought all the images in movie looked so real and the makers of this film captured the greatness and majesty of Aslan perfectly. All the actors did a great job playing their roles, especially those playing Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. I remember watching a play of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe when I was child and I loved it; to watch it again on DVD as an adult makes me feel like a little girl again. I truly hope they make movies out of the rest of the books. I think this movie is right up there with Lord of the Rings!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
very colorful... very what-the-public-likes... very empty... very American,"I've been looking out for this film for some time, and was anxious to see it. Now i've seen it... and i've seldomly seen a worse book to film translation. Taking into consideration this is an incredibly good fantasy story.The film itself looks great. Visual effects were cleaner then ever and everything was vibrant and full. Sure this is needed for this big a story. 3 CG companies worked on it, and it show's. They did their part perfectly... bravo, another step forward in CGI.The story on the other hand - lacked almost everything that makes the book what it is. The book has a grand depth which makes these big fantasy stories work. It's not about the talking animals, but why they talk... it's not about the fact the 'god' is a lion, but it's about why he's a lion. This is what makes the book work on so many levels. The movie only worked on the shallow end. Aslan was far to weak compared to the book's character. The BBC version of narnia portrayed aslan as a being to be feared and loved at the same time - that is Aslan - incredibly powerful. In this movie he lacks the huge wisdom on one hand and the power on the other. A tame Aslan. Disney's Mufasa from the Lion King was twice as strong as this Aslan, and Aslan from the book is much more then Mufasa's character.The audience had to laugh about the adult peter at the end of the movie - and that's about the worst thing that can happen to a story like narnia's. He resembles 'prince charming' from Shrek 2 - who was portrayed as a self-absorbed egotistic figure. Incredibly big flaw...These are a couple of the bigger faults - but the whole movie is desaturated in the same way. If you read the book and find this film satisfying in comparison, please read the book again, because the book is meant to tell much much more then this movie does. This film ended up in the McDonalds-commercial category. Very sweet... very colorful... very smartly adapted to what-the-public-likes... very empty... no vitamins, just a short lasting good taste.There were some good parts. The Lucy character was nicely done, and really made an imprint. The other 3 didn't... i couldn't describe their personalities if i was asked now. Which negates Lucy's quality.I've seen about a zillion stars for this film, but i really, really don't understand. Maybe the big posters and the visuals indeed are enough. The quality of Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings must be very much underestimated if this movie gets this high a rating. Hope Disney chooses another director, because Narnia requires someone deeper... and less American.Walt would never approve.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Enough to Pull In Old and New Fans Alike, of All Age Groups","'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a truly outstanding fantasy adventure. Based on the beloved children's book written by C.S. Lewis in 1950, it has enough to pull in old and new fans alike, of all age groups. While the film has been kept to a PG rating in the U.S. to remain children friendly, it is by no means meant to be purely for children. The book has seen three other adaptations: a television series, an animated film and a live-action made-for-television movie; this is the first adaptation to be released in theaters.For anyone who may not know the story of 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,' here is a brief overview: Peter, Susan, Edmure and Lucy Pevensie are sent away from London during World War II, and come to live at the house of Professor Digory. Lucy, the youngest, finds a mystical wardrobe which leads her to another world, which the others don't believe her about at first. But soon all four come to the land called Narnia, and find that it is being ruled by an evil White Witch, Jadis, who has declared it shall be forever winter but never Christmas. To defeat her, they must join forces with Aslan the lion, true King of Narnia, and lead an army in a great battle between good and evil.Andrew Adamson, who co-directed the first two 'Shrek' films, steps up for his first feature-length film and does not disappoint. The start of the movie is dark and moody, much like the attitudes the four children have. It isn't until Lucy's first visit into Narnia that coloring truly starts to lighten, helping Narnia to truly seem like another world. Adamson creates scenes that are beautiful and sweeping, and scenes that are disturbing and dark. And while he used enough action to make the film slightly more appealing to audiences, he never strays too far from the heart of the novel.The acting is also superb in this film. Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch is a wonderful villain. She has proved before that she is a great actress, but she is truly at the top of her game here. She becomes the role, and makes Jadis so evil that you can not help but hate her. The four children, three of whom have never made feature-length films before this, are all outstanding in their roles as well. They make the characters believable, and display their faults just as well as their virtues. And the voice acting, especially Liam Neeson as Aslan, is very well done, making you believe these animals can truly speak.The visual effects are very nicely done for the film. While some animals, such as the Beavers, are obviously done with computer animation, they still come off believable within their landscape. The work done for Aslan is especially astounding, having combined shots of a live lion with computer animation to create a truly magnificent talking lion. Richard Taylor's work, featured in 'The Lord of the Rings' as well, is obvious throughout the film with beasts hideous and beautiful, and magnificent armor and weapons. The score for the film is wonderfully composed and utilized especially well in the battle sequences.There is one point I should address. The film is not obvious Christian propaganda, as some would paint it to be. Yes, it's true that the story has ties to Christian beliefs. But those story points are never pointed out as being Christian in origin. The religious context is no more than other epic fantasies like 'Star Wars' and 'The Lord of the Rings' contain, it just has slightly more bearing on the main focus of the story. Yes, you're bound to see Christian themes in the film, but they are themes that run in many stories, some predating the Christian belief system. Please do not let talk of religious themes affect whether you would see this film.'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is one of the first films to have an obvious influence from Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. While the idea of making an updated film version of the book has been floating around for several years, it was the popularity of Jackson's films that prompted this movie to be made. After Tolkien's books-turned-movies hit theaters, Walden Media opted to adapt all seven of C.S. Lewis' 'Narnia Chronicles' in feature-length film version. While 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is the only book optioned so far, it seems likely that Disney will at least make a trilogy of movies, if not adapting all seven books.I look forward to see what else they do with the series. This film, while perhaps not quite reaching the epic status of 'The Lord of the Rings,' is a great movie to see. Beautifully done, with great action, adventure and drama, it truly is a fantasy film for all ages. While it may not be the best fantasy adventure to date, I can't imagine it possibly being better adapted than it is. For that, I gladly give the film 9 stars, and recommend it as a must-see this holiday season.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Superb Film!,"I just put this film together for the Friday opening and what a treat it was to watch. Almost right away, you will be whisked into this incredible fantasy world with some of the best scenery and graphics sense ""Lord of the Rings"". The soundtrack accompanies the film well adding a great depth to this magical land. The acting and voice talents of many characters were also done exceptionally well in my opinion. With all those elements added together you get a wonderful film you will be engrossed in from start to finish. However, It maybe a little too much for really young kids to follow. The screenplay seemed to follow C.S. Lewis's masterpiece nicely. A very moral and uplifting story about good triumphing over evil with a biblical twist. So if you're between 8 and 108 check it out; I don't think you will be disappointed!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hey!  You trod on my dreams!!, and the dreams of every child.","I haven't written a spoiler - the entire movie is one big spoiler for anyone who respects the written words of CS (Jack) Lewis for the treasures they are, and who hopes that their child might learn a love of reading and develop their own imagination without being told what or how to think.Problem one - Where is The Magician's Nephew? Without that before LW&W you are only getting Narnia Lite, despite what the theological purists say about the reading order.Problem two - Jack Lewis wrote the stories to get children to think and imagine for themselves. Showing children what to imagine is like doing their homework for them, but on a much more soul-destroying and life-long scale.Problem three - the voice-overs were chosen for pop-appeal rather than from serious quality actors. Comediennes and pop singers!!! A travesty wrapped in a farrago of misrepresentations.Problem four - a wise person said that the Chronicles of Narnia should be read four times - as a child, as a young adult, in middle age and finally in old age, because the words of Jack Lewis will bring you a different kind of joy each time.How can you do that with a movie? I can't think of a crueller thing to do to the memory and legacy of Jack Lewis or to your own children than to show them what and how to imagine rather than giving them the books and letting them imagine Narnia for themselves.Except to show them the earlier 'muppet' version, but the crippling of the childhood imagination is the same unless they read the original words for themselves.Truly great books were never meant to be recycled into celluloid, and this is one instance. Lewis wanted to teach children to think and imagine for themselves, and this film does neither and cripples both.All in all, give your children the printed words of Lewis for the rest of their lives, not some flack's CGI imagination, editorial compromises and pop-culture voice-overs for a couple of hours of electronic babysitting.This movie could debase the opportunity to imagine for one's self, for an entire generation of children who might have learned to love to read.If you truly love your children, buy them the books and skip the fake film version - a cluster-bomb for a child's imagination and intellect.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant Faithful Adaptation,"I saw the film on the day it came out as I love the books and was quite looking forward to it, and boy I was not disappointed. The cast, special effects and direction were spot one of the best films of the year. The stand out moments would have to be Tilda Swinton as the white witch giving a performance which is the epitome of evil and of course Aslan whoever thought of casting Liam Neeson as Aslan needs to be given a medal. Lastly Rupert Everett as the fox expanded from the book but still a great character. All in all a great film for all ages even though not for the really young however. Still released at precisely the right time (christmas, should be destined to become a classic in years to come and quite right too.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Take a trip into a truly magical world,"Gosh that film was fab, not sure if my eyes stopped watering all the way through and was trying so hard not to sob when Aslan died and then during the war etc, even though I remember the story and knew what was coming. What a fantastically done movie.Was coming home and nearly took a heart attack as a wolf jumped out at the side of the road, then I realised it was actually just a husky..on a lead.. Ah well! Can't get over how amazing everything and everyone was. Lucy wasn't nearly as annoying as in the BBC version. I completely loved Mr Tumnus, and then the beavers and then Aslan. Was just amazing and all the wee details like the badgers that scurried past at one point. Crickey I could go on all night! Go see it now!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie of the Year.,"I LOVE this movie. I mean I love the books so I was a little hesitant when I heard the reports of the film makers having changed it so much. I was very surprised that the changes actually made me like the movie even more! I mean they stuck true to what CS Lewis originally thought up. Only adding to the story to help with the baseline. Even cooler is the fact that this stands alone as a great movie and people can stop comparing it to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. It can stand alone in movie History as another great addition to the fantasy genre. And regarding the fear that it might be too ""Christian"" as a lover of the series and A Christian I was also pleasantly surprised that the film makers didn't detract from the original allegory without stressing too much on the fact that its not a Christian movie. The story is an allegory. I saw the context but that doesn't mean that it should only be seen for that. It's a wonderful story and and a wonderful movie that every one should watch. I just hope the filmmakers are smart enough to make all seven.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deathly boring,"I don't even know why I went to go see this movie. I didn't really like the books; I was up to my nose in hobbits. This movie really didn't appeal to me, and as my friends sobbed over the death of Aslan, I was like, what's the big deal? He didn't even look real! None of the animals did! I could almost see through them! The writing was nearly word for word from the book. I'm not kidding. It shows that the writer cannot think for himself and therefore must copy words from the original source. The movie has no flow, and I don't think that it is any coincidence that the 'good guys' colours are the same of Rohan in Lord of the Rings. I also believe that watching the battle scene it 'battle of the Five armies' all over again. I would not suggest this film to anyone!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonderful Film,"I have seen this film twice now. I have to say, the film is wonderful. I have read negative comments here by people who are quite frankly up their own arses. GET A LIFE PEOPLE. Those who denigrate this film simply do not get the point. I feel sorry for these people who try to impose their own weak sense of self and who try to appear 'educated'. The fact is they come across as pathetic - they know the price of everything and the value of nothing. This was a beautiful film....it completely bowled me over. To those people who didn't get the film.....my heart really goes out to you....you are obviously missing some gene or something.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Technically adequate but poor screenplay and direction,"The first half hour of LW&W is great. They set up the four children and their relationship well, and we get to see their entrances into Narnia - and it feels really quite magical. However once all the children find their way into the wardrobe things go downhill, rapidly.There are various things in the screenplay that aren't in the book. Usually this is understandable for the requirements of the medium, but in this case it is totally unnecessary, for example a melting ice river scene.The screenwriters have added 21st century gags into a 1950s story. The gags work better than the story (well they did with the audience I was with).Unfortunately the White Witch just isn't white enough for me. She could be described as pale. So she's not the pantomime baddie you expect her to look like, but her clothes and her Ice Palace are pretty cheap looking. Bad memories of Die Another Day and Batman & Robin came back - they look good but are totally unbelievable. And when a certain man in a beard turns up you either know it's Father Christmas (because you've read the book) or it's a random man in a beard - i.e. he looks nothing like an image of Father Christmas.I am being hard with the film, but there are good points to raise. The effects are overall terrific, even if they do conjure up happier memories of a Peter Jackson blockbuster. Aslan does look real, and the beasts have been created with care. Harry Gregson-William's music is good when used in the right scene, but here again it's way too rhythmic and 21st century for the scenarios most of the time.The acting is good, with Tilda Swinton providing a strong, though not menacing performance. Of the four children, I'd say Lucy was the strongest, though they all did above average work for a film like this.My main problem with this film lies with director Andrew Adamson. He's a master of CGI work (a-la Shrek) and he deals with the fantasy world well...for a Shrek film, but in my book the vivid colours and style is more suited to a comedy, not a serious fantasy film. And Peter suddenly can wield a sword and ride horses, just like that. Of course everything has to be compared with Lord of the Rings, but in this case, it falls so far short it shouldn't be compared at all. Or maybe I'm being unfair and Narnia isn't supposed to be like Middle-Earth.Adamson has had to work with a compromised script so that scenes we are meant to feel something in don't work because there's been no emotional build up to (Aslan's introduction is very under whelming, as is conveying his ""Legend"" status). Then there are the logical mistakes, such as screaming at the top of your voice about how to evade capture when you're only a few feet away from the enemy, or hearing a whisper half a mile away etc.The allegorical argument is lost on me, I am a person who knows nothing about bible stories, but I think this is an easy recruiting film for the evangelicals in America (who part-financed the film anyway). However, for young children not of the Christian faith, this will simply be a good story.Overall I give marks for technical prowess and the opening 30 minutes. However the rest of the film is lacklustre to me, a very cynical 22 year old, but I know younger children will enjoy this film a lot, and rightly so. I don't see this franchise living up to the Harry Potter status because, basically, the stories are really dated. LW&W was very faithful to the source novel, but subsequent stories with much less ""money-shot action"" will no doubt be altered beyond recognition for the lowest common denominator audience. Hopefully the series will be an allegory of Aslan - die soon, then resurrect for the force of good. The later stories deserve better than this.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exciting and True to the Book,"The only complaint I have is that it didn't last longer! Despite his wish to avoid a live action version of any of the seven Chronicles, C.S. Lewis would be proud. Tilda Swinton IS the White Witch, she is as cold and calculating as one would expect her to be. Her violent cruelty as well as some of the other violent themes are toned down a bit, though - a little Disneyfied - however, the strangeness of the tale is uncompromised and it is truly magnificent. It is obvious to me that, like The Lord of the Rings, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was made by some who appreciate the book, if not absolutely love it. The cinematography is phenomenal and the casting couldn't have been better. I can't wait to see the rest of them!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Must See,"Went to see it with my kids... 9 and 7 yrs of age; the boy Loved it. He quoted ""the best movie I have ever seen in all my life"". So I'm waiting to buy it when it comes out on DVD. The movie evolves with great scenery; then has excellent special effects with the mythological creatures that seem real. My daughter (7) had a little trouble with the battle and she closed her eyes; but for the rest she enjoyed it as much as my 10 year old. If you haven't seen the movie, what are you waiting for? Its always nicer to watch it on a theater even though you buy it afterwards on DVD; I know I am...

Everyone should see this!,"After watching the verbal bashing given by Jonathan Ross on BBC a few weeks ago, I was a little wary of going to watch this one. Since my kids and other half wanted to see it, I quashed my reservations and off we went...Well, what a delight! I have read the Narnia books several times over the years and had a good mental visualisation of what I thought it was like. In many cases, the film echoed this pretty well, with the exception of the witch's palace. I just loved Mr Tumnus! My other half, who is notoriously choosy about his film viewing was entranced, too, not to mention the children, my teenage daughter, especially who was viewing for the second time! So, I think the film will appeal to all.I must mention that the filming, special effects and photography were beautiful, with such wonderful scenery that it briefly made me want to emigrate to NZ! The musical score was also lovely; it reminded me a bit of the Lord of the Rings score at times - along with the scenery, of course. Fantastic!So, to summarise, great film, well worth watching however old you are. You don't need to have read the book to understand the film, either. I'd recommend to Jonathan Ross that he should go and read the book of the film he rubbished, whether he has read it before or not. Then, he will see it ain't half bad, mate! I nearly missed out on seeing a cracker, 'cos I listened to you....",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Typical Disney mess,"The problem with Disney is that they try way too hard to sell the product, to rake in the big bucks, and it is quite obvious when one watches this ""epic."" While the cast is quite good and attractive, too much just did not work here. Why does Disney always have to include the standard ""talking animals doing the stand-up comedy bit?"" The wolves looked good, genuinely scary, until the lead wolf started to talk. He sounded as menacing as Richard Simmons. I guess the guys at Disney were afraid that if they included any scary or intense moments at all, then the parents wouldn't shell out the bucks at the movie houses and then at the DVD store. Everything was so fanatically politically correct. No, the oldest boy could never stab the wolf that was about to eat his brother and sisters. The wolf literally jumped on the sword. I am not saying the film should have been filled with the same frightful images as the thousand times better LOTR. But this limp adaption of a classic children's book is just disappointing. Every commercial stunt was pulled here to ensure big numbers at the box office. I hate this kind of movie-making. And even more, i miss the days before computer imaging replaced real special effects, or real anything for that matter. Why build a magnificent kingdom, even if it is on miniature scale, when they can simply super-impose the image onto the screen? It must save the studios billions of dollars. The only problem is, it looks like crap. It was obvious that most of the landscape was simply not there. Personally if i want to look at this kind of thing, I would prefer simple animation, classic Saturday morning cartoons. I suppose after the cinematic milestone that was Lord Of the Rings, it will be quite difficult for anything to live up to that films grandeur. And perhaps computer imaging was used in LOTR, but it was done so much better. The landscapes, the cities, the million plus armies, actually looked real for the most part. I guess however, that kids will love ""Narnia."" Most kids are fairly easy to please. Look at all the junk on TV every Saturday morning! This one is a disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not perfect, but good enough to start a potential franchise","I admit I have never read a single ""Narnia"" novel (although I've read a few chapters of C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity""), but I did get excited about ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" getting its cinematic treatment considering the great awe I had for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, of whom the author of the novel it was based on - J.R.R. Tolkien - was a good friend of Lewis.The first part of what could be a new installment in the fantasy genre tells the story of four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - who are brought far away from London to an old country house to escape the perils of World War II. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy stumbles upon a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an otherwise empty room. She hides inside only to realize she is transported to the perpetually snowing land of Narnia, a land where animals talk and the evil White Witch rules causing the winter spell.Soon, all four of them get to enter the land and they learn of Narnia's history: the great lion Aslan is the true guardian of the kingdom and has been absent for many years but is ""on the move again."" It is also prophesied that when four children are to take the throne, the witch's powers will fail.As I've said, I've never read the book and was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the movie, other than it was set in Narnia, that there was a lion, there was a witch, and there was a wardrobe. And from the plot summaries at the back of so many versions of the book, I also knew there were four children. But after watching it I'm now thinking of catching up on what I missed on my reading list during my childhood years. ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" presents a variety of messages, both within the Christian context (which should be obvious) and the world in general.I don't know how much liberty was done with the book but I like the direction director and co-writer Andrew Adamson and screenwriters Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely took the audience on. Adamson has accomplished to retell a story that includes talking lions, beavers, foxes, fauns, centaurs and other fantastical creatures which could have been otherwise ineffective, and maybe even unintentionally funny. His experience with Donkey and Puss in Boots may have helped.Adamson succeeds in all this while the script provides it with humor. It is also filled with impressive visuals, peppered with good soundtrack. The film also boasts of first-rate CGI but unlike ""King Kong,"" where CGI was used in an over-indulging fashion, Adamson uses it to perfection. Through all this, he works with a cast of mostly first-time actors, especially the children. The performance in particular by Georgie Henley as Lucy, is sweet but never cloying. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch provides menace to her character.I think it has enough charm and enough depth to stand quite well on it's own. I guess it depends on how the viewer will react to the thematic story beloved by many (unread by me) in this Disney interpretation. Perhaps a lot of people will be inclined to dismiss it, partly because the religious theme may turn them off, partly because they hate Disney, and partly because fantasy is just not their thing.While I would not say this movie is better than other fantasy films of the contemporary era, it certainly does bring a positive outlook for what's to come to the series or even to the whole genre. ""Lord of the Rings"" has attained such great heights and even the ""Harry Potter"" has elevated itself so much that, personally, this first installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" finds itself a little wanting. Still, it is well-made, and that says a lot for a first installment... that is, if it IS the first installment.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This being said, my sister really really enjoyed it, she is 7 years old and she loved it. I also enjoyed it, it was overall a well created movie, I think this movie is better then any of the HP series (The books however are probably equal ,maybe an edge to Narnia).

Great views with flat and boring characters,"I saw the TV series when I was a kid, and therefore I had high expectations about this new movie. Sadly I have to say that I still think that the old series are better then this movie. Somehow they managed to forget to tell the story and focused on the battles in a pathetic ""we want to be as good as LOTR""-kind of way. You just don't want the kids to win the stupid battle because the characters are flat and boring. The exceptions are Lucy, the White Witch and many of the non-lead characters. They couldn't even get proper equipment or clothing/armor or teach the stupid kids how to use their weapons in a realistic way. Put the curtain back on that wardrobe!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A delight from start to finish.,"Narnia on the BIG screen. What a tremendous piece of filmmaking. As a fan of the books - I read them so often in primary school, I could almost recite them word for word, and I've read them plenty since, as an adult - and a fan of the BBC television adaptation (which remains excellent), I had high hopes for the first big-screen treatment.The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe exceeded my wildest expectations. I was blown away!William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley and Anna Popplewell are perfectly cast as the Pevensie's. Tilda Swinton brings the necessary evil to Jadis, the White Witch. Liam Neeson is the perfect voice (sorry, Roland Pickup!) for Aslan. Ray Winstone as Mr Beaver, James McAvoy as Mr Tumnus... I could go on and on and on. The visuals are perfect. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is appropriately rousing.All the pieces came together.I love this film like few others.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kudos and congrats on  a new Children's Classic!,"My first introduction to the Narnia, (prior to reading and falling in love with the book) was through the 1979 cartoon. I had seen bits and pieces of the 1988 BBC production, and while it captured my attention I can't say I was ever really that crazy about it. I found it extremely slow paced. While a discussion has been on-going about the look of the Pevensie children in this current film version, it should be pointed out that the young girl playing Lucy in that version is Eleanor Roosevelt in training, sporting an over-bite that enters each frame before she does. Not exactly a pretty picture.For years I had hoped someone would bring this tale to life on the big screen. It was rumored that the movie version would be updated and set in the city of Los Angeles. Why not?! Good idea! Let's take a story that children of all ages have loved for over 40 years and ""improve it, by modernizing it and giving it that Hollywood touch!"". Wonderful. While we're at it, let's remake ""The Wizard of Oz"" and cast Brittney Spears as Dorothy and Jim Carey as the wizard.Producer Perry Moore and director Andrew Adamson should be praised and applauded for their beautiful, endearing , magical and most importantly, FAITHFUL film adaptation of a children's classic. Again, I highly disagree with the rantings of those attacking the children and their ""looks"", and let's not forget people they are just kids, ,so lay off, OK ? It's bad enough having bullies on the playground at a young and tender age, but to have the American public attack them on a message board, Come on! Personally, I think William Mosely is adorable as Peter Pevensie. Georgie Henely is the perfect choice for the wide and innocent Lucy. She is thoroughly believable as the little girl who stumbles upon the magical world of Narnia. Every giggle, every tear drop is right on the money and honest. I never once got the impression that this kid was forcing her performance. She could certainly be a model to most other child actors in Hollywood, and more then half of the adult's as well.Tilda Swinton turns in a riveting, bravura performance as the White Witch. Aside from being stunning , she is deliciously wicked. Liam Neeson is the perfect choice for the voice of ""Aslan"", rightful ruler of the magical world. James McAvoy is a delight as Mr. Tumnus. Jim Broadbent deserves a nod in his small but pivotal and endearing role of Professor Kirke. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are a hoot!I also found the movie visually stunning. In particular the moments at the castle of the White Witch, the children's journey with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver to the meet Aslan and of course the great palace of Cair Parevel. If you see anything this Holiday season , make it ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"". You will not be disappointed.Oh, yes...I do have one complaint. There is a marvelous moment between Lucy and the Professor at the end of the film, edited as it is, it shows up after some credits are rolling and so often times people miss out as they are leaving the theater . I have seen the film several times now. I hope when they release the DVD version, they will tag the moment between Lucy and the Professor on BEFORE they roll the credits.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
all that hype for nothing,"Having been eagerly anticipating the much awaited chronicles or narnia I was upset when it turned out to be such a monotoned, slow and sleep inducing film.Right up until the final battle scene staying awake was less appealing than running off to the toilets for a quick whizz, the story takes far too long before any real action occurrs, and the only scene which does the original storyline any credit is the grand fight scene, a little over-dramatic and a waste of time, my verdict is please don't waste your time. allow your imagination to create narnia, rather than ruin a what should be epic of a film.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I was constantly checking my watch and making cynical remarks. The movie was a blockbuster disappointment. Sadly, at certain serious points, I was left laughing. I do not recommend seeing this movie, the children in the movie gave it their best but it was a cinematic disaster.

I expect great things from this movie, and wasn't disappointed.The special effects were amazing, especially the animation of the beavers and Aslan.

A Fantasy Well Grounded in Reality,"CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual. Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels. Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters. The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent). The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe. Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong. As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response. In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting. Quibbles aside, it is a charming film.

Poor score the only fault,"I am a great fan of the books and I was very satisfied with this film. I don't think it could have been done any better or more faithfully than it was EXCEPT for the score. Yawn. In a couple of places it sounded like LOTR wannabe. In a couple of other places, PASSION OF Christ wannabe. Mostly, it was instantly forgettable. Can you hum a single tune from the score a month after seeing the movie? Neither can I. How about some fantastic music next time around? Loved the kids, the faun, the professor, the centaurs, the witch, and the beautiful scenery. Aslan was as good as a CG lion can be, though he is still fake-looking...I'm not sure it's possible to perfectly portray a feline deity.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I could see a little bit of everyone's naughty little brother in Edmund. The Narnia world was overwhelming and all I could do is wish I lived there. I really appreciated that the movie stayed along the ""Christian"" lines too. The lion was so real and majestic. Even I felt a tingling of fear at the first sight of him.

One down - six to go...,"Most people will be wanting to compare the Narnia movie with the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings. How could you not? So how do you do it? You do not.This film stands on its own and it does it well. The movie grabs you and pulls you into the universe of Narnia as well as the Lord of the Rings.The effects are as good as LotR... but given that it was the same company, you would expect so. If you liked the Look and 'feel' of LotR, you will let yourself get swept away by this one.The story line is as per the novel, with a few variations here and there. On the whole, I felt that the movie has an impact close to what the book had on me so many years ago.Now we come to where the movie lost the point that would have scored it a perfect 10. The actors. Almost all are good if not terrific, however there is something lacking. To name names and point fingers, Peter and Susan. Lucy is great and Edmund is just as believable in the role as the self absorbed coming of age teen ager that redeems himself. Peter and Suan are weak and not all that believable, which is a shame, as you find yourself stretching to feel for them.My hat is off to Liam as Aslan. I thought that he would be awful and not have the voice for it, but after 'seeing' him in action, I am more than happy to eat my words.Where does this leave us?

Classic Literature on the Big Screen,"I'm always skeptical about classic literature being made into movies. Too often there's a sense of disappointment when the end credits roll. Too much left out, too much changed, too much just /not right/ about it.As I walked out of the theater today after seeing Chronicles of Narnia: Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I felt like I had just finished reading the book all over again.The four children could not have been better cast. I was annoyed by them in the beginning and loved them by the end -- just as I did in the book. They're going to be highly sought after, should the choose to continue acting. Tilda Swinton could not have played the cold Witch better. Even the tepid Southern winters could not stave the chill down my spine. The c-g characters were alive. I swear they were. Even the wardrobe looked exactly how I imagined it.Very little had actually been left out of the movie, nothing really changed. I'm having to reevaluate my opinion on books-into-movies. The movie is a bit intense for the youngest children, but then, so was the book. I look forward to the rest of the series.8 out of 10 (from a very tough audience)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not true enough.,"I have love ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" since childhood, reading this particular book over 10 times. I just finished it again today and watched this movie again. Unfortunately, this film relies on fabricated tension instead of the tension still built into the book, and it makes for a very weak story that never really builds to the emotional climax the book delivers. Some tense words from the book are simply removed from this movie, or re-fashioned in the name of excitement. The movie adds tension that simply doesn't exist in the book. It hurts to say that it this is a clear attempt to follow in the LOTR greatness and simply comes up short.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
excellent,"This is the movie that I've been waiting for, not the televised played back in the seventies (or eighties) that I had to endure with much disappointment. C.S. Lewis would've definitely been proud of the way Andrew Adamson handled the story, and the visual effects were of course spellbinding to watch. A worthy rival to Lord of the Rings, and I cannot wait for the next six to be completed. Until then, I will just have to read the rest of them, won't I? Great performances by the new-coming performers for Edmund, Lucy, Susan, and Peter, and of course Jim Broadbent. Tilda Swinton was vicious and just chilling (pun intended) as the White Witch, and Liam Neeson was just great as portraying the voice of Aslan. I totally recommend this film, though I think it would be far better if you read the novel(s) first, as I should have.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Back to Childhood,"I have to admit that this film is a quite promising opening to a trilogy. Even though the first half of the film feels very slow, I guarantee the imaginative depiction of the world of Narnia so beautiful and magical. The character depictions are neatly written, I like each character's character which stands out without being monotonous. Even though the plot is so slow at the beginning of the film, it's fun then it goes so fast. I loved the White Witch's acting, as did the other characters. It's just that Lucy looked so stiff in some scenes and it bothered me a little. This film really feeds your childhood.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing,"The storyline was very interesting with its plot twists. The character development of Edmund was great since he turned from a selfish kid who only thinks of himself to a person who is selfless and caring. Not only did he change from a tractor to a hero, but he also acquired a lot of good qualities that a true leader should have. The special effects were not bad considering that the movie was made in 2005. The movie also adheres to the actual book which is very rare in most ""book-based"" movies. All in all the movie was awesome and I rate it 9/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wanted to be impressed. Wasn't.,"Classic literature and CGI technology don't always mix. They did an admirable job of it but at the same time it became a distraction. C.S Lewis had developed such rich characters replete with conflict and emotional frailty. The actors, particularly Peter and Edmund, were horrendous. I thought their performances were so wooden and two dimensional I thought maybe they were CGI. Peter was too wimpy, Edmund failed to broadcast the internal complexity of his Judas nature, the girls I thought, were fantastic. I didn't hate the movie, but I did not get the veneration surrounding it either. It could have been much more were it not for, yet again, the focus on computer generated spectacle winning out over simply telling the story. I wouldn't say don't see it, but keep your expectations in check.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful adaptation,"I remember seeing this movie over ten years ago in the cinema and even back then I thought it was a great movie. Even though it's not as good as the book (which has always remained a classic in children's literature), I consider this film to be The Lord of the Rings for kids and like the Lord of the Rings, it was filmed in New Zealand as well and some aspects reminded me of the Lord of the Rings trilogy like the effects or the action scenes or the fact that it all took place in a fantasy world. I enjoyed all the actors that played the Pevensie children and I loved Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. I'm very glad that I read the book before I saw the film. I also enjoyed the two other sequels. But I think the Narnia movie trilogy is kind of underrated. While it's nowhere near as good The Lord of the Rings trilogy, they deserve more credit.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This was really pretty bad,"As a general rule of thumb, it's best not to try to take a timeless classic novel and try to convert it to the big screen (unless you happen to be named Peter Jackson.) Last time I checked, Andrew Adamson wasn't Peter Jackson. I liked Shrek and all, but the book that, admittedly, really funny movie was based on was by no means a timeless beloved classic. While I do not believe that Narnia books are nearly as brilliant as they commonly made out to be, I still have to give C.S. Lewis credit for making books as a segue into fantasy for the children too young to read the actual classic fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. So while I do feel that Narnia books are very over-rated, I can still see their worth in introducing 4 and 5 year olds to the genre (and seriously, 4-5 is about the age level these books seem to be written for.)However, the movie adaptation takes the books' unengaging, repetitive nature, and then goes on to disregard all the values that made the books at least worth the paper they're printed on. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe adaptation attempts to be a poor man's Lord of the Ring. It keeps true to the books for the most part, but Adamson interprets what is not specifically specified in the book and tries to recreate the epic battle sequences found in both the Tolkien and the Jackson ""Rings"" trilogies. For example, in the novel version of ""The Lion, etc."" the final battle lasts somewhere around a page and a half. Along came the movie, and WHAM! 25 minute battle scene, anyone?The fact the book was made into a movie at all was also a bad decision. The book is very slow, and takes it's sweet time in causing anything to happen. With only the two Shrek movies under his belt (and stuff was continuously occurring in those. Shrek is the definition of never a dull moment) Adamson has no real experience making anything with long slow bits of dialog that seems written by George Lucas (and no, that's not a compliment.)The acting in the film wasn't horrible. It was a darned sight better than in that cinematic piece of crap called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Now there's a film that makes a Uwe Boll movie look like manna from Heaven. Comparatively, simply because the acting was completely atrocious, this film seems about on par with one of his. I'm not saying the acting was genius or deserves any special awards. On the contrary, it was quite forgettable. But therein lies the key. Bad performances, as well as brilliant ones, can be remembered for long periods of time. I guarantee that whatever you've heard about this movie, good OR bad, the conversation probably did not revolve around William Mosely or Georgie Henley, or any of the other actors. They are not memorable in the slightest.So on the plus side, this movie didn't have me debating the merits of destroying a movie with nuclear weapons simply so future audiences don't have to sit through it and current audiences are put out of their misery. However, this came about as close as you can get to the point. Actually, Im being unfair. This movie is the perfect sleep aid. If you know any insomniacs, and Lunesta doesn't work, they may have found their perfect sleep aid. I know I did. And then, unfortunately, after the good night's sleep I was granted, I had to watch ""This film that involves something to do with a gigantic carnivorous cat, a warlock, and a big closet"" again. I did not fall asleep this team, and I was able to come to terms with how much of a cinematic turd this really is. It's just not the worst turd in existence. And that's a back-handed compliment if ever I saw one.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent adaptation and heartfelt tale,"Sometimes certain films can leave a big impact on first arrival, but don't have the staying power to remain in public conscious. Despite a lot of comparisons to 'Lord of the Rings' (often unfavourable ones), I believe 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' is probably one of the best films to recommend to a young person starting out in live action fantasy films, and can stay as an exemplary adaptation of C.S. Lewis' first part of The Chronicles of Narnia.During the London Blitz of WWII, four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, are evacuated to stay in a professor's house in the countryside. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe that leads to the frozen land of Narnia, and befriends the benevolent faun Mr. Tumnus. She learns that Narnia is ruled by an evil sorceress known as the White Witch, who has made the land ""always winter but never Christmas"", ruling with an iron fist. Her siblings don't believe her at first, but soon they enter into Narnia with her and become caught in a brewing war between the White Witch and the noble lion Aslan, and must save their brother Edmund and all of Narnia from the White Witch.The performances from the young actors are all solid; Skandar Keynes manages to portray Edmund as a misguided boy and not wholly malevolent as both sullen and sympathetic, William Mosely and Anna Popplewell provide warm and earnest performances and work well off their siblings, but young Georgie Henley simply glows as the innocent and sweet natured Lucy with boundless emotion and charm and my personal favourite among the Pevensies. Thanks to the added backdrop of WWII, I believe they feel more realized as characters, and it parallels the Narnian war they find themselves in.Tilda Swinton encapsulates the cold cruelty and commanding presence of the White Witch; her inhumanity and seductive ways can be pretty creepy. James McAvoy brings Mr Tumnus to live right off the pages and I can find no fault in his portrayal. I especially love his interactions with Lucy, bringing a truly innocent friendship to life. James Cosmo even cameos as Father Christmas! In terms of voice acting, Ray Winstone and Dawn French turn in humorous and likable beavers, Rupert Everett has a fun cameo as a fox, and Aslan's warmth and wisdom is conveyed by Liam Neeson's excellent voice work.By today's standards many argue that the CGI is rather dated and in some instances not well rendered, but it is still reliable in telling the story rather than showing off special effects for their own sake. Thankfully Aslan is consistently emotive, well rendered and animated to the point where you can easily buy into the movie illusion. The digital artistry, New Zealand locations and physical sets blend together to create a lot of beautiful visuals from the lamppost in the wintry forest to the epic battle between Aslan's army and the White Witch. Considering Andrew Adamson's earlier involvement in the first two Shrek films, this was a rather smooth transition from animation to live action film, but not a perfect one. For me at least, there's something incredible about seeing so many fantastical creatures like centaurs, fauns, satyrs, minotaurs and dwarfs amidst griffons, werewolves, lions, leopards, unicorns and other creatures come together to fight for a land of pure fantasy. The accompanying music of Harry Gregson-Williams is gorgeous, with lilting, gentle melodies and uplifting choruses for the many awe inspiring scenes, and it really compliments the film.While LOTR was a war epic with a serious tone, the final battle feels more like an act of hope, in which Aslan would still be with them in spirit, which fits perfectly with Lewis' allegory of faith. The religious subtext is present but it's not forced, in fact it's rather subtle when compared to the book and anybody may be able enjoy the film without feeling bludgeoned by the religious symbolism. I feel that because of the simplicity of the story and characters, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' feels less engaging and very slight compared to Game of Thrones or LOTR, which is why it skews best towards a younger audience. The focus is largely on the sense of wonder and discovery of Narnia as opposed to the war, unlike LOTR, which I never believed the filmmakers were trying to directly imitate. Ultimately 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is an inspiring and heartfelt film that manages to capture the spirit of Lewis and brings a grand fantasy world to life.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautifully done and true,"Those of us - and there are many - who know and love the works of the great Christian apologist CS Lewis, found this movie version of his first children's book surprisingly true to the original and really beautifully done in every way.Perhaps not everyone on this list knows the background of the Chronicles but, briefly, he and Tolkien were close friends at Oxford and belonged to the same writers' club. While discussing the impossibility of reaching youngsters with the message of Christianity, they each decided to write thrilling stories for children that would also include Christian morality and voilà! we have Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia.In my opinion, the only way to really appreciate the Narnia books is to 1) read them aloud to a child and 2) read some of Lewis' other works, so that you get the context.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Dream Come True,"I Thank God so much the book was made into a movie this is a dream come true if no one did, I will! After I've finished broadcast and took up Directing, Cinematography etc. I'm so glad I didn't have to wait for so long but it would be an honor & privilege if given a chance.The film was not bad at all for it was done in good taste and that they have mostly sticked to the book's tradition except for Lucy who should have been a blonde girl but that's just fine, very minimal Goergie did justice to Lucy's character, not to mention she is adorable. William is just right for the role his bearing is like that of royalty and he fits well for the character's character. Anne is very good in her acting I like the scene where she & Goergie were bonding before they were attacked by Maugrim. Skandar really showed how Edmund was such a nuisance, I like the part were he & Aslan were talking privately. All in all You need to watch the movie! Thanks a lot for the space you provided for me. I really love this film. I can watch it a million times over and I'm looking forward to watch all the other books to be made into film. A Salute to Dir. Adamson & crew!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charm of the novel lost in a wash of special effects,"The 2005 version of this classic children's novel is a very competently made film. It for the most part seamlessly blends special effects, CGI, and live action together. The acting is competent. It follows the book with few exceptions. Why only a 5 star rating? It takes itself way too seriously. C.S. lewis' novels were so enchanting because it was all about tone first with story a close second. In the film, while the plot is followed, the charm was lost. The characters were stiff and serious. I did not feel the excitement of children exploring a new world. I did not feel reverence and awe in the presence of Aslan. What I remember mostly from the film was the last battle which was extended and shown in great detail. In the book, the battle is given only a couple of paragraphs. But since this is Hollywood, they felt the need to extend it and ramp up the violence. In many ways, I felt I was watching an action film for adults marketed to children. The only scenes that came close to enchantment were with the beavers. But that didn't help the serious tone of the film to lighten up. This is one of those films where less would have been more, slower have been more exciting, and character more entrancing than action. What surprised me the most was how the fabulous Tilda Swinton came off so unconvincing as the White Witch! I still have yet to see that character portrayed convincingly.Basic advice, if you want a ""good looking"" film with action and special effects, then you will like this film version of the novel. But if you are willing to forgo the superficial pleasures and enjoy the tone of the novel (the most distinguishing aspect of the Lewis' book), then check out the 1988 BBC television version. It production value is very crude by today's standards, but it captures the magic of the book better and lets the story unfold naturally.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie with amazing spirit!,"In short, this movie was excellent.The actors were fabulous, most of them being rather newish. The cinematography was beautiful, and the CGI was very believable. It's a great family movie, but appeals to all age ranges. There is just some spirit that Andrew Adamson put into the film that makes it great. This movie will be one of the classics, in my opinion. Here's a plus : If you are between the ages of 10 and 19, there is some pretty good crushes in store for you....mine personally is Skandar!I advise you to get the extended DVD just for more great viewing experiences! The only problem is the waiting time between the next installment!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely stunning,"I grew up reading the Narnia books since second grade. I've remembered my teachers reading to me ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" I'll have to admit, that book was pretty darn good, and I ended up reading most from the series except for book 1. Now this movie came along for the winter, probably the nicest treat a child can get.Narnia was simply a classical tale full of knights, magic, and animals. Hell, it was almost ALMOST like the kid's version of Lord of the Rings. (I mean, the two authors were good friends) This movie had everything coming as expected, unlike how other movies are these days. I don't understand, all the kid's flick these days include some of the most awful films ever. Now here was a classic tale that a kid would enjoy, despite his age and size.I was actually amazed at how much I underrated this film. The actors and actresses all pounded their roles, but I have to admit, Tilda Swanton as the White Witch stole it all. She was amazing as the White Witch. Changing faces from that kind, generous queen to that cruel, arrogant witch made me realize how much of a powerful actress she was. Maybe it was all that makeup she probably had, but the White Witch clearly depicted the villain I had expected her to be. Liam Neeson's powerful voice also matched that of how I would imagine Aslan would be. The clear beauty of the landscape and the epic battle that takes place in a wide terrain made Narnia ever so beautiful and bold. The simple children's story that I held and read came vividly and alive. The special effects had it all, as well.I have to admit, Narnia was one of the best kid's movie I have seen in years. Convincing performances, stylish landscapes, and the beautiful dialogue made this film the most classical experience I have ever felt.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasantly surprising.,"My initial reaction when I first heard that the director of the Shrek films would be directing/writing ""The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe"" was, ""What?! That won't work!"" I am not an avid book fan that curses at the screen at every add-in or change. I find the Chronicles a bit dry & hurried, but my expectations of the transfer from book to movie rose. Until I heard the director's name. However, despite my recurring fears that in it's stead, a horrid mutant of the the original story would appear, the rumors that I began to hear shortly after the film's release were all favorable. I started to think that perhaps this adaptation of the novels would be better than BBC's whole-hearted, but cheap, attempt at the series many years ago. So, I accompanied my family to the theater, & was sucked into Narnia instantly. The scenery was amazing; the children looked exactly how my mind had imagined them when it received absolutely no prompt from the book. The acting was believable; all the missing components of the book were, amazingly, in the movie. We own the special-edition DVD & watch it over & over, highly anticipating the release of ""Prince Caspian."" Andrew Adamson pleasantly surprised me, bringing a quality family film to the screen, & leaving me begging for more.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Film not as good as the trailer.,"I have waited the better part of 6 months for.....this. I do want to see all of the books of the series come to the screen. This director, if he can be called that must be banned from doing further harm. The film simply doesn't work. Changes were made that were not needed, parts of the story were cut for the flop of a battle scene at the end. Which by the way was known as the battle of Beruna, though you won't find that out in this film. The Characters were not developed properly, the pace was rushed way too fast. If you had not read the book, I doubt you would have clue one as to what you were watching. Nothing is adequately explained. Nothing is shown with any real sense or purpose. Some parts were quite moving. The scenery and special effects are stunning. But not enough to carry the story. The portrayal of Aslan was indeed powerful. Liam Nielsn did a B+ performance, but I prefer the depth of emotion and deep base resonance that David Suchet gave in the Focus on the Family Radio theater production. It is not a total loss. The 10 minute clip shown on Stars is far better and much more majestically scored than the final full length production.It is not the spectacular epic that I was hoping for either. The buck stops with the director, he is responsible in the end. I sincerely hope that this is the end of his association with The Chronicles of Narnia. Let the epic series continue under fresh leadership. As far as comparison to the Lord of the Rings series and Harry Potter? Potter is just a waste of good film and I will give it no further discussion. Where Narnia is fast, the Lord of the Rings just plods along like an aged boxer who has no punch left and no good sense to quit. They are way too slow paced, very dark and depressing and much too long. I really felt that the entire story could have been told in one or at most two well edited faster paced films. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe could have easily had ten to fifteen minutes of good character development added and a better film would have been the result. Great special effects and a strong musical score may build a nice box office but the story is what makes it a classic, most of that unfortunately; was left behind on the cutting room floor.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome Movie.,"This is the best version of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" I have ever seen. The cast is great; the special effects are amazing, and the scenery is beautiful. It's no wonder that Andrew Adamson did a very good job of directing the movie since he did Shrek and Shrek 2. The other versions of this story are not as good. Peter was my favorite character. He reminded me of Harry Potter because of his courage and Ron Weasley because of his sense of humor. They probably shouldn't have made Susan a little stuck up because she wasn't like the that in the books. In the last book, they say she stops believing in Narnia. They made that to obvious. The girl who played Lucy did a great job, and the boy who played Edmund portrayed his character very well. The BBC version wasn't good because it had poor special effects and scenery. The animated movie was all right, but it wasn't really exciting.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Near perfect film for children, but really great for all ages!!!","When I rented this movie I had already heard so much about the movie and was skeptical as I generally don't end up enjoying movies with to much hype.Also I had missed the movie in the theaters and was really excited when i got this DVD almost the next day after it released.This movie will be one of the rare movies where you expect the world and end up getting it. Everything about the movie is great and save for a one or 2 I cannot see any flaws in it.The acting is excellent and I'm not to sure whether the plastic expressions of Edmund were intentional or because he is a bad actor but the fit perfectly with the mood he should have been throughout the film.The setting of the film is in fantasy and even though some scenes reek of LOTR and New Zealand the fantasy world of Narnia has been masterfully created.A special winner is the background score of the film which was brilliant and was further enhanced with some great mixing on the home-theater enhanced sound on the DVD.The old fashioned values that are taught in this film (sacrifice, family bonding, hope) are endearing to people of all ages and are far better than the stupid cartoons that are being dished out today(spongebob , squarepants ).The only thing that annoyed me was the quality of the action towards the end of the film which could have been much better considering the pg-13 certificate (i can never understand why they freak out in fight scenes when whats really disturbs the children are the sexual themes in movies even with pg-13, i mean we watched cartoons where people fought and killed every time and were no homicidal maniacs).Save for that this film is a perfect family potboiler with loads of hope, scary scenes, funny scenes , inspiring scenes etc etc etc.A must watch for all ages and a far better film for children then say a Harry Potter.You have to watch this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch It.,"The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a story about four children and their adventure to save a mythical world called Narnia. This world is accessible by a magic wardrobe in their guardian's mansion. The youngest of the four children named Lucy wanders into the wardrobe while playing a game with her other siblings. In order to not be found she scampers into a nearby empty room with a wardrobe in it. She climbs in and realizes that she is pushing on a tree and then immediately after she falls into snow. She, who has never been in a place like that, was in pure awe. The starts right after she discovers this magnificent world.In my opinion the story was good. Also the story was very exciting at a lot of points during the story. I think that the book and the movie were quite similar. In the movie the dialogue seemed more up to date and it showed more things that would make you understand. The movie, on the downside left out some minor situations that the book did not. I'm not a big reader so I thought the movie better suited me, but if you're a big reader the book would be a better choice. There is more in the book apposed to the movie, also in the book things are better explained. I thought altogether that the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was an all around good book and movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, warm, lovely movie bringing back the child in you","Based on reviews I read in advance, didn't expect much from this movie at all. In fact, I was expecting to sleep through part of the movie. But boy, was I wrong! There are these kind of movies, where after the first few shots you know you are going to love the rest of it. This was precisely the case. The parting of children from their mother in London was shot just beautiful, full of rich emotion, yet steering clear of being pathetic.This remains the case for the rest of the film. Were it set into different background, I would probably sneeze at it, calling it pathetic and emotionally overcharged. But in conjunction with the beautiful tender story of small children living out their fantasies, it just all seems to work.Performances by the child actors are very satisfactory with some and exceptional with others. While I didn't like both of the boy's acting as much, I found the young girls brilliant. Lucy in particular, being the youngest child, is basically driving the whole atmosphere of the movie and should have been maybe given even bigger space.Overall, the movie left a very warm and cosy feeling in me, it made me sit at the edge of the seat and feel like a small child again. Very, very recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Made me feel like a child again,"Growing up, my favorite films tended to involve ordinary people thrust into unordinary situations. Part of the fun was the hope that someday, somehow I would become one of those people and explore places that were deemed impossible to exist. As I got older and became an adult, I accepted the harsh realities of the real world and that I would never end up like the heroes that I cheered on screen. The innocence and the warm feelings of my youth became extinct.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe brought those feelings back, if just for the two and a half hours of the film's running time. This is the best fantasy film released since 1984's The Neverending Story. Any relation to the real world and the logic we have all become accustomed to should be discarded upon viewing, because that's not what the film is about. The audience is in the shoes of the four main heroes of the film as they explore and discover all the wonders of this new world and its strange mysteries for themselves.The story is often hailed as a representation of the Christian belief and is well-acclaimed by its followers. However, there is no reason for Atheists to discard this film, by any means. It is not a retelling or adaptation of the story of the life of Jesus Christ. It merely makes references and borrows ideas from the bible to help develop their own characters. And it all works. By the time the film ends, the audience will care deeply for the heroes and cheer for them all the way through the many exciting turns and situations they encounter.Terrific film. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
unconvincing and badly acted,"Loved the books, I have to say. But this film, right from the beginning, fails to convince. It's impossible to be carried along with it; everything is too unlikely and the child actors are, unfortunately, terrible. The director lets them down horribly - it should at least be possible to relate to their characters, but they are allowed to behave in the most preposterous ways. Only the most credulous would be able to settle down and watch this film. The rest of us, after 5 minutes, are wishing we're somewhere else.That just about says all you need to know.The rest of this review is padding to make up the requisite ten lines - I suggest you read no further.There is no god.

"Absolutely fantastic - In my opinion, better than the books...","I have seen this film more times than I can count, and haven't once gotten bored of it! What impresses me every time is the perfection of the child cast - they are fantastic young actors and actresses, and I particularly enjoy Skandar Keynes' performance as Edmund. In fact, pretty much everything in this production is close to perfection - the sets, the costumes, the script - everything comes together to make a beautiful film. The continued brilliance of this film is that it is perfect for all the family - you will never be too old to enter the magic of Narnia... I did read the books as a child, and although they were fantastic, I feel that I just 'clicked' more with the film adaption of this timeless tale, perhaps because of the more 'epic' feel to it when C S Lewis' beautiful story is up on the big screen. I do also feel that the film narrative is quite close to the book - always a positive thing!Don't miss this incredible film - it will be a very valuable asset to your film collection!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The infamous story is well-known,"Excellent unremarkable costumes, special effects, and the story-line itself. A classic. I am so disappointed to see it fall behind Harry Potter. Not that Harry Potter isn't a great series as well but this movie was breathtaking. The acting and history of these stories should make this movie #1 for 2005. It is in so many Narnia fans opinions. I was so pleased and interested to see these characters come to life, I hope that the story will continue in the movie's but with these ratings it looks as though the public was not pleased? May I ask why? This is an excellent piece, highly-recommended!This story of Lucy the girl and her siblings (one older sister ) and her brother Peter escape reality into the mysterious wardrobe to find another world. Perfectly magic contents reveal another land-Narnia. The Chronicles of Narnia correlate so well with the most well written delightful books. The child Lucy, ventures off into the land to discover evils as well as friends. She comes back into the human world to discover that Narnia stops the time clock.She recruits her siblings...and you need to see for the exciting rest of mythology come to life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"« Welcome to Duloch, such a perfect place »","« Welcome to Duloch, such a perfect place » : sugarcoated, soulless, lifeless, artificial, phony, kitsch and without imagination. Interesting irony: the director of ""Shrek"" doing this. I guess he felt he needed to apologize from too much subversive thinking.The huge success of this so-called « movie » tells a lot about our society and the way people want to « dream » nowadays. It's frightening. It's been a long time since I have attended something so lifeless, watered-down, sugary, tame, devoid of any genuine emotion, entirely virtual and fabricated. In comparison, the blockbusters that it tries to emulate (the LOTR and Harry Potter movies) look like timeless masterpieces, and this is coming from someone who'd rather eat a cactus than attend a LOTR movie ever again, as bombast and overkill tend to make me feel nauseous. As for the HP movies, I only celebrated the third one as a « real » movie, thanks to the extremely talented Alfonso Cuaron. To each his own, for my part I'm still in love with Scott's « Legend » (the export version, with Goldsmith's score, not the awful USA cut / Tangerine dream one) as nothing has ever come close to it in terms of painting a fantasy/magical world on the screen. Yes, it's mushy, but it works. Scott was a genius, at this time, at pulling off coherent, alive, breathing, working cinematic worlds (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend).Here, everything you look at is artless and lifeless, just petty/pretty, sugarcoated pinch-beck images, a « 3-D Barbie fantasy show » as a friend of mine called this, CGI prowess presented as great achievements while being just pseudo-realistic digital dolls on a stage (it kinda looks like the real thing until you try to smell it and discover it has no smell whatsoever, or any taste for that matter) while all sense of depth, substance, emotion, soul, magic, is meticulously wiped off. The whole thing looks like a phony plastic Xmas tree. Pretty to look at, but anyone used to a real tree can only be very disappointed, and feel sad that the magic is gone.As usual, Tilda is absolutely jaw-dropping. A Queen she is indeed, not only in the story but in the movie team as well. Looks like she was the only artistically competent (grown-up) person in this team. Why such a fantastic actress isn't hired for A-works (artistically speaking) is beyond me.If you like real fantasy, look somewhere else. If you insist on having some family sugar-coated evening, even the Sound of Music and Mary Poppins are leagues ahead this soulless digital fest. Watch these again instead. Want the real thing ?

A Good Yarn,"Although not in the same league with the already legendary Lord of the Rings pictures, director Andrew Adamson (of Shrek heritage) has brought C.S. Lewis' ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" to the silver-screen with unusual humanity and style. In a courageous attempt to capitalize on recent trends of audience infatuation with the fantasy genre Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures brought us an expensive yet delightful holiday treat in the form of ""The Lion with Witch and the Wardrobe"".A great many things about Adamson's adaptation of the Lewis books are very impressive. Interestingly though I did not feel startled by the quality of special effects. Perhaps LOTR/ WETA have ruined my view of effects for several years to come. But despite lacking a great many new thrills in the technology department Adamson has other tricks up his sleeve. I was especially impressed with the performances of the film's most integral parts, the Pevensie children. Despite risks of being overwhelmed by the abundance of CG characters, landscapes, and the resulting scenes, the four young actors who took on the lead roles of Lewis' valiant children proved themselves by excelling in almost every category. Skandar Keynes did well in producing the necessary audience feelings of disdain and eventual embrace of his surly but lovable Edmund. Anna Popplewell seemed like an old hand compared to her co-stars and handled her screen-time with grace and poise that is enviable for many of today's stars. William Moseley did justice to the character but he failed to make a resounding statement with his performance (I would be surprised if he is successful in turning his Narnia time into a long-term career). However, the most remarkable scenes in Narnia are not produced by the grandeur of special effects but instead by a tiny little girl named Georgie Henley. In the history of the cinema directors have shown sick fascination with hinging their films on the performances of children. While most people remember the positive moments in the history of film and children e.g. ""Sixth Sense"", ""E.T."", ""Oliver!"" there have been a hundred times as many distinct failures (Brandon De Wilde's ""Shane"" is my personal favorite). And in other cases failure has not been outright and is instead replaced by mediocrity of child performers which has led to mediocrity of the film as well e.g. ""The Road to Perdition"". Although her performance is not what the film hinges upon for its overall effect it might as well have because 10 year-old Georgie Henley provides the deepest magic you find in Narnia. Henley completely pulled me into the story every instant in which she was the focus of a scene. Her on-screen communication does not even walk a fine line with overacting, it remains perfectly within the boundaries of subtlety and magnificently communicates the innocence and fiery spirit of her character. My favorite scenes of the film are played out between Henley's Lucy and James McAvoy's good-hearted faun Mr. Tumnus (McAvoy is particularly outstanding among the supporting players).Tilda Swinton's turn as the white witch was a primary reason for my interest in the film. However, I was relatively unimpressed with how her performance played out. Certainly Swinton did an admirable job but she lacked anything extra that truly made her stand out amidst the quagmire of CG characters. This role could have kept Swinton in mainstream villainous or powerful female parts for life but I am afraid she did not do enough with her screen time to justify any special attention. She will likely never become a contemporary of Cate Blanchett as she, and her promoters, may want her to be. Jim Broadbent's precious few moments of screen-time are everything any Broadbent fan would want them to be. He handles himself as always with unequivocal dignity and produces a fantastic sense of mystery as the ancient and secretive professor.The quality of voice acting is certainly good. Ray Winstone, Rupert Everett, Dawn French and many other talented individuals lent their professionalism to the project and they add to Narnia's mystical ambiance marvelously. Liam Neeson took on the difficult role of Aslan (Narnia's equivalent of the Messiah) and I am sad to report that he simply does not have the ability to voice a lion like James Earl Jones (Mufassa from Lion King). Neeson has proved himself time and again to be one of the great modern-day thespians but he just lacks the power Aslan needed (and could only be provided in my view by Jones).As a whole Narnia presents itself as a very good children's fantasy epic. However, Lewis' high focus on child content will leave Narnia out of any serious consideration for awards and status in the history of movie-making. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's will stand a test of time that Narnia cannot and will not. Still, Andrew Adamson's direction shows that he has the stuff to be a lasting directorial force in Hollywood (and with the success of the Shrek film's why not?). Not only does Adamson strut his technical stuff he also displays an uncanny understanding of what makes a movie humanistic and fantastic without exploiting or stretching an audience's collective imagination. He and his screen-writers cleverly expanded on Lewis' storyline (which lacked many necessary establishing factors) and did so without losing any of Lewis' charm or intent.Overall, it is a Good Yarn that is worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice adaptation of classic children's book.,"I like the film. I really do. The film blends drama, comedy, and adventure, very well, and the character development (especially for Edmund) is nice. I also the fight and adventure sequences. Because, yes, it's intense, but I like how they didn't add any blood or gore to keep this film clean, (it IS an adaptation of a children's book after all, so you gotta keep it at the PG rating!) and I like how the film focuses more on the adventure and journey, instead of the violence, like a lot of other adventure films. The acting is great, (especially since children are in this movie) and the cast is amazing. The CGI has also held up very well, and the story is nice, entertaining, well-developed, and lacks dragging, especially for its 143-minute runtime. Overall, this film is a nice, adventure story fit for the whole family, and a good movie to start with if you're looking to get into the action/adventure/fantasy genres.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comparisons comparisons,"The problem with this movie is that it ends up like little bits of pieces of scenes gathered from various similarly-themed movies. This movie ruined the beauty of C.S. Lewis delicately written imagery by resorting to a badly written book-to-movie script and ""seen that, what else is new?"" special effects.So basically, that is what really disappointed me when watching the film. It's amazing that FINALLY they bought the book to life... And yet only to watch it go down the toilet drain. Aslan (Liam Neeson) was a great asset to the film, but somehow along the middle it seemed like I was watching a Sesame Street movie.The movie is a mess, it failed to capture the real series. What a disappointed. Watch it if you're a fan of the book but be prepared for the havoc that awaits.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing job!,"I think that the entire story was very creative and imaginative. I loved it all! The actors did a fantastic job on playing their roles as they also did in the following movies. I do wish that they would have made more movies though, perhaps a series with younger characters to fill in the roles of the four children since they are much older now. I've seen all three movies about a dozen times and I would definitely give them a ten out of ten for excellent work and and amazing job on the scenery! I know that these movies were over 5 years ago and I'm just now writing this review, but to those who haven't seen it yet should definitely watch it especially if you're into fantasy, family, and adventure movies!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good Movie. (period/full stop) Not Harry Potter. (period/full stop) No comparisons, please.","I beg to differ with Ms. Catherine Jones but this is not a ""better movie than Harry Potter"" - it is a DIFFERENT movie than Harry Potter. (It's also different than LOTR but there are some similarities.) Obviously, as the 6th or 7th sequel to Narnia comes out the lines will be less firmly drawn but this is simply a different movie about a different book. All three (HP, Narnia, and LOTR) are adaptations of VERY popular book series and, as such, must remain as faithful as possible to the original story to retain fans of the books. But they are distinctly different movies (books) which happen to touch on overlapping themes at times.I have read all of the HP books at least once and the same for LOTR. This is not true about Narnia. However, I have read other C.S. Lewis and, perhaps most importantly, a primordial version of Narnia (not called that but many of the ideas came from there) which Clive wrote with his brother when he was 8 or 9 years old. What IS similar about the three authors, and hence the three movies to some extent, is the ability to build a fantasy world peopled with very real characters who exhibit some very real human traits and situations (in spite of the fact of their fantastic or non-human form).I would not/did not/could not judge this movie in comparison to HP or LOTR because I would have to find it lacking. I would recommend judging it on it's own merits. It is a good move. The series may some day become a great series. But Peter Jackson's LOTR was a feat like none other and stands on it's own. The same is true of the HP series but in a different vein - this is a collection of film adaptations made by a number of different directors yet hearkens to and keeps us connected to the series of books which is still evolving within our lifetime - there is a connectedness between the evolution of the books, the characters, and the films that has it's own appeal - not unlike the serializations of Charles Dickens or Arthur Conan Doyle. But enough of those other series - I said that I dost not compare this movie to they.This first of the Narnia stories was a good movie. By comparison to all lesser movies (common Hollywood drek) it may even be a very, very good movie. But comparing it to HP or LOTR can only reduce it's appeal.The CG was a little less perfect than it could have been. The child actors were outstanding and the adults did not get in the way. (I do think that I will go back and watch some of Ms. Swindon's earlier films such as ""Female Perversions"" ...)I do recommend it and, especially for the holidays, it is an excellent family movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yawn,"Yeah i just came out of the theater after watching this one and i had to get on here to warn people. Unless you're 10 years old or younger, avoid this movie and save your money. This movie can be best described as a made for TV movie with a bigger budget. Or perhaps it could be seen as a watered down kid's version of Lord of the Rings.The first 3/4 of the movie was a total yawn. Character development is non existent as we are not given any insight about the personalities of the children at all, all we know is that they're children running away from the Nazis. Furthermore, what we do realize about these children are that they are quite the little runts. With exception to the the youngest child, Lucy, the rest are a bunch of malcontent, annoying, complaining, unworthy rodents. Edmond in particular is an obvious pain and i would not be misty eyed at all to see this little brat's existence come to thankful end. The older sister is annoying as well and there are several times during the movie where she was so annoying that you wished you could reach into the movie screen to ring her neck. I was not made to feel any sympathy for these two. The oldest boy, Peter was a bit easier to tolerate however still not worth a care. How could the viewer enjoy this movie if they didn't care for the main character's well beings? A very good question...The story is seriously flawed and also share painful parallels to the triumphant Lord of the Rings movies. For example the death of their leader, who later is resurrected by questionable, and head scratching means. The big battle that seemed to be lost, suddenly saved by a last minute addition of troops. A character that does not wish to take their role as leader but afterwards taking up his sword and marching into battle... Please give me some credit... please give viewers credit... we are not morons, don't treat us like we are.The inhabitants in Narnia also do no make much sense as they do not seem to be able to follow footprints. The White Witch (aka female Saruman) is all powerful, able to freeze anyone with a motion of her staff however fails to be able to dispose of a child who just picked up a sword 2 days ago for the first time. She forgets about all her powers and tries to swat him with swords. Which brings me to another point... how could children who were given weapons by Santa Claus and have had not previous training be able to battle in a war, be better able to lead an army into battle better then any soldier already in the army? Overall this movie was a real disappointment and falls short on many many levels.4 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of my favourite movies of all time from one of my favourite books of all time,"I will start off by saying that, while this is a very good movie, I do think that the next two are unfairly criticized for not following the source material as this one did. Now, I haven't seen ""Dawn Treader"" yet, but I should remind people that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" is, in my opinion, the most famous Narnia tale of all the Narnia movies. For this reason, I think that the people behind the scenes had a bit more freedom with the second and third movies, while this one, they had to have it really close to the book in order for it to work the way it did. Don't get me wrong; it is good to follow the books. I'm just saying that ""Prince Caspian"" and ""Dawn Treader"" are not as famous as TLTWATW.Now, onto this movie.I'm really surprised that this only got a 6.9. This deserves a way higher rating. I won't go into too much details about the story, but for those who don't know, it's basically about 4 children who end up stumbling into a magical land via wardrobe, and find out about a prophecy that includes them in a huge way.I can't emphasize how much I love this movie. I'm 18 years old, and as a Christian person, I instantly fell in love with this back when it came out in theatres. I wasn't worried about whether or not it would follow the book, and I'm glad I wasn't worried. This film delivers.You could say that the special effects are amazing, but what really steals the show are the performances. Let's start out with the stars of the film: the four Pevensies. William Mosely definitely is the weakest, and is really the only reason why I gave it a 9 out of 10, but he is good. Anna Popplewell has that motherly look that you feel when she is on screen, which makes her perfect for Susan. Skandar Keynes is great as the mean little brat known as Edmund, who learns a ""little"" lesson as the film goes on. But, Georgie Henley is the star that shines the most. It is through her character that we see Narnia first, and when she's on screen, she gives the child-like energy to her performance that is needed for the character of Lucy.Now, it's not all new faces here. The first movie star that we see is James McAvoy as the faun Tumnus, and he gives off a performance that will make children love Mr. Tumnus just as much as he seems to love them (as seen in his interaction with Lucy). Tilda Swinton gets the most screen time out of the heavyweights here, and she is chilling (no pun intended) in her performance as the White Witch. Fans of the Shrek series will recognize Rupert Everett's (aka Prince Charming) voice as the fox who appears throughout the movie. But, the most recognizable actor here is the voice of Liam Neeson as Aslan. I could listen to that man read a telephone book with that voice. He is among Morgan Freeman and James Earl Jones as to having a soothing voice, and he proves it with his performance of Aslan.Overall, this is a film that should not be missed; it will please you whether you are old or young. The special effects are completely first class, the story is gripping and stays true to the book, and the actors all do their jobs well. A 9/10 for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie I have ever seen,"I so love this move! and what a masterpiece it is. The wonderful story of Narnia from the books are retold in a way the the books comes alive.

Missing the magic,"I was rather underwhelmed by my experience of seeing Narnia for a few reasons. Some of the main problems arise from miscasting of the characters:Mr Tumnus: he somehow manages to come across looking like some guy you would meet at a fancy-dress party, or in a bar, albeit in an excessively elaborate costume.Jadis: this character is the most important of the movie and should have been played by a stunningly beautiful actress with a much more powerful screen presence, both in terms of her compelling and admirable (yes) intellect, and her sheer size. She is described in 'The Magician's Nephew' as one of the most beautiful women in the entire world. Tilda Swinton simply has no appeal, and comes across rather meek and albino/alien-esquire. As a result, it is very difficult to conceive the magnetic attraction that Edmund was supposed to have had to the White Witch. Andrew Adamson has said that he wanted to avoid the usual cliché of the ""evil stepmother and the cackling witch"" that has been seen too many times over the years. He said he wanted to ""create a more sophisticated type of evil"". While the usual stereotype has been avoided (which is good), its replacement fails to arouse much emotion at all. She could point her wand at me any day and I wouldn't bat an eyelid.The children: Peter's actor seems the least likable. His strong leadership from the book comes across as joyless sanctimoniousness and is off-putting. Susan seems to suffer the worst from the CGI, especially scenes involving wind which doesn't seem to move hair very much. The actress playing Lucy tries desperately to be cute and show wonderment at the unbelievable world around her. Any scenes involving extreme emotion (for example, crying) were the most disappointing. Edmund was actually pretty good.The beavers, and Aslan: The voices, provided by celebrities, did not blend into their scenes. They were simply too loud and too clear. The beavers were the best part of the movie and their lines were met with approving murmurs from the audience around me. Liam Neeson's Irish accent, while slightly modified, seemed odd.Regarding the rest of the movie, I just have a few remarks: The most crucial part of the plot from the book that is left out is the fact that the Turkish Delight given to Edmund is in fact enchanted! The book says ""anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they had killed themselves."" There are many instances in the movie where either critical information required for the story (such as above), or descriptive narrative, is left out, and the movie loses a huge amount of texture as a result. My solution would have been to include a narrator, making sure that they did not speak in a patronizingly slow manner. Father Christmas is depicted in the movie without his usual, hackneyed red outfit. I considered this to be rather refreshing. However, what Susan says a few scenes later doesn't really fit in as a result - ""just because some fellow in a red coat gives you a sword doesn't make you a hero"". I noticed that while leopards are featured in the book, the rosetted felines starring in the movie appeared to have cheetah heads, with prominent black 'tear' marks that leopards do not have. The bodies were clearly those of leopards. CS Lewis wrote in a letter: ""Anthropomorphic animals, when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare -- at least with photography."" This unfortunately rang true. I found myself many times thinking how clever the WETA graphics team was, and other times thinking that more work should have been put into the project. My objection to this is that I really don't think I should have been thinking about the WETA team at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Dude, Watch This!!!","In the movie adaptation of C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, four siblings are sent to an old country estate to escape the World War Two London bombings. One rainy afternoon, during a game of hide and seek, the youngest child, Lucy, discovers a wardrobe in the spare room and uses it as a hiding place. While hiding in the wardrobe, Lucy stumbles upon a magical land called Narnia, where she meets a Faun called Tumnus. When the false ruler of Narnia, the White Witch, finds out about Tumnus' meeting with Lucy, she takes him prisoner in her castle. Lucy returns to Narnia with her sister and two brothers and they find themselves racing against time to save Mr. Tumnus and free Narnia from the tyranny of the White Witch.Having read the book and watched the movie, I can say that the movie definitely elaborated more on the battle scenes, which was fantastic because they were somewhat hard to follow and grasp in the book. I also liked that the rivalry between Peter and Edmund was played up a little more in the movie than it was in the book. It helped you get into Edmund's head and really understand why he felt so unappreciated. I think this movie really stuck to the main plot of the book, and, even though it missed a few parts that helped the audience understand the White Witch and some of her motives, I definitely recommend that people read this book and watch the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Her words were ice cold and when she yelled at Edmund for not being able to bring his family there, it shocked me. Not to mention, the props were stunning!

A real Turkish and worldwide delight.,I've been reading the book to my school kids ( third fourth and fifth graders) for 30 years and they have all loved the book. One of my kids told his parents about the book and his dad brought back some Turkish delight for us when he went to England. I enjoy the BBC version of the movie because it is so faithful to the book. I wasn't sure I would like this movie version because I knew it added and subtracted from the book. It was so well done and brought the characters so vividly to life that I really enjoyed it anyway. The message of the book stayed intact and that was what really mattered. The only thing that disappointed me a bit was the voice of Aslan. I expected a voice like James Earl Jones - very deep and commanding. I wish they would make an IMAX version.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprised how much I liked this,"I originally saw this in the cinema and I felt a bit let down by it. However I watched it again recently on DVD after having seen (and loved) The Dawn Treader. Watching on DVD at home I really loved it! The things that i disliked about the cinema release seemed to have changed... possibly they fixed a few things for home release? The battle scene seemed much longer and not as tame this time (a good thing!) and Aslan seemed bigger than I recall from the cinema. Few movies ever do the books justice, and C.S. Lewis's writing could never be matched, but this movie does do a very good job in bringing it to life. A great film that's quite moving and beautiful at times.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shocking - an old book actually made into a movie,"I have to say that I hate most new movies. They rip off the title of an old book, throw the rest of the book away and then make some politically-correct garbage claiming it to be the same story that has little if anything to do with what the book said. Here, a Hollywood director actually made a movie that IS the old book. He didn't even remove the Christian parallels that the original writer intended nor did he change the main characters to be something more politically-correct - I am still trying to get over the shock of seeing a novel properly made into a movie. A very good movie well done. I will be looking forward to the rest of the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The way to Narnia becomes simple,"My husband and I have loved C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories since we were children. Shortly after we became engaged, he took me to Wheaton College so that I could see the Wardrobe. I had to suppress my joy, but when when I got to open it, the path to Narnia was blocked.After more years than I care to admit, I finally managed to find my way to that a place more comforting than Oz or Wonderland by watching this film. I screamed at Edmund when he placed his trust in the evil Snow Queen because she made him Turkish Delight (something I've never liked, but I tolerate those who do). I was proud of Peter, Susan and Lucy as they braved things that I would have never been able to do by myself.And, then, there's Aslan. He was the giant symbol of great heart, power and love that lions are often equated with. His joy in life and the deep magic which protects everyone alive lies in every movement and that beautiful voice (Liam Neeeson). I'd seen many of the other mythic creatures before with Harry Potter, but here, even these wanting no contact with humans all became heroes fighting for what they believed in, including four children from another place and time.Lewis'series reflects the horror that England went through during World War II and the trouble it endured afterward. It's also true that they contain more than the usual amount of Christian symbolism something that some people of other religions might not care for. No matter that, because the beauty and love the movie creates can be felt by any person of every background. It is one of those things that can unify people from all over the world.When I am full of doubt that the Universe will turn out right, I pull out my copy, watch it, and my doubt starts to go away. You might like to do that, too.If you would like to read more books written by this Oxford Don, you might like _The Screwtape Letters_ and _A Grief Observed_ too.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Chronicles of Narnia: The music was good!,"I have no idea what made this movie as big as it is today!? The director had every hand out to him. The story was there already, and these kinds of movies are a big hit right now. But how in the world could he make a movie like that, and why was it shown in cinemas? It would been perfect to show this movie at the HALLMARK CHANNEL over the Christmas, I've would have turned on the Television and not expected a well done movie, but a movie filled with computer animated effects that didn't really look real, but fun! Instead I had to dress up, go out and sit beside a stranger, staring angry at the screen trying and wanting to join the stranger playing with his popcorn! In one scene, where the little girl Lucy, (Georgie Henley) saw here friend turned into stone, she just stood there smiling, but then start's sounding like she's crying and I got confused! We also had these ""Peter Jackson, over the hill, camera flying move"" but we had it to many times, four times if I remember it right! They should had hired a good makeup artist instead of a bed costume designer! But the music was fantastic; you could hear that the director knew that the music was the only good thing as he tuned it up a lot! IF you haven't seen this movie, then don't!

Deep Magic!,"While the dark recesses of many wardrobes are a mystery containing untold treasures and/or horrors, there is a particular wardrobe in a spare room that leads to the magical land of Narnia. A land where the White Witch (evil) has reigned for 100 years, but Aslan the Lion (good) is on the move. This is such a vast and beautiful world that an epic clash between good and evil is inevitable.Set during World War II, the four Pevensie children are sent away from blitz-bombed London to the safety of Professor Kirke's country mansion. Peter and Susan are the elder children and stoically sensible and responsible. The youngest child, Lucy, is sunny and engaging. It is Edmund, desperately missing his father and smarting against the assumed authority of his older siblings, who has some hard lessons to learn about temptation and treachery.Isolated and bored in the sprawling house, the children resort to playing hide and seek. Lucy hides in a wardrobe and stumbles into Narnia, a land frozen in the grip of winter and the evil Witch. This seemingly random event begins the fulfillment of a prophecy of biblical proportions. And the biblical themes that run through these Chronicles are undeniable.The essence of Narnia is Deep Magic. Mythical creatures such as unicorns and griffins, mermaids and centaurs and even Santa Claus mingle with more modest birds, beavers, badgers and wolves. All these animals can talk and even the trees are listening. So who can be trusted? Definitely not the White Witch, with her guilty gifts of Turkish Delight. She is the epitome of evil, breathtakingly icy and chillingly ruthless. As for her followers, fortunately it does seem to be true that evil disfigures and deforms as they are the foulest collection of genetic mishaps we have ever seen.On the other hand, Aslan the Lion is molten gold goodness, with a lion's courage and a true heart. His voice resonates with warmth and it can only be summer in his presence. His followers are a host of the most dazzling beings in Narnia, as well as a myriad of sharp-witted forest animals.The Chronicles of Narnia incorporate CGI at its most seamless. Though for all the awesome scale, its beauty is in the details. Only four of the heroes are human and it is set in a vast, magical land, but this fantasy is warmly familiar. Following his first meeting with Lucy, Mr Tumnus the Faun says that she ""made me feel warmer than I've felt in 100 years"". This is how we felt about our first trip to Narnia and we can't wait to return.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beatiful, magical and mystical.","Having stumbled across this movie relatively later in its life, its undiluted magic still enraptured me as much as it would have done in 2005. The young cast was impressive alongside convincing talking creatures, namely Aslan and the beavers, with a truly mystical backdrop of Narnia, capturing the magic of the scene more effectively than many other titles since, despite improved special effects. The slightly darker nature of this film paired with a wondrous childhood tone, made it a truly consuming two and a half hours. The ending was particularly effective, mirroring the audience's loss of the mysticism of Narnia as they are brought back into the present whilst consoled by the hope of returning to this land. Having said this, most of the humour sprinkled in this title fell flat, seemingly conflicting with the vision of a slightly darker Narnia than conveyed in the books. The strained relationship between Peter and Edmund at times felt too forced, with the only aim to precipitate Edmund's betrayal of his siblings which obviously propelled the narrative forward. Overall, whilst slightly rough around the edges, a beautiful film for all.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
