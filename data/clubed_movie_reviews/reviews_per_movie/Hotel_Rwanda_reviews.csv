This year's Schindler's List,"I was fortunate to see it at the Toronto International Film Festival.Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle and was directed by Terry George. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. When the war broke out he thought of only saving his immediate family but as he saw what was happening he opened the hotel to Tutsi and Hutus seeking refuge from the killing. He used all the favours he had stored as manager of the hotel and basically saved over a thousand lives. This will be the next Schindler's list. When the film was over, there was a standing ovation. Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra-ordinary things. Paul Rusesabagina and his family attended the screening and he received a five minute standing ovation. Even Michael Moore came to see this movie. I highly recommend it. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A brilliant movie that deserved a Best Picture Oscar-nomination,"At one point in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, ""Hotel Rwanda"" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since ""Schindler's List"" (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives ""Hotel Rwanda"" a sense of urgency.As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There's brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment's made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn't a false note in his performance. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He's one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren't all that memorable. Here, he's in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul's frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That's why the moment's shattering.""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't flawless. George doesn't harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film's end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film's straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we're doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq's supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.I can only hope the success of ""Hotel Rwanda"" will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Extraordinary film based correctly on real deeds about the brutal genocide,"1994 Rwanda,Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu happily married (Sophie Okonedo) and with children .He's a Hotel manager -Millie Collines proprietary of Belgian Airlines : Sabena- and its General Director(Jean Reno) placed in Belgium. Paul is respected for his generosity , charm , friendship and numerous contacts with important people. He's accidentally trapped in violent events when his family and neighbours are threatened to be killed . He gets avoid it by means of bribes with the hope that United Nations (UN) and international forces arrive to preventing the civil war. However the happenings break out again . After assassination President of Rwanda, all get worse. It begins the horrible genocide including rampage , massacres and ravage in Rwanda which is spread along Burundi. Slaughter of Tusis by the Hutu is executed by soldiers and rebels. A journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) get into tumult and will shoot the events to show it all around the world. Paul gets to protect his family and unfortunate refugees at the hotel but others hapless people by the hundred are coming to ask for help. Meanwhile, the refugees Tutsis flee toward Congo to find shelter .The film has an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations (exception for Colonel incarnated by Nick Nolte) and international community and specially , the abandon of the European foreign policy .An interesting and thought-provoking film depicting terrible happenings and based on historical facts . Thus, a character tells that origin conflict is due to Belgians whom in colonization time differentiated the Tutsi as highest and more white complexion and co-governed united the country, now the Hutu are taking the vengeance. It's calculated in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by militia Interhamwe approximately one million people and in only three month. The bloody conflict finished in 1994 when the Tutsi throw out the Hutu army and militia through the frontier Congo. Leader of Interhamwe was condemned to maxim penalty. Don Cheadle's interpretation is magnificent , he was nominated to Academy Award , although wrongly didn't obtain it . The motion picture well directed by Terry George. Rating : Awesome and above average . Indispensable and essential watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Shaming and compelling,"Anything I say in this review is probably redundant, because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here, and I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.Nevertheless Hotel Rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. The scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.It's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story, from the artistry of the product, and often I get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at Oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded, whether or not they make good films. However, I can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since I saw The Grey Zone, and I hope Hotel Rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An absolute must see,"The only comment I can give about this movie is - SEE IT. It's one of the most heart wrenching, yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. I really hope Don Cheadle and the movie receive Oscars! The acting is superb and the fact this is based upon a true story only makes it better. You may need some Kleenex as I was overwhelmed for a large part of this movie.I had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening with the real ""Paul"" and his wife attending - what an absolute amazing experience to be in their presence. This movie will make you rethink everything about what it means to be human and how much we need to think about all our neighbours in this world.Don't miss it!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
so powerful and amazing,"I have never been so touched by a movie. It was the hardest movie I have ever sat through but also the best. it's so easy to ignore human rights abuses if they are not happening to you or your family, but just because you ignore it, they are still happening. i hope this movie receives the praise it deserves. i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me. i did not think about the making of the movie but rather sat shocked and horrified and nauseated and inspired. there was the red cross agent. there were heroes and while human nature perverts and the thin veil of culture unravels, there is still good. i have to look at the good of the heroes in the movie and of the people that wrote the movie, and realize that going to the movies doesn't have to be about escapism. it can be about reality. this is a must-see, not because it will make you laugh but because it will make you think and feel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A fantastic and powerful film,"I was fortunate to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival. I had heard nothing about this film before I read up on it in the Fest guide and originally was going to see something else. But, the subway happened to shut down and I was not going to be able to see the film I originally intended. So, I decided to give this a try.And I am so very glad I did.This film is by far the best drama I have seen all year, and indeed was the best film of the 11 I saw at the festival. It is gripping, heart-wrenching, and opens your eyes to so many things. Don Cheadle -- who I am a long time admirer of his work -- is phenomenal in the lead role, and I hope that he is nominated for Best Actor this year, because he certainly deserves it.I am recommending this film to everybody I know and I hope that it gets a wide distribution because it certainly is a film that needs to be seen. While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated, because (as one character says) we will watch it on TV, say that it is terrible, and go right on eating our dinner. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Documentary Feel & an Acting Treasure - A must see.,"Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE!The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes. Near the end of the q&a, an older man stood up and was called on. Slowly he commented that as a Tutsi, the movie gave him a lot to think about and that it may now be possible to find peace in his heart. The audience was stunned. And believe me, it takes a lot to silence a San Francisco audience.One last comment, the film is indpendently made and distributed - no Hollywood involvement at all (Terry George is British). There will be no machine pumping out ads and radio anouncements about this one. Help get the word out - great film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"See ""Shooting dogs"" instead...","This is a good movie. That can't be denied. But it is also the polished PG-13 version of one of the most horrifying events in modern history. Every little bit of information about the Rwandan genocide, that can find its way to the knowledge of people, is of course precious, and for that I am happy that this movie was made and brought lights to the topic in a way that regrettably not even the actual genocide could do. BUT... (And this is a big BUT.)This movie, has IMO never been able to fully depict the absolute horror of the genocide in Rwanda. It is not about the amounts of blood on the screen, nor the number of bodies in piles in the frames. It's about how you close up to the subject. And nothing in this movie makes me relive the anguish and emotional trauma which I felt when I was in Rwanda, some 8 yrs after the genocide. I have seen the scarred remains of a country trying to build itself up from the ashes. I've seen the mass graves, the Gacaca courts, the thousands and yet thousands of convicted perpetrators in their pink uniforms, working the fields. I have been to the survivors center and I have seen the thousands of skulls lying in N'tarama Church. What does ""Hotel Rwanda"" make me feel? Not very much. (As a note - I have also been to ""Mille Collines"". Which was a rather bizarre feeling, that luxury in the midst of poor Kigali.) This movie is just a little bit too detached from the reality as it was, to get to you in the way that the story of the genocide really does, if told in another way. Sure, I can see that people who have not known much about the Rwandan genocide, can get very emotionally affected by the movie, and I do too, of course. But, I still think that this movie makes a quite a shallow impression compared with other movies on the topic. Of course, I wasn't there when it actually happened, but when you have seen the mayhem after it with your own eyes, it's still different to when you haven't.AND ALSO - the thing that bugs me the most is the fact that Paul Rusesabagina really isn't quite the hero the world seems to think him to be. Did you know that the man ""sold"" shelter to the refugees coming to Mille Collines? The ones with money got in, the ones without, didn't. So the people who survived thanks to Rusesabagina were mainly very rich. Of course it's good that they survived, but what about the ones with no money. Rusesabagina did good, yes. But is he a hero? No. The heroes were the families who hid their neighbors, the UN-soldiers who desperately tried to get word out to the the rest of the world and get military task forces in, but were ignored and left to see the slaughter with tied hands. The people who risked their own lives to try to save others. The soldiers of the RPF, who were the ones who stopped this madness. Never believe everything you see in a movie without trying to get the full picture.No... if you are interested in this horrific but engaging chapter of modern history, and wish to know more about the shameful way in which the UN and the rest of the world handled the whole thing, I strongly recommend you to watch some other stuff. Like the best movie made about the Rwandan genocide: ""Shooting dogs"", which is much more likely to get you to understand the event in a more broad way, as well as give a much more deep emotional experience. ""Shake hands with the devil"" is a very well made TV-production about one of the true heroes from Rwanda 1994 - Roméo Dallaire. (On which Nolte's character in ""Hotel Rwanda"" was loosely based). There is also a very good documentary with the same name - ""Shake hands with the devil - the journey of Roméo Dallaire"". Also, there are some other movies on the topic - of which ""Sometimes in April"" is the best. I recently saw ""Kinyarwanda"", which was very good from some aspects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the most inspiring films I've ever seen.,"I have just seen this film and have to say I am deeply moved by it. The premise of the film is about one mans struggle to do the right thing at when everything around him is going wrong.Don Cheadle is the best African American actor out there. His passion and heart was so strong that moved me almost to tears. There is a definite wish here to let this story to be known to the world.Its powerful and provocative in its indirect and subtle jabs at the west for not intervening into such a horror that took place in Rwanda.Very well made and directed. Please see this and let it inspire you as it did me - to try cultivate selfless actions.Thanks, Ricky Thind",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not surprisingly, you'll need to have some Kleenex nearby as you watch this film.","""Hotel Rwanda"" is an incredibly sad sort of film. After all, during 1994 between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were murdered--mostly Tutsis hacked to death due to an insane tribal rivalry with the more numerous Hutus. Genocide is not pleasant viewing. However, the film is a bit easier to watch than it could be, as most of the scenes of the slaughter are pretty tame. This isn't really a complaint--it doesn't deny the killings but it also doesn't show a lot of hacked off limbs and bodies (though there are quite a few of the latter). I appreciate how the MPAA changed their minds and re-rated the film PG-13 instead of R, as R would seem to imply that it's not a film for a wide audience. Folks should see this film.Instead of ""Hotel Rwanda"" showing the violence in a general fashion, it focuses on a very brave man. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) was the man who ran the swank Hotel Rwanda around the time of the genocide. In a very brave move, he opened the hotel to the Tutsi (who were being massacred) and created a tenuous safe haven. However, when the UN pulled out (as the UN did what it usually does in these situations...NOTHING!), Rusesabinga had to learn on the fly to work with the ruling powers, the mobs and the few remaining UN troops (though most had left). Rusesabinga managed to not only save his family (his wife was Tutsi and children half-Tutsi) but 1200 people through his heroics. The film shows the way he connived and begged and worked to make this possible in the midst of Hell.The film is a high quality and well made product. Not surprisingly it's on the IMDb Top 250 list and it also was nominated for three Oscars (including one for Cheadle who sure sounded African to my untrained ears). And, not surprisingly, it's an awfully tough film to watch. I don't recommend it for very young audiences but folks need to see this film and realize we have not come that far as a world. And, it's sad the film and other films about Rwanda during this period didn't come out until a decade after the massacres. It also makes you realize just how far from its original charter the UN has gone--it SHOULD have been able to take a stand against such evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not bad, but definitely a disappointment","Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.The film is very well put together, with the acting, direction and production values all being very classy examples of how good each can be. The story takes in themes of the futility of war, love for your fellow man and, of course, the race divide (another reason for the good critical reaction), and it has to be said that all of these things are done well, and even quite potent at times. The film is also notable for avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall most dramas of this nature - things such as over the top sentiment or long, heartfelt speeches. While the film definitely has an underbelly of sentiment, it never sees fit to fully expose it; and that is always a good thing in my opinion. The film is keen to give glimpses of it at it at times, however, and these moments tend to be cringe-worthy. The ending is a prime example of that; and despite the fact that this is based on a true story and that's simply 'how it ends'; the film could have handled it better, and then I wouldn't have left the cinema feeling like I'd just been slapped in the face after spending two hours of my time on the film.On the whole, Hotel Rwanda is a long shot away from being a 'bad' film; but it's not a great film either, and the lack of sympathy for the characters will make some people feel like they should have watched a straight documentary instead. Many have, and will continue to be seduced by the racism theme and the fact that it's based on a true story; but not me, and hopefully not you either, as there's more to a great film than just that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Dumbed-down, sentimental, superficial version of history","The only possible explanation I can think of for the high regard and score for this film is that people are reviewing the theme, or the intentions, rather than the movie itself.I found the script incredibly puerile. I felt embarrassed for the actors having to say lines like ""How can people be so cruel?"" or Joaquin Phoenix exclaiming ""I feel so ashamed"" because a porter holds an umbrella over his head.It was no surprise to learn that the writer, an editor, wrote it in his spare time, and had not written anything before. There are no rounded characters, only mouthpieces for the humanitarian message that the writers are trying to convey.The story is decent enough, and there are some effective scenes such as a convoy of vehicles driving into an ambush, but all of these play better with the sound down. The dialog was more suited to a Steven Seagal action movie than a fact-based movie with serious pretensions. The director resorted too easily to slushy music to tell the audience how to feel. And the characters were paper-thin: the hero who loves children and animals, the angelic aid worker, the cowardly bad guys.Given the subject matter, this review will probably come across as mealy-mouthed and uncharitable. But this is a site for reviewing movies, not causes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a great one,"I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that can get me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, I might be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personal experiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizing the development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography, acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watching it. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time. The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of people facing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith... Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in the situation. What's more is that it squarely shows the realist thinking in international politics.It honestly shows the weakness or helplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. It truthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community (or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towards the deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of the world. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say what we see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows you how monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail. At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful you find those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. The movie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassion that the world is dreaming for.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I heard Paul Rusesabagina speak at Lewis & Clark College.,"""Hotel Rwanda"" recreates the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" recreated the genocide against the Jews. The movie shows not only the massacre, but also how the international community did nothing to stop it. Hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) sheltered several Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the Mille Collines hotel, saving them from getting murdered.Right after I saw the movie, I attended a speech by the real Paul Rusesabagina at Lewis & Clark College. He explained how the Belgian colonization of Rwanda set the stage for the 1994 genocide (the Belgians put the minority Tutsis in power, completely disenfranchising the majority Hutus), and what it was like for him experiencing it. As for why specifically the international community did nothing to stop the massacre, Rusesabagina said (as a mild joke): ""Maybe it's because Rwanda doesn't have oil."" Anyway, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a very powerful movie that reminds us not only of this specific event, but about what can happen if we forget the past. I recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It is very accurate about what happened but reading it is just not the same as seeing it, it seemed horrendous always but when I actually saw the movie it was just... Jesus... it's so hard to believe that this happened and that this could. The film was excellent in both execution and portrayal.

What were you doing in 1994?,"What were you doing in 1994? I was probably rockin to Soundgarden's latest album on my portable CD player, waiting for Seinfeld to come on while pondering the OJ Simpson murder case, the ""news of the century.""Meanwhile, as many as one million people were being butchered with machetes, raped and tortured by their fellow humans, as an entire nation collectively lost its mind.Suddenly Seinfeld ain't so funny.This film is epic, if for the sole reason that it brings to light a horrific chapter of human history that many of us would otherwise know nothing of. Let me repeat: as many as 1 million people (the population of North Dakota and Wyoming combined) were slaughtered, and the politicians of the western world did nothing to stop it, and the media never gave it 1/1000th as much air time as OJ. Yes, it is a disturbing film, but it focuses on the brave struggle of one individual in his efforts to save as many lives as possible. So it is also a very inspiring film.To be honest I was too engrossed in the story to be able to review this movie on technical merits such as acting, cinematography, musical score, etc. I believe that is the way to watch this film; it is not a film, it is an experience. A lesson. A reminder that, while we live our comfortable lives in 1080p HD Blu-Ray comfort, we have no clue what is going on with ""the other half"".I will say that every performance was very convincing, and several scenes could be called poetic if they weren't so disturbing (I'm referring to the river road in the fog... but you'll see what I mean). I was instantly pulled in by Don Cheadle as the ""everyman"" hero of the story, and I was equally intent on supporting cast members such as Nick Nolte whose character was based on Canadian general Dallaire (even though the real Dallaire was never consulted about this film).It's crazy, but you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this story is real, even though its plot is as preposterous as the craziest Hollywood fiction you've seen.This is a film I highly recommend to people who like to get involved. Whether you're a political activist, whether you volunteer walking dogs at your local animal shelter, or whether you blog about life in general, this is a film for you. Yes, it will upset you. But I think in the end it will get you stoked to get out there and change this damaged world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A document for humanity,"The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.At the center of the story is Paul Rusesabagina, a courageous man who witnessed first hand the worst days of the Hutu rebellion and its bloody aftermath. This man alone was able to protect and to save more than a thousand Rwandans that clearly would not be around today, had it not been for his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy, or wouldn't reason about what they were doing to their fellow citizens.The performance of Don Cheadle, as Paul Rusesabagina, is worth the price of admission! This wonderful actor projects such an intelligence that it's hard to find in any American film released in 2004. Mr. Cheadle was right to portray this man; it was a role he was born to play. Mr. Cheadle got under the skin of the hotel manager and runs away with the film. It's hard to keep ones eyes from this commanding performance.The rest of the mostly black cast is excellent. One must single out Sophie Okoneko, who plays Paul's wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches Mr. Cheadle's performance. Nick Nolte is fine as the UN Colonel trying to keep peace in a place gone mad.Congratulations to Mr. George. With this film he touches us in more ways than we imagined. The unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if the international community would have intervened sooner, but obviously, it didn't even try until it was too late.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hotel Rwanda's cinematic compression of history,"The historical errors in the film Hotel Rwanda will unfortunately go unnoticed by the average viewer. While the film is not billed as a documentary, the director has neglected to provide any disclaimers for the cinematic manipulation of factual events--a manipulation which is all too obvious to those who know the history of the country well.One of the most glaring errors in the film seems to be due to the cinematic compression of time, which is often unavoidable when attempting to simplify complex events for a general audience. The General portrayed in the film, Augustin Bizimungu, did not in fact hold that position (as Army Chief of Staff) until 3 weeks after the genocide. The actual Chief of Staff at the time, Deogratias Nsabimana, was aboard the President's plane that was mysteriously downed on April 6 (no one has claimed responsibility for this crash since, although evidence points increasingly toward the country's current President, Paul Kagame, as the man who gave the order to fire the 2 missiles that brought it down). There were, in fact, 10 people on the plane, including 2 French pilots. In addition, the airplane was a gift from Francois Mitterand. Both of these facts truly call in to question the current Rwandan government's suggestions that the French military is the entity responsible for downing the plane (which in essence, qualifies as an act of terrorism under many international legal instruments).This last statement should not, however, be interpreted as an attempt to excuse the grave mistakes that the French did make in its Operation Turquoise.Immediately after the plane crash, which is commonly referred to as the 'trigger' that touched off the genocide, a man named Marcel Gatsinzi was named to replace Nsabimana. 3 weeks later, A. Bizimungu was named to take over the post. (Before the plane crash, Bizimungu even lacked the credentials necessary to become a general, which makes the film's portrayal of him as such even more inaccurate.) Gatsinzi, a Hutu, is now employed in the current government of Rwanda, which is dominated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (the army that is credited with stopping the genocide).The film further neglects to mention--not even by providing a paragraph of text that could enlighten the audience further--that the Rwandan Patriotic Front was responsible for targeted killing of tens of thousands of Hutu civilians (especially those from the North of the country) during its invasion into Rwanda in October 1990 (which instigated the civil war that preceded the genocide), as well as ""after"" the genocide and in the years immediately following (particularly 1997-98). The RPF currently enjoys considerable impunity for its war crimes and the crimes against humanity it has committed, and acknowledges only selected crimes.Despite the film's compression of time, and the ahistorical consequences that arise from this, the film does provide a powerful, well-acted glimpse into an isolated part of the horror that engulfed Rwanda in 1994.For more information about the economic roots of the genocide, read Chapter 10 ('Malthus in Africa') of Jared Diamond's best-selling book ""Collapse."" For more information about the genocide in practical and political terms, read ""Leave None to Tell the Story"" by Alison Des Forges (Human Rights Watch publication): http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/ Finally, if you are really serious about understanding the full context of the 1994 genocide and its international political dimensions, familiarize yourself with the research of scholars Rene Lemarchand and Filip Reyntjens (available in English).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda- very good,The movie was brilliant I had to see it for history class and I learned a lot. I wanted to see the movie Don Chedle is brilliant and is great at this particular role. His wife was great as well. This is a Must see movie. It will take you back to when Rwanda was in trouble and no one came to help except one guy who sheltered 1000 Tutsis and is a hero of Rwanda. It was sad though because it was a war and a lot of people died. Very educational and a good lesson to learn about peace and war. The movie was so great but very sad I cried and I am writing an essay on the movie. I also want to see it again. It was so good and there is a lesson to be learned about helping and keeping peace between people. I felt very sorry for the people of Rwanda who lost family members.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda? Yes; Rwanda genocide? Not Obvious,"The Rwanda genocide is certainly one of the most atrocious crime in the 1990s. Rivalry between the Hutus and the Tutsis led to the death of over a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a span of three months.""Hotel Rwanda"" is a true story based on this massacre. Unfortunately, I do not feel any pain watching it. The entire film focuses too much on people inside the hotel that the film fails to portray the horror of the massacre. ""Hotel Rwanda"" spends too much time inside the hotel. It does not show the events outside the hotel and how they connect one another. I notice the hotel but I do not witness Kigali and Rwanda.I do not demand a feast of bloodshed, shootings, and corpses. However, I would also like to see how the terror moves Paul. I only notice several brief scenes where Paul actually witnesses many corpses and cries. The film needs to present more connections between the genocide and Paul's family.This film has some shadows of ""Schindler's List"" but it is nowhere near the calibre of ""Schindler's List."" When Hutu soldiers started the massacre, I doubt that Paul's hotel can keep getting away from the bloodshed by means of personal relationships and bribes. I cannot believe that this is true.""Hotel Rwanda"" has its positive elements in spite of its weaknesses. I am impressed that they vividly portray the world's negligence. Foreign nations care more about pulling out its citizens than stopping the bloody massacre. This was the case in 1994 and ""Hotel Rwanda"" makes this point. In another scene, Paul tries to send his family away and determines to stay with others in the hotel. This scene touches me because it deeply illustrates Paul's sentiment and humanity. He is not a selfish individual caring only for him and his family.""Hotel Rwanda"" is not a bad film. Its subject is serious and worth us to reflect. However, it can do a better job portraying how atrocious the genocide was and how Paul and others survived.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Film Based On Lies.,"This movie is an utter disgrace, falsely based on the antics of a supposedly ''hero'' of the Rwanda Genocide.

Probably the most important movie of 2004,"Hotel Rwanda (2004) Directed by Terry George, is the great film of 2004.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, an African who has bought into the European ideal of the perfect life. He's the manager of a four-star hotel in Rwanda. He has a beautiful wife (played by Sophie Okonedo), handsome and healthy young children, a new vehicle, and a fine suburban home.All this changes when civil strife erupts in Rwanda. When this happens the former colonial powers wash their hands of the problems, and the Rwandans are left to fend for themselves in an atmosphere of increasing violence and anarchy.The acting is excellent and the story is emotionally gripping. Like Schindler's List, the film follows one man's attempt to save as many people as he can. Schindler and Rusesabagina were heroic, resourceful, and amazingly effective. However, as individuals, they could accomplish only so much. Outside intervention could have saved a million lives in Rwanda, but it was never forthcoming. The Rwandan genocide is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Hotel Rwanda brings this horror onto the screen and into our lives.Addendum: Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, the U.N. commander in Rwanda. This role is obviously based on Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the ridiculously small force of 400 U.N. soldiers. These troops were unable to do anything more than watch the genocide taking place before their eyes. General Dellaire's story is told in Steven Silver's film ""The Last Just Man.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the Most Moving Pictures Ever!,"For a while now, there have been uprisings in Africa, most of the time, it is quite violent. In Tears of the Sun starring Bruce Willis, the problem in Nigeria was put into perspective. It was shown through the eyes of the US military trying to rescue a couple of select people but end up bringing back refugees. Hotel Rwanda takes a different path, shown through the eyes of those under attack.Hotel Rwanda is based on a true story out of Rwanda, Africa. It is a country gripped by war and oppression. When a four-star hotel is now thrown right into the mix of things, manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) has to make a very important decision. He must decide whether or not to let Tutsi's live in his hotel to take refuge from the Hutu soldiers.The problem is that the Hutu's, a tribe of Africans in Rwanda, are taking control and want to exterminate the Tutsis, a rival tribe. This hostile take over is one that spreads all over Paul's town. One night over a radio broadcast, the Hutu militia's leader told all of his soldiers to find and eliminate the Tutsis. Now, Paul, his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi, and their children must stay in the hotel and watch over all of the ""new guests"". With Paul paying off the leader of the Hutu militia, General Bizimungu, he tries to keep his hotel out of harms way.When he runs out of ideas and aid from the General and from the United Nations, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), and the media, he must defend his hotel by finding a way to get those refugees out of there and keep his family safe at the same time. Paul is faced with heart breaking decisions and must stay strong so he doesn't show weakness or give up the Tutsis.Cheadle's performance is breathtaking. When everything seems to be coming apart and he might lose it, he has to hold it together. Cheadle's character sees things that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So much death and destruction in one area can have an impact on a man. With scenes that are similar to Schindler's List, this movie is powerful and really shows how little people have known about the crisis in Rwanda.Hotel Rwanda was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay. Although it didn't win, the movies message was carried across and brought attention to the devastation in Africa.Hotel Rwanda is a masterpiece and is one of the most moving films of all time. It leaves nothing behind and shows you everything. It will be looked at for years to come. Hotel Rwanda opens will open your eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Powerful, gut-wrenching and compelling","Hotel Rwanda was one of those films I initially put off seeing for reasons I don't really know, but after seeing it that decision is one of those decisions that I've regretted as it turned out to be one of the better films I've seen in a while now. Hotel Rwanda is beautifully shot and the scenery is striking while still being authentic without being too clean. The story is always compelling and powerful, with plenty of gut-wrenching and poignant moments while never feeling preachy. The film is excellently directed and scripted too, while Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Pheonix and particularly Don Cheadle give superb acting performances. Overall, a truly fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent and emotionally devastating,"""Hotel Rwanda"" gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.From about fifteen minutes into ""Hotel Rwanda"", I was pretty upset, and that feeling didn't go away once. Don Cheadle is incredibly good as a conflicted hero. Many comparisons have been made between this film and ""Schindler's List"", but if there is a way to rate levels of heroship, Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed in the film is pretty high up there. He is repeatedly given the chance to escape unharmed, but never gives in, a big turnaround from the beginning of the film when he first turned a blind eye, then became a reluctant hero. Cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly. It's not just the superficial coups that he achieves (flawless accent, etc.) it is the subtle strength he gives the character. His character may not be a beloved singer or a good impersonation of someone, but the strength of his performance should have given him an Oscar, not just a nomination. (Though I am glad that he at least got that much.) This is the first film that I have seen Sophie Okonedo act in, and she also extremely good. She quickly shows that she is more than a pretty face, and her strength and mettle are admirable, while experiencing the worst atrocities first hand.As a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" was not manipulative emotional. Under Terry George's direction, it felt at times like a documentary because it was truly an unblinking look at a terrible and shameful time in history. Though I had heard about the genocide, I was not fully aware of the ""reasons"" for the war, and as completely ridiculous as they were, the film is excellent at providing us a lesson in recent history without commentary. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty level look at the conflict and while it was incredibly emotional, it was not preachy. While I mention that it had an almost documentary feel to it, which is not to say that there were dramatic moments. One moment in particular where I literally felt like I was going to be sick was when Paul (in what was probably his defining moment) encounters literally hundreds of dead bodies on a road that he and one of his hotel employees are traveling. Having said that, however, even a moment like this one was managed with care and subtlety by George.I was telling some co-workers about the film and its emotional impact and a couple of them who hadn't seen it went, ""Gee  that sounds too depressing for me"". ""Hotel Rwanda"" is certainly not a cheerful film, it is a film about a conflict that ended the lives of one million people in a matter of months while most of the world turned a blind eye. But it amazingly ends on a note that did not make me want to find the nearest closed garage and turn on the car, and left me with a newly found understanding of something I had only heard about and until Saturday night, knew nothing about. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is really and truly an excellent film that should be seen, both for its impactful storytelling and for its command performances. 8/10 --Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Pretty good movie, pretty pretentious comments","I finally saw Hotel Rwanda and I thought it was good, not great, and not terrible. I agree that you didn't get the FULL horror of the genocide but I think there certainly was a sufficient amount of brutality to get what occurred across; scenes like the one on the foggy road were very disturbing.What annoyed me more than any problems I had with the movie was the level of pretension in some comments I read (this one not excluded). Where are the, ""the scene where Don Cheadle is shirtless was hot"" posts? Instead, I just see people writing ""I am better than everyone because I know what REALLY happened"" under the veil of a leading questions like, ""I liked the movie a lot BUT I would like people to share their thoughts on if the film's distortion of reality was justifiable in that it led to the ends of greater mass appeal?""

The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's ""civil"" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite.

A missed opportunity,"Hotel Rwanda is all right, but it is only all right and certainly does not merit the praise that has been heaped on it. It is true that is it has given a new audience to the terrible atrocities of 1994, but this does not get away from the fact that it is only a slightly above average film. If anything, it should have been easier to make a great film because of the power of the story, but instead of letting the events speak for themselves they end up Hollywood-izing it. The most glaring pandering to the Western audience is the fact that everyone speaks English, which reminded me of the awful portrayals of the German soldiers in all the old war films, where they speak English in a German accent. But this is only the tip of the iceberg and there are plenty of changes with how things really happened. Again, what did happen what so ghastly that there was no need to do this, and there seems a lack of understanding that something can be emotionally powerful without intrusive music that cheaply pulls at the heart strings. And why, oh why, did they not use more of the Rwandan countryside. It's certainly one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and the film missed a trick in this respect. The Constant Gardener's cinematography is much better, even though the lush greens of Rwanda would be much more conducive. But despite everything I hate about this film, I still like it. It is exciting in some parts, and with other parts is successful in making you angry about how the West left all these people to be brutally murdered. But it's not in the same league as Shaking Hands With the Devil, a far superior film on the Genocide.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An important film for our time,"I attended the United States premier of Hotel Rwanda on November 3rd, 2004 in Philadelphia. I have never written a review for a movie before, but this movie was excellent and I am urging everyone I know that they should see it as well.I lived in Rwanda in the summer of '04. I have read several books on the history of Rwanda and talked about the '94 genocide with locals in Rwanda and also with Rwandans living in the US. I am by no means an expert on the history or the country, but I do know a fair amount about it, which is part of why I am writing this review.The movie was an excellent reproduction of what Rwanda is like and it tells the true story of one of the many heroes during that time. While it is a sad movie, it is also a story of hope. The portrayal of the violence was subtle and powerful, but not overly graphic. The movie focuses on the efforts of the manager of an upscale hotel in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda to protect the guests/refugees streaming into his hotel to escape the killing. The writer/directory (who spoke after the premier) said that he made an effort to get a PG13 rating rather than an R rating to ensure that students would be able to see this movie.It is an important movie to see because it brings to life the hope and triumph in Rwanda. It also shows what the media did not show in '94 and is not showing in Darfur: The suffering of ordinary people who need help from the rest of the world. While governments repeat the phrase 'never again' yet do nothing, it is up to us to ordinary people to learn about these events and do something or make our governments do something about them. Please see this movie-it does not have the budget to launch everywhere and relies on word of mouth to generate enough interest to make it into every city.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful,"'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons.In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George.Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope. There is one complaint (one that also counts for 'Schindler's List') I have here. The people in Rwanda were not speaking English as their main language, but they were definitely not speaking English with accents. Maybe it makes it more realistic for an English speaking audience, it does not for most others. Just let them speak their original language or normal English. You didn't see the people from 'Gladiator' speak English with a Latin accent either and it worked just fine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Modern Day Schindler's List,"""Never have so many owed so much to so few"" - Winston Churchill.I think this quote best describes the atmosphere highlighted in this magnificent film. What Paul Rusesebagina did to help the helpless Tutsis families by sheltering them in his hotel was proof that everyone of us can make a change for the better. The story is simply amazing and shocking at the same time - the feeling of regret and compassion was amplified by the fact that this movie was based on a true story.Don Cheadle delivers an outstanding performance.His acting is flawless - he manages to actually bring the viewer into the harsh Rwandian environment of the 1994 events. He skillfully points out the torment which Paul Rusesebagina faced! Sophie Okonedo also plays very well in this movie, masterfully playing the role of the determined and loving mother willing to do anything to save her children. Nick Nolte is superb in playing remorse haunted Colonel Oliver of the UN forces and Joaquin Phoenix does a great job on playing the character of Jack Daglish, the cameraman in charge to bring footage of the massacre.What strikes me at this movie is the remarkable resemblance between Paul Rusesebagina and Oskar Schindler, two men who risked their lives to save other people and who, against all odds, succeeded in achieving this.Through their actions, they saved the entire world, saved it from forgetting the fact that we are all humans and a right to live on this planet!All in all, this movie is superb and greatly deserves a spot in the Top 250! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An African holocaust,"As one can probably imagine, a film with an 8,5 out of 10 (with 4.356 votes) ranking at number 130 of the IMDb's top 250 has few naysayers. There are some there however and I've taken the trouble to read them. What I think is sort of funny, is that many of the critique that is placed is utterly stupid. One person actually goes so far as to say that the film:""doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies.""This is I feel a very feeble critique. This is not a film about the Rwandan genocide as is was, but a film about the events Paul Rusesabagina witnessed. He cannot help the fact that he didn't get to see much of the genocide and that he and his family survived in the end. Or maybe flat6 (the writer) thinks they should have just killed Rusesabagina off in the film, which certainly would have been more dramatic, but much less true. Also, doesn't this criticism mean that Schindler's List is a bad film as well?Another writer, imdb-45 states that:""The film gives no treatment as to the reason for the hatred between the two sects of African black people and concentrates virtually on a man's heroic attempt to save people in a hotel, many of which are would-be victims of the genocide.""If I'm not mistaken, the reason for the hatred is actually clearly outline in a conversation between Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and a local African journalist. I mean I am no expert on the subject, but it seemed pretty clear to me (if that was the whole of it). Basically it was just like WW 2, based on race, an African holocaust so to speak (although less organized and without the concentration camps as far as I know).The same author states that:""there is an awkward product plug for Volkswagon that ruins a genuinely amusing moment. There are product plugs for several different alcohol beverages that don't quite feel right.""Well, sorry but in reality people use product and brand names on a daily basis. So why not in a film? Because than it is advertising? If you recommend a brand of beer to your friends it is also advertising in a way, although on a much smaller scale.Someone else, fooltank77, states that the film doesn't say what happened after the genocide. While that is true, it isn't a flaw. This is the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his family and what happened tot hem during the genocide. The rest is nothing of the films concern. Also, everybody who watches the news occasionally or reads the paper knows that it is far from peaceful down there even now. Do you need to have everything presented to you? Personally I felt that this was a very impressing and good film. The performances and the directing were great and despite the fact that the film didn't show much of the slaughter, it was emotionally unsettling enough. I was especially astounded by the fact that the UN did so little to help. I knew that there wasn't much interference, but the fact that there was virtually no help at all just goes to show that Africa is just too far away for the rich and distant countries to worry. I daresay that the events in the film made me almost ashamed to be living in one of those rich UN countries.I feel that if you actually go to see this film and expect it to be an individual tale within a massive cultural slaughter, you will come to accept that this film has it's boundaries and doesn't show everything that happened before , during or after the genocide. Demanding that and claiming the film is bad because it doesn't give you everything there is, would be like saying Schindler's list is bad, because it didn't show the political situation in Germany in the beginning of the 1930's, how Hitler gained his power, what happened in Stalingrad, what Dr.Mengele did during medical experiments on Jews or the killing of the moffen-hoeren (women who had sex with Germans during WW 2) in the Netherlands after the war. My point here is that a film like Schindler's list doesn't actually have as much background info as is demanded of this film by some viewers. It is just that we (in the western world) now much more about WW 2 than we do of a distant African genocide. Also there is so much suffering when something like this occurs and one film can not show it all. All it can do is show us parts of the tragedy and maybe inspire viewers to try and find out more about it. Giving a complete picture of such a tragedy is like completing a puzzle. Bear in mind that this is only the first piecehopefully.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Making a film and a contribution to humanity,"I usually say my criteria for assessing a film are asking myself if it inspired, educated or entertained me. I somehow don't seem to have a category for 'it totally devastated me'.Nearly all the main characters are based on real life people  very real. One of the problems we have in coming to terms with the ethnic destruction of a peoples we have no knowledge of, have little culturally in common with, have little to identify them as 'people' other than a biological acknowledgement is that, for us, they are not very 'real'. So is the point of a film about the Rwandan genocide that left a million dead that they become more real? Does that make any difference? One of the results of going to see this very powerful, very harrowing (and in terms of the personal integrity and bravery of some central characters, very beautiful) film is that part of the proceeds go towards helping the people who are left. Another, perhaps, is that by becoming more aware of suffering our desire to find a way to avoid or alleviate it increases. The film shows a divide between - on one hand - the Rwandan people who, rich or poor, had sensibilities much like you or I, - and on the other hand - the troglodytes that wanted to kill each other and (with a logic reminiscent of President Bush's ""if you're not with us you're against us"" simplistic attitude) anyone who didn't join them. The inclusiveness of the carnage and the inability (or unwillingness) of the West to help meant there was no get out along the lines of 'if they want to kill each other let them'.The performances are so spellbinding that it is hard to watch the film without feeling the suffering of those involved. Although it points the finger at a reluctance of the West to get involved, we also have to ask ourselves that, even if the powerful governments or the UN were willing to get involved, could the carnage have been prevented? The lack of any well-structured hint at a potential solution is perhaps one of the (very few) flaws of the film. Similarly, the swiftness of some of the events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail to explain why things happened the way they did. But it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced a large amount of the carnage, so in a way Hotel Rwanda is a protest against international apathy.The official website of the movie provides much in the way of reference material, links and analysis. This helped to confirm my view while watching the film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars. In doing so they have become true stars, irrespective of what awards were won or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Rwanda's Schindler,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with ""Hotel Rwanda"", which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out ""Sometimes in April"", a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective.

Excellent except for one thing,"It's difficult to imagine the inhumanity and horror of the Rwandan genocide. Yet this film does a good job of conveying it without resorting to excess gore. It also leavens the horror with well timed moments of humour or tenderness. From all accounts it is factually correct. Why then did they not portray Gen. Romeo Dallaire as himself instead of inserting some trumped up fictional character played most unsuitably by Nick Nolte wearing a Canadian flag on his shirt? This detracts from the film and angers Canadians. Most of us regard Dalaire as a compassionate, highly principled hero who was betrayed by the UN. (Read his book, ""Shake Hands With The Devil."") The movie tells a terrible story very well. But eliminating Gen. Dalaire is a little like eliminating Eisenhower from ""The Longest Day"" (Dalaire, incidentally, just recently was appointed to the Canadian Senate.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant film of questionable factual basis,"I'm aware that there are substantial claims that the depiction of Paul Rusesabagina is potentially flawed in this film and that he may not be the hero the movie makes him out to be. I can't know for sure which version of the story is factual and can only ""review"" the film as presented.The movie is powerful and heartbreaking and shows the 1994 genocide of Tutsis by rival Hutus as part of the Rwandan Civil War. The horrifying brutality of this unimaginable slaughter of up to 800,000 people is the backdrop for the valiant efforts of a resort hotel manager to shelter and save as many innocents as possible, especially children. I CAN say that Don Cheadle is outstanding in the film, that the movie accurately and dramatically gives an eye-opening look at the savagery of war, and is absolutely worth watching as presented. I would also urge people (if interested) to read further on the subject to decide for themselves whether they believe this story, as told, to be mostly factual or a slanted and unfair view of history.The film itself deserves a ""9"" or maybe even a ""10"" on merit. I've given it an ""8"" because the controversy over its veracity troubles me. I still highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle...","Films like this remind me why life is just one big ball of tragedy. It is very difficult to live life happily unless all these horrible facts of reality are summarily swept under the proverbial rug in our minds. Don Cheadle does a reasonably OK job in his role as the messianic hero, although his face is usually stamped with helpless despair most of the time, a lot of time the fact that he is acting oozes through the lens a little too intensely. The film tap-dances around the horrific violence going on in the periphery, there is minimal on-screen violence shown. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and there be an actual depiction of the massacre going on. But, in the end, it was an attempt to shed some light on the Western world's indifference to the suffering of a split-off continent that is kept in captivity by the superpowers, kind of reminds me of the film ""Martyrs"", except in geographic terms, and applied to about 1 billion people in 54 countries. Now, the ridiculous thing about this movie, in my opinion, is how the main actor does this ""heroic"" thing for all the refugees, and yet ends up leaving his country and moving to Belgium, where it's all white and safe; again, the racial and economic split is created, but people swallow it easier since the actor is black, but the egregious disregard for human life is eternally stamped on the final message of this film... after all, who cares if 700,000 people lost their lives in this atrocious genocide, as long as the charismatic wealthy hero who knew all the right white guys comes out unscathed?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Indisputably a quality film, Hotel Rwanda is nevertheless a little more Hollywood than I thought it would be","The basic hurdle for the world to have more empathy with the macro issue of the horrendous massacre is the fact that the world is uninformed. Unlike the situation of Nazis and Jews, Irish Catholics and British Protestants or Crusade and Islam, the issue of Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda has not generally been heard of by an average citizen of the world. In the movie, the reporter asks two women at the bar in Hotel Rwanda what tribe they belong to. ""Hutu"" says one, and ""Tutsi"", the other. The reported turns around and comments to his companion ""They look like twins to me"". That says a lot.The film does educate us on the brief background of the local history, on how the Belgians used the Tutsi's to rule the Hutu and so since they left, the Hutu had been waiting for their chance to revenge. That is however just the bare backbone of the history, but we have not been brought to a deeper understanding of the bitter hatred that drove the Hutus to a diabolical genocide of a million Tutsi in 1994 as the world turned its back: ""the nations are united in their indifference towards Rwanda"" as Mr. Ebert aptly puts it.Rather than being an epic on macro scale, Hotel Rwanda is a personal story (albeit a true one) on micro scale, about hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina's heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel ""guests"" of Tutsi descent, including his own wife. This is a story told with high quality filming and yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like a Hollywood thriller. It would be gross injustice to say it's crafted and yet, the climax after climax of narrow escape and cliffhanging suspense does feel a tad Hollywood. It would be gross injustice to say that it's a tearjerker and yet one cannot help feeling traces of familiarity in the Hollywood style emotional pull. And there is considerable predictability, such as the sudden bumpy ride of the jeep in the fog would be easily discerned by a regular moviegoer as the signal for the next scene: a road strewn with bodies of massacred victims.Oscar nominee Don Cheadle's performance as the circumstance-driven hero is deservedly recognized by the nomination. Nick Notle, who was wonderful in ""Clean"", puts in another great performance here as a similarly circumstance-driven hero in the U.N. peace keeping force Col. Oliver. The rest of the cast contributing to making this film a solid success includes Sophie Okonedo who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Pauls's wife Tatiana and Joaquin Phoenix as the reporter whose videotape of the massacre made the world pay attention. All told, Hotel Rwanda is a high-quality movie, but I can't agree with many comments hailing Hotel Rwanda as another Schindler's List.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This IS the Best Picture of 2004 (spoilers),"As governments around the world ignore the atrocities against the Sudanese in Darfur, this movie should have you screaming for something to be done to save them! 'The Hotel Rwanda' should be seen by all, and forgotten by none.'The Hotel Rwanda' is a familiar favorite among Best Picture contenders, more than humbling an audience with biographical tales of heroic struggles against disgusting atrocities. 'The Pianist' and 'Schindler's List' are more recent examples of this. But, with 'The Hotel Rwanda,' the intensity delivered by director Terry George and the powerful performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, this film was able to put the shock into people in a much more disturbing and intense way than I had ever seen any other movie do and leaves you silent and just as helpless long after you've left the theater.The Hotel Rwanda refers to the Belgium hotel that, under Rusesabagina's unexpected direction, served as a refugee camp for the Tutsi people who were being wiped out by Hutsi rebels in Rwanda. On the one hand, this movie shows you the kind of atrocities that could result if one faction controlled the media (the Hutsi's here controlled the radio waves and incited their violence and recruited their followers through a propaganda radio program). On the other hand, Rusesabagina is such an extraordinary heroic figure where he tried desperately to save people from the slaughter when it seems that every government that could help denied assistance to the Rwandas. Even where journalists were able to enter the country before the worst fighting began and report the massacre. We ought to be made aware of these things, and we should never ignore them, and never forget them.I am still amazed by the powerful emotion that this movie is able to invoke, to nearly lose your mind in desperation when it seems like there is going to be no hope left for Paul, his family, or the Rwandan refugees. To become nearly violent when anger when you their holocaust, but the other countries refuse to help.And, actress Sophie Okonedo, who plays Tatiana Rusesabagina, likewise gives an incredible performance as Paul's wife.This IS the Best Picture of 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A moving and powerful film,"Just over ten years ago, Rwanda, a former Belgian colony the size of Vermont, became a horrific killing field, the result of ethnic, social, and political hatred between the majority Hutus and the rival Tutsis, the former ruling elite who ran the country for the Belgians and treated the Hutu as second class citizens. The Washington Post reported ""how the heads and limbs of victims were sorted and piled neatly, a bone-chilling order in the midst of chaos that harked back to the Holocaust."" The massacre that claimed over one million lives was triggered by the still unsolved assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane was gunned down by missiles on his return from a conference in Dar-es Salam. Senior Hutu leaders used the downing of the plane as an excuse to exterminate Tutsis and moderate Hutus. While the UN maintained a peacekeeping presence they did not intervene, nor did the U.S., France, Belgium or other Western powers who had the power to stop it.In the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda, the atrocity is dramatized through the story of the determination of one man who sheltered over 1000 Tutsis including his wife (Sophie Okenado), a Tutsi woman, and his children. Don Cheadle portrays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in a towering performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Rusesabagina, who served as an adviser to the film, managed the Belgian-owned Hotel Mille Collines in the city of Kigali, a luxury hotel where UN dignitaries socialized with Western diplomats and media. As homes are invaded and bodies pile up, people are forced to leave their homes and seek shelter in churches, schools, and in this case the luxury hotel.As the sounds of fighting outside increase, the White guests are forced to leave and the remaining Africans are left to defend themselves with the token aid of the UN peacekeeping force, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), who is faced with an insurmountable task. With supplies of food and water diminishing and the violence increasing, Paul pleads with his guests to telephone the outside world in a plea for help but with scant results. The comment by an American journalist about the value of airing a segment explicitly showing Hutus hacking Tutsi civilians puts it into perspective: ""They will go  'O God, that's horrible!' and then go back to eating their dinner.""Hotel Rwanda allows us to see the conflict in human rather than political terms and Paul's loving relationship with his family is believable and deeply affecting. Though scenes of gory violence are kept to a minimum earning the film a PG-13 rating, the scene showing Paul and his assistant Gregoire driving through fog and discovering hundreds of bodies of slaughtered innocents lying on the road, stands out for its understated horror. Though not justifying the massacre, more historical background would have been helpful such as knowing the role of the Belgian colonial authority in fomenting ethnic division in the country, and the 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the exiled Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front with the support of the Americans and the British. While Hotel Rwanda may fall short of greatness, it is nonetheless a moving and powerful film, an unflinching indictment of the political extremism that fed the turmoil, the indifference of self-satisfied Western nations, and the courage and tenacity of one man who made a difference.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A must watch for all,"What do you feel about riots and mass killing? What did you do when you saw these things on news channels? Did you do anything to stop them? All that most of us would do is feel bad about it. And then we would turn off the TV sets, take dinner and go to sleep. The movie shows the attitude of the world when mass killing is being done in Africa in the communal riots between Hutus and Tutsis. The protagonist, ""Paul"", who is a Hutu himself, is just like one of us for whom his family (which is Tutsi) is the most important. In the beginning he would do anything to save his family and would not even bother about his good neighbour. But slowly as he sees what is going around him he starts to realize. He takes up the responsibility of giving shelter to thousands of refugees in his hotel. He keeps giving bribes to the Tutsis leader. He even speaks to so many influential people around the world. And although he had a lot of difficulties convincing the world powers that they should interrupt, he ends up saving lives of about 1200 people. It is not a feel good movie or anything like that.

More than just an African 'Schindler's List',"Based on the 1994 genocide between the African ""tribes"" of the Hutu's and the Tutsi's, Hotel Rwanda has gotten decidedly mixed reviews. Before seeing the film, I was a little surprised since such subject matter alone is usually powerful enough to lead a film to critical acclaim. After seeing the film, though, I was incredibly surprised, as this is one of the most powerful and harrowing films I've seen in a year. It moved me in a way most films fail to do.Documenting a sadly little known event from just a mere decade ago, when nearly a million Rwandans were killed brutally with machetes and other weapons in the short time span of two months, everything within the film works. It never becomes manipulative or sentimental, always letting the emotions flow naturally. It also never becomes a blood fest, instead letting the majority of the violence be seen in small glimpses. It is an effective strategy that actually shocks more than any amount of hacked limbs and bloodied faces could.However, the film does become a wagging finger at those around the world that did not do enough, or anything. Yet, it does not blame without a purpose. This is a film that urges it's viewer not only to look back at history and have a reaction, but to look at today and forward into the future and to seek out the injustices that occur now so that perhaps those in need will not become abandoned again. For example, in Somalia the 'G' word has been brought up for atrocities occurring to this very day.Then there is Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle. Simply put, Cheadle becomes his character, never going for the showy theatrical bits that will look good in a 30-second clip. Rather, he embodies the spirit of a true honest-to-God hero. The actual Rusesabagina helped on the set of Hotel Rwanda, and the touch of honesty that would have come from the real Paul is evident on screen and in Cheadle's presentation. Ultimately, Rusesabagina is a name as worthy as Oskar Schindler.Ignoring the built in power of the subject matter, though, Hotel Rwanda is a work of cinema and art on its own merits too. I first began to realize I was in for more than a Discovery channel special in an early scene before the genocide, as lightening brightens the sky at intermittent points. It is a brilliant way to foreshadow the coming storm Rwanda is about to face. Rusesabagina himself is a Hutu, but his wife and many of his friends are Tutsi, and as Rusesabagina and some friends are talking about the looming danger on the horizon as Tutsi members have become verbal targets thanks to a local radio station's spreading of propaganda, the brilliant touch of the lightening that is not overused but rather subtly inserted into the background helps create a sense of unease.Ultimately, this is a film that needs to be seen. The Oscar nominations come out tomorrow, January 25th, and I hope this film picks up several nods partly to help it gain more attention in a way the actual event never really did. The film is as powerful as Schindler's List but still unique in its own right, helping to illuminate a terrifying but little known event. Hotel Rwanda is testament that there is always a reason to stand up against humanity's greatest flaws, and that those who turn their backs can be just as dangerous as the ones who carry the bloody machetes down into their local neighborhoods.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Some true stories like most never make it on the screens. Fortunately for Paul Rusesabagina's (played by Don Cheadle) story it does make to become one of the best movies ever.,"In 1993, ethnic tensions heightened in Rwanda due to the Melchior Ndadaye (ones popular Hutu President of Burundi) assassination, it was a common knowledge as to who could be responsible. The conflict between the Tutsi's and Hutu's takes a down turn after when Rwandan President Habyalimana and Burundi's new President, Cyprien Ntaryamira's are also assassinated when returning from meetings with Tutsi rebels despite hopes and efforts by United Nations to preserve a very fragile peaceful political climate. The death of these two presidents became the catalyst for a genocidal onslaught that killed an estimated one million of Tutsi civilians and some Hutu civilian who were considered as moderates or as ""cockroaches"" by the Hutu rebels. During this chaotic killings by militiamen wilding guns, grenades, machetes and clubs does one man's extraordinary courage and love for his fellow human being takes stage in perhaps the most heart pounding ""must see"" movies of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Watered-down violence made it less effective,"It's rare to complain about such things, but Hotel Rwanda wasn't violent enough to get the full point across. Someone like Spielberg with his knack for ultra-realistic violence could have done a better job. When you feel like you're watching something real it hits you on a deeper level. There's a lot more to it than gratuitous bloodshed. The unnerving chaos of Africa was displayed much better in ""Blackhawk Down.""This was a case where filtered gore robbed the movie of the outrage one should feel. There were only a few serious cringe-inducing scenes and I expected the whole movie to stay at that level. There was definite unease throughout, but it wasn't quite edgy enough.I think some rave reviews describe what the move could have been and the importance of its theme, not what it actually was. I disagree with those who say the reason for the conflict wasn't explained well enough. It was just a type of gang vengeance and us vs. them, like so many other wars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Who says you have to see the violence to feel its power ?,"I had wanted to see this film from the moment I saw a snippet about it on BBC America. It was so powerful. It is difficult to talk about a film like this and use terms like what a great movie etc.. since it is about such a horrific event and a movie is a form of entertainment. I was caught up in the film right from the start, Don Cheadle made this role his own, every scene that he was in showed another angle another side of a man torn by so many things from what he knew to be right to what he knew in order to survive. It was his eyes that riveted me, each and every thought that he had as Paul was mirrored there - he was a man torn between so many things whether to just concern himself with his family or include his neighbors or the plight of strangers as well. I was so impressed also with the way he carried himself with such quiet dignity even while you knew that inside he must have been seething. He moved with such grace like a ballet dancer, even his fingers as they moved carried expression. I have always liked Mr. Cheadle in movies from his crazy turn in Devil in a Blue Dress to his great Brit part in Ocean's 11 and 12 but here he showed that he is by no means a lightweight. I can only hope that he has the opportunity to bring more of this talent to the screen. The rest of the cast was also superb, poor Nick Nolte always so powerful and breaking the rules and yet here unable to be a total rebel. You won't be disappointed with this film but you may walk out wondering how you could have helped, I know I did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good Film With a Strong Story,"Hotel Rwanda is quite a strong story due to the uniqueness of location and topic, as well as the emotionality that is penned into it. I found though, that although the story is very strong and so is Don Cheadle, the rest of the film is not all that it is cracked up to be. Many people like to focus on the good parts of this film (of which there are many), but one must not be so quick to overrate it.Don Cheadle's performance is very convincing and engaging, and as in most of Don Cheadle's roles, he is able to acquire an accent and a whole different method of acting for each role that he takes. He is truly a diverse actor that deserves much credit (and awards) for this performance. However, Nick Nolte plays an aging military man and throughout the film you cannot help but note that the Colonel is weakly portrayed and Nolte acts quite poorly. I have never seen the portrayal of such a military man being so unintentionally weak and sheepish, yet at the same time the attempt to make him seem soldierly. Either Nick Nolte's acting is bad, or Terry George doesn't know what he wants out of the Colonel.Which leads me to elaborate that the film was poorly directed. George, for whatever reason, focuses away from the action of the film (the riots and war in Kingali) to the hectic scene at the Hotel, when it is quite obvious that any viewer after hearing all these reports about warfare on the streets would like to see more than is shown. One could say George is tantalizing us with action, but I am afraid that the action seemingly doesn't exist as it should in this film. The film had endless potential to show the depravity of genocide and war in an active and engaging way, but in the end George focuses on a passive portrayal -- with which I would have had no problems by itself, but it becomes quite unsavory.Furthermore, George also throws inappropriate scenes at inappropriate times, and sometimes the vocal narratives on the radio which are meant to be threatening and scary seem to be comical due to the selection of words. Scenes that bring you in one direction (towards something riveting and compelling) often leave you unfulfilled. George also does not drive home the messages as hard as he could have, and by the end of the film, one can scarcely remember many of the messages that George wanted to drive home, being that one is quite exhausted with the puzzle of plot that George assembles.Overall, it was a good film, but certainly not without flaw. It could have been a much better film had there been a different style of directing (or, in short, a different director).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Movie with a message,"Like most ethnic conflicts around the world, the divisions in Rwanda between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis have long antecedents, in this case the invasion of the Rwanda highlands by the Tutsis from Ethiopia in the 15th century. However, it was Belgium - who ruled the country under a UN mandate from 1918 to 1961 - who institutionalised the discrimination by favouring Tutsis and introducing identity cards which specified the holders ethnic group. The spark which lit the tinder was the shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu President on 6 April 1994. In the next 100 days, there was a ferocious outbreak of genocide orchestrated by the Interahamwe militia and sanctioned by the Hutu government in which around 800,000 mostly Tutsis were massacred while the world community failed to intervene. A decade later, a kind of collective guilt sees the release of no less than four films about these events, the most high profile being ""Hotel Rwanda"" which garnered three Academy Award nominations.Portraying death on this scale in a work of 'entertainment' almost demands that we observe the savagery through the prism of selected individuals and, in this case, Irish writer and director Terry George has chosen to use the real-life experience of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina and his family. Rwanda is often called 'Le pays des Milles Collines' (the Land of a Thousand Hills) and Paul worked at the Sabena-owned Hotel des Mille Collines, a four-star establishment in the capital of Kigali. A well-educated Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi and had three young children, so he was geographically and ethnically at the heart of the madness. Like a kind of Oskar Schindler, he used a mixture of simple bribery and his sharp wits, together with charm and even obsequiousness, to create a haven in the horror that enabled 1,268 mainly Tutsis to survive.America actor Don Cheadle, who played a cockney fool in ""Ocean's Eleven"" & ""Ocean's Twelve"", gives a powerful and textured performance here which marks him out as someone who is going to become an A-list star, while able British actress Sophie Okonedo is his wife Tatiana (Tutsis are lighter-skinned and finer-featured), and it is such a change to see the leading roles in a movie taken by black actors. The fear and powerlessness of the hotel occupants - over a thousand men, women and children crammed into a 113-room establishment - is well created and sustained. The settings are very realistic, being largely shot in Johannesburg, and most of the technical and support crew were African. The focus of the action is the hotel itself and the violence is deliberately understated and left largely to the imagination.While one does not wish to see killing portrayed gratuitously, this artistic decision runs the risk that a largely ignorant western audience fails to appreciate the true nature and scale of this machete-fuelled rampage of rape and murder but, this reservation aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an important and worthy work that should serve as a political warning of the price of international inaction in the face of ethnic conflict. Paul Rusesabagina, now lives in Belgium with his family, and recently told the US ""People"" magazine: ""What happened in Rwanada is now happening in Darfur, in the Congo, in all of these places they are butchering innocent civilians. It is high time we know that a human life in Africa is as important as a human life in the west.""",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Powerful 'Rwanda' sends sobering message,"Some films hold importance because they shed light on a world that most of us will never know or comprehend fully. ""Hotel Rwanda,"" the true story of a hotel manager who saved the lives of 1,268 men, women and children in Kigali, Rwanda in April of 1994, is the most important film of 2004.A decade ago, the African nation of Rwanda became a place of mass genocide. The two dominant tribes, the darker skinned Hutus and lighter skinned Tutsis, began a civil war. After 100 days of fighting and over a million casualties, the U.N. finally interceded.We follow the story of Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed by the excellent Don Cheadle, who has never troubled himself with the affairs of the people. He is a businessman and manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, the most luxurious hotel in Rwanda. Over the years, he has become friends with important people by providing cigars and expensive Scotch in meetings with them.However, Paul's world goes from heaven to hell when the civil war begins. The Hutu militia walks the streets killing any Tutsi they can find, including helpless children. The militia wants to kill every Tutsi to wipe the slate clean of their kind.Paul himself is a Hutu, but his wife is a Tutsi and his three children are mixed. The welfare of his family is his priority throughout the film. In addition, Paul helps other refugees by housing them in the hotel and bribing the Rwandan army (who has sided with the Hutu militia) with money, beer and other items to protect the hotel.Some have hailed the film as an African ""Schindler's List."" This is right in the aspect of a heroic businessman protecting innocent people from their death. However, ""Schindler's List"" is better-made film because of the unflinching portrayal of the Holocaust and Steven Spielberg's powerful direction.""Hotel Rwanda's"" only major flaw is toning down the violence to make this a family oriented piece. Director Terry George cleaned the image of war up so the film could receive a more commercial PG-13 rating.Still, even though the violence is not accurately portrayed, the film is simultaneously haunting and heartbreaking. In one scene, Paul and an associate drive down a foggy and unusually bumpy road, only to stop the car and realize they are actually running over hundreds of dead bodies. It's a scene that will stay with you for weeks.One key factor that makes the film work is Cheadle's performance. It has been nominated for an Academy Award because it is flawless and Cheadle has never been better. We really believe Paul's plight because of Cheadle's perfect Rwandan accent and ability to convey conflicted emotions.Also worth noting is Sophie Okenedo who plays Paul's wife Tatiana. Okenedo has been doing small television roles for most of her career, but after this film, it wouldn't be surprising to see her more often on the big screen.Although ""Hotel Rwanda"" sometimes has an overly sentimental feel to it, it still succeeds in commemorating Paul Rusesabagina and shaming the world for not helping stop man's inhumanity toward man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Welcome to the wonderful world of European colonization.,"Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Congo, Sudan, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia - and Rwanda...what do all of these African counties have in common? They're countries torn apart by civil war, where millions have been slaughtered and millions more have been maimed, raped, beaten, tortured, threatened, displaced, and, most importantly, ignored by the rest of the world. And the main reason for the nightmare that Africa has become? Europe colonized Africa and divided it along new territorial lines, splitting tribes and clans into pieces, and forcing rivals and foreigners into the same territories. The entire Rwandan genocide is namely due to the Belgians, who basically handpicked certain Rwandans and called them Hutus, and called the others Tutsis, all arbitrarily, then left the country and power to the Hutus, creating a power struggle between two 'tribes' who were really the SAME PEOPLE.In the end you have Hutus and Tutsis at war, even though there is absolutely no difference between them save a name granted by their Belgian 'lords', and power unilaterally granted by uncaring and abandoning colonizers. I just watched the Shake Hands With The Devil documentary on Radio-Canada tonight, and one thing that astounded me was the footage, at the 10th anniversary conference on the Rwandan genocide, of a personal attack by the Belgian senatorial representative, on Dallaire, because of Belgian casualties within the UN peacekeeping corps. I think that this is the perfect example of where the Western priorities lie.Everyone in North America and Western Europe needs to see Hotel Rwanda. Only through this kind of film can we actually learn about and feel the sort of terror that exists in a land where death can come to someone simply because they're unfortunate enough to be branded with a colonial name that divides them from the Powers That Be. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don Cheadle...Finally will get his calling. Wow!,"As one who feels that there is ""no best performance"" for the Oscars but rather, everyone who is nominated is a ""best performance"". How can you possibly compare any one performance against another when the movies and stories are totally different. We loved many movies this year and feel they are worthy of nominations. We have already been rewarded by seeing that Natalie Portman and Clive Owens were honored by the foreign Press for a movie that we loved, but understood some would find it abhorrent. The line is drawn in the sand by Don Cheadle who we have always liked in every role he has played. He has been relegated the usual stereotypical roles for Black actors and it must be frustrating for him and the handful of very talented black actors and actresses who just don't get the great roles. Don Cheadle sets himself apart from every single actor in any movie of 2004. It is done by simply providing the best acting role in a movie about ""real events"". It makes us all ashamed of the fact that we were frozen to the TV watching OJ Simpson at the time that all of this took place. What a disgrace to us. As usual the world stood still and did nothing as in the Holocaust and the few other cases of genocide. The French true to their colors did nothing when they could have and should been first on the site. The English and Americans turned their backs as did the UN. Cheadle brings us to tears and cheers in this fascinating story of ""one man"" who defies the odds against genocide of his own people. He is an outstanding actor and he surely deserves not only the nomination but the win as well. True, Leo was great as Hughes, Sideways is still something I cannot understand as to what the hub bub is about, Clint and Morgan were superb in Million Dollar baby, but none come close to Cheadle in this spectacular role of a lifetime.

"A good movie, yet ....","To keep it short: What really turned me down was that the makers of this movie or maybe rather the writer of the script didn't have the courage to focus on the events of the genocide in rwanda as such. Why couldn't they just try and show the mere barbarism of what really happened. Like the catholic church of rwanda got involved in massacres, like last days neighbors became murders over night - and the dimensions of the genocide itself which were unseen of since the shoa. 800'000 to 1 million people slaughtered within 3 months, for the greater part with machetes and other tools - very little of this does shine through the almost romantic story of a brave and pure man. Sometimes I think that such stories rather use events like the rwanda genocide for a historical background only: The main story seems to be this of heroism where in fact a mass killing among neighbours was going on in rwanda. what fits this picture is the way the rebels of the rlf are glorified in the end of the film. in fact, after they had kicked out parts of the hutu murder gangs, they started intense killing based on racist projections too. it is still unknown among historians how many the killed then, but figures may go up very, very high. But as I said - maybe the actual events aren't that important for hero-movies like this. What I liked about the film was the role of the u.n. and the post-colonialist governments as portrayed in ""hotel rwanda"": in fact the international community witnessed over months the mass murder.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I couldn't stop crying,"I almost didn't go see this movie. It's so hard for me to sit through things like this. It is very, very good, but you can only see it once if you have a heart or a soul. You can only go through the experience one time because you can't do it again, at least I can't. Don Cheadle was exceptional. Nick Nolte and Jaoquin Phoenix had very difficult roles. I was also happy to see Jean Reno has the hotel president. The good people anguished and the bad people schemed. The woman who played Don Cheadle's wife was also very good I really felt her fear.

10/10 from its message   6/10 for the movie itself...   a bit over-hyped.,"Hotel Rwanda is an excellent story, and the movie certainly deserves perfect scores on it's message and the topic at hand. The problem with this movie is a bit on how it's done. I understand the direction the movie was going with light on the gore and rather on the story but I felt it just left a bit too much out, as we know close to a million people where killed, although we really never get that feeling watching the movie. The great movie ""passion of the Christ"" uses extreme gore to drive home a point, and perhaps tell a story like it really is not so that we don't turn off some viewers. I think this is exactly the point, Mel Gibson figures if you can't watch this movie (Understand how awful it is) but yet refuse to accept it you refuse to really accept the truth, the same could be said with Rwanda and the current tragic events we have currently in Africa.The acting here is top notch, and I can see the nod for best actor nomination but the movie is a bit too ""Hollywood"", there's too much music matching the moment and it feel's unrealistic & typical, any experienced movie watcher will get upset with this style. In conclusion, I wish this was done again.. to think of it, we will have another chance, someone will show the horrors in Dufur in a Hollywood production I just hope next time there won't be music playing when the main actor is running to his family, lets get it done right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"He Made the Difference In a Country of Poor Black People Without Oil, Gold or Diamonds","In 1994, the world was surprised by the images on TV of the genocide of the Tutsis by the Hutus in Rwanda. Nevertheless genocide was happening in Africa, the West ignored and turned back any sort of support to this poor black people, inclusive USA opposed in the security council of UN to any type of help.""Hotel Rwanda"" rescues, through an overwhelming and awesome movie, the life of one anonymous hero called Paul Rusesabagina, performed by Don Cheadle in his best role along his career. This simple hotel manager of a four stars hotel sheltered 1268 Tutsis and Hutus refugees in the Milles Collines Hotel of Kigali, and with his common sense and courage, saved the life of these people. When the genocide finished in July 1994, there were a million dead bodies left in Rwanda. The Tutsi rebels forced the Hutu army and the Interhamwe militia to move to Congo.It is amazing that it has taken ten years to see this powerful contemporary drama on the big screen, when we see dozens of Holocaust movies as if this has been the unique slaughter of a race in the recent history. As far as I remember, this is the first movie that I see showing, in a sensitive and full of love and hope way, the misery of this people, which the world turned back maybe because they do not have oil, gold or diamonds in their poor country.

"Why should we care, if we don't get any money out of it?","The conflict in Rwanda didn't matter much to most Westerners, although one million people might have been killed.

There have been much more bad feelings about white people killed in the tsunami, when about the locals.""Hotel Rwanda"" definitely makes you think about that. You also come to think about the fact that this country and these people didn't have much business interest to offer West. Why should we give away our tax money to our armies to protect them, if we don't get anything out of it?

Don Cheadle Was Robbed,"I did not see this film before the Academy Awards ceremony. I wonder how many members of the Academy also did not see this film before the ceremony. Cheadle should have won the Oscar. Though fine work was turned in by the other nominees, Cheadle's performance was breathtaking. And heartbreaking.The very few negative reviews I have read will compare this film to Schindler's List, which also deals with genocide. However, the analogy fails because: (1) Oscar Schindler was not a member of the targeted group; (2) The distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was completely arbitrary and artificial; and (3) The West had ""intervened"" in WWII.That distinguishing feature--the West's intervention or lack of it--is doubly ironic: first, it was the West's meddling which had created the problem in Rwanda, both the colonial aspirations and later arming the factions it created. And second, the people we were saving from Hitler were mostly white. No truer words were ever spoken than the line delivered by Nick Nolte's character as an explanation for the lack of concern by the West: ""You're African."" This film was horrifying without being unduly grisly--a remarkable and commendable restraint for a film about a war fought mostly with machetes. And without further explanation (in case you haven't seen the film), I point out there is one particular road trip in this film as chilling as anything in horror films.After about ten minutes into this film, I was thinking, maybe 8/10.

"""Hotel Rwanda"" is an historical drama.","""Hotel Rwanda"" is an historical drama with good merit.

There is a very intense performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina who does his best to save lives in a tragic situation in Africa. His wive, Tatiana Rusesabagina played by Sophie Okonedo is equally as inspiring in her empathic portrayal. Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, a United Nations Colonel, who is practically impotent in his ability to give aid to an impossible situation. Nolte is a drawback for he seems to read lines without any regard for believability. He fails to convince the audience that he is really a young United Nations military person. This movie is worth seeing for it's historical importance. An epic portrayal is lacking, but the essence remains.

Help me Rwanda,"I just finished watching Hotel Rwanda moments ago. It certainly didn't bore me. And I suppose I should say it was a good movie. But it's really just all part of that greater genre, the misery revolutions do to regular folks. It's something of a Doctor Zhivago in black skin.Still, it had it's contemporary twists. Like when the main character, an hotelier, informs the Hutu five-star general that although the Americans and Europeans may have left for now, they certainly have his name on their list as a war criminal for judgment later. ""That's how these people operate,"" he says. True enough.You should probably give it a squint. But I don't get the premise that the whites are somehow responsible for not stopping the bloodshed. Didn't colonization end a long time ago? Aren't these people responsible for managing their own fate now? And if not, then are we obligated morally to renew occupation? These questions, of course, are not explored.But the end titles do tell us that the hotelier is now happilly living with his extended family in Brussells.

You forget you're in a cinema - you are in Rwanda for those 2 hours.,"Hotel Rwanda The true story of a man who saved over 1000 people (many of them very young children) from slaughter. Close to a million Tutsis died because the west didn't want to risk the lives of 300 of their own - these 300 people who have histories, families, loved ones, blah blah who were so much more important and valuable apparently. Instead of sending in the requested urgent intervention to protect over a million people marked for death, the west washed their hands of these people.Based on the footage I have seen from various documentaries on the genocide, I believe that this film is an entirely accurate portrayal of what happened (except, of course, the language would have been French, not English). Filmed on site in Kigali, the painstaking attention to detail in the film made you realise exactly what it would have felt like to witness the situation unfold right before your eyes. I feel I can understand how it's possible to not see (or believe) something like that is imminent until too late. We all ""have"" these reassurances in the back of our minds that this sort of thing can't happen, that humanity won't let it happen, that someone in power somewhere will make sure this kind of thing won't happen. That surely it's someone's job somewhere to ensure this can't happen.I watched this film with my friend Lucy, who was in Rwanda as an aid worker shortly after the genocide - she's even been to the hotel itself.But what you realise is that, in reality, you really can be abandoned by the world, even if they know FULL WELL what's going to happen to you, even if they know FULL WELL that they'll regret not helping when they should have and be so very ashamed of themselves later. Humans seem to sometimes prefer to be ashamed later than to risk their necks in the now.You forget you're sitting in a cinema - you are in Rwanda for those 2 hours. I felt a whole spectrum of emotions - I was scared, sad, horrified, angry, I felt the tension and relief for the characters at every turn, etc as the scenes unfolded.Lucy said it best - we were both shell-shocked when we came out.

A bit overrated but worth the time to see at least once,"Some people say that this is like the African version of ""Schindler's List"" now I wouldn't go that far, but it still is a fantastic and powerful film. The movie is basically about the Rwandan Genocide that took place in 1994, where many Tutsi are killed by the Hutu extremists. Probably hardly any one cared about this atrocity that didn't have to go through it and I enjoyed the aspects of it showing why. Don Cheadle really was perfect for this role, and he put on a great performance here and it's one of those films he most definitely was worth being in. There is also a deep message, although it isn't a movie I would see multiple times or anything, but it was most definitely worth the time to see it at least once. If I can name one flaws is that you don't really care about the people that are trying to survive from the genocide, but maybe that is just the realistic aspect of it and why the message behind this film is deep.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This Movie Touched My Soul,"Every time I hear someone say there is no real ""good"" or ""evil"" in the world I think of things like Schindler's List, The Killing Fields, The Power of One and similar movies. Hotel Rwanda is now added to my list.This movie stirs the soul with a true story that is engaging, interesting, unspeakably sad, funny at times, and ultimately (for the lead focal family) triumphant. ButI kept asking myself while watching: Am I not related to all these people? Could I ever treat my fellow humans as cockroaches and vermin? How can people think of other people that way? If such a condition can exist in others, can it exist in me? If I saw human depravity around me, how much would I tolerate and wink at before I did something about it? And what WOULD I do about such things? Would I throw my hands up in hopelessness or would I find a way to alleviate pain and suffering? This movie is difficult to watch, yet it is important to watch.

Over rated,"I just saw Hotel Rwanda on PBS, and after reading other reviews here, I must admit I felt let down. It was admittedly well made, but didn't leave any lasting impression. Probably because it was basically an excellent solo show by Don Cheadle. Sophie Okonedo was badly miscast; whoever saw a Tutsi that light-complexioned? Nick Nolte just wasn't believable as a General. Some may criticise me for being too bloodthirsty, but apart from the episode when Cheadle was driving over the bodies in the road, the depiction of the treatment of Tutsi was too long-range and detached. It seemed like a news report viewed from a distance, without any real involvement. This is the story of an horrific episode, but fails to press its point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Food for Thought,"A fantastic film depicting the untold story about what the UN did not do about the genocide that killed nearly 1 million people in Rwanda in 1994. An outstanding performance by Don Cheadle playing a Rwandese international hotel manager, who bought into the story that the UN would not abandon them. As Cheadle comes to understand that he was duped by the rhetoric Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a reporter assigned to cover Rwanda, suggests that the most likely reaction of the western world after watching the horrible footage on the news would be: ""They will say how horrible, and will go on eating their dinner."" The lack of an international intervention force, in a situation when it was truly needed, is one of the main points of this movie. Along the similar lines, I would recommend ""No Man's Land"", about the Balkans war. Food for thought.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The worst good movie I have ever seen,"So I finally get around to seeing Hotel Rwanda. A friend and I had a long standing engagement to get out and see this film however the forces that control these things conspired against that happening and as all movies eventually do, even good ones starring Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda left the theater. My friend and I would have to view something else.As luck and fate would have it, Hollywood studios like to make as much money as they can on any given film and so they released Hotel Rwanda to DVD which allows viewing movies outside of the theater in your own home or place of convenience (forgive me if I am going to fast.) As I have a Netflix account and in that account I have a queue of movies, Hotel Rwanda was sent to me without me having to do anymore than point and/or click. Since it was sent, I felt obligated to watch - a fact that my wife hates by the way - while she has no problem stopping watching films already in progress, I, by some freak genetic mutation, must watch them to their painful end regardless of how long or asinine - much like the South Park episode where Cartman had to finish singing Come Sail Away whenever he heard the beginning of the song . . . but I digress.For those not familiar: Hotel Rwanda stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed over a thousand Tutsis refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda. The audience watches Paul's transformation from a man with style to a man with substance. (see the film - the quote makes more sense then.) So I watched IT - and here you are, dear reader, wondering how IT was. How do you think it was? Of course it was good, fine, Oscar nominated and all that. The story was heartfelt, Cheadle was stellar, impeccably shot. Heck, even the sound was good. And therein lies my problem - the film was all that I expected it to be and thus as I sit here thinking about it, I am terribly bored by it.How horrible! I am an unfeeling boob! He should be gutted and hung in a public square to remind little children on how not to live their lives! And to all of these things I would say yes, yes, and yes again. But that doesn't make Hotel Rwanda any better at entertaining me (a funny side note, the aforementioned friend, myself, and my wife all went to see Amistad one evening and were so bored by the slave trade film that we fell asleep which incensed our more social conscious audience members.) The problem is that Hotel Rwanda is so paint-by-the-numbers Oscar caliber that I wanted terribly for some Sofia Coppola-esquire Godfather 3 performance or some random death to shake me from my stupor. I took to the Internet to see if I was alone in my thoughts. Here are some quotes from the IMDb:larajane says: Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.and this from Julie-Gefter: i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me.and celiaricky loved the movie so much she ""ovated"" the director for 10 minutes - the lucky scoundrel: Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes.So there you have it - Hotel Rwanda was a good movie - a great movie by most accounts - that, I'd be willing to say if 'tweren't based on true facts would have been a nice little HBO original film. Cheadle is greatness - but watch Boogie Nights or Devil in a Blue Dress for a more impressive performance. And to all IMDb readers - I'm sorry I suck.Movie notes: Hotel Rwanda is 121 minutes long and rated PG-13 for brief strong language, Oscar worthy depictions of human atrocities, and disturbing images. Directed by Terry George who has brought you other true life moving experiences such as A Bright Shinning Lie and the second episode of season one of the District. It stars Don Cheadle who is good in everything he does, on and off camera.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"""Schindler's List"" meets ""The Killing Fields"" by way of ""Casablanca"" ; Cheadle's triumphant career best","HOTEL RWANDA (2004) **** Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix. (Dir: Terry George)""Schindler's List"" meets ""The Killing Fields"" by way of ""Casablanca"" ; Cheadle's triumphant career bestWhat would you do if suddenly you found yourself in the oncoming path of a genocide? That is the question that South African Paul Rusesabagina faced ten years ago when the Hutu militia hunted down its Tutsi citizens determined to wipe out these 'cockroaches'.Rusesabagina (played beautifully by Cheadle who deserves an Oscar nomination) is a mild-mannered yet savvy businessman who works as a hotel manager in Rwanda in 1994 who has put on blinders to the unrest in his nation that suddenly sets its all-too-true reality in his neighborhood one night when he witnesses one of his neighbors being dragged bodily from his home by a jeep of Army soldiers and then beaten when he resists. Life as he knows it is now over as this is the tip of iceberg to what events lay in wait.Determined to save his small neighborhood and his family l Rusesabagina maneuvers one of the hotel's van shuttles crammed with his friends and family to the Hotel Demille where he works as a refugee site. Shortly thereafter the hotel is inundated with scores of fleeing Tutsis seeking solace and Paul must then decide what can be done to keep the bloodshed at bay.On hand is the UN soldiers led by Canadian Col. Oliver (a world-weary Nolte doing some fine supporting work) who informs Paul that things are only getting worse for the most part and as predicted the black South Africans will not be rescued leaving the ingenuity and quick thinking of Paul to keep things on track until they manage a form of escape.Director Terry George racks up the suspense and dread without resorting to any truly graphic images of the war at hand and the uprisings depict the machete brandishing hordes at a safe distance yet there is no doubt of just how horrific the proceedings at hand are in some truly unnerving moments including Paul's decision to get supplies in the dead of night when he encounters what he fears the most  that things in fact are only worse than he could have ever imagined.Cheadle, one of our finest and most versatile actors working today, gives his portrayal of a decent, ordinary and extraordinary man that many of us would only aspire to be in the face of death and the threat of violence so thick in the air it would more than likely only cause paralysis to contemplate a next move in a morbid game of chess  a dignity that encompasses the entire film and spread to his co-stars, namely the stoic Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana who also provides some soul and tenderness yet a stern anger fueled turn.Inevitably there are comparisons to ""Schindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" and even ""Casablanca"" yet the film stands alone in its defiance to what mob mentality is about and how prejudice is much deeper than what is on the surface. This is one of the most inspiring, harrowing journeys into fear and is one of the year's very best.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant,"This movie was outright fantastic. Having seen both this film and Ray I felt that Don Cheadle deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture over Jamie Foxx (and, mind you, I think Jamie Foxx did an EXCELLENT job himself). The fact that this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture is outright ridiculous. This important film is very emotional and will leave you wondering what you were doing while all of this was going on. Most of us were watching OJ Simpson's trial.Don Cheadle's emotional performance deserves high praise. The scene where he is arguing with the general in the office of the Hotel Diplomat is his best work overall. I couldn't believe the outright emotion this man put into his strong performance. The death scenes are tear-jerking while abstaining from graphic violence. Death is never glorified in this film. You'll also be amazed by the driving scene by the river.I especially liked the mise-en-scene (did I spell it correctly?) that showed issues of Time Magazine in the background with Bill Clinton's face featured prominently. I don't feel this film bashes Clinton or the United States specifically -- instead it makes us all feel guilty for being blissfully unaware the entire time. The media coverage here in the United States was centered around OJ and 2 deaths while 800,000 were dying elsewhere. While the film never states this, it becomes obvious when one finally realizes what they were watching on TV during this time.This film is a must-see for anyone who was an adult in 1994.

An important film.,"Hotel Rwanda is an important film, it's subject matter is of an extremely serious nature, in a similar to the likes of Schindler's List. It depicts the events of a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, during which Hutu man Paul Rusesabagina shelters the endangered Tutsi civilians from the angry machete-armed Hutus. The film handles it's subject matter very well, telling precisely why these two ""types"" of people, (they are really only different in name, which was given to them by Belgian imperialists based on vague classifications) are not getting along, without being too simple. The film than follows the Schindler's List formula, with Paul trying to shelter as many of the Tutsis that come his way, and hold off the Hutus for as long as possible. The acting, script, score, cinematography etc. are all of a good standard, though nothing really stood out for me (which in this case is a good thing as it enhances the realism). The film should also be praised for challenging the viewers watching, in a line that Jack Daglish's character (the cameraman) says. The film is difficult to watch at times, and works as it's own film very well. It's only major failing is that it may seem a bit samey for those who have seen Schindler's List, or even Lord of War, or any other film with genocide as the subject matter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Phenomenal,"I can't even understand how this movie was not nominated for best picture in this year's Oscars. I can't say for sure until I see The Aviator, but Leonardo DiCaprio's performance better be SPECTACULAR to have beaten Don Cheadle for the Golden Globe (drama). I haven't seen a performance like that in a very long time. He and Sophie Okonedo were both incredible. It was very moving. It's hard to not feel like something is wrong with a world where we can live peacefully in America and people are living that way in Rwanda... still to this day. But as they say in the movie, people will see pictures of the genocide, say, ""how horrible"", and go back to eating dinner....

Rusesabagina's List,"I do not intend to sound sarcastic by my above 'one-line-summary'; for if the real life Paul Rusesabagina, a 'Hutu', did the things he was portrayed to do, to save hundreds of 'Tutsi', then indeed there is a comparison with great people of conscience like Oscar Schindler.The story is that of the infamous 'ethnic cleansing' of minority Tutsi's by their nationalist rivals, the Hutu's. The film also cleverly weaves in the reasons for the deep ethnic hatred between these peoples, by ordinary conversations between locals and European visitors.The violence is not nearly as bad as one might expect. In fact, the actual news reel footage that the world 'witnessed' at the time of this genocide was far, far worse than the movie portrays.The film will rivet you to the screen, as you follow 'Paul' beg, borrow, steal and bribe to save the lives of the 'hotel guests' Well worth seeing, a little bit 'over' on the acting but smartly sensitive to the brutal violence that Hollywood so often turns out, (even in its' jests) just a wee bit to long but,still, a story that need to be told, and more importantly needs to be heard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Powerful Story, Powerful Movie","Watched in 2021. Despite knowing more about Paul Rusesabagina now than we did when this movie came out in 2004, I could still appreciate the film. The content alone tells a powerful (albeit sad) story. Rusesabagina may have gone from hero to zero in some people's eyes since then, but the fact remains that the genocide in Rwanda left roughly a million corpses in its wake and people need to learn about what happened.Poignant and heart-wrenching at times, Hotel Rwanda paints a very raw picture of those tragic times. I watched the movie with a broken heart and dose of white guilt which makes me think the producers and director accomplished their goals.There were a few flaws that kept me from scoring the movie in the upper echelon of 8-10 though. The film rushes into the conflict without enough explanation to set the stage for the viewer. There was a slightly convoluted character spread which could have used more distinction. Plus, I would have liked to learn more about what happened to some of the other characters after the movie ended. All-in-all though, Cheadle puts in a memorable performance and there are some powerful moments that make you hold your breath (and your loved ones) which create this grim, but cinematically satisfactory, look into a dark time in history.Verdict: Watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An outrage,"One can rate movies according to what they bring of ""newness"" to our horizons. For me this movie hasn't added anything and i can only say that to the people this movie was a ""widening"" of some sort, then you must have been asleep before you saw it. The first objective criticism i have to make is that once you have visited Africa you cannot relate to the images in Hotel Rwanda. We see the movie as if we are in a western suburban area and that, i might say, as nothing to do with the feel of Africa. Throughout the film we seem to be taken through a somewhat digestible version of scenarios for western bourgeois audience.Sure enough that the film is talking about a sensitive issue and how the circumstances enforce heroic acts on the part of the main character. But if we go a bit deeper into the portrayal of Rwanda's reality then we find this film has no specific content other than the poor commercialization of conflict, and i would say that's mediatic malady. I'm sure Tutsi survivors may have praised the film as something important. But talking in cinematic terms this film is a hoax. The horror of Rwanda is much more darker on the whole of humanity than this film can show. One would have to film constant panic to get a bit closer.It's not Hollywood made but it is still the same formula. In my opinion: don't watch it! It has the stink of culpabilization on it. I'm sorry for writing such a bad review but i'm just being honest.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Heartbreaking and Powerful Film About  a Sensitive Subject,"I remember viewing many powerful and great movies last year, but something about 'Hotel Rwanda' stuck with me more than a lot of the others. 'Hotel Rwanda' is about the unbelievably sad and horrible incident that shook Rwanda to it's very foundations eleven years ago. It was April 1994 and almost no one could predict how nasty things would turn in a matter of days, and how many lives would be shattered. 'Hotel Rwanda' is the incredibly haunting and mesmerizing true story about one man who saved the life's of many of his fellow men during this period of Genocide and conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi citizens in Rwanda.The story revolves around Paul Russesabegina (played expertly by Don Cheadle), a hotel manager of a four-star resort in Rwanda. Paul's an extremely generous and chivalrous person who gets caught up in a very unsettling situation. Tragedy strikes Rwanda when the Hutu leader of the nation is assassinated by a band of rebel Tutsi forces. The Hutu citizens and government go absolutely crazy and start trying to annihilate all of the Tutsi citizens. After this starts happening all the Americans get rushed out of Rwanda (especially all the non-African hotel managers) and Paul is left to fend for himself and his family and friends in Brutal Rwanda. Paul turns out to be like an African version of Oskar Schindler, and turns his hotel into a refugee camp for the prosecuted Tutsis, including his wife and children who are also Tutsi. Paul is able to accomplish this by his cunningness to trick the Hutu government by not only paying them off, but telling them the American government is watching them through satellites and will charge them as war criminals if they do anything to them. Paul also has the help of a peace officer (played by Nick Nolte), who helps him bribe the Hutu government and try to rush the Tutsi citizens out of Rwanda.Despite a few of the films shortcomings, it's a little overlong and drags during it's third act, it's still an excellent production and showcases some wonderful performances. Don Cheadle gives the best performance of his career as the title character. He gives a powerhouse character embodiment that's riveting all the way through the film. You can tell he really poured his heart into this very crucial role, and he should have won the Oscar over Jamie Foxx (in my opinion). Sophie Okonedo is very impressive as Paul's strong, independent and caring wife. She definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Nick Nolte gives us some of the finest work we've seen in fifteen years. Joaquin Phoenix does a nice job in the role of a photo journalist in Rwanda during this time, and Jean Reno is pretty good as the owner of the hotel Paul manages. The cinematography is interesting, and the screenplay is especially compelling. The directing has it's few flaws, but the musical score is always effective in stirring up emotion.All in all, 'Hotel Rwanda' is definitely worth renting and/or buying on DVD. You can count on me having it in my DVD collection in the not-so-distant future. I think all the U.N. members elected during this time should be forced to watch it and confront their decision not to help out these poor people, especially Bill Clinton.

A Hard-hitting Classic,"This movie is poetry in motion. Creative movie making at it's best. You cannot fault even the minutest aspect of this movie. So perfect is this movie in all respects. Don Cheadle does full justice to his role and his acting is superb. Every frame of this movie is gripping with suspense and thrill as to what fate awaits the helpless victims of the mindless genocide. Once you begin watching this movie it is hard to stop it halfway , and throughout the movie the edge of the seat suspense is maintained.But above all this movie is a triumph of the indefatigable human spirit, a triumph of good over evil, and a triumph of sanity in an atmosphere of madness. All of this is represented in that one man , Paul Rusesabagina. Throughout this movie this man grips our attention. When he cries we cry with him, when he laughs we laugh with him when he worries we worry too. In my opinion, very few movies can lay claim to this rare distinction. There are quite a few very violent and disturbing scenes but when the truth is stranger than fiction, there is no other alternative but to bare that. This movie is based on truth and the truth is quite shocking. It is enough to jolt a man from his nonchalance and stupor. In this context , it is shocking to see how the entire world watched this gruesome drama without lifting a finger to help. The helplessness of the UN , the shocking cowardice of the super powers and above all the failure of entire humanity itself is very movingly shown.But again in this depressing backdrop, the courage of this one man Paul Rusesabagina , his cleverness, his resourcefulness and above all his humaneness contrasts sharply and shouts aloud the message : That the whole world is one , that what a difference a few good men can make. And this voice of sanity will ring loud and clear and cannot be drowned out in the din and stench of the voices of madness.I can write an entire book of praises for this movie and all its aspects and still that wont be enough. I don't want to dissect this movie and kill its charms. But just one line will suffice : A thoroughly watchable movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Just hand the Oscar over to Don Cheadle... go ahead... do it,"Ever since seeing a program on television about the circumstances of the Rwandan genocide, I have become somewhat of a student of the issue. And sure, the Interahamwe didn't kill as many people as the Nazis, or even Pol Pot, but the brutality of slaughtering nearly a million people, most by machete, more than makes up for the numbers. And the abandonment, the sheer disregard for anything African that the West perpetrated on Rwanda, that should make all of us ashamed of our governments.You should see this movie. Everyone should see this movie. Exquisite performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo bring to life the desperation of simply holding on to life with the proverbial barbarians at the gate (right at the gate, as it was), and all while Cheadle's Rusesabagina clings tenaciously to the image and prestige of his hotel, giving his best when everything else falls apart. How the real life Paukl managed to keep it all together, bribe the army, keep the militia at bay is nothing short of a miracle, and the cast brings that to you in such sharp detail that you can't feel anything but the utmost admiration and astonishment for everyone who kept it together.Rusesabagina, General Dallaire, and many others are the true measure of hero. They gave everything they had to make sure that 800,000 didn't turn into millions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Humbling Experience,"For me, Terry George's Hotel Rwanda was easily the best and most memorable movie of 2004. It's difficult to call a movie about a terrible tragedy such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994, but in every aspect, this movie is excellent. Yes, the movie is one of the most upsetting pieces I have ever seen, but this is only an indication of the greatness of the Hotel Rwanda. The actors (especially Cheadle) are so believable in each of their roles, that it does not take long for the audience to take an interest in the main figures, their lives, and the lives of their friends and neighbors. This fact makes the suffering of those who witnessed and fell during the Rwandan massacre both on film and in actuality so much more real.Also, much credit must be given to the director, Terry George. In a film revolving around an incidence of genocide (in which many victims were hacked to death with machetes no less) it would be easy for the story and tragedy to be lost amidst a depiction of the excessive violence that occurred. However, while there is obviously a good share of violence in Hotel Rwanda, George avoids excessive gore and instead relies more on fear to express the suffering of the refugees at Rusesabagina's hotel. George instead shows the aftermath of violence (hundreds of corpses covering a road), the threat of violence, and especially, feelings of alienation and separation (the abandonment of Rwandan refugees by the western world). All these elements really draw the audience in and force the viewers to feel the pain and suffering felt by the refugees.The excellence of Hotel Rwanda also makes it a very humbling movie. It forces those who live in the western world to acknowledge the atrocities that resulted from their countries pretending a massive problem did not exist. Possibly the most depressing fact that Hotel Rwanda asserts is in the last image of the entire movie, where simple white words on a black background remind the audience that nearly a million people died during this period of genocide, a toll that may have been dramatically lessened had the world not turned its back. Thus, in its greatness, the movie is also very shaming, a fitting feeling given the words of Rusesabagina in the movie, ""we must shame them into acting."" More than once I was reduced to tears watching this movie, as were many other members of the (unfortunately) slim audience present in the theater. Truly, this is a movie that all should see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good, but too romanticed","The problem starts when you give third world stories to first world directors and writer. As much as they can try, they will never understand what it feels like. And it's not their fault because they've been way too far from the things that happen in this movie.There is nothing romantic about the war. You don't seat in a terrace having a romantic dinner with your wife while listening to rocket and gun shots half a mile away. That's confusing for the public but I guess that's how Hollywood works. They don't care to explain the story and tell that to the world as closer as they can. They are like UN in this movie: they just don't care about Rwandan people.I hadn't seen this movie before but I was told it would be good because I just saw ""Quo Vadis, Aida?"" which is a new movie about the Serbian genocide in Srebenica (Bosnie).

Hutu- Tutsi war in Rwanda,"Although I visited Rwanda shortly before the war I do not remember 1000 colins hotel in Kigali. Certainly there was a tragedy in this tiny African country where brothers- I do not make any differentiation between tall Tutsi minority and somewhat small Hutu majority - were fighting each other. Probably all this hate started at the time of colonialism when the Tutsi were more favored by the Belgians, and once the country got the independence, a Tutsi kingdom was established with discrimation over Hutu population, which lasted not for long. The Hutu defeated the Tutsi and came to power with a Republic that continued the discrimination this time against Tutsi. In that country was compulsory for everyone to have the ethnic indication in the identity card. The film is only touching the final phase of the war between Tutsi guerrilla who was coming from the North of the country and the Hutu extremists, who were able to kill its own president, as it is shown in the film, just because he signed in Nairobi a peace agreement. In the film one can see how Hutus were killing innocent Tutsi population, and how international community was weakly reacting to this mass assassination. Unfortunately, it did not show how many Hutu families were coming from the North to Kigali. The film finished with the victory of Tutsi, but was it the end of this war? Not at all, Hutu escaped to Goma in the neighboring Congo, and many of them died again in war established between both groups, but no in their land. So if Hollywood makes several sequels of non sense films as ""Terminator"", ""Die Hard"" and others, it would be wise to prepare a sequel of ""Rwanda Hotel"" showing what happened after the Tutsi conquered Kigali, and how this confrontation finished, or perhaps to prepare a similar film of the tragedy in neighboring Burundi, where the same groups are still fighting. Don Cheadle acted very well but somewhat different to the role he played in the film ""Rosewood"". In ""Hotel Rwanda"" he was a Hutu but married to a Tutsi lady and with several children, always looking for peace and understanding.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not terrible, but certainly not great.","The story is inspiring, and the film deserves praise for shining a spotlight on issues that the west chooses to ignore. So, whilst it may seem uncharitable to criticise, it would be patronising to overlook the glaring faults. Even though the film isn't that bad, it is disappointing. The problem is that the film-making is second rate - you can't help but be distracted by the mechanics of the film.The film is overscored. Barely a line of dialogue passes without music telling the audience what they ought to be feeling. This device demeans and patronises the viewer. The blatant product placement throughout the film destroys any attempt at nuance or subtlety. You can't help but pity the actors who have to perform awful dialogue about beer brands or car manufacturers. Even when they are not forced to read dialogue that might as well have come from an infomercial, the dialogue is clunky - and at times woeful. The result is a stack of poorly developed, two- dimensional characters.Social/ political/ historical complexities are either ignored our disposed of in one line. The Hutus are largely portrayed as soulless killing machines pitted against our 'western-friendly' bourgeois hero (the only good Hutu), his family, and periphery characters. The result is that scenes start to feel more like a horror movie than a serious drama. Inexplicably, the filmmakers deliberately chose to omit actual events (possibly to ensure a PG-13 certificate), which would have given the film a greater sense of jeopardy for main characters.It's a credit to the actors involved that some of them manage to feel in any way human. Particular credit is due to Sophie Okonedo who is required to make ridiculous mood swings feel believable. Joaquin Phoenix also does well.Not terrible, but certainly not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hotel Rwanda, full of great shots and full of propaganda","The film itself has great acting and a ""true story"" plot line. The problem with the film is the story's failure to give any insight and truth to the actual problems in Rwanda.Besides the fact that the problems are still rancid today, viewers love to sit back and find comfort that there was at least one good man in that time or turmoil, which still occurs on a violent and deadly basis.I imagine those who typically watch the film find it sad, inspirational and patriotic on some level. Though the film does nothing but deliver a false ""reality"" and applied ideology of a region and its people.The following is a""A truly ""investigative"" journalist might hack through the propaganda of Hotel Rwanda to get to United Artists parent company Metro Goldwyn Meyer, whose directors, not surprisingly, given what the film does not tell you about the U.S.-sponsored invasion of Rwanda (19901994), include current United Technologies director and U.S. General (Ret.) Alexander Haig. Recall that ""I'm in charge here"" Al Haig served under a Hollywood actor named Ronald Reagan. Hotel Rwanda took off from the now celebrated but wholly mythologized book We Regret To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed by Philip Gourevitch, the New Yorker's premier Africanist, and whose brother-in-law, Jamie Rubin, was Madeleine Albright's leading man.

Hotel Rwanda honors a man who made a difference,"A decade ago, the country of Rwanda underwent a costly civil war which claimed countless lives while a whole world stood by. In the true story of Hotel Rwanda, one ordinary man took it upon himself to save as many people as he could even risking his own life and the lives of his family.This hotel is a luxurious venue for travelers (mostly white) to spend a pleasant trip while attended to by the staff and its manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle). Ominous signs in the news and rumors point to growing hostilities between two ethnic groups, the minority and former ruling group of Tutsis and the majority group of Hutus. A militaristic movement among the Hutus begins to form even as an impending peace treaty is brokered. When one leader is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. This is civil war at its worst as the Hutus begins to attack and kill the Tutsis en masse. It is the beginning of a genocide that will claim close to a million lives as the United Nations does relatively little to intervene.As the white guests are escorted to safety by United Nations troops, things grow desperate for those left behind. Paul starts to shelter a few people including his own family and then more refugees until over 1200 fearful souls seek safety in the hotel. In some instances, it is out of necessity that he take in people who have nowhere to go. Pretty soon he realizes that he must do all he can to save his people and himself. This means calling on favors and relationships with any and all who can help, and frequently it means the difference between life and death. There are numerous occasions where the military is ready to take the refugees away or execute them and Paul on the spot. There is stark evidence of the increasing atrocities as homes are burned and bodies litter the roads. Bribes and supplies begin to run short, and as the outnumbered UN forces return to escort only a limited number to safety, the rebels begin to descend on them and the hotel.As a shameful, cautionary tale of what happened when the world ignored its most needy, Hotel Rwanda serves its purpose, but the main thrust of the story is the love Paul has for his wife and children and the determination to save them. The important thing is how he responds to the horrific events and how he must think his way out of seemingly impossible situations. It is truly remarkable how resourceful the real Paul Rusesabagina was in staving off doom.As portrayed by Don Cheadle, we understand his thought processes and feel his pain. He never loses his humanity and compassion for his fellow man. It is a splendid job of acting. Ironically, Cheadle (who was not considered box office leading material by the studios) has leaped into the forefront of leading men for good after having spent most of his career in strong supporting parts (Bulworth, Oceans 11, Out of Sight). Sophie Okonedo is quite good as the wife who must fight for her family and support her beleaguered husband. Nick Nolte plays a recurring part as a UN officer whose units of soldiers are virtually powerless to help. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role as a news cameraman witnessing the beginning slaughter and Jean Reno has a good cameo as a hotel executive in France who proves to be a valuable ally.Although, there was initial difficulty in securing financing for this project, director Terry George (who also wrote the screenplay with Keir Pearson) does not seem to have skimped on his visuals. The massive crowd scenes and evidence of mass execution are thorough and impressive. It is as if we are living a real life documentary about war. He does a nice job of contrasting the chaos in the countryside with the peaceful, relative calm inside the hotel. He also manages to balance the tension and terror with a few effective moments of honest humor especially with Paul's family-quite a feat.While there are obvious similarities in theme to Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda's protagonist is not only the benefactor, but he becomes a potential victim, thus raising the stakes. Even with a PG-13 rating compared to Schindler's R rating, this is no less compelling history and the events no less despicable. George does not have the directorial flourishes of Spielberg, but his film succeeds on an emotional level.Although the subject matter may cause potential audiences to pause, those who want an intelligent, honest depiction of one man's remarkable acts of heroism amid an unthinkable tragedy will not be disappointed. It is a courageous film that teaches the audience about individual responsibility and choice. It is about one man making a difference for over a thousand of his countrymen amid the horror and chaos even as the world turned its back.**** out of **** (every bit as good as the five Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2004)",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Paul Rusesabagina is Oskar Schindler,"I rented Hotel Rwanda, with great expectations for this film. Getting an 8.5 on IMDb and with 3 nominations, who who wouldn't want to see it? After I watched the film, I was pleased with what I saw. Don Cheadle played a wonderful performance as Paul Rusesabagina which earned Cheadle an Oscar nomination. The whole film actually reminded me of Schindler's List. The film is almost an identical twin of Schindler's List. Paul Rusesabagina is an Oskar Schindler type person. There the same people. The only thing different them is that there from different countries and are a different race. That's it. Overall, I liked Hotel Rwanda and I wasn't disappointed with the movie at all.

"Interesting subject, but laid on way too thick","A fascinating story, and a subject that I'm pleased to have learned slightly more (ie. something) about: the Rwandan civil war and genocide of the mid-nineties, and how it was played down and ignored by the West.The central performance by Don Cheadle is strong and his character likable and understandable. However, most of the characters were barely developed at all. An awful lot of story is crammed in, and most of it is only lightly brushed over - I think it would have worked better if some elements were left out and the remaining ones covered in more depth. Worse, the tone of the film started very well, but became increasingly syrupy as it went on.

While Paul's (Don Cheadle) situation continues to get worse as the movie progresses just like Adrien Brody, he does whatever he can to help the Tutsi and Hutu refugees at his hotel. Cheadle is gripping - this from a man who has played a wide range of roles from a porn star with an identity crisis in Boogie Nights to Sammy Davis Jr. in the Rat Pack - and he supplements the troubling story of the country's civil war and genocide with a flawless performance. I immediately wanted to research the Rwanda situation after I saw the movie to learn more than the little I already knew - it truly was a war fought for outrageous reasons, and the ignorance of the rest of the world (something the movie did well to convey) at that time is hard to imagine.

disgustingly overrated,"I saw this movie with high expectations-- the media and classmates all gushed about how wonderful and powerful and moving it was. Well, it wasn't. I felt guilty the whole time I was watching it, because I didn't ""feel"" anything. In fact I found it to be a pretty boring/sterile film save for the moment in the middle where the hotel owner walks in the foggy cloud among dead bodies. I can't believe that this was supposed to be about the real, devastating events that actually happened in Rwanda. I bet most of people who gave this movie rave reviews are just compensating for their previous ignorance and apathy. It's a mediocre, shallow movie parading itself as a powerful film about the great feat of a man standing up for humanity and protecting refugees during a time of ethnic genocide. Instead of wasting your time with this pathetic attempt, look up the subject and read the literature instead.

Loved the movie and the fact that its conscience building,"I thought it was great and it did make me cry and that's saying something.I don't want to repeat what others have said, but I do love the fact that movies like this one help raise awareness of the terrible consequences our actions can have so that hopefully we may make wiser decisions in the future.Another movie that I would recommend for everyone who has watched this one would be Voces Inocentes from Luis Mandoki. This is another recent release and though I believe there is no distributor yet for the US, you should try to see it if you can. I left the theatre feeling many of the same things I felt when I saw Hotel Rwanda, but I was more sympathetic towards Voces because it portrayed war through the eyes of an innocent boy like I had never seen done before. The comic relief was also well-performed and timely.Two great movies that deserve our praise and to be watched by as many people as possible. Frankly, it seems that the people who should be watching it the most, aren't.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The most important film of 2004,"When referring to ""genocide"", the average American would automatically correlate the word to the Holocaust. However, it's amazing to think that the Western nations allowed another genocide to occur that could have been so easily prevented. I would find it hard to believe if 5% of the American population knew that a million Africans died in Rwanda. However, it's that fact that makes the desperation and isolation of the primary characters in this film seem so terrifying and heart-wrenching to the viewer. If for no other reason, but to awaken Westerners to the genocide in Africa this film would have served great purpose.However, the brave story within the story is what separates the film form simply a tragic historical piece into one of the best films of the year. Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo provide depth and believability to rich characters wrought with unconceivable choices and bravery. It is a great story of survival and you should leave the film feeling guilty why you didn't know why you know this was happening and why Western leaders didn't stop it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
There's always room,"Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Graphic Reminder in Hotel Rwanda,"Don Cheadle stars in this emotionally heartrending depiction of when the world turned its back on Rwanda when its innocent civilians cried out for help. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of the five-star Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali. In 1994, Hutu extremists took over the country wanting to terminate all of the Tutsi people. With most of the world unconcerned and unsympathetic, and U.N. peace-keepers ineffective, the Hutu's had a green-light to slaughter more than one-million Tutsi's.Paul is married to a Tutsi (played by Actress Sophie Okonedo) and decided to allow Tutsi refugees to live in the hotel; holding off the soldiers with bribes such as wine. But bribery only works for some time as his wine reserves begin to run dry and he is forced to make hard decisions and take a stand to save not only the Tutsi people, but also his half-Tutsi family.Hotel Rwanda is a very important movie that shows how senseless religious and cultural hatred could result in the decimation of so many innocent lives. It also demonstrates how little the world truly cared about this little country and it's Cival War, as one character put it: ""If people see this footage, they'll go, 'Oh my God! Thats horrible!"" then go on eating their dinner."" During some scenes, the movie is raw and violent, but it's true eminence and heart comes from the emotional struggle Paul has to endure to save the people he loves and the people he has developed bonds with. Hotel Rwanda is a powerful movie with a throat-clenching, underlying message of what happens when humanity is lost in the harshness of war, and reclaimed in one person's quest to ask why.-Rawan Aqil",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well Acted Film for the strong of heart,"This film is a documentary of man's inhumanity to man and is a very disturbing film. Don Cheadle is very good in his part and is certainly worthy of nomination for an Academy Award, although I do not think his performance is as good as Leonard DeCaprio in the Aviator or Jamie Foxx who was Ray in the movie of the same name. The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this film but if you do you will be richly rewarded. We need more of the fine writing that is done in this film Hotel Rwanda. Go see this one you will be richly rewarded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
African Schindler's List,"I finally saw ""Hotel Rwanda"" after reading recent news of the arrest of Paul Rusesabagina, who is portrayed in the movie as an Oskar Schindler-esque hero by the Oscar-nominated Don Cheadle. As with many based-on-a-true-story features, I did some internet reading to see what others said of its historical accuracy or lack thereof, but that rabbit hole only led to more confusing controversy. Ultimately, it's not my place to weight in on such matters, anyways, as surely I don't know enough about the Rwandan genocide, let alone Rusesabagina's part in events, to comment informatively. I bring this up because, ultimately, in any such narrative cinema, we are not only watching a limited perspective of someone's story (in this case, that of Rusesabagina), but we're also seeing it as filtered by the cinematics brought by the filmmakers. A sort of cinematic colonization of history is troublesome enough, but the screen representation only becomes more dubious in the manufacturing of that history for mainstream, Western appeal. Given that the real-life narrative was neglected in the rest of the world, it becomes all the more disheartening that this becomes the primary way many of us come to learn or care about such tragedy.It's not only because the story involves a man from the other tribe leaning on his connections with the powers that be to save over a thousand people from a holocaust that Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" resembles a limited variation on Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" (1993). There's a system of cinematic conventions and audience appeals to mold the narrative around. With the focus on Rusesabagina, larger context is provided by radio and TV reports he witnesses and, as in Spielberg's film, by his relationship with military men and mass murderers. Instead of Schindler on horseback witnessing the massacre at the Plaszów concentration camp, there's Rusesabagina falling over a mass of corpses dotting a road in Kigali. We see both pay to save the lives of others and continue their businesses as a facade to conceal their makeshift refugee camps. It's emotionally effective dramatization, to be sure, and Cheadle is fine--certainly by comparison to Nick Nolte's overacting and Joaquin Phoenix's white-guilt pathos--but when the racism is reduced to an arbitrary artifact of colonial categorization and the ethnic cleansing deriving from no more apparent reason than a presidential assassination and that the radio stirred up racist parades and when scenes such as that of the concluding refugee camp are already admittedly sanitized, it doesn't help one to put faith in the rest of the history depicted on screen. One moment, a Hutu woman and a Tutsi woman are friends being hit on at a bar by Phoenix and the next neighbors are slaughtering neighbors with machetes. Yet, regardless of hagiography, Westernization and cinematic obfuscation, ""Hotel Rwanda"" at least brought attention to one of the world's most recent genocides.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Grand Hotel,"Based on the true story of a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the 1994 genocide, 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a glimpse at a sad chapter of modern history seldom told. Often mentioned is the blind eye turned by the outside world to what is happening in Rwanda with a key piece of dialogue coming from lead actor Don Cheadle saying that they need to shame the world into helping out. The film is supported by strong performances from not only Cheadle but also Sophie Okonedo as his strong-willed wife who truly rises above stereotype: she is never once fragile, passive or helpless. Upon initial release, the film attained comparisons to 'Schindler's List' with a similar story of a brave man sheltering others in war, however, such comparisons actually reveal some of 'Hotel Rwanda''s shortfalls. Most notably, Cheadle's Paul is honorable and generous from the get-go compared to Oskar Schindler's who gradually progresses from greedy to selfless. Spielberg's inclusion of seemingly random subplots (like the gun that does not go off) also paint a fuller picture of the Holocaust, whereas 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a far more contained portrait of the genocide. And yet, if not the out-and-out masterpiece that some claim it to be, 'Hotel Rwanda' remains quite an accomplished motion picture with tension frequently felt in the air.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"I am sorry, but I disagree with you all.","I saw Hotel Rwanda last night, 2 years after its release. I had heard a lot about it, and was expecting (as many people said) a new 'Schindler's List'.I am sorry to say that a theme, even when so important and shamefully unspoken as the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, doesn't necessary make a masterpiece.The cinematography was as ugly, televisionized and cake-like as possible; the characters weren't well developed. the movie was fairly acted, nothing more. (except for Sophie Okonedo, she was a real revelation).But most of all, that terrible genocide is barely shown. And it is extremely cleaned up. Bodies here and there. Almost no blood. But the images that came out of that event in 1994 were way different and shocking. There were so many butchered corpses in the rivers that you almost couldn't see the water. They really used machetes to slaughter them. Children did it, under the use of drugs. This movie shows a sugary version of it all, and doesn't make you feel the terror and the horror of these days. By filming it so, this genocide seems almost accepted and closed. It has happened, that's it.It probably made a lot of people feel shame for their ignorance, that is already something. Many probably documented themselves, thank god. Maybe some learned some more about Africa today. But this doesn't make it a good movie.What a disappointment. What a missed occasion.

Powerful and Emotional,"Rwanda. A small country in the heart of Africa. Normal government, normal people, normal country. Until the day everything changed. the year is 1994 and Rwanda has fallen into civil war between the Tutsi and Hutu parties of the country. Caught in the middle is a hotel manager named Paul Rosesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his family.At first Paul tries to help only his family but soon finds himself housing over a thousand Tutsi and Hutu refugees in his luxurious hotel. With the help of camera operator Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) and U.N. officer Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte)he is able to save the people from the rebel army waiting at the gates. But soon Paul along with the refugees must fend for themselves as the foreign troops are evacuated from the capital.The movie is a powerhouse of emotions with accounts of people telling what they witnessed in the town. As the world turned its back, Paul Rosesabagina was able to save 1295 refugees through bribery, blackmail, and favors. Based on the true-life story of the man, the film gives you a sense of civil war and what is currently happening in the Sudan to millions.At some points you truly feel like breaking down and crying as you watch people being hit with machetes in the street and children lying dead on the road side.In my opinion, this is the best film of 2004 and Don Cheadle deserved Best Actor over Jamie Foxx (Ray, 2004) but that's my opinion.Hotel Rwanda.

Powerful,"Powerful movie. 'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie. First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons. In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George. Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"An horrendous, yet ultimately heartening story.  The film doesn't do it justice.","I hate to criticise this film. It's one of those movies you feel you ought to like, because of the subject - Paul Rusesabagina's story needed to be told, a tragic, desperate story, but also a story of remarkable strength.Sadly, it seems that Terry George felt that the story would carry the film on its own. It doesn't. The screenplay is far too earnest - as if Messrs. Keirson and George believed we'd all be incapable of understanding what was going on. The direction is unimaginative (George does not have much experience as a director, and it shows). And both the character and performance of Nick Nolte are dismal.There is a lot of scope for a genuinely vital film here, and it has its moments, but on the whole it comes out as a substantial disappointment. Comparisons with Schindler's List are obvious - and unfortunately, they show this film up for what it is. None of the energy, none of the inspiration, and thus, none of the power of Spielberg's film.If you've been completely unaware of what happened in 1994, Hotel Rwanda is an honest introduction.

The PG-13 rating restricts some of the content but nevertheless its message is effective,"Ten years ago in the country of Rwanda, one million people were brutally murdered in less than three months by opposing forces, and much of the world passed over the events giving them little notice. However one brave man (played in the film by Don Cheadle) granted over 1,000 refugees access to his hotel and helped save their lives.I had heard very mixed reviews on this film. On a UK talk show when it came out overseas one critic called it the next ""Schindler's List,"" and another said it was too tame and ""not scary enough"" to be a great movie.Personally I felt that although the movie was very good, and extremely well acted by Don Cheadle, the PG-13 rating does indeed restrict some of the atrocities that were actually performed. It kind of seems redundant to make such a daring, un-Hollywood film and then rate it PG-13 so more people can go see it and it can bring in more money.At the time, I thought the critic who said it ""wasn't scary enough"" was off her nut, but now I can understand what she was getting at - ""Schindler's List"" really immersed you into the Jews' struggle through its brutal depictions of senseless violence. It hurt to watch.""Hotel Rwanda"" is tamer. It still deals with hundreds of thousands of lost lives, but PG-13 is still PG-13 and it does give the film a lighter edge - an R-rating would have allowed them more freedom to really examine the full extent of the atrocities in Rwanda.Nevertheless, for being restricted to a PG-13 rating it manages to translate its message rather well, and thanks to the lead performance by Don Cheadle it really does have moments of near-greatness. I wouldn't put it on the same level as ""Schindler's List,"" but it's still a haunting reminder of what happened in Rwanda.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not worth the hype.,"This was a decent movie, with a really good story that people need to be aware of, but the screenplay and the technical quality of the movie is quite average, maybe below average.This movie is a joke really, to be considered for awards when you consider it's terrible blue- screen scenes that are nearly Saturday Night Live quality, sets that are so low quality you can almost swear it's the same set that Let's Make a Deal was shot-on earlier in the day. Then there's how the plot is so painfully obvious after the first 10 minutes of blue-screen work. Like the ill-fated UN caravan ""saving"" a list of people that was carrying Don Cheadles family; obviously this was doomed from the beginning! Then you couldn't have the ""Family Jumping off the Roof"" scene that was so ineptly setup.Cheadle, as usual does a terrific job, so what's new? Does this a great movie make? GIVE ME A BREAK. This movie borders on the verge of being a ""B"" movie it has so many problems, but because it's about an important topic everyone is SCARED of giving it a proper review. On a level of topical importance the movie is off-the-charts, but I'm sorry people, that's what documentaries are made for. I give the movie a 7 and not a six because it did do a good job of providing a personal and a national story at the same time, which is usually not done very well with most movies that try to achieve telling a story of such magnitude.

"The darkest of historical moments, told brilliantly","Grim subject matter aside, this is a jewel of a movie which I hope with every fiber of my being you will watch. Compassion, corruption, fear, violence, hate, love, integrity and honor are the highlights of this film. The world stands by while terrible things happen all the time. We have no choice sometimes. We're far away, politically disconnected, we feel powerless. The cognitive dissonance pounds our hearts at times.What chimes in my heart the most about this movie is that this is actually the sole theme of the movie. It is not overpowered by moral preaching, it does coerce you into feeling anything specific, it's purpose is simply to allow you to feel SOMETHING about what is happening; whether it be yesterday, 1994 Rwanda, or today with Syria. It gives you a road map and empowers you. It's incredibly inspiring. Words cannot explain.Sometimes, feeling something is the best you can do. Reflect, learn and try to be one of the good ones. Be a hero in your own little world. You do what you can do be good, at the cost of witnessing certain atrocities and being restricted in what you can do about it. Just do what you can, when you can. (I speak of the protagonist's role and not the world, in this particular situation, the world was most certainly not heroic) And sometimes, when you can do that, you may not know it at the time, but you become something bigger; a real hero. This is a movie about the dignity of fear, of monsters at every turn and above all else, it is a movie to help you define what it is to be a hero, a true real life hero. Not the MARVEL superhero kind, but those kind of people with hearts so big that they make you feel grateful to be human.In the very midst of hell happening on earth, the protagonist, brilliantly brought to life by Don Cheadle, feels the events and makes small decisions. That is all. And you watch him. This movie makes the world feel it. The moment of it. The smallness he feels and the enormity of the world at the same time. You feel it. It's a pure sentiment distilled down to its purest form and that is the very premise of the movie.Bad things happen, we try to be good, we try to be strong, we do what we can and keep our chins up. The beauty of being human is that you decide how to react to the world, in all its contrasting colors and beautiful madness, you too can find honor, valor, humility, integrity -- MEANING -- PURPOSE.What a brilliant shining beacon of light this movie was.... despite being at the same time a grimmest saddest and most harrowing foray into the darkness of the human spirit. All at the same time. A true masterpiece.I must note that the powerlessness I feel after watching this movie is a bit overwhelming, but it has sparked something in me. I am not very political, but my views have now been changed. I suspect the director and writer and actors would be pleased that I feel restless to go out into the world and do something good now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A must watch despite the Hollywood ending.,"Review in short: This is a must watch because of (1) it tells a story every one must know. War, genocide & murder are never too far behind & one must not forget what helping his/her fellow man means (2) the movie is greatly acted & Don Cheadle carries the film with strength.However, the movies falls short in two significant ways:
(1) The pacing. Each semi-feel good moment is interrupted by an instant attack. This movie could have delved deeper into the analysis & not focus on the showing (which it doesn't do much to).(2) The ending. It's just bad. I don't see how having a good ending works.

Solid and quite frightening at times recounting of a desperate situation in 1994 Rwanda.,"One of the more common reactions to have in regards to a tragic, real life event played out on screen is one of great sadness – it's just a reactionary thing that something so horrible is even capable of happening to people who just don't deserve it. Hotel Rwanda is a film that is able to produce these sorts of reactions, but also feelings on a level of suspense and horror as certain scenes and situations play out involving people we have come to be quite fond of. The film is more of a re-telling of certain events than it is a study of anything in particular, although the protagonist of the hour does possess characteristics of great honour and courage at a time of need. In truth, Hotel Rwanda does feel a little bit stagey at times while at others, feels made for television. You do, also, feel as if you're being chastised as a Westerner – that something as horrific as this happened and you let it happen; but the film mostly offers positive vibes.The hotel in Rwanda of which the title refers to is one owned by a certain Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a harmless but rich and quite successful Rwandan living with his harmless and equally rich family. He has a wife named Tatiana (Okonedo) and a few children. He runs a hotel and takes care of his employees as well as his family in good measure. Importing goods and taking care of those that need taking care of are the run of the norm and these things are the most he has to concern himself with. But that is about to change. The film breaks away from this supposedly 'idyillac' set up for a turf-war of sorts between rival tribes, named the Hutu and Tutsi, that goes back many years; although by the mid point, you feel the tribesmen are unconcerned with whatever legacy they're fighting for and just enjoy chopping up some other people, such is the manner in which the history and details of the rivalry is developed.No matter, we're not here for a history lesson from yonder-century; we're here for a history lesson from yonder-decade, 1994 in fact. One thing leads to another and Rusesabagina's hotel quickly becomes Schindler's factory when push, not so much turns to shove, as it does cold-blooded execution by way of machete. Most of the locals not interested in the bloodshed want in, and it's Paul's duty to save as many as possible as the 'guest' list totes up. But can he save all these people and take care of his family? What about supplies? What happens if/when the U.N. pull out? All this occurs as the rest of the world look on, and Canadian U.N. higher-up Colonel Oliver (Nolte) pauses for thought now and again as well as pulling his gun from his holster and waving it around at times of supposed urgency.Paul himself is a Tutsi and the early warning signs occur when he, in the passenger seat of a harmless van transporting him to his home, has a run in with a Hutu before the bulk of the bloodshed has begun. The warning and the hatred is planted in a fairly well done manner and it's all fine because later on, things will get really hairy. Like I said, the film is a re-telling of events more than it is a true study of anything. Paul is established to be this above-ordinary Rwandan living a life that 95% of Rwandans don't have the luxury of living; he has a wife and child and there's a lot of grief before the nice, clean hero is put through a grinder and we're all supposed to go 'Oh No! I hope no harm comes to him!' It's fine, but it's unspectacular and it doesn't really matter if the backdrop is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide; the Holocaust or some made up event a hundred years in the future when aliens come to Earth and enslave us.What the film does do, in some retrospect, is demonstrate what people are willing to do in times of great distress. If Paul is willing to allow people into his hotel for safety and stay behind with the others deemed doomed when certain people have to pull out, then that is that but on the flip side there's a lot of greed in the film; a sense that 'sure, we'll help you out' but always for a price – a sort of 'what's in it for us?' mentality that the film sort of captures. But Hotel Rwanda is a very respectful and, on the broader sense of things, important film that will remind many people in the West of the situation that happened; a Western world that, as the film so very clearly points out, contributed hardly anything to, bar pull their own people out thus saving their own skins. If the film's overall goal was to recount the event that happened at that time then it succeeds and that is worthy enough of certain praise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant.  Reminds you how great movies can be,"Hotel Rwanda engages the viewer in a catastrophe of epic proportions while emphasizing the resilience of human dignity and the tenacity of love. Don Cheadle excels as Paul Rusesabagina, highest-ranking African official at a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Rwanda, who is left to run the place himself when European staff are recalled amid growing social violence. Paul's first concerns are to protect his family and to maintain a high level of service in the hotel. As the killing frenzy grows around him, so do his compassion and pragmatism, and he gradually opens his heart and the hotel's doors, converting luxurious quarters into a refugee camp. Nothing is overdone, and there is no preaching. But as the chaos spreads, turning neighbor against neighbor, the movie develops moral and artistic power. Private scenes are beautiful and convincing.

The Tragedy the World Refuses to Remember,"While America was transfixed by O.J. Simpson and his low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, the worst humanitarian tragedy since WWII was taking place in Rwanda.Don Cheadle excels as the Hutu manager of a Belgian luxury hotel who does whatever is necessary to save as many people as possible while a Hutu militia, largely incited by government radio, engage in an unrelenting slaughter of Rwanda's Tutsi minority.Cheadle and the people he is trying to protect hold out in the hotel protected only by a small contingent of UN troops led by Nick Nolte, whose number one order is to avoid a firefight with the locals. Cheadle effectively balances diplomacy and bribery to keep the Hutu warlords out of the hotel and to buy precious time for him and his people to ride out the massacre. The film accurately portrays the total failure of the ""world community"" to take action that could have prevented the massacre of hundreds of thousands.The UN and other organizations have detailed files and reports of this occurrence that can be read on line by anyone who is interested in this. In those files you will learn there was a similar incident there in 1970 that claimed 100,000 lives. They're real good at writing up reports after the fact, but they were useless in preventing or limiting this tragedy. That's essentially what this movie tells us as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good, but could have been better","Hotel Rwanda does a good job of glorifying the good in an African hotelier under terrible circumstances - kind of a black man's version of Schindler's List. It's all very believable, but I was left wanting to know a bit more about the background hatred of the Hutus and Tutsis. All that slaughter deserves a bit more than just calling the opposing tribes ""cockroaches."" At first, I thought of Cheadle as miscast for the role - too stoic and businesslike to be a savior, but he did grow on me a bit as the film ran on. By the end, I actually believed him. (Unlike Nick Nolte, who was miscast for his role. Oh admit it, he's miscast for every role he's ever had -- he just can't act.) I'm giving this one a 6: you probably won't regret renting it, but you won't want to see it a second time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful,"Hotel Rwanda is a very powerful movie which is not easy to watch. The genocide which occurred in 1994 was one of the most horrifying events to happen in recent years and it went virtually unnoticed by most of the world. Paul Rusesabagina was an ordinary man who didn't really want to get involved, but was forced by the events to make impossible decisions. Don Cheadle's performance is amazing as he demonstrates Paul's extraordinary courage and compassion. You do not watch this movie without feeling incredible sadness for the people of Rwanda (both Hutu and Tutsi) and you leave hoping that by putting this difficult story on film, the producers may encourage us learn how to prevent any type of genocide again.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Still a striking film,"I had it seen it long ago on the big screen. Then about five minutes of the film on TV last night and it got me again. In the rain, the bus departing, the children singing. Don Cheadle is a man of many faces. This was one of his most remarkable. The quiet dignity in the face of the unspeakable in order to provide safety for others. It was very different from some of his other roles, yet he inhabits this one a hundred percent. The Academy still owes his an award.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gut-wrenching true story of courage,"In the face of true human evil, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) stood up and said Not on my Watch. Cheadle plays the real-life role of hotel manager during the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi sect people by the Hutu sect majority. At the beginning of the film, before the killing starts, you learn that people were arbitrarily assigned to one of the two sects based on physical characteristics, which makes the killing even more unbelievable.Hotel Des Milles Collines is the one place of refuge in the middle of mayhem once the genocide starts. Cheadle uses guile, tactics, stalling, bargaining, bribing, begging, every tool in his toolkit to try to save as many as he can. Reminiscent of Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda shows what one compassionate man can mean to so many others' lives when he's the only one that can do anything.Rusesabagina loves his family, and that is portrayed over and over again, especially in many heart-wrenching scenes with his wife when he tells her what she must do if death comes near them.Tension, plot, great acting, despair. Nick Nolte is terrific as the UN peacekeeper leader who has guns but no mandate or authority to use them. Excellent acting by the evil General and the evil supplier. The way the Director Terry George portrays the carnage, especially the river road scene, will stay with you for a long time.Genocide never makes sense, is never understandable to the sane person, but never has it been so palpably seen as in Hotel Rwanda. thankfully the Hollywood ending is actually true. If you have time, watch some of the special features where the real Paul Rusesabagina talks about the reality of that time. This movie will restore your faith in good people doing amazing things when faced with evil.Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic movie with emotion and heart,"""I think if people see this footage, they'll say Oh, my God, that's horrible. And then they'll go on eating their dinners.""Hotel Rwanda is not just about the conflict in Rwanda a few years ago, and its not just about one man's quest to save people. It is about the continuation of Africa's plight in their everlasting mission to live in peace.It is about the ruthlessness of people, and how corrupt society actually is in Africa, portrayed by the brilliant story of Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel manager who housed over a thousand refugees during the conflict that killed over a million people.Yes, this has shocking scenes of bloodshed, horror and violence. But the contrasts of this horrible nature are balanced by the fantastic overwhelming calm of Paul Rusesabagina, played fantastically well by Don Cheadle.When i saw this movie i was shocked by what i saw, and moved by the sheer ignorance of myself as to what actually happened in Rwanda.

Genocide tales,"Making a film of the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 is not an easy thing to do as you need to find a hook to grab the viewers and keep them interested. I have already seen Shooting Dogs which was released at a similar time and also dealt with the events of the Rwandan conflict.Hotel Rwanda sees Don Cheadle playing a luxury hotel manager Paul, a Hutu who spends his time charming people of influence. His wife is Tutsi and the he is respected by the corporate owners of the hotel based in Belgium.As the conflict escalates and using bribes in terms of money and booze to some sympathetic Hutu bigwigs to tune a blind eye he brings over some Tutsi neighbours and his family to the hotel.Once the UN decide that the country is too dangerous and decide to leave and leave the Tutsis to their deaths, Paul opens up the hotel to the Tutsis and then figure out how to get everyone to safety as the Hutu militia are sensing blood.The film is based on true events and has a docu-drama feel to it by director Terry George. The film has strong performances from Cheadle, Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo.Maybe because I saw Shtting Dogs first there was an element of seen it all before. The film could had done with more spikiness as to why UN forces left people to such a fate when they were supposed to be protecting them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Open's Your Eyes - SEE IT,"In 1994 a mass genocide took place in an African country called Rwanda. Have you not heard of this tragedy or have you CHOSEN to turn the other cheek? Now, let us break down the word genocide, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines genocide as ""the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group."" Does Hitler pop into your mind? Well, less then ten years ago (in your lifetime) this event happened. The movie Hotel Rwanda is an excellent portrayal of the absolute devastation that took place. Millions of Rwanda natives were killed in this mass genocide. Don Cheadle gives an astonishing portrayal of Paul Rusesagagina a savior for over a thousand caught up in the madness occurring right outside the gates of the Hotel Mille Collines. ""When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms,"" a tagline that fits oh so well into the heartfelt movie that puts you right into the conflict. Perhaps you did not care to pay attention in 1994 when the conflict fully unraveled, but see this movie and you may change your thoughts about looking at the horrors occurring abroad within our own small world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Don Cheadle has done exactly this. The plot, the direction, the performances.. they are so real that u feel a part of the struggle. Though every single performance is worth admiring but Don stands out with his.A struggle that most probably persists in so many countries around the world, which we are not even aware of sitting in the air conditioning of our drawing rooms watching cable changing channels and cribbing of not having anything worthwhile on it to watch. This one makes u do some retrospection.

A great inspiring story weakened by bad casting,"This is the true and inspiring tale of one man who tried to do something when his country descended into madness and genocide. Don Cheadle is masterful as our hero and he was deserving of an Oscar and not just a nomination. Its is thanks to him and most of the rest of the cast that we have as good a movie as we do. The problem, for me, with Hotel Rwanda is the casting of Nick Nolte as a UN peace keeper. Every time that Nolte appears on screen I'm pulled out of the movie. No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story. Nolte aside, this is a great movie and should be seen , not only because its a record of what transpired, but also because its a damn good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I'd like to think many Americans would feel the same way, as long as these policies were applied consistently.It makes me angry that these events happened. It saddens me that the West didn't do more earlier. Nick Nolte really nailed his monologue about how the West views Africans.I'm also impressed with Rusesabagina (as portrayed in this film, anyway I haven't researched how much of the story is true). I'd like to think that I could react with the courage and strategic intelligence that he displayed in such a crisis.Finally, no better actor could have been cast for this role than Cheadle.

Beautiful--but allow me to nitpick....,"I loved the film, and have absolutely nothing new to say that hasn't been already covered in the many positive reviews here.But I am a bit obsessive around the issue of authenticity and accuracy in something that is supposed to convey factual events, and there was one thing that drove my just bugged eyed throughout the film. As a Canadian, a former member of our military, and a huge admirer of General Dallaire, I had some difficulties warming up to Nick Nolte's character. I can't quite put my finger on it, but Nolte seemed almost unfocused, sloppy, and unconvincing in the part. On top of this, the inaccuracies in his uniform drove me absolutely around the bend--the little ""CANADA"" bar that is supposed to sit just beyond the four ""colonel"" stripes on the shoulders is a standard feature of the uniform, and its absence on an officer that was obviously supposed to be Canadian really discombobulated me in every scene Nolte was in.But I know the typical IMDb reviewer doesn't fret about such things and will likely advise me to lighten up. So in closing, I will--the movie was moving, engaging, engrossing, impeccably acted, beautifully photographed and uncomfortably informative. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The connection you feel for Paul and his family in this movie is far greater than any other movie you'll find yourself watching. You'll notice subtle little things about his character, his personality... It has some of the most influential scenes I have ever seen.

When Humanity falls apart,"It's no secret that this film caused a lot of controversy, stirred many lakes, revolted many people and moved many more. All of us will have different interpretations of it. The one undeniable fact, however, is that what we see on the screen happened. As is. No law and peace-abiding Nation did a thing to prevent it. All those who could flee, fled. The rest is history.Don Cheadle has a break-through role in his career. The role of a man who, saving the distances, reminds me of other brave people such as Schindler or Aristides de Sousa Mendes, whom in extreme circumstances, and going beyond their very human fears and flaws, did the right thing. Nick Nolte doesn't have a brilliant role. Actually, as flimsy as the helplessness the poor Canadian Colonel felt in real life, probably.Hotel Rwanda is a real eye-opener. It reminds everyone that the news have a human face. What happened there in the 90s is nowadays happening in Sudan (and has been for years!) as in other places: people are simply getting killed for nothing. That's the bottom line. Some will say that's the way the world is. Those are the cynical. That is not the way the world should be. We screamed never again. Yet, here it is again, asking for a new script in 2015: Hotel Khartum. The acting is not superb. The script aims at telling a story, but also at making the movie a real tear-jerker.But if one thinks about all those that survived the Genocide and are perhaps thankful for the story, then it had to be worth making it. Despite the lack of help, no one will now be able to forget.Any human being must feel ashamed of himself while watching it. It's a civil offense in most democracies to see someone in need of help and doing nothing. There isn't a more extreme example. We all shoved it under the carpet and pretended it wasn't there. Hotel Rwanda stands as a memory. To face us with our passiveness, it should be mandatory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Standing Ovations to Paul Rusesabagina,I saw an interesting true story without much suspense or action but the genocide itself is dramatic enough. I discovered HOTEL RWANDA because its high votes and the good critics on IMDb. Don Cheadle delivered a respectable performance here. Cameos for Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno. The picture was okay but the film minutes could have been reduced. I don't like movies that are running more than two hours because I don't have much time. Anyway if you are looking for a true story don't miss it. It's a shame that on this massacre the UNO was helpless and all the Western countries too. I'm asking which kind of sun is shining on this UNO. There were many facts that let me without words. I was also impressed how the hotel manager Paul bought lives with money. Standing ovations to Paul Rusesabagina the great hero that saved so many innocent lives. We all should take an example from him. My final vote is 6/10 but please don't get me wrong.If you liked it I highly recommend TEARS OF THE SUN.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don Cheadle is the best actor working today. And Hotel Rwanda deserved more than it received.,"With all due respect to Jamie Foxx, Don Cheadle gave the best performance of 2004 in Hotel Rwanda. The real-life tale of the Rwandan genocide that took place in 1994 might not have been seen by the majority of the American public this winter, but it should have been. As Rwandan hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, Cheadle commands every scene and puts himself into the upper echelon of today's American actors.The story of Hotel Rwanda may not be familiar to many. In over 100 days in 1994, nearly one million people died as a result of a war between two Rwandan tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis. This tragedy was completely overlooked the world over, especially here in America.During this civil war, Rusesabagina housed thousands of Rwandan refugees in his hotel, the Mille de Colline. As hotel manager, he bargained, pled and bribed for the lives of friends, family members and those he didn't even know.After numerous, but memorable, supporting roles in movies like Swordfish, Bulworth, Ocean's Eleven, Boogie Nights and Traffic, it was refreshing to see Cheadle get his chance at being a leading man.While Cheadle was the heart and soul of Hotel Rwanda, he wasn't the only bright spot. In addition to the aforementioned writing and direction from Terry George, relative newcomer Sophie Okonedo turns in a brilliant, Oscar-nominated performance as Rusesabagina's wife, Tatiana. Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte also nail their supporting roles, Phoenix as an ashamed American journalist and Nolte as a struggling UN Colonel trying to keep the peace.Though Phoenix appears in just a few scenes, he delivers the most memorable and perhaps the most accurate line depicting the Rwandan conflict. ""If people see this,"" he says, referring to Americans watching the news at home, ""they'll say, 'Oh my God, that's horrible,' and then go on eating their dinners."" Maybe, if more people get a chance to see Hotel Rwanda, that sentiment could change. This isn't just a movie; it's a film that can change lives, policy and the way we think about our actions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Overrated,"Not a bad movie, but you know, I didn't really feel much for the characters in this film. While the story is reasonably compelling, you see the leads sipping wine by candle light after all the tension occurs and they're left in the hotel to manage the chaos. I mean, come on. What's that all about?Way too Hollywood to actually produce compassion for the true story at hand. Everyone seems to go nuts over this film, both at IMDb and other sites (such as rental), and it's yet another film I feel is overrated by at least 2 out of 10 stars. I gave it a 6. It doesn't suck, but it's not all that great either.I didn't find the acting all that supreme to be honest, and while the story was important to be told, it wasn't told in a way that provides one with feeling for the actors or whom they''re portraying. I didn't feel as sorry for the characters as I did in many other movies, such as Salvador, The Killing Fields, etc. They were far better films, in my humble opinion.While this movie had its moments of sadness, it would often spoil the true story with these displays of 'wine by candle light', which I found to be complete nonsense and totally unrealistic given the circumstances. Tantamount to drivel. I didn't really think the movie got going till around 50 minutes into the film.

There were few cardboard characters, even the motivation of the most brutal, avaricious, vengeful and cruel was believable. The frustration felt at the utter indifference of the west by those who were betrayed, coupled with their helpless dependency brought a vivid light to what it was like to be utterly ignored by those believed to be friends.The stark moral choices were those that I think most of us would fear ever to confront, knowing how little how we would actually behave in that situation.The acting was superb.I think that everybody ought to watch this film - not least to learn more of just what it means to be human.--It is an unalterable law that people who claim to care about the human race are utterly indifferent to the sufferings of individuals - Quinten Crisp, Resident Alien *",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Has a Schindler's List feel, but trust me - it's better","The premise for Hotel Rwanda seems much like that of Schindler's List, released a decade before it... the story of one man who uses his power and position to provide a haven for refugees from a brutal war where they are the targets. I'll be blunt; Schindler's List underwhelmed me and I felt like I was being forced to feel emotions that just wouldn't generate themselves.Hotel Rwanda succeeds where Spielberg's self-proclaimed classic failed. Lead character Paul (Don Cheadle) shelters men, women and children from both sides of Rwanda's bloody civil war. You don't go into this film with any preconceived 'Jews good, Nazis bad' notion of whether it is the Hutu or the Tutsi people who are being demonised. It is the atrocities of the war itself that are painted in a deserving light and the producers let the film focus on Paul's struggle to save the lives of those in his care.The film is brutally honest about the horrors of war without the melodrama that might bely a lesser production. The images speak for themselves; there is no need for over-blown orchestral melodies in the background trying to forcibly yank the tears from our eyes. It's a straight-up, believable film.The entire cast nail their parts to perfection, especially Cheadle who comes into his own playing an unlikely hero, sometimes skittish and unsure of himself, only once having to display any kind of bravado, and even then only when it is necessary that his people's lives will be spared.Hotel Rwanda is a brilliant, moving and most of all realistic film that lets the true story on which it is based tell itself, without having to 'Hollywood it up' and thereby ruin the picture.

The film certainly changed our perspectives.Well shot and emotional, the film based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Western-owned hotel in the middle of the conflict captured the terror faced by the genocide victims extremely well.

(That's made me highly value the TFF over the Academy Awards.)If you'll GOOGLE the name of the central character, ""Paul R____""(?), you'll find many stories that expand and elaborate on the film and ALL of which confirm ALL the premises of the film. I found http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/574/574554p1.html to be one of the best although all carried the same central message -- adherence to the central truth of the story.This film does two things.It clearly faces us with the worldwide responsibility we all face with the consequences of ignoring ""man's inhumanity to man"" wherever and to whomever it occurs. "".... Therefore, never send to ask for whom the bell doth toll; it tolls for thee.""It also confronts each of us with what -- as individuals -- we could do, would do, when faced with moral situations.Excellent film. IMPORTANT film. Very well done. Superb acting. Faithful story telling.11 of 10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not quite Schindler's List, but still a really absorbing and powerful film that serves as a real eye-opener to what goes on in the world under our noses","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsIn 1994, the UN, in a rare act of competence, have managed to broker a peace agreement between the warring hutus and tutsis in Rwanda, Africa. But all this is thrown into disarray when the African president is murdered and tutsi rebels are suspected. The local militia begin a nasty campaign of genocide against them and those suspected of working with them. One such person ends up being Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) a hotel owner who witnesses the horrific carnage for himself and is forced into action when his own family get caught up in the slaughter campaign.He ends up saving thousands of lives. Hotel Rwanda serves best as a modern Schindler's List, a Schindler's List with colour, although that doesn't make the story it is telling any less bleak or harrowing. It's a few notches away from the quality of that film though.In the lead role, Cheadle plays it stern and serious all the way, with a real conviction for his passion to the project. He has a heavy supporting cast too, from Nick Nolte, Joaquim Phoenix and Jean Reno, who only marginally manage to capture his sincerity.I was expecting the film to be a bit longer, actually, but it manages to wrap it all up perfectly as it goes.Hotel Rwanda is a startling film, depicting things that I know go on everyday in foreign countries but don't watch the news very often and, like many others, sort of pretend isn't happening to an extent. Although everything in this film happened when I was a child, things like this probably are still going on and it's good that there are films like this about to kick people into reality a bit. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Performances Bring True Story to Life,"When the world (specifically the UN) turned its back on the genocidal tribal warfare in Rwanda in the early 1990's, a true story emerged of a hotel manager who risked his life and his family to help refugees survive the massacre and escape to safety. The straightforward and by-the-numbers direction of Terry George service this tale very well, as it allows the fact based and ultimately uplifting story to speak for itself and allows the actors (most notably Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo-both rightfully honored with Oscar nods) to shine. There's a lot of heartbreaking stuff here both of a personal and political nature. It's a sobering and timely tale that highlights the grotesque flaws of current geopolitics while reminding us that even in the most dire of situations the human will to survive and help others survive will emerge triumphant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good But not Good enough,In the Movie Hotel Rowanda a man Fights for himself and many other African Americans to be protected from the Hutu warriors. this movie had a good plot good acting and a good screenplay. though it had many good parts to it it still could have had more. the Geniside was a very bloody and breathtaking time. in this movie all i saw was safe non-bloody stuff and there were no breathtaking events. when I say that there was no blood I mean that that was really what happened and I didn't feel like they captured that violent time. it was a safe and boaring movie. I watched in the special features that they didn't want people to be scared to come see it because of the gore.

A gift to the art of cinema,"I have read many of the responses and have no more to add other than to share how sobering it is to realise that, as we're in midst of general elections in this country, how our preoccupation with utter trivia (like how many extra discretionary $$'s we'll be better off if we give our vote to this or that party) pales into shameful embarrassment that our preoccupations are so trivial to a degree that's cringe-making.I offer an addition to the many perceptive observations made, as there is one that stays with me above all, after sitting still gripped by the impact, through all of the credits with that wonderful singing, and it is this...Darwinism has much to answer for, the 'ism' not Charles. The judgement made by the colonial powers, that one grouping was 'finer', more dignified, 'superior' - because of perceived 'fine points' of looks or body shape.....fine nose, taller stature ... whatever, let alone skin colour. The Belgians decided that the Tutsi's were 'the finest', and set that in privilege and in history. Other Euro colonials did no better, and if we're truthful we who should know better in the white West still hold these shameful stereotypes.When gifted with the opportunity to observe how a relatively non-attention seeking individual met the challenge to do inspirational good, it give me pause for thought and perhaps a re-arranging of my priorities as a citizen of this planet.Thankyou to the wonderful team who brought this masterpiece to the world.

sincere history telling,"It's 1994 Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a hotel manager who knows the right people and gets things done. He's Hutu but is apolitical. He sees signs of upheaval. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is Tutsi but he expects his connections to pull his family through. Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) from the UN is at the hotel touting the new peace agreement. Reporter David (David O'Hara) and cameraman Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) arrive to cover the story. When the massacres start, his home and then his hotel are inundated with refugees.This is a sincere telling of a harrowing historical story. Don Cheadle delivers a sincere performance. It's all very sincere. There is an inevitability to the story. It is a bit heavy-handed but the history demands some heavy-handedness. However, the lines coming out of Colonel Oliver is too much.

Aided by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) a UN general (Nick Nolte), and his staff, Rusesabagina became an important hero that has rightly been characterized in this film by director Terry George and one hopes this film will be remembered as importantly as 1984's 'The Killing Fields'.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Top Notch,"Grade: ATerry George's sober-sided and ham-fisted Hotel Rwanda is a caustic indictment of Western indifference to atrocities committed in the world's rawer precincts. It reminds us that we have short memories and shorter attention spans and most newspapers these days cede coverage of foreign events to the various cable news networks. We pay little attention to the internecine tribulations of savage foreigners so long as only brown or yellow people are involved.And so, a decade after the slaughter of nearly a million Rwandan Tutsi by their Hutu countrymen, many Americans may be surprised to learn that such atrocities took place -- that the powder blue helmets of United Nations peacekeepers could virtually stand aside for genocide. Even the division of the Rwandans into Hutus and Tutsi can be laid at the feet of the West -- it was Belgian colonists who decided the slender, lighter-skinned Tutsis were superior to their Hutu brothers and required that all citizens carry identity cards that identified them by their ethnicity. For decades, the Belgians encouraged the belief that the Tutsi minority was superior to the Hutus. Tutsi were favored with better educational opportunities and jobs than the Hutu, with predictable results: In 1959, 20,000 Tutsis were killed in a series of riots. When Belgium relinquished control of Rwanda in 1962, the Hutu majority adopted the Tutsi as an all-purpose scapegoat. Some Tutsis fled to Uganda and -- along with some moderate Hutus -- formed an opposition group called the Rwandan Patriotic Front.In the midst of this maelstrom, Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu hotel manager with European manners and training, was able to save more than 1,200 endangered Rwandans by passing them off as ""guests"" at the Belgian-owned Milles Collines resort in Kigali. Rusesabagina has so often been compared to Oskar Schindler, the Czech industrialist who saved the lives of thousands of Polish Jews during World War II, that the comparison feels easy and reflexive, but the truth is Rusesabagina performed a miracle in Kigali. As played by the ever-efficient Don Cheadle, Rusesabagina is the ultimate concierge. He knows his clients and uses a brutal general's taste for single-malt Scotch and Cohiba cigars to buy time and protection for his charges. A walking argument for decency, we see sublimated anger flashing in his civilized eyes as he deals with all sides to maintain his makeshift sanctuary. A product of European grooming, Rusesabagina can't quite believe that he -- and his people -- have been abandoned by those he'd considered his friends. Cheadle admits a trace of hubris to his character; Rusesabagina's horror at being abandoned mingles with disgruntlement at being not quite a full-fledged member of the corporate family.Director George isn't as subtle as Cheadle. He's an old Irish Republican who tends to see the world in strident shades, but he has got hold of a subject worthy of his righteous anger. And he has cast it with fine actors -- Nick Nolte quakes with self-disgust as a Canadian colonel ashamed of the orders he has to follow. Sophie Okonedo is brilliant as Rusesabagina's Tutsi wife, Tatiana.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A good film, but a little overrated","Regarding the fact that most people don't know that much about the massacres in Rwanda, this movie was necessary to show the shocking things that happened and the rejection of help by the western countries. However, I don't think people bring the critical acclaim the motion picture - not the documentary - needs: Many actors and actresses did a rather poor job, especially Nick Nolte was really disappointing in my opinion. I appreciate the directors job for delivering a movie with tension and the information every viewer needed, but after the parts couldn't make me believe they really happened because of the in some scenes crappy performances by the UN-Guy and Paul's wife which just let me realize that even if these things happened, they don't seem as real as they could if the actors would do a better job. That sucked the special quality out of a masterpiece: Great shocking film with information everybody needs to get, some errors in the performance that this story does not deserve.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Could have been a good movie without the propaganda,"First, the good. It was an inspirational film both in demonstrating the personal heroism and humanity of the reluctant heroes and the deep and abiding love between the hotel manager and his family.Unfortunately the film was apparently intended as a piece of political propaganda. Anyone familiar with the issues involved will find some of the points put forth by the film ridiculous and an insult to their intelligence.The horror of war was, if anything, thoroughly sanitized. Over a million people were killed in the real war, and Kigali as the largest city was the center of much of the violence. Yet we see a few hundred corpses scattered about with no closeups, and few if any people actually being killed. This is not to demand a gore-fest, but if thousands were hacked to death by machete wielding tribesmen, why not grudgingly give into the reality and show how cruelly disgusting it was?While the violence was clearly and overwhelmingly African on African, much of the moral outrage expressed in the movie is directed at the Europeans. And, of course, the Americans. As if it were our responsibility to save the Africans from themselves. Kipling would have been in full accord with the ""white man's burden"" concept underlying the moral themes of the movie.This is furthered by an interesting piece of history presented on the origin of the Hutus and Tutsi. Guess who's fault all this is? Why, the Belgians of course. Never mind the fact that the area was originally held by the Twa who were conquered by the Hutus a thousand years ago and then taken over by the Tutsis probably 500 years ago, long before there were any Belgians around to muck things up. The film delivers the preposterous concept that all was love and Kumbaya until the Evil Europeans showed their faces and separated them intro tribes. Utter balderdash.Then we have the UN. Forget the fact that UN peacekeeping forces on this planet have been found to be regularly engaged in the sex trade for children and common bribery. The UN troops in the movie are all Sir Galahad's from another planet, riding here and there to the rescue who's sole problem is that they are hopelessly outnumbered. I practically expected a ""Donate the the UN Support Group"" phone bank number to flash on the screen every time Nolte appeared.While there is plenty of moral bashing against Europe and America there is no attempt whatsoever to ask the counterpoint -- why should it have been the responsibility of Europe and America to intervene in the middle of a massive tribal war? One can debate the point, and certainly good people can draw conclusions on either side of this issue. But the issue is simply never raised. It's all about how cowardly America and the French are for not sending in the Marines. And now that you mention it, why America and not China, Egypt, South Africa, Japan, Russia, or Germany? Belgium may have had historic interests there by certainly the US never had African colonies. How did we somehow become part of the select group of the guilty?Overall, it was worth seeing, but only if you open your eyes and see the baloney sandwich you are being served, and hold your nose when you smell it.

Stunning...,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is the heart-wrenching story of Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over 1,200 Tutsi refugees from the Hutu militia and their 'purification' crusade in 1994. The movie begins by giving a thorough explanation of the political situation in Rwanda at the time. The nation is divided by two factions, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Rwanda, being freed from its Belgian colonizers, forms its own national government and attracts the attention of the international media and wealthy tourists. However the Hutu population, the majority, still resents the Tutsis for their alleged cooperation with the Belgian colonizers. By the early nineties both factions have organized their own militias and the official government is leaning toward the corrupt Hutu cause of exterminating the Tutsi people. The UN is caught in the middle trying to act as a peacekeeping force.Paul (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu that must use various diplomatic skills as a hotel manager, a job bringing him in contact with various entities. When violence does break out, Paul goes against his instincts and decides upon protecting his endangered Tutsi neighbors. As they escape to the refuge of the hotel more refugees come under Paul's care and he realizes that the UN and the media, the only ones who can protect him, are fleeing the country. Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) is a UN commander that has befriended Paul and, being one of the few westerners who cares about the genocides, does his best to protect Paul's hotel.I must say that the entire cast is outstanding. Don Cheadle becomes Paul right before our eyes and amazes us in virtually every scene. Sophie Okonedo plays Paul's courageous Tutsi wife, Tatiana Rusesabagina, who encourages her husband every step of the way. This character reminds me of the old adage: behind every strong man is a stronger woman. Nick Nolte has one of the greatest and most convincing scenes in the movie when he (as Col. Oliver) explains to Paul why the West doesn't care about his plight.The director and producer, Terry George, pulls the picture together in such a way that it is an outrage was not nominated for an Oscar. The dialogue is realistic and human in every sense. Finally, the cinematography tells the story in such a straightforward manner that with the very appropriate (and sometimes eerie) music we as an audience feel transported into Paul's terrifying world.""Hotel Rwanda"" is an excellent tale of survival.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Paul (Don Cheadle) is an amazing character. He makes you feel ashamed of yourself. Could you face this sort of thing in the same fashion as he did? I kept asking myself that question the whole time. To be reminded of this atrocities is one thing, but to confront them and still keep a straight and gentle face is another thing. Paul is such an amazing character he's beyond human, and Don Cheadle portrayed this man with such dignity and charisma it left me biting my nails every moment. I also loved Joaquin Phoenix's character. You always wonder what the feelings of journalists would be given the chance to cover a story like this, and I think he hits the mark very close.

A Captivating Story of Genocide in Africa,"Hotel Rwanda tells the true story of one man's determination to hide over 1000 people during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Watch as his country, his family and everything around him falls apart.This film was destined for greatness. The subject matter is so grave, so serious, that only a really bad film could have lessened the impact. And this is not a bad film, but rather a very good one: solid directing, great music, great acting and imagery.Don Cheadle is the main character. The only bad thing I can say is that he bears a striking resemblance to Tim Meadows, but that's not Cheadle's fault. Every tear, every cry of anguish and each loving embrace seemed real to me. And he definitely came across as someone who is African at heart. (I have no idea if Cheadle is African, American or European, but he could have been Rwandan.) I was confused by the appearance of Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix. They could have been distracting from the overall film, as they were the only mainstream actors in this otherwise sea of unknowns. They weren't, though. Phoenix had a small role, yet quite powerful. And Nick Nolte was the shining star, playing a Canadian military man who was the only person who cared about the Rwandans. (His speech in the bar about the difference between Africans and n*****s rings very true, and sadly will for some time.) Jean Reno was Jean Reno, I could have used more of him, but I'm happy just knowing I was able to glance upon his droopy eyes and somber face.Now, the imagery is where this film shines the most: the violence, the corpses, the scenery... all so shockingly real. The film was rated R before petitioning for a PG-13. And I'm so glad they did, because the message inherent in this film should not be missed out because someone is ""too young"" to understand.

I don't really mind about it being PG-13 and not showing much of genocide and brutal killing (the movie only intention was to show about survival) but the story and the movie itself is very unemotional and flat. I feel so detach to it.Synopsis: A hotel manager Paul was force to housed over thousands refugees as there were genocidal and unrest outside of the hotel.The good part of this movie got to be it was quite entertaining to watch and there is something happen all the time. Plus I get to know the country Rwanda existed and thus have this entire problem. The sad part is when executed into the screenplay it wasn't that good and combine with really bad cinematography make this not such a good movie one hope to be. I guess if you watch it for fact it was fine but movie for movie sake it wasn't that good.I got to say the whole film is very flat, though there are like two scenes that are quite moving but the rest was very ordinary and forgettable. The casting of Don Cheadle was a smart moves (otherwise this wouldn't close to be this famous), though he was the best in the movie his acting is barely average and the rest turn out quite bad specially Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo.

On the minus side though, I thought it did seem to gloss over the whole thing. There just did not seem to be any sense of outrage. To get the point across there should have been more on-screen atrocity - not with a view to satisfying gore hounds, but to emphasise why the world should be ashamed of what happened.

Hotel Rwanda Review,"I have seen the movie and being a undergrad who has spent a year working on the Rwandan Genocide I have to say that I was disappointed with this movie. I like that it is trying to bring some light on a subject that we have all seemed to forgotten or never really knew anything about in the first place. However, this movie never seemed to show the brutality or show the reality of the horrors that were occurring in this county at the time. Most of this film takes place in this hotel where they are drinking wine and one of their biggest problems is having to boil their drinking water out of the hotel's swimming pool. There are very few scenes where you are given the opportunity to see a glimpse of what the real horror of the genocide must have been like. I understand that the movie was trying to keep its PG 13 rating but I think that the rating of this film is not as important as the message.

Sophie Okonedo as the loving mother and wife is perfect. The scene where all the white people are boarding buses and leaving the Tutsis for sure massacre is compelling. When the Tutsis get on the phone to anyone they know that might help and manage to obtain exit visas hope prevails only to be thwarted when the UN trucks are surrounded by the rebels and must turn back and return to the hotel.This is a must see movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
great amazing movie should have won best actor and actress  and best picture,this has to be in my opinion 1 of the top ten movies of all time this movie features great acting! and sucks you in the entire time. you feel like your there in Africa watching there population suffer and you cant do anything about it i totally fell in love with Paul and all the other characters and i think IMDb has this to low at number 49 because this movie is defiantly better than pulp fiction and one flew over the cuckoos nest and maybe better than Schindler's list this is an absolute must see! you wont be disappointed. this is what acting is all about acting is about being the character and in this movie for 2 hours you couldn't tell that it was Don Cheadle PLAYING Paul Rauseabigina Don Cheadle WAS Paul Rauseabigina.Its amazing how hotel Rwanda does not win best picture best actor and best actor it ridiculous just because ray was all about a really famous person does not mean they should win best picture this is just like 1994 when shaw shank redemption got robbed,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Incredible Film,"The action in this film takes place in 1994, when war exploded between two tribes in Rwanda - the Hutus and the Tutsis. This film tells the story of what happened, focussing on Paul Rusesabagina, (played by Don Cheadle) the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital city owned by Belgians (who caused the tribal problems to begin with but that is another story). He and his friend, the UN commander Oliver played by Nick Nolte, assisted over a thousand Tutsi refugees by first of all hiding them in the hotel and then through mounting tension and bloodshed whisking them outside the war area to safety.The film reminded me of Schindler's List and had the same powerful effect. Much like the book on which it was based (I believe)- Romeo Dallaire's ""Shake Hands with the Devil."" The character of Oliver is loosely based on Colonel Dallaire - and a film should be made about him too, he is given short shrift in this movie.It is about the nobility of the human character when faced with incredible acts of evil and horror. Particularly when the world turns its back, as it is still doing on Africa. Some horrors are just too huge (the Holocaust, the Irish famine, Rwanda) to be comprehended. The tsunami is about all we can manage. The rest we know in hindsight, as in this movie and others like it.This nobility of character is never more exemplified than by Don Cheadle in this movie. His acting has to be seen, he just nails the character of Paul, the hotel manager who knows all the tricks of diplomacy, graft and bribery in the book.The depiction of the actual horror in Rwanda is fairly discreet and leaves much to the imagination it is rendered through radio broadcasts and one haunting scene of a road fading into the horizon covered in the hacked bodies of women and children. There were many heroes in Rwanda, the orphanage managers, the nuns, the UN peacekeepers defying orders not to shoot, but we observe it all through the eyes of Paul, his day to day wrestling with the sheer challenge of feeding and hiding over 1000 people in his hotel.The movie ends on an uplifting note, a surprise, much like ""Schindler's List"". It is still with me, which is always the sign of a great movie. Don Cheadle should get the Oscar. He is simply stunning.The one word that strikes me about the Pauls and the Oskars of this world is that they were noble, an old-fashioned word. We cannot apply that word to too many but it is something to which we should all aspire. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant Warning,"I think anyone for anyone to take this movie as just a piece of art on film is a mistake. The fact is, this movie is not for our entertainment, but it is to help us see what has happened and may happen again. The world vowed never to let what took place during the Holocaust happen again, but it did. Genocide is rearing its ugly head in different corners of the earth far more often than we'd like to believe. This film is intended to show us the horrors that went on in Rwanda. It also shows that nothing was done to stop it. It's a brilliant piece of film, yes, much in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" is a brilliant piece of film. But please, everyone must take something important out of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
good but somewhat subtle,"At the second viewing upon this film maybe five or six years after the first, it loses some of its effect and power, and some issues pop up here and there, namely the film's lack of exploring the cultural and national conflicts and tenstions between Hutus and Tutsis that eventually lead to the catastrophe or the script's overused and exhausted love-scenes regarding the main character and his wife.I think this film is best tailored for someone who isn't really familiar with the Rwanda genocide so the film can be of use introducing potential viewers with one of the most hideous events of the 20th century and encourage them to delve deeper into the subject. However, if you are familiar enough with the horrors and fears of the above-mentioned, then the film manifests and talks in a rather subtle, almost ignorant tone one could argue as opposed to.Still, I do think this is a good film that finds its place and reason and serves a purpose I'd wish more films deem.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda WOW,"I just saw this movie earlier today and I remember the headlines at the time of the crisis and never understood afterwards how so much slid by the public on information. Boy I have learned so much from this film and truly hope everyone will go see it. What a wonderful man to have taken up the burden of the crisis he was living amongst and to bear it when so many of the countries in the world turned their backs on him. I am ashamed of our world that we did not help in time and do hope that we as people can not grow cold to third world countries as well as the rest of the world. We are all in this world together period and we need to show love and compassion to all no matter what creed, nationality or even color of skin!

"Good acting, interesting story...","but not the best movie of the year. I've seen other movies about the conflict between Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda. All were good. It would be hard to make a really bad film about such a powerful subject. The film focuses of Paul, a hotel manager at a swank hotel. It's where all the white people vacation and journalists gather. The genocide of the Tutsi breaks out and they seek refuge at the hotel. Paul is Hutu but his wife is not. He does business with other Hutus who help keep the hotel safe for a while. Paul tries to buy time by bribing soldiers with money and beer. He knows they all will be killed if forced to leave the hotel. The only thing keeping them safe is the hotel is not considered a refuge camp. But the Hutus who are committing murder on the streets know Tutsis are in the hotel. Paul is offered a chance to turn some over in order to get his family out but will not do it.Don Cheadle was very good. He uses a convincing accent. He must play a man who appears strong and in charge but really breaks down behind closed doors because he knows their chance of surviving is low.FINAL VERDICT: Good, compelling, but any movie about this subject would be. Good acting, Cheadle definitely deserved all the award nominations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A must watch movie for its brilliant portrayal of varied human personalities,"It is a hard hitting civil war(between the rebelling Tutsis and the ruling Hutus) movie based on true incidents during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It depicts how the central character Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, manager of a four-star Hotel uses his diplomatic skills and political contacts tries to save hordes of Tutsis while he himself is in grave danger of being hunted down by the Hutus for harboring Tutsis. It depicts wonderfully how gruesome ethnic hatred is induced by the State to maintain its political clout. A wonderful melange of politics at various hierarchies. It depicts how regional politics for control instigates mob mentality and gruesome genocide, how international politics keeps UN from taking any affirmative action, how individual politics played by Paul Rusesabagina helps save lives. It skillfully presents the contrast between how common people torn by ethnic strife and witness to thousands of killings, many of them near and dear, accept their fate while some others in power try to extract every single ounce they can to fulfill their personal greed. A must watch movie for its brilliant portrayal of varied human personalities.PS: A brief perspective on the Rwanda genocide can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide . The book by UN general Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire ""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"" and the documentary film with the same name are definitely worth a watch. While watching the movie I could not stop thinking about how history teaches us nothing. After the Rwandan genocide, every one went about condemning the genocide, the world body has setup a war crimes tribunal, Bill Clinton has termed the genocide the biggest failure of his administration and still today we have Iraq burning on the same ethnic conflict, Darfur in Sudan enduring a killing of 400,000 people(and that's just the official figure). Hope history teaches us something. Still I'm sure, in future, politics will be played and men in power(or the others seeking it) will try to instigate petty differences among people to fulfill their own ambitions. But, let's hope this is not done at the cost of millions and millions of lives for human life is too precious to be lost on the basis of some caste or creed. Obviously the change won't come from the preperators of these heinous crimes as they have high stakes in the game. But the sufferers are just puppets in the show. They should be aware of the fact that they remain the ones who bore the brunt of the conflict no matter which ""side"" belonged and no matter which ever side ""wins"". They should abandon the mob mentality. Only then will there be hope and only then may be history won't repeat itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An eye opener for a crazy world,"With reviews hailing this title as an African ""Schindler's List"", i gave this movie a go, expecting it to be very good.It was good, but not very good, and not excellent. Perhaps it was too hard comparing a movie like this to Schindler's List. Either way, do not get me wrong. It is still a compelling tale as one man struggles to save some 1300 refugees during the Rwandan genocide. I was impressed with Don Cheadle's portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, which demonstrated his versatility of an actor, having recently seen him in movies such as Crash and Traffic. Worth seeing to gain a perspective? Yes. Just not that well of a movie made as it could have been in my opinion.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hotel Rwanda: Oscar Worthy Film, Cheadle for Sure ***Some Spoilers***","Although dwarfed by the national scope of the actual events, 'Hotel Rwanda' did capture succinctly sometimes even in vivid detail the horrors that were inflicted by the Hutu and Tutsi tribal factions on each other. Some say the scale of Hutu slaughter of the minority Tutsis reached genocide proportions.And as we learned from the film the Hutus did just that. One major Hutu henchmen character, George, stated it this way.'""We're half way there.""The screen play is a compelling story. Paul, (reprised masterfully by Don Cheadle) is a front-line manager at the 4 Star Des Milles Collines hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capitol. His colonial employers, the Sabena Corporation, are headquartered in Europe, Belgium to be specific.No doubt the former colonial rulers of this land still take pride in their African possession. Their resort hotel is an oasis in the hot sun not only to tourists but to foreign diplomats, international press, and domestic government officials.One of the Rwandan Army's top generals (later convicted for his role in the genocide) in the region is a frequent visitor. Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) head of the U.N. Peacekeeping force (sparse) also is an honored guest. We learn soon that the U.N. Colonel Oliver and the good Hutu general share a common trait. The both enjoy the elixir that the staff serves: imported single malt Scotch whiskey.Paul made sure the bar was always well stocked with good spirits. For certain, life at the hotel was like that of any other African resort: relaxed and far from the maddening crowd and wild animals. Both locals and hotel guests alike enjoy their stays.Paul sees to it, sometimes personally. In his presence, people are treated royally. His and the hotel's reputation depend on it.And who wouldn't want to kick up their heels in the hotel's air conditioned bar after a hot day in the Central African sun? For about 30-40 minutes I too succumbed to the hotel's luxurious ambiance and decadent pleasures. Yes, even Cohibas, the finest Cuban cigars were offered to select guests.Then the dogs of war are let loose. Rumors abound that the Hutu President was assassinated. The head of state was bound for Tanzania to sign a peace agreement with the rebel Tutsi opposition group. Later we learn from the Hutu dominated press (radio) the earlier terrible reports indeed are true.The Hutu media is quick to add their bias: the traitor Tutsi rebels performed the dastardly deed. Paul disagreed. So did I.However, the confirmed news and later evacuation of all foreign nationals from Rwanda (only if you're white or the holder of a foreign passport) places Paul, in a serious bind. He and he alone must now fend for and protect those 'guests' forced to stay.Many of the refugees are Tutsis. Knowing that fact, the Hutu machete wielding militia await outside the gates. With the grounds left unguarded, the Hutus no doubt will invade. Then the feeding (killing) frenzy starts.Their mission: kill all the traitor 'cockroaches'. That meant the Tutsis were to be singled out. Even the U.N. blinked. They laid an egg but not before Col. Nick announced that the pretty blue helmeted U.N. Armed Force was ordered to pull out of the hotel guarding business, permanently. No surprise there...Now the their situation looks hopeless. Surrounded all around by bloodthirsty Hutu militia, their supplies cut off, even the water, Paul prepares for the inevitable. He asks each guest to call a friend.In his own words, Paul knows exactly what to do: play the guilt card. He also instructs his guests on how to say 'Goodbye'.""Make them (friends) feel ashamed.""Now knowing the true aftermath of the slaughter (almost 1 million), I couldn't find fault with his tack.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Well made and realistic, but it can be depressing.","'Hotel Rwanda' is based on the Rwandan genocide which - according to Rwanda - killed around one million people during the 100-day war in 1994. Most of the victims were from the Tutsi ethnic group.Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of the four-star Hôtel des Mille Collines in Rwanda. He is of the Hutu ethnic group, while is wife Tatiana is Tutsi. When the President - being Huto - was killed by Tutsi extremists, this resulted in the start of the genocide the very next day. In an instant, Paul's life was turned into a nightmare. With Tutsis being killed, Paul had to do everything in his power to save his family.With the hotel guests having been evacuated, Paul soon had his hands full with Tutsi civilians looking for refuge at the hotel. The rest of the film sees Paul pleading for help from the United Nations, the Red Cross, and military officials. Fearing time is running out before all hell breaks out at the hotel, the film also becomes a nail-biting race against time.Don Cheadle delivered a fantastic performance as Paul. 'Hotel Rwanda' is a very well made film, but it can be depressing - even more depressing because this is based on fact, and so many innocent people lost their lives in such a short space of time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An incredible story of bravery within one of the most barbaric episodes in recent history,"The Rwandan genocide of 1994 remains one of the worst atrocities in recent history. Maybe even the very worst. After all, has there been a situation since where 800,000 people were murdered in a three month period? Not only that but they were primarily killed by being hacked to death by machetes; women, children, babies – everyone. The massacres were a result of the Hutu tribe taking vengeance on their Tutsi counterparts. The problem between the tribes had its roots in colonialism, where the Belgians had installed the Tutsis in positions of power due to them looking more 'European'. This ties in with more recent events in the Middle East where Western intervention has caused many more problems than it has resolved. Unfortunately, history has a tendency of repeating itself. But the biggest disgrace of the Rwandan situation was that the world actually did not intervene when the people of the country really needed them to. They did nothing aside from save their own citizens. The United Nations came out of it looking especially bad and completely ineffective, basically withdrawing when ten of their men were killed. The fallout was an unchecked murder spree of unbelievable proportions.The film tells the story of this horror via a true life story with a positive narrative. It focuses on a Hutu called Paul Rusesabagina who is the manager of the Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. He used his connections to save over a thousand people by giving them shelter in his hotel and by doing so putting himself in considerable danger. The narrative has some very obvious similarities to Schindler's List (1993). It's kind of a story that seems too unbelievable to be true but true it is though. It does sanitise the story somewhat though, in that it resists showing violence or too graphic results of the carnage. I think this pulling of its punches was a bad move though as this was such a dreadfully violent situation that the film would have been better served being more explicit to hammer home the true horror. The similar film Shooting Dogs (2005) presented the carnage more harshly and in some respects had more of an overall emotional impact as a result. What Hotel Rwanda does have though is Don Cheadle. Rusesabagina is played by this excellent actor in a performance of perfection. The on location shooting also contributes a lot to the overall impact. And even though the music was too forcefully Hollywood obvious at times, the drama overall was very effective in giving its message out clearly without being too contrived. All-in-all, an impressive film about a bit of history that shames the Western world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Interventionist propaganda,"This movie has some good moments, but it's mostly spoiled by the constant hammering home of the message: the West is racist because it didn't stop the massacres. If you accept this premise, then you'll probably find the film moving and meaningful; if you don't, then you may find it manipulative and rather shallow. Don Cheadle's performance is very good, and there are several moments of real tension, but I couldn't stop feeling that almost everything in the movie was designed to bludgeon the viewer and provoke guilt. As for me, I don't think France should be the policeman for the world, and neither should the United States. I see no reason that a boy from Kansas should have to die in Africa, Iraq, or any other place in order to make it safer for its own inhabitants.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Look at this soon!,"The most impressed movie that I ever saw was ""Hotel Rwanda.""I saw many kinds of movie before, but watching this movie, I cried for the first time. Hotel Rwanda is a true story. It is about a fight of a race between Hutu and Tutsi in 1994. At first, Tutsi was stronger than Hutu but the position changed. A man, who ran a famous hotel had a family. Three children and a wife. They were living happily. However, the war was getting more severe and many people were killed or forced, especially Tutsi. The man was Hutu and his rest of his family was Tutsi so they were in danger. He desperately tries to protect his family but what will happen at the end.I like this movie for many reasons. First, their acting was really great. I think Japanese can't do this kind of acting. Second, the song which sung after the movie impressed me deeply. I can't forget that song. Third, The violence scene was so grotesque that it was like a real one.If you watch this movie, nobody will say ""I didn't cry.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful -- Not Just a Political Message,"Hotel Rwanda is a great film. Yes, it has direct ties to a very heart-wrenching part of history, but what makes it powerful is the strong performance by Don Cheadle, an excellent supporting cast, great direction and storytelling.I love movies like this. I very much enjoy movies with historical settings, even if their not always accurate (not a problem with this film). But anyone can make a drama based on historical events. What matters to film is the event gets the proper focus and circles around a handful of important characters. ""Hotel Rwanda"" does just that: it shows the Rwandan genocide as it occurs within a few square kilometers with the hotel as a focal point. More importantly it shows the tragedy through the eyes of a handful of people (if you focus solely on Cheadle and miss the viewpoint of the main character's wife and children you miss a great deal). This is how great historical dramas are made. Look at ""Patton"", one of the best WWII films ever made, not because it showed the action any better than any other WWII movie, but it focuses on a single, strong character brilliantly played. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is such a movie.A great film, great performances (Cheadle was robbed of an Oscar on this one), and a powerful story. ""Hotel Rwanda"" should be shown in high schools across the country come fall.9 out of 10. Sometimes it was hard to figure out which side characters were which (perhaps that was the point based on the whole Hutu-Tutsi past), but that is only a small nit. Otherwise the film is excellent.Barky",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Don Cheadle just made me feel how it would be to find yourself the only sane person in a world devoured by hate and insanity. His performancewas mesmerizing. Just heartbreaking without being sentimental or depressing,he is totally amazing. I had enjoyed Mr. George's ""In the Name of the Father"" but nobody could have expected this film to be so monumental.

A Nutshell Review: Hotel Rwanda,"This is a powerful drama. In 1993, there was ethnic war between the Tutsis and the Hutus in Rwanda. The film highlights the horrors of war, and also brings forth that a man must do, in all his ability, to always protect his family first in times of crisis. It's sad, but true, that there is always a limit to the number of people you can help.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager whose hotel was used by the UN and world media as a base for covering the supposed peace treaty between the 2 ethnic groups, and later used as a place of safe refuge when Hutus start to ethnic cleanse the ""cockroaches"" Tutsis - it's amazing how easily hatred is bred through endless radio broadcasts.Being a Hutu himself, and married to a Tutsi, this brings forth danger to Paul himself. However, with his street smarts, and network connections, he manages to stay one step ahead of the situation, and brings hope to his family, employees, and refugees, when all seems bleak.While the West has abandoned Paul and Rwanda, Paul has shown courage and hope in turning things around, during times of violence and rampant corruption. You're as good as what you can offer to those in power - once you have nothing, you're as good as a goner. This doesn't only apply to Paul and the generals, but also, on a bigger picture, between the West and Rwanda as well.I haven't watched a lot of movies starring Don Cheadle, except for the Ocean11/12 movies. Given these shows tend to root for strong leading man types, probably Denzel Washington, Cheadle does an excellent job here.No doubt the lack of A-stars, the supporting cast gave commendable performances, see if you can spot Joaquin Phoenix underneath his bearded face! I shan't preach here, but I must state that genocide is evil, and the world cannot turn a blind eye when it happens, no matter where.Watch this film, and understand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A movie that should be seen by all.,"I guess there is no-one who can say that he or she doesn't know what has happened during the genocide in 1994 in Rwanda. The images of all the massacres, often committed with nothing more than machetes, were absolutely horrifying. But on us Belgians this event has perhaps had an even bigger impact than on other Europeans and on Americans. Not only has Rwanda, after Germany's defeat in World War I, long been a Belgian protectorate (no, just as Burundi it has never been a colony. We only had one and that was Kongo), making that we still have some kind of historical connection to the country. Our government has always helped the Rwandese with military assistance and training (except during the genocide). But we were also personally affected by the genocide when 10 of our UN peace-keepers were brutally murdered in a military camp because they tried to protect one of the Rwandese ministers. Three of them were shot, the others were hacked open with machetes. The images of the paratroopers who cut their blue berets into pieces with their bayonets, once their returned home, will never be forgotten by all those who saw it back then.""Hotel Rwanda"" doesn't show anything about that particular event, but it does give a good idea of what the rest of the entire genocide, and the reaction of the international community towards it, was like. This movie tells everything from the perspective of Paul Rusesabagina, an ordinary hotel-manager from Hutu origin who saved the lives of many Tutsi's. While the rest of the Hutu's brutally murdered every Tutsi around him, he not only protected his Tutsi wife and his children, but helped many of her relatives and friends to escape the horror by opening the hotel doors for them. Despite the fact that he didn't get much help from the UN or from the French, he was able to save over a thousand helpless refugees...I would like to say that this is a wonderful movie, but not without adding that I'm not talking about all the murders. What I like so much about this movie is that it shows how a seemingly ordinary and unarmed man was able to stand up against all those militia men, not only protecting the lives of thousand people, who would otherwise have faced a certain death, but risked his own life by doing so and didn't care. If this hadn't been based on a true story, many would have said that it was impossible, but it isn't. All this actually happened, the good things as well as the bad. The makers of this movie have recreated it all very well and certainly have done some great research about the reasons and the attitude of the international community.The acting in this movie was also outstanding. Don Cheadle did a perfect job in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina and Nick Nolte was excellent in his role as the Canadian Colonel Oliver, but that doesn't mean that the other, less known actors, weren't at least as good as them. They all did a wonderful job, lifting this movie far above average. If there is one thing that I could have a remark about, than it must be the fact that they speak English, instead of French. But that's such a little detail, that I'm very willing to forget about it. It didn't really bother me and it certainly didn't spoil the rest of the movie for me.Overall this is a movie that should be seen by all. Not only because we should never forget what has happened over there in 1994, but also because we should hope this is a lesson for those who are planning on doing it and for those who never did anything about it. I give this movie a well-deserved 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"9/10: A film both moving and inspirational, shaming and compelling","Not since Cry Freedom has a film so honestly told the story of one man.Not since Schindler's List has a film so frankly highlighted the atrocities of a 20th Century conflict.Not since Uprising has a film so sincerely shown the efforts of a small few to assist helpless refugees.This film is a powerful and compelling story of the strength of one man, Paul Rusesabagina, who opened the doors of his hotel to 1000 refugees when civil war broke out in 1994. It is open and honest in its depiction of the neglect the world showed by turning it's back on the situation. In its dealing of the situation, the film manages to construct hope and doses of humour amongst tense and frightening situations.The acting is stellar, with Don Cheadle (Paul Rusesabagina) in the performance of his career providing true despair and emotion throughout the film. Sophie Okenedo as Paul's wife Tatiana is superb in bringing real concern and fear to the role. Even Nick Nolte surprised me in his characterisation of Colonel Oliver (real life: Romeo Dallaire).In its depiction of the horrific event, the film deals with themes and issues including racism, family, politics, culture and religion. All these issues are dealt with in an honest and sincere way.Although the film holds back on showing horrific scenes of genocide, it manages to draw much emotion from the audience, moving many viewers to tears (myself included). This is largely due to the actors ability and the structuring of the crucial scenes.This is not a film for someone who wants simply to be entertained. This is not a film for the lighthearted. It is film for those who wish to become enlightened as to the horrific events of 1994. See this film for its historical benefit (as well as it excellent script and acting). This is the first (in my knowledge) feature film made about the event and those involved. The film has very very few flaws; it is a perfect depiction of the efforts of Paul Rusesabagina.Much like its historical counterparts (Cry Freedom, Schindler's List and Uprising), it is an accurate and truthful representation of the events. However, if one thing should be said to make the film more powerful it would be to have included a little more (in the story) of the genocide and to tie up one (or two) loose ends. However, the filmmakers clearly made this film in the hope of telling Paul Ruseasbagina's story with the 'backdrop' / setting being the Rwanda Civil War. So it can be overlooked if this was the intention.An excellent film!!! Kudos to all!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing Movie!!,"I can't say enough about this movie.I would like to say that Don Cheadle is not simply the best African American actor out there, but is one of the best actors out there period.I would even venture to say he was robbed of the Oscar this year.His performance was subtle, and yet had so many different layers, it is impossible to describe. What Paul Rusesabagina did was simply amazing, and speaks to what one person can do, how one person can make a true difference in the world. This man and Don Cheadle with his amazing performance, truly touched my heart.Kudos also go out to Sophie Okonedo as Paul's unwaveringly supportive and loving wife, and the the children in this movie were also wonderful.This is a movie that speaks to the human spirit and should NOT be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
U.N for / against humanity??,"this movie represents so much what what Africa is made of. we talk of globalization and helping the needy. this is a true life incident when all the super powers of the world, took much longer than they should have to help Rwanda. i guess the reason for it was probably they all had no personal gains. when it comes to the central Asia and the oil rich gulf, the superpowers really stop at nothing to go all out to help them and use all their resources.its a shame that the world knows so little about Africa and how much we criticise their backwardness, i think this movie is a must see for all, in terms of true life incident, world history, acting, music, drama and finally HUMANITY.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An amazing emotionally drenching film that you can't take your eyes off,"I didn't know much of the genocide that happened at Rwanda though I had heard brief talkings of it so this film was very intriguing for me to watch. What starts out as a man called Paul (played magnificently by Don Cheadle) who has the unfortunate burden of being the protector of hundreds of people who will surely be killed by the opposing party during a civil war. What we see is the conflicts of these characters who are trying to stay alive as the world abandons them.This film is truly gripping from start to finish. It is a very powerful film that makes you care about the characters so much and makes you marvel at the cruelty of humanity. What you see is a man who does not want to get involved in the corrupt politics of his surroundings and just wants to run a nice hotel, but then ultimately becomes the hero to many people in order to save them. You also learn of the selfishness of powerful countries such as America an the UK in how they simply do not see countries such as Rwanda as of any significance for them.The film has terrific performances from everyone, the violence is not as bloody as what I thought it would be but it has a high degree of realism that it becomes violent in your mind and through what you can only imagine is happening in the slaughter. A movie like this can only bring out the compassion in you, and I would find it hard to believe that you would not be moved by this film.Essentially, this is a story that is really nothing new, as it is a movie that you probably can predict it going in a certain way, but you really don't care. You just get swept up in this magnificent tale of a man simply aiming to protect the people of a nation that has gone into turmoil. This is a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An awesomely done film about an awful event,"The events in Rwanda between the Tutsis and the Hutus happened when I was in high school. I didn't know much about it then except that it was a horrific event. ""Hotel Rwanda"" did an incredible job telling the story to the audience and showing the ruthless and gruesome nature in which the Hutus treated the Tutsis. No person with a pulse could help but be moved by this movie. As a human being first and as a Black person second, I was grief stricken to see how people from the same country and of the same color could relentlessly kill based upon a stamp on an I.D. card. This movie showed how hate can drive humans to behave like animals and it showed how kind and merciful people can be as well. In this movie there was bravery, cowardice, honor, humiliation, kindness, and ruthlessness. I'm no film critic, but I could not find anything I disliked about the movie, just things I disliked about the event.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Amazing movie experience, all need to see this","Hotel Rwanda is a an amazing movie and a story that needs to be told. The Rwandan genocide, lasting just a few months, was one of the greatest tragedies among many in the twentieth century. The US, Europe and the UN stood by and watched and this leaves us lessons for current conflicts in Sudan and other parts of Africa. As a movie, Hotel Rwanda is wonderful. Don Cheadle is perfect as Paul, tough and determined but full of doubt and fear. Any of us could be Paul but few would have the guts and strength. Some reviewers have claimed the movie is too Hollywood or does not show the true violence, but the use of sound, facial emotions and scenery forces the viewer to put themselves in the place of a Rwandan, not an American viewer. The movie is almost a documentary of what happened but is also very moving and an appropriate length. All in our theater were choked up with emotion at the end. I spent time in Tanzania in 2003, next door to Rwanda. East Africa is still dealing with the repercussions of the Rwandan genocide and so should the world. We all need to do what we can to prevent such conflicts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
hotel rwanda,"Cheadle's study in pure, unvarnished decency (obviously a little too pure for some IMDB skeptics) is skillful in its avoidance of the twin pillars of sentimentality and sanctimony but otherwise this film is your typical pat yourself on your liberal back/ Oscar bait that, while aiming for ""Killing Fields"", scores at best a glancing blow at ""Exodus"". Give it a generous C plus for Don and Fana Mokoena who plays a Hutu tyrant with a love for all things Scottish.

Hotel Rwanda will hit you harder than the majority of the movies you've seen,"Hotel Rwanda was a touching, shocking, and very powerful film. I was surprised filmmakers waited a whole 10 years to make a movie about one of the biggest massacres of all time.Hotel Rwanda tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, in a career best performance), a hotel manager who is forced to turn his hotel into a refugee camp to save his family and the refugees from the massacre that took place in Rwanda in 1994.The first question that will come across your mind while watching HR is ""why have we become so cruel?"", and no wonder one character asked the exact same question during the movie. You'll see roads covered with corpses, the males of the dominant tribe, The Hutus, raping females of the other tribe, The Tutsis, and Hutus slaughtering Tutsis on the streets. And then the United Nations, in one of their biggest failures of all time, decided to rescue only the Westerners (by making them leave the country) and leave the people of Rwanda to die alone. And Hotel Rwanda isn't afraid to show everything. I wonder how they could get away with a PG-13 rating.After that, I think you'll feel ashamed. In the best scene of the movie, an American cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix, in a great cameo), had to leave the country after the infamous UN decision. When his Ruandan friend begs him to take her with him, he says with teary eyes ""I've never felt so ashamed"". And frankly, I was ashamed too. I didn't try to donate money, or protest, or do anything for that country, and that's why I felt I (along with millions of people around the world) was responsible for what happened. I even think your average Joe will never know this massacre happened in the first place. And that's another great thing about Hotel Rwanda: It reminded us of that horrible event.And I have to disagree with the people that said the somewhat uplifting ending ruined the movie for them. In fact, I can't find a better ending for the movie. That ending happened in real life, and it shows that despite all the cruelness in the world, there's still some hope left.So, I'd definitely recommend Hotel Rwanda. Being a true story, it will hit you harder and touch you more than the majority of the movies you've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda,"Don Cheadle is super as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Belgian-owned hotel in Kigali in 1994 during the civil strife that saw Hutus relentlessly and ruthlessly persecute the minority Tutsis in Rwanda. Once he is directly touched by one such incident, he decides that he must do something to help and so turns his luxury accommodation into a refuge for hundreds of dispossessed and terrified people. With the help the Red Cross and some foreign press he walks a delicate tightrope trying to keep everyone safe, fed and watered. This is a brave and compelling story of the unimaginable brutality and ultimately compassion that stays with you long after you've finished watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Impacting and Heartfelt Reality,"Under the security blanket of America, we tend to forget or ignore the destruction that is occurring throughout the world. We may catch a glimpse of the danger present in foreign countries, but we put it off as out of our control. Yet Hotel Rwanda shows the viewer the tragic consequences of inaction in the face of genocide.The main character of Hotel Rwanda is Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who looks out for his family in Rwanda, and who stands as an innocent bystander in Rwanda's civil war between the Hutu and the Tutsis. The Hutu forces are on the attack, and although Paul is Hutu, he must take a stand to protect the Tutsis being persecuted. His wife, Tatiana, a Tutsi, does not face the situation as calmly as Paul, because she is very protective of her children. These two main performances are extremely impressive and bring a lot of the emotional power of the film as well as to the characters themselves. Supporting cast includes Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver from the UN and Joaquin Phoenix as a cameraman who catches on film the atrocities of the occurrences outside the ever-crumbling walls of the hotel. Nolte does a very good job in his position of helplessness, but Phoenix puts in a far less-impressive bit role.The screenplay, written by Keir Pearson and Terry George is very good, and the dialogue shows the strength of a few, the helplessness of many, and the evil of those who started executing innocent people out of their own selfish ambition. The film reminds us, albeit through simple direction, of the destruction of which we as human beings are capable, but it also shows us the power of love for others. Some parts of the film are so hard to watch and so emotional, that one cannot help but remember them vividly. The power of Gregson-Williams' and Guerra's score stands out especially in such scenes.If only films with such heart could be made without flaw! Although the flaws are outweighed, in my mind, by the film's message and stunning images, they must be mentioned. As I alluded to earlier, the acting of those in smaller roles is below par. Also, there seemed to be a kind of alacrity of direction throughout the film, as if George were attempting to speed through the film. This does not take much from the film's power, but the viewer is left with little time to take in each specific scene in order to understand the movie as a whole. Further, the song played in the credits, ""Million Voices,"" seems poorly hashed together, so that the viewer cannot think to his full potential upon the film in all its intensity.Ironically enough, the film's strength increases when we see that we too are in a sense responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, because we leave the theater still unwilling to take action to help the helpless. The film is sadly flawed, but incredible in its message and force.Final Grade: B+.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Truly A Film Everyone Should See,"In my sophomore year of college, I write a paper for my English class about the Rwandan genocide. I was well versed and knowledgeable about the atrocities that went on in April of 1994. I was, however, not prepared for the wide array of emotions felt by watching this film. The human cost of watching this film is astounding. As a member of the audience you will be terrified and enraged at the lack of concern given to the Rwandan people by the world community. But over and above the all, it is a story that needed to be told. Don Cheadle gives a performance which is only matched by the film greats. The story itself is the cinematic portrayal of humanity, both the ugly and the beautiful.

"A powerful journey, filmed beautifully and acted well","This is probably one of the most touching stories i have seen in film in the past year. Hotel Rwanda tells the story of a courageous man who is a manager of a five-star hotel in the genocide period. The screenplay is superb, great character that we can all relate to. The direction was quite beautiful and equipped with a suitable and graceful score. The acting was great as well, Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo and Jean Reno all gave great performances. Joaquin Phoenix didn't have many scenes but was great as well. I didn't particularly like Nolte's performance too much, seemed a bit wooden in this one to me. The film however is great, great storytelling, definitely one of the best film of this kind of genre.

Touching the dark side of humankind...,"A powerful subject. Real people. Real events. Seems like a formula for success, right? Well yes, but almost not quite. For those unaware of the 1994 Rwanda genocide or its details, it's an amazing chance to look from the inside out instead of the outside in. Unfortunately, save for a few scenes and the panic in people's faces, we don't really feel the full impact of the slaughter. Over the course of several months, approximately 800,000 men, women, and children were butchered simply because of their fictionalized ethnicity provided by the Belgian colonialists. That's a lot of zeros. And yet, from the movie, it feels as if a few of those zeros are missing.Still, it does not detract from the seriousness of the subject or the quality of the film. Hotel Rwanda is, by far, one of the better movies out there. The acting is good, despite the fact that I can't stand watching the fellow who plays Romeo Dallaire, the UN general, as he clops about like a plow horse. This film has the ability to open eyes and bring attention to the genocide, which is the most important thing about it.

Movies based on true stories don't always work... Hotel Rwanda is Exceptionally Brilliant,"Imagine that you have the responsibility of a hundred lives. You are watching your only hope going away while you are standing in the rain and can do nothing but save as many lives you can...You won't understand this unless you have seen the movie. Hotel Rwanda is a fragment of cinema that shows the ugly truth of this world: Life is not always fair. This movie is marvelous, not because it's based on true events it's because the cameras captured the recreated events very beautifully. There is a reason why this movie has a low rating on IMDb. (yes it's quite low in my opinion) It deserves to be with Movies like Schindler's List and Godfather. You will know that reason once you have seen it.Don Cheadle was great and I was surprised that he didn't won the Oscar. The performances really are great. Especially in the scene when all the foreign tourists are leaving the hotel and Paul watches them, standing in the rain, as they go away safely from the riots leaving the Rwandans... the emotions run deep. You even see a lady holding a dog in the bus. Now that's creativity!I would recommend this to everyone. It's a unique movie with a very different style of film-making.

Wonderful!,"1) Cheadle was amazing...I believe that any other year he would have won the Oscar.2) The film did a very good job of interpreting the situation. It explained the intricacy of the foreign policy that was going on at the time in a way that most people should have been able to understand (i.e. that UN peace keeping officers cannot fire guns, the UN charter does not allow unilateral interventions by countries who want to help) The only thing that would have made this film more powerful was if it had shown some of the more gruesome atrocities...I believe that is one of the key elements that made Schindler's List a perfect film.Finally, I am so glad this film was made because I thought that, for sure, the Rwandan crisis was never going to be felt by western society.

A fatuous effort at dramatizing something more dramatic,"I was disappointed in every aspect of this movie. The events that were supposedly depicted, including the background of genocide in Rwanda, were insipidly portrayed, pure Hollywoood hokum. The casting was mediocre, especially Nick Nolte, but also including most of the smaller parts, although Don Cheadle and his wife were portrayed competently. It was an obvious attempt to take a single series of events--the actions of this hotel manager--and parlay them into a typical movie format, when the Rwandan genocide deserved, indeed deserves, much more significant treatment. The one redeeming feature of the film was its portrayal of the cowardly and bigoted manner in which the West dealt with the tragedy, but even that was done without impact.

"Should have been a ""Best Picture"" nominee","In a less competitive year, this film would have received its due as an Oscar contender. In addition to the top notch lead acting performances (which did receive nods), the movie tells a compelling story in a manner that perfectly balances horror with humanity. Mel Gibson could use lessons from this director in how much more effective suffering can be conveyed when it is done with more subtlety and restraint so the audience is never numbed by tragedy, but rather is kept constantly feeling with the characters so as to even laugh with them at the occasional light moment.The script may not be conventionally catchy in terms of original dialogue, but it allows the film to move well while presenting many of the characters (even some of the villains) as three-dimensional human beings. When people do things -- even those that may seem unwise -- we understand why they made that choice, which avoids the ""why would anyone do that"" problems that so annoy me in other movies.All in all, the film that should have had the ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Ray"" slot on Oscar night.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An important movie,"Everybody should see this movie and even more our leaders. And they should feel ashame that they didn't act when the genocide was going on in 1994.

Just look at what's going on in Darfur.Contrary to most people, I don't think Don Cheadle gave an Oscar winning performance. It's sometimes uneven. But Sophie Okonedo was just great. As for Nick Nolte, it was hard for me to really like him, because I was just thinking of General Roméo Dallaire, the true hero who was leading the incapacitated U.N. team.

A very powerful and disturbing account,"Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a real life hero, who risked everything he had, too save as many as he could; while the governments of the world that could have helped, stood by and did nothing. Obvious comparisons have been made between this and Schindler's list, and the harrowing truths in both films do stir the emotions and enlighten the blind to the real tragedies in the world, but the films and the stories within them are very different.Just over ten years ago some of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind took place in the country of Rwanda, and yet in the media driven world in which we live; these events went almost unnoticed by the general public and were ignored by the powers that may have helped.Even without the production quality of Schindler's list, this film still proves to be equally as powerful; so much so, that i felt ashamed that such things had really happened during my adult life, and i'm sure anyone who sees this movie will feel the same way.Don Cheadle excellently portrays the hero, a ordinary man named Paul Rusesabagina, who offered shelter to over a thousand people at great risk to himself and his own family. Over a period of just three months; one million people were brutally murdered, and if one man managed to save over one thousand others, imagine how many could and should have been spared their terrible fate.The story simply has to move you, even if the film itself may appear a little cheap looking, but to me it isn't, it's realistic and shocking.9/10 Well done",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Shameful and compelling.,"Summary: HOTEL RWANDA stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a real lifetime hotel manager who became a courageous hero in Kigali when he witnessed the horrifying massacre of the Tutsis by the Hutu extremists in Rwanda, while the rest of the world looked on and did nothing about it. The massacre was part of one of the few of the worst atrocities in humankind history and it really occurred in April 1994, now twenty years ago. This is a story that really happened and it isn't fictional. 4 or maybe 5 parts of the true reality were changed in the film, but overall the movie mostly shows what really happened, I think. This is the kind of dramatic motion picture which completely catches your attention and drives you through the minds and emotions experienced by the leading characters. This is a story that I believe everyone should pay careful attention because Hotel Rwanda is truly sobering and heartfelt, and I'm really not kidding about it. In my opinion, everyone should like this movie and pay close attention to the way characters behave, because that's mainly what captured my mind and made me like the film. My comments are that the actors who had the main lead in the story all played well and were believable inside the skin of their characters they were interpreting. Don Cheadle and Sophie Kurlenko had an excellent performance and I won't ever forget it. Their performance was well done, because the magnitude of their performance was so high and that really shows the power of the human struggle and how much they care about the problems taking place around them. Plus, the film has feel-good warmth, is constantly filled with one problem after another, has a sparklingly original, well written screenplay and that's all great. This isn't a movie about action, but about the human heart and don't already think in advance that the movie will be boring with not enough action. JUST go watch it and see it for yourself.

I give this film a 10 out of 10 i know this world is full of hatred and barbarians but................. never have i been moved by a scene such as the misty road scene. The struggles and trials and tribulations of Don Cheadle playing Paul a man ""playing both sides"" and his ""cockroach"" family and staff make me wonder exactly what the character and indeed the actor went through to achieve the tension the success and the horror to what the people of Rwanda must and did go through. The scenes were beautifully shot and even the ""chopping"" were to add a sense of reality to the situation for want of a better word. It can be compared to ""Schindlers List"" and even ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the ""Reality"" of the world today that it brings.

"""I promise to tell your story""","With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed. HOTEL RWANDA is not only a well written (Keir Pearson), well directed (Terry George), well acted (entire cast) work of cinematic history, it serves as a thunderingly loud announcement of how the world ignored the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Africa - a country whose only exports are tea and coffee and therefore not high on the agendas of importance of the other nations of the world. HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers. How many of us knew about this incident before now? But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people, and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters. With Belgium's exit the two parties were placed in delicate balance and long years of struggle for control resulted in the 1994 disaster.The senselessness of the genocide is shown by the selection of victims for which the Tutsi rebels depended on registration cards to identify Tutsis from Hutus: in reality the people had intermarried - even Hutu Paul was married to Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) - so that the killings were wholly irrational. Given this madness, Paul struggles with the insurgency and gives shelter to as many people as he can squeeze into his hotel, refugees including orphan Tutsis, hotel staff, and friends and fellow countrymen in need of a Gilead. All of this is happening while the United Nations contingency led by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) is impotent and the outside reporters such as Jack Daglich (Joaquin Phoenix) grab footage of the slaughter and flee to safety. Only a Red Cross nurse Pat Archer (Cara Seymour) remains to assist in any way she can. Paul attempts to contact the outside world through his employer Mr. Tillens (Jean Reno) of the Belgian Sabena Airlines, but the world refuses to recognize the reality of Paul's plight in saving his countrymen.The cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okoneda are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb. The DVD opens with a statement from Don Cheadle the actor, the movie unfolds, and the remainder of the CD includes 'the making of' sequences and historical segments that for once are not self-serving aggrandizement, but sensitively informing pleas for understanding and digestion of a genocide that was ignored. This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A disturbing and unsettling piece of truth and cinema,"Ten years after the atrocities and genocide in Rwanda, Africa, a movie is made about the man who helped lessen the loss. The man who gave everything he had in order to save complete strangers. Who put his life on the line for his fellow human beings. I couldn't possibly put to words how hard it was for me to hold back the tears for almost all of this movie(which I had to, due to the crowd I saw it with). Some of these tears weren't ones of sadness... they were at the beauty inherent in this person. This humanitarian. With everything to lose and nothing to gain, he selflessly helped people who had nothing to offer him in return. This movie reminded me of Schindler's List. However, as one of the other viewers pointed out to me, it's far easier to distance yourself from that... with all possible respect to any and all victims of it, World War 2 ended over 60 years ago. What this movie depicts is just over a decade ago. Genocide. Which took place while us in the West sat far away, comfortable and not affected by it... and we did nothing. No UN, no US forces, nothing. This film is incredibly touching. I can't see anyone watching and not being emotionally involved. The plot is well-written and intriguing. The pace is perfect. It never moved too slow or too fast. It started adequately slow, but moved intensely later on. The acting is all spot-on. The writing is excellent. A great film that everyone should see. I recommend this to everyone who can sit through. Watch it if you get the chance and you're hardened enough to take it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent Film,"I really wish people would stop gushing about how GREAT this film is, how it made you CRY, MOAN, WEAP, GENUFLECT, etc. YES, I agree that the film is brilliant. It GETS one's attention. IT is a story powerfully told. Unfortunately, it also inspires a general sense (to my mind, and after reading some of the posts here) of armchair philanthropy. Stasis. Inactivity. It is great that there is a film that takes Africa and individualized Africans figures, seriously as its primary Subject, tells the story from an African point of view. This is the first mainstream film (to my mind, that has done this). Africa, as a concept, is most often seen as a massive, dirty, backwards ""Heart of Darkness"", unexplored unless by prying, objectifying news cameras (starving children with snot running out of their noses etc.) The fault doesn't lie with the film (it is quite firm about its contempt for the ""West's"" strategic lack of agency). The problem lies with people like YOU, quite happy to sing the film praises, but not much else. There is a post further down that (flippantly) refers to this film as ""This year's Schindler's List"". What a cheek! Yes, this may be one of those ""never forget what happened film's"", but while the Holocaust recedes ever further into history, atrocities of similar proportions still happen on this continent (I am a South-African). The speed and force with which the ""Rwanda"" happened forced the West (retrospectively) to sit up and listen. Although slower, other protracted battles/hotspots(a misnomer no doubt coined by that beast CNN) continue to shock the mind out of comprehension. Angola, for example only recently (three years ago) ended an over twenty year civil war (see, in Africa its ""on again: and ""off again: so no-one really knows how long these things last and whether or not they ever truly end, case in point: Sudan. The list goes on. To list ""issues"", rant-style, here would be counter-intuitive, to my mind. Go find out.Hopefully there will be more films about African SUBJECTS in the future.Most of the major supporting actors are South-African (and they all give performances as good as Cheadle's). It was mainly filmed in and around Soweto (in Johannesburg, where I live).Calling this film ""this years Schindler's LIst"" is, to put it lightly, unconscionable. Think ""historically specific"" next time, hey? Rant Over.Do something from your end. Find out how. Avoid condescension.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Two Words!,"WOW! Two Words: Powerful Movie! There are honestly no words to describe, how powerful Hotel Rwanda actually is. I just saw this movie last night and I didn't have a clue what the movie was actually about. All I had heard was that this movie was such a awesome movie and that I should see it.OK this movie is based on historical events. The movie is about two different kinds of people, the Tutis and the Hutu. How can you tell the difference, this is exactly what I thought. This is how it was explained to me was the Tutis have lighter color skin than the Hutu do, they are the darker color. This movie is based on what happened in Rwanda in 1994. Where these two different kinds of people were at war. The exact thing that happened back in 1994 in Rwanda, is now currently happening in the Congo right now.Wow, what a excellent performance from Don Cheadle. Don Cheadle did an excellent job in playing Paul Rusesabagina. I am really glad that he received a Best Actor Nomination for this movie as in the way he portrays his character, was so excellent. Plus all the supporting actors/actress did a phenomenon job in those roles, they played.This movie should have received a ton of Oscar Nominations as it was such an excellent movie, one of the Best Dramas of the year. But since the awards season is over, they only received one nomination that I know of.Like Honestly, this movie was so awesome. If you are reading this review, and you haven't seen the movie yet, I really encourage you to watch it. Wow I could hardly sit still through this movie has it was really intense to watch. I have never been so touched by a movie before and also this is one of the best movies, I have seen in years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not funny at all,"Billed as a comedy about a wacky hotel owner and his incompetent staff managing a hotel in the face of a massive genocide, this movie has a few laughs but nothing that lives up to the hype. Worth a look but it's no ""Fawlty Towers.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hype Followed By Disappointment,"Having viewed the HBO production, ""Sometimes In April"" with a very similar story-line, etc, I was extremely disappointed with the overall presentation of ""Hotel Rwanda"" on most comparative levels including acting, continuity, and length. On the other hand, I thoroughly respected HBO's handling of this most sensitive and disgraceful Rwandan situation which was effectively portrayed by a virtually unknown cast of extremely talented actors. This is not to say that Don Cheadle and his supporting cast did not perform admirably, but I feel that the caliber of overall acting certainly did not warrant Academy Award consideration.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Extremely good,"I'm so glad I went to see Hotel Rwanda. At first I avoided it because I was afraid it would be too violent or political. But the film handled this brilliantly. The emotion and violence of the events are evident but you don't see the worst directly.The movie reminded me of other political films. But this one is so much more uplifting and entertaining. It's truly a human story that's so much more effective because it's true. You see the events mainly through one man's eyes. It really is a hero film that shows how tragedy can bring out the best in people not just for caring about others, but for being strong, calm and setting an example.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda: 8/10,"Whenever anyone mentions the Oscar-nominated (and hopefully winning) Hotel Rwanda, they (present company included) feel obliged to sing a parody of The Eagles's ""Hotel California"". Both are rather similar, actually. Both deal with destruction, whether it be small or massive, as is the case with Hotel Rwanda. I knew little of the Rwandan genocide (all of my information had come from a 6th grade teacher-her son was in Rwanda during the aftermath). Although movies can never not have a bias, I feel like seeing Hotel Rwanda was necessary in learning about something I otherwise wouldn't've. Plus, there's Don Cheadle.Cheadle is Paul Rusesabagina, the owner of a high-scale hotel in Rwanda for rich white tourists. During this, the Hutus and Tutsis are in the middle of a genocide, leaving no one out of danger. Paul and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) open up their hotel to any refugees (whether they be Tutsi or Hutu), as Nick Nolte comes in and attempts to shake off the heroin he shot up during the filming of The Good Thief.Hotel Rwanda shows the true inhumanity man can have onto man. It opens up the door for people to examine how people treat each other. Showing how personally brutal this genocide was to the Rusesabaginas, and how it should have been to everyone else. The movie did an outstanding job of yelling at us Westerners for not really caring about Rwanda at that time (and we still really don't). There's not really much I can say on this movie. Everything stands out about it, especially Cheadle. If he wasn't up against Jamie Foxx for the Oscars, I'd root for him. But then there's the case of Sophie Okonedo. I really don't know what bugged me about her, but it just ruined the movie for me. Instead of this toweringly powerful film, it's just a very good one because of Sophie Okonedo. I really don't know what it was, but I recommend you see it and tell me.My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 on appeal for violence, disturbing images and brief strong language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hotel Rwanda - Makes Us Consider,"British Co-writer, producer/director Terry George (The Promise '17) has certainly carved out a name for being a maker of films to give us cause to think. He's also capable of showing the un-show able without resorting to sensationalised cinema 'stylized' violence - in fact, his great control allows us to be horrified & moved to tears with a remarkable lack of explicitness. So effective is his approach, the viewer feels as though they were watching an unfolding documentary account. His performers give remarkably convincing portrayals, leaving no doubt that cast and crew all shared Mr George's passion for this tragic cause. Excellent production values ensure an involving experience without overdone visual CGI excesses - making all that we do see so convincingly real. Some have drawn comparisons to Schindler's List but, that was stylized Hollywood, where' Rwanda' is all raw soul - giving it a far more compelling believability.Much of the world apologised for its inaction --after the event-- but only following certain serving personnel and press witnesses having publicly shamed them into doing so. This brings into question the true effectiveness of the UN - and the responsibility of the politically 'economic' heart of the developed world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Shaming and compelling, but what does this tell us about foreign policy","I was a little suspicious of this subject in George's hands given how some of the facts of his previous wok had been distorted for dramatic effect. I'm not sure if he has indulged himself again here, but I would not question the power or message the film conveys.But I wonder how many in the current anti-war movement ask themselves what exactly they would have had the west do in this, or any similar, situation given their shameful queasiness when confronted with uncontrollable atrocity and human rights abuses, such as in Iraq, Afghanistan and, in this case, Rwanda.It seems when faced with corrupt, insane murderous extremism such as practised by the likes of the Interehamwe, the Taliban, the Baathists - and currently the Janjaweed in Sudan - only force will do, and complicity in the status quo to preserve self interest is unacceptable.This thinking is, of course, a neo-conservative cornerstone and underpins much of its foreign policy theory - to its credit. In 1994 Clinton stood idly by and history shamefully glosses over this when it comes his presidency. Indeed he would have done the same in Bosnia had the British among others persuaded him not to.It is to our shame that while the west intervened in the Balkans Rwanda was left to implode, and equally depressing that the current (Tutsi) Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame, shows all the signs of playing to type as another despotic, militant for whom power is a means to an end, and something to be abused, as he conducts similar excursions into neighbouring DRC.Ultimately, though, this film should make audiences think and not forget the words of Dalliaire when Paul proposes a toast when the troops arrive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A masterpiece,"There are plenty of good reviews about this movie. It's very difficult to top them and I'll spend no effort to do so. This is about the genocide in our living memory which we indifferently watched on TV screens just like J. Phoenix put it while he was shooting a footage as a reporter in the movie. The reality of the scenes hits you so hard as to make you think you could be one of those souls stranded in the hotel if you were born under wrong circumstances. The acting, directing, story telling, everything about this movie looks impeccable. Technically, there could be some minor flaws to a trained eye, but the little cinematographic details are simply obstructed by the sheer power of the story. A movie about a million people who were butchered with machetes can't escape the violent and disturbing scenes but the blood and gore were craftily kept spare to keep the focus on human drama. Even then, you feel the violence much more powerfully than cheap Tarantino movies, in which brains and guts are lavishly splattered all over the place for redneck audience consumption. In the same vein, I can't imagine any horror flick that could instill the same kind of horror that this movie will fill you with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This movie is the most distressing I've ever watched!,"My wife and I watched this movie in Fremantle yesterday afternoon and although I had a rough idea about what I was about to watch, the actual movie was far stronger than I had anticipated. The producer, director and writer, Terry George, must be congratulated for bringing to the screen such a horrendous story and yet making that story palatable to the extent that it is nominated for Academy Awards in a number of categories. Beyond that I was struck by the deftness with which he handled the unthinkable through elucidating the reasons the civil war massacres were taking place-the anger that motivated the participants. So often writers leave the audience in complete dark as to these motivations for some terrible event-the perpetrators are: simply fill in the words-mad, evil, stupid, directed, etc. We disagree with the bloodletting but we have no reasons to account for it.Georges decision to cast Dan Cheadle in the lead role was inspirational-Cheadle handled a demanding role so well that I thought I was watching TV footage or a documentary. All the actors were superb and all contributed to this total feeling of ""realness."" I could talk about every person on the screen but perhaps my favourite was Fano Mokoena who played the Huto general who maintained the hotel sanctuary. Beyond Mokoena was Nick Nolte's portrayal of a Canadian Peace Keeper-I love Nolte's work but this small role was one of his best.Please see the movie-it's one of those rare movies that has so much light to shed on a piece of history people would rather not see.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Beautiful Acting but Unemotional Plot,"After watching this movie the only thing really there to do is to applause the performances given by the actors. Don Cheadle gives the defining performance of his career and support from Djimon Hounsuo, Nick Nolte, Sophie Okenedo, and Joaquin Pheonix set this film's acting on a new level. The plot though is just not as emotional as it should have been. Every point were a gut wrenching powerful scene should have occurred this movie takes the quicker thrill route which does make the movie seem just empty at points. Luckily every scene were this is evident there are amazing actors around to back it up and keep the film going on. That is what really makes this movie worth the price of admission or rental is just to see these sensational performances. Though Nick Nolte really doesn't do anything for the film (as usual), his acting style does add a good feeling towards the films character analysis. The best part is watching Don Cheadle's character age and alter during the entire film. I highly recommend you jump out of your seat and head to your local theater as soon as possible. The acting in this film is just mesmerizing and the script is well designed for your average every day movie goer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best English spoken movie I've seen so far,"Personally, I try not to watch anything made or even touched by Hollywood, or anything that could be considered mainstream, as I feel that would constitute the utmost treachery against the art of cinema. With such a sentiment, I end up staying away from most English spoken movies, unless synchronous recommendations come from a dozen or more people whose tastes I trust. This time it was different, I had to watch this movie for a Mass Media & Communication course project on globalization. Boy, I'll remember this professor with positive feelings until my last breath, because he made me watch this film! I would have never watched it otherwise, the sole reason being the spoken language, and now I think I'd have missed A LOT. I've seen a few other excellent English spoken films (American, British, or else), but this one outsmarts them all, by far too!I had to come to IMDb and verify that the main actor isn't the actual person who experienced all this. Strangely enough, he hasn't even experienced any incident as such (most likely?), but his acting was so flawless that I even thought he could have been the real ""hero"" of the story. Are the others doing a weaker job? Hell no! Every single detail is simply perfect about the movie. I didn't see anything wrong even with the smallest roles, for example the soldier guys shooting around. The script stays true to the original as well, the soundtrack is perfect, the settings are well put, everything is just great!Considering the topic the movie revolves around, it could very well have ended up being overly political. But that's also taken care of; the movie has a plentiful load of content that gives direct political messages, but in spite of the abundance and might of such, it doesn't drown the plot. Speaking of which, the plot encompasses an engrossing thriller, an astounding drama, and a heart-aching pile of romance, all embroidered with epic motives.There must be more movies like this, holding the looking glass on the dirty deeds carried out by seemingly innocent corporate entities. Witnessing the consequential atrocities as such, triggered by the work of earlier missionaries, who supposedly went over to Africa (and to other destinations) to teach them civilization (whatever that is), I guess it's safe to assume that no one is anywhere as innocent as they seem.The movie itself with its art and story, its political messages, the soundtrack, everything is wonderful.

In my personal opinion i think this is a fantastic movie becasue it's really shocking people. This movie shows different personality of people at different situation and it also shows that human can be kind eventhough the disaster is coming. The plot that shown in the is awesome. I think it perfectly return to the original condition in Rwanda and the facial expressions of every actor is just like they're in the disaster and facing the massacre.

"Overwhelmingly Astonishing War Drama, Must See","Rwandan genocide was a bleak, bloody, ruthless and violent page in African history, and Hutu massacring Tutsi and UN Forces also suffering casualties is no small thing to depict. A bad filmmaker would make this into a sweet melodrama with all the clichés and trite ideas. A good director has made this heavy story into a real must see foe everyone who wanna know about what genocide is and how awful vile people may behave. Terry George made a great work here, showing just one page of that tragic book - hotelier Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, saving hundreds of both Tutsi and Hutu from immediate murder and shame. His actions are shown as actions not of a super hero, but a mere man of flesh and blood, but with guts and valor to withstand the threat, deceive the killers gently, buy the time, do all one can do in such gruesome situation, and thus save those people. Don Cheadle is a highlight of this as a main hero, and his dignity, vigor, skills and power shine all throughout the movie. Nick Nolte as an UN officer is another great stronghold here, brave and level-headed man of duty and word. Even the cameos of such stars as Joaquin Phoenix or Cara Seymour are absolute treat. And then, there are all those vile, brutal Hutu warriors with machete and guns, cold-blooded and intolerant. They are shown so deeply true that they awake sheer terror and shiver.

Paying attention to situations like this, occurring right now, all over our globe, helps us to become more aware that we are all in this life together.

Well-told story of genocide in our time,"Paul Rusesabagina is Hutu. We see the word on his passport. His wife is Tutsi. She is in mortal danger. But Paul doesn't realize it yet. He believes that the violence threatened by the ruling Hutu against the once ruling Tutsi in Rwanda will not happen because the UN peacekeepers will not allow it, nor will the world stand by and watch the slaughter.Paul manages a luxury hotel. He is a worldly-wise, efficient, suavely diplomatic man who dresses impeccably and who knows how to influence people with well-chosen gifts and flattery. His demeanor is calm and measured. He tells his driver that to give a government official or some other important person ten thousand francs is not as effective as giving him a rare Cuban cigar worth the same amount.He visits a supplier to gain supplies for the hotel. While he is there a crate containing hundreds of machetes overturns. He is told they come from China at a cost of ten cents each and can be sold for many times that amount.This is the first hint of the horror to come, and the way it is revealed is characteristic of director Terry George's calculated method. He has a story of genocide to tell, a story of criminal neglect by the West, especially by the United States under President Clinton who stood aside and allowed the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people to take place, as did the rest of the world through the UN. The next hint comes from government radio in which the Tutsi people are referred to as ""cockroaches."" This is most chilling because when one tribe or nation sets out to kill the people of another tribe or nation the essential element is to turn those people into something less than humans. The psychological trick is to make the killers believe they are killing vermin. One cannot help but recall the Nazi propaganda machine and its methods prior to and during the Holocaust.Next we see in a scene at the hotel bar that it is really impossible to tell by appearance the difference between two young women, one Tutsi and the other Hutu. The Tutsi are said to be tall and to look down their noses at the Hutu who are said to be shorter and perhaps darker, but this is clearly a fiction. Even so, racial differences are invented and racism is inculcated into the mass mind. All of this is necessary because the slaughter is to take place using not bullets or gas chambers, but instead the cheap machetes from China. To get armies of young men to kill their neighbors and fellow countrymen, women and children with machetes requires the stirring up of a mass hatred of epic proportion and demonic intensity.The personal story itself within this greater scenario is that of Paul and his family and how he was persuaded by a moral imperative that he himself felt to save hundreds of Tutsi by housing them in the luxury hotel he managed after the Europeans left. We see how he risked his life and family and how his courage and resourcefulness proved heroic. Terry George tells the story in a straightforward manner with vivid and deliberate detail. In particular there are scenes of carnage on a vast scale, including the chilling horror of the nighttime bumpy ride along the ""river road"" which was said by George Rutaganda, a sadistic man, to be ""open"" and the preferred route to take back to the hotel. The bumps in the road were the bodies of recently slaughtered Tutsi that the hotel van could not help but drive over.The acting by Don Cheadle as Paul and by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife is outstanding. Nick Notle is effective in the role of a compromised and nearly helpless UN commander.This is a message film. The message goes out to the whole world, and Terry George makes us understand that those people who were slaughtered could be people anywhere, in particular they could be middle class Americans or Europeans. He indicates that Western prejudice against black Africans in part allowed the slaughter to take place. By showing us the ordinary domestic life of Paul and his family at home, their love and affection for one another--their familiar humanity--we are made to share this horrific human tragedy and to realize that we could have prevented it had we only known or cared enough.Will we care enough next time?--and there will be a next time, and a time after that and then another until such a day comes when the rule of law prevails internationally and people everywhere understand that we are all essentially the same and that the baser nature of our leaders must be controlled by law and justice.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"Hutus, Tutsis, Serbs, and Croats","1993 -- Milisovec and his genocide programs bring tears to the world's eyes. Cries for US involvement mount as the Croat and Muslim victims of Milosivec are given increasingly human faces by US media. Looking at the faces, a single frightening thought strikes many of us at once. The Serbs are trying to exact the ultimate penalty from the Croats who they consider lower in God's food chain than cockroaches. Yet, to our eyes, the two ""races"" are indistinguishable. Still, as heartbreaking as this is, it took years for us to actually take action.Now, take these same faces, paint them black, and put them in a part of French North Africa with which the English-speaking press and the US has little familiarity in a country whose name is spelled strangely. The Genocide is being implemented at a rate comparable to the recent tsunami. This is scary stuff, and we have no natural side and no history. Tutsi? Hutu? We can't tell the difference between them, and we don't care. Is this genocide or just more tribal warfare in Africa? Some Blacks killing some other blacks. Why would this be the business of the US? This is much closer the Killing Fields than it is Schindler's List in terms of the West's abandonment being central to how it played out. The Tutsi's were scapegoated and slaughtered so quickly, it was easiest to simply right off our losses and live to die another day. Small but powerful bits are contributed by the sincere-yet-ineffective Colonel played by Nolte and the wise-guy-macho newsman Jack played as appropriately impertinent by Joaquin Phoeenix.Don Cheadle certainly we worked hard for the nomination. He is in practically every seen and the movie moves on his energy.Sophie Okodengo matched him scene for scene in honesty, confronting torture, and summoning up one final breath when the brain is working as a slow trickle at best, hope had all but died, and you can't remember when you last slept. I think she is magnificent and will win a must-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar even though she's a relative unknown.Cheadle's performance is the best lead in an historical drama since Paul Scofield essayed Sir Thomas Moore in A Man For All Seasons -- which in turn was the best ever. And, Cheadle's assignment was even harder in many ways. He needed to blend an everyman-side with his heroically extraordinary conscience side with a con-man side, then expertly add in impeccable timing with whistling-past-the graveyard humor and dashes of theater of the absurd. One additional thing I'd like to underscore is that Cheadle's Paul is NOT everyman. He has extraordinary intelligent, and excellent facility with people and intermarried and intermingles among tribes freely and openly in a society that had never truly accepted such boldness. But, he tries to deal with most people with the humility of an everyman because he understands it is the best way to be.Unfortunastely, Academy dynamics being what they are, it is most likely that Okodengo's Oscar will have to serve for both of them, because it's Clint Eastwood's year (forget DiCaprio). And, like Joaquin Phoenix's Jack at the bar, Academy voters will have trouble not confusing Don Cheadle with Jamie Foxx. I don't mean this as a specific knock at the Academy. It is simply the nature of this particular beast.Terry George already entered the recesses of truth within my breast and my brain with In The Name Of The Father. That marvelous film also dealt with injustices and holy wars promulgated in the name of irrational fear and hatred masquerading as patriotism. He illustrates here how he can immerse himself in the brutal realities of the unfortunate with even greater singlemindedness to create an even higher-quality movie.As others mentioned, he also did a great job conveying the horror of the atrocities occurring without assaulting our senses with violence as Gibson did in the Last Temptation of The Christ. The scene where it dawns (quite literally) on Cheadle why George directed him, ""Take the River Road; it's clear"" conveys more horror and sorrow in its way while still managing to spare the audience its dignity. The movie also did a good job of demonstrating that seldom do the people who wind up being the perpetrators of unconscionable acts look or act like monsters when we meet them. The dynamics of the situation take a life of their own and suddenly transform otherwise good people into committing monstrous acts.Most Highly Recommended: 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The most gut wrenching film I've ever watched,"Don Cheadle should get an Academy Award for his role as the African hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina who single handedly saved over 1,000 people during the Hutu massacre of Tutu tribesmen in the mid-1990's. His accent, his emotions, his courage and integrity were impeccably executed. Sophie Okonedo, who played Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana, was also excellent.The film seemed almost like a documentary at times (hand-held camera?) and crystallized the dilemma of man's inhumanity to man as only pictures can do.Over 800,000 men, women, and children were slaughtered in a period of a few months. It made for tough watching. For those with a strong stomach, it is a film not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the Greatest Films Of All Time,"""History Never Repeats, I tell myself before I goto sleep."" - The Stranglers But it's a lie, and he knows it as well as you or I do.Watching the footage the mind rebels. I think to myself, that's so mean they're hitting these defenseless people, young, old, women, children. But they're not hitting them, they're striking them with machetes until they're dead. The atrocities are simply too unreal, and one must imagine God if there is a God, is in his Heaven, and crying.We talk of love, but will never understand what love is until our love extends to the whole world.Hotel Rwanda 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A forceful message,"Sadly, this movie just didn't do it for me for a number of reasons. I knew coming in that with this type of movie, depicting an horrific historical event, that it is a difficult line to walk. Many movies make the message too heavy-handed, utilizing ""message-based- dialogue"" that doesn't feel believable. Then there are others like Schindler's List that masterfully demonstrate the horrors, yet remain cinematic masterpieces. I heard so many good things about it from friends and saw the cast and thought that it was going to be good, but left feeling a empty. First, I did not feel the chemistry between Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo. From the opening, I didn't feel much of a connection between them and although they kissed and ""do"" what a married couple should, there was something missing. Secondly, I thought that the editing was a little odd in a couple places. For example, when Cheadle and Okonedo are on the roof at night, there is a part that it unnecessarily cuts to the guns shots over the city. It wasn't anything that helped the movie, but left me a little distracted. Thirdly, I have to complain about the theme of the movie being preached through a megaphone. All good art has to allow the viewer to reach for their own conclusions, invite them in and allow them to interpret. When any art form forces a certain feeling or message upon the viewer, it is insulting to them because it comes off as the director or writer don't trust the audience to reach the same conclusion. This was done mainly through the dialogue. So many of the lines seemed forced in order to get the message that the genocide was bad. This was also done with all the pictures of the dead. The last thing I want to do is offend anyone by downplaying how horrendous this event was, but I believe it should have been represented in a more tactful way. Many times, less is more. Let the audience come to that conclusion without it being shoved down our their throat. However, given all these things that I didn't like, I did enjoy some parts. The individual acting of most characters was good (Phoenix, Mokoena, and Kgoroge to name a few). I also thought that the cinematography was good. The lighting used to help the essence of each scene come forth was well done. Finally, I enjoyed the sound design. It did a much better job of subtly stating the mood of the scene and brought me in as a viewer to interpret with it. Positives: Good sound design, some good acting, and good cinematography. Negatives: Forceful theme/ message, lack of chemistry between leads, and distracting edits in some parts. Conclusion: If you want to watch a movie that tells you how to feel about genocide and war instead of inviting you to develop your own thoughts, you'd probably like the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda is Awesome!!!,"My husband and I saw Hotel Rwanda and were very touched by it's content. It is one of the most powerful movies that I have ever seen!! Since we saw the movie I have told EVERYONE that I talk to, to go see this movie!!(even total strangers) We had intended to see another movie but heard that it did not get good ratings. This movie deserves an A+!! My husband loves to watch the history channel so I knew he would be very interested in seeing Hotel Rwanda since it is based on a true story. I haven't seen ANY previews or promotions of any kind and had not even heard of it before we went. In my opinion, this movie should receive MANY Academy Awards and EVERYONE should see it!!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hotel Rwanda is a powerful story of perseverance in the most grim of times, further enhanced with superb acting.","Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. This movie that's based on a true story was very dramatic and intense. What happened in Rwanda was a real tragedy, but Paul Rusesabagina risked his life to help people survive in a war torn country.

when humankind sleeps ...,"'Hotel Rwanda' is a docu-drama about one of the most shameful events in modern history. It is about the genocide in Rwanda, that happened only one decade ago, and the hard questions that need to be asked about how this was possible, and why governments and international organizations did not succeed in preventing it should haunt the minds of the politicians and of any decent person on earth.Still, this film is more about the human aspects of the conflict. As in 'Schindler's List', the action focuses on one episode figuring one noble figure of a real human, who succeeds to make a difference by saving innocent lives. Beautifully acted by Don Cheadle, the main character endangers his own life, and the security of his family, just because as a human he cannot behave differently. If we can be appalled by the dimensions of the Rwandian tragedy and the lack of humanity of the perpetrators of the crimes, the message of the film is basically optimistic, showing that human dignity not only survives in our cruel world of today, but also can succeed, can make a difference. If only all humans would behave like this ...I do not believe that this film is great cinema, but it is important, and it must have been made. It features some good acting from actors like Nick Nolte and Joachim Phoenix, but its value lays in having told the story, in a direct and fluent manner. Because of it, less people can pretend that they did not know that this horrible events happened now, in our contemporary times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful personal story,"This film's main strength is how it balances historical circumstances with a personal perspective. Don Cheadle does well as Paul, the hotel manager who must survive and protect refugees during the Rwandan Genocide. His acting is superb, showing a brave man thrust from his ordinary life into a harrowing chaos where any wrong move might kill him. We never get a bird's eye view until the end - we have no idea of who's alive, what's going on or what help is arriving. The violence is horrifying and the reactions are palpable. This film shows what true courage is like - not Hollywood-style heroism, but a bravery and dedication when ordinary people are thrust into situations that demand our responsibility to humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
amazing Paul,"I think Paul is a hero even though he is just a citizen but he saved over thousand of refugees and protect his family, the orphan , even his neighbor.At the last part of the movie, when he argue to the General and he use a confidence power to say it that let the General went back and save the refugees.I think we can not do these action when we were in such dangerous situation. It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country. I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped. If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can. I think it is a good movie but it is a good documentary because it can let us know the true dark history of this massacre.So when I visited to Rwanda I will focus more on the history of this civil war. I will recommend the marvel series movies because most of them are about superhero",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
More questions than answers,"The west's terrible neglect of the Rwandan genocide is to our shame; but how did it happen? 'Hotel Rwanda' deserves credit for bringing this wrongly-ignored tragedy to our attention, albeit long after the killing; but it fails to really answer the question. A smooth, urbane hotel manager suddenly finds that half the country wants to kill the other half, and ends up trying to protect as many of his fellow citizens as follows. But the murderous violence comes out of nowhere, and perhaps cannot be truly understood through the perspective of a westernised member of the middle classes; and the widespread nature of the terror (a million people were killed in all) is not really captured. Although it's quite normal to personalise a story that seems too large to tell completely (think 'Schindler's List' for an obvious example), I found it hard to get a true sense of the wider society of which the hotel is supposed to be a microcosm (just as the one heroic U.N. officer we see appears equally without a context of his own). So while it's good this film was made, I found it only somewhat illuminating; though it also made me ponder how shamefully rarely black Africa is chosen as a subject for any sort of film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not much to add which others haven't,"I originally didn't want to watch it b/c of a lot of controversy surrounding the main character. However, the film itself is very well made, with good pacing, music, and it shows the horror of the atrocities without being too graphic about it.But people need to take note the film was made from the protagonist's perspective. A lot of criticism surrounding him could either be true or simply be a smear campaign. The only thing I'll comment on that is despite everything, you cannot overlook the fact this man risked his life, the lives of his family, to save over 1000 Tutsi.However, b/c the film is only focused on one event, it may have unfairly painted a picture that the Tutsi were the victims while the Hutus were the villains. Keep in mind of their whole history where prior to this event, the Tutsi in the region massacred just as many Hutus and even after the establishment of the Tutsi government, they looked away at the retaliation masscres against the Hutus in their own country.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best Movie in Recent Years.,"Hotel Rwanda is a powerful drama which invokes strong emotions on the atrocities committed in Rwanda in 1994 which the international community turned it's back on and ignored. It serves as a reminder to viewers not to take racial harmony for granted and to work towards preserving racial harmony as once it is out of hand, it can have a cataclysmic effect on the stability of a country.The movie cast is top rate especially Don Cheadle who is truly inspiring in his role. The character (Paul Rusasabagina) he plays is a good role model. To me, he is the Best Actor and this is the Best Movie.The movie has also brought the spotlight to Africa which urgently needs the attention of the international community to mediate in it's civil strife and to lift the entire continent out of poverty. I hope ""Hotel Rwanda"" will help renew interest in Africa and that governments worldwide will come forward to render their hand to prevent conflicts and other social problems from escalating further.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Gripping, shocking and beautifully made","""There's always room"" was the phrase uttered by Paul Rusesabagina at the end which captures the essence of this great film. Hotel Rwanda is a well directed and beautiful film. It captures a shocking and brutal period in human history. Despite a Rwandan genocide in 1994 carried out the Hutu militia as revenge for being oppressed by the Tutsi in previous years Paul's humanity and bravery still prevailed. His qualities and actions could sound like a fictional hero yet it is very real. In the most dire situations the bravest and most humane stand out. Despite different conditions and circumstances Paul Rusesabagina in the film shares similarities with Oscar Schindler in Schindler's list who used his factory to save so many Jewish people. Don Cheadle gives an Oscar worthy performance and more than carries this beautiful yet shocking film as the brave hotel manager who housed and saved so many refugees. A once charming hotel is transformed into a temporary refuge safe haven for many.Despite showing the harsh realities that once existed this film pointed out the sad truth about the rest of the world in this period. The west and the rest of the world refused to intervene even though there were so many pleas to be saved. A bright light was shone on human nature. Overall this eventful and tragic film was well directed and educational about a dark period in history. Often many forget how many innocent people are affected by civil war and unrest. It only takes a number of instigators to disturb the peace for millions of civilized people. Hollywood and society can benefit from well made and accurate films rather than looking for the nearest gravy train. One can only be thankful for not being stuck in those tough times and for their freedom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I loved this film,"After watching Hotel Rwanda, I just sat and thought and thought and thought. That's what this film makes you do: think.

It made me aware and now I'm interested in current happenings in Africa like the Darfur conflict.I cannot express my appreciation of Terry George enough. His direction is so wonderful. And Don Cheadle is amazing. He acts the character of Paul so well that we have to remind ourselves that he is acting and not the actual person. Altogether the whole film was superb.I learned a lot from it. I cannot in words describe how I felt after watching Hotel Rwanda. It just moved me so much to tears.

"When carelessness kills faster than machetes, one good man emerged out to restore our faith in mankind...","I believe in goodness, I don't know about any other Holy entity but if there's anything pure and eternal in this world, in this history we share for the better or the worse, it's definitely ""goodness"". In the same train of thoughts, I believe hatred is more devastating than any devils or divine wraths. Sorry if I sound too metaphysical but that's the emotional state ""Hotel Rwanda"" left me in.The film was directed by Terry George ten years after the Rwanda massacre. At that time, most viewers knew the numbers but didn't take their full measure. Indeed, why do we insist so much on World War II lessons if no one cares about the last genocide of the twentieth century? Has the African setting something to do with it? Is Africa so connected in the international subconscious to poverty, famine and civil wars that there would never be enough corpses to make the world care? History seemed to proved this right.No one cared about the genocide and the genocide emerged out of that carelessness, that's its most tragic equation. The film is told from the perspective of a hotel manager who uses the 'Milles Collines' hotel to shelter refugees, protecting them from the Hutus who wish to settle a historical record with their 'enemies'. The man will witness savagery and horror from the view of a hotel balcony before walking among piles of dead bodies, but the toughest lesson of all would be that the victims weren't worth the help of Western countries and that obliviousness killed much faster than machetes.It's very ironical that it was the Belgian colony that sowed the seeds of the very racism between Hutus and Tutsis, they ruled by dividing before division would implode like a volcano of blood. In a necessary expositional scene, a journalist played by Joaquin Phoenix (who represents our POV) learns that Belgians made the Tutsis the privileged ones on the basis of their tallness, lighter features and even the size of their nostrils. Tutsis would indeed rule Hutus and have more than a few altercations, but in 1994, for any newcomer, these considerations were silly: the journalist sees two girls in the bar, one Hutu, one Tutsi, but they could be twins.The film doesn't hide the tacit responsibility of the European colonization and makes the absences of reactions from Western countries accessories to mass murders. The film doesn't point an accusing finger because facts speak for themselves, but it shows us the two sides of the same coin. Hutu and Tutsi living, working together, forming families and living in harmony and a radio program alimenting the hatred and asking the Hutu population to get out and ""cut the tall trees"" or kill the ""cockroaches"". The word is used so many times that we almost get used to it.And naturally, these ugly terms of reference have a strong resonance and remind us of the darkest hours. And it's a credit to the film's central character to have been capable to save so many lives with so little help, the UN contribution was acknowledged through the character of Nick Nolte, a UN peacekeeper left powerless when there was no peace to maintain but who knew when it's necessary to show a gun. But let's get back to the film's hero, because he's a hero. The man is a Hutu, Paul Rusasebegina (Don Cheadle) and married to a Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) and together they have children.Their chances of survival are thin but Paul, once abandoned by his Belgian bosses, knew he couldn't make profits because it meant betraying his family or buying their lives by selling others. Paul chose to jeopardize his life and his family's to save a thousands of Tutsi refugees from the altar of ethnocentric madness, using his hotel as a true oasis of peace. What was a publicity stunt became a reality of ""matter and death"" significance just like the factory in ""Schindler's List"" and it's true the film borrows a lot of elements in he narrative but there's a singular difference.Indeed, Paul is directly concerned by the tragedy and the hotel is only a temporary situation and he knows it, at any time, the army can come, rebels can attack and his refugees massacred, Paul has no help but only time and skills. And this is what makes the film so riveting: to see this man who's only a civilian, uses what he knows best as a hotel manager to handle the most life-threatening situations. He needs ten minutes to put on a suit and these ten minutes are used to save hundreds of refugee, all it takes is to serve the guests a beer, to be a hotel manager, patient, polite, well-dressed, aware that war makes many profiteers and carpet baggers and you can make business with them.In a more painful scene where he's asked to shoot at his family, he manages to bargain lives in exchange of money. Paul knows that for as long as he works as a manager and never loses his capability to negotiate, to bribe and even to blackmail with diplomacy, there might be a chance of survival.That's what ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a character study with a horrific war in the backdrop. And it doesn't leave us much time to catch our breath, it's truly a powerful and emotional journey that makes you wish you'd never have to live such a tragedy with your own beloved ones.As Tatiana, Sophie Okonedo gives a magnificent performance of a mother who's always at the verge of a breakdown and yet keeps enough strength to protect her children, I could feel my heart pounding at the sight of her trembling body. And as Paul, Don Cheadle shines as a man whose best asset is his professionalism and self-control in the middle of chaos. And since I decided to deify goodness, I would call this man not a hero, but a Saint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Best movie I have seen all year!,"This was one of the best movies I have seen so far this year. It was not over the top with graphic scenes and violence yet left no doubt in my mind (or heart) of the atrocities going on in Rwanda. I watched this movie with my teenage son, and felt it was important for him to not just ""see"" but to ""feel"" the sense of dread and fear that the people of Rwanda were feeling-which this movie portrayed very well. Some movies go over the top with the graphic scenes for the shock factor, and some movies portray unrealistic heroes-the knight in shining armor that saves the world-but this movie was very real for me. The actors did an excellent job portraying emotions of fear, horror and confusion of the Rwandan people along with love, graciousness and humility.This movie kept our interest from start to finish. I think this is Don Cheadle's best performance to date. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role, but one very powerful statement that I believe hit home for many people. Don Cheadle should have won an Oscar. Paul Rusesabagina should be commended for his bravery, wit, humility and compassion. A very worthwhile film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Truly Outstanding,"This film is stunning in many ways and like I say in my subject-- truly outstanding. I was fortunate enough to see it for free tonight here in DC. You think of nothing else but what's on the screen as soon as the movie starts until the finish. Like another who reviewed this film our screening was also graced with the presence of Terry George and the man himself Paul R. I wish this film could be seen in every high school in the country. It is a reminder of humanity and how we can so easily lose it; as well as being a very engrossing story and film.It's well done all the way around. Some I guess, may be scared away by the darkness of the story, but I hope that won't happen. The viewer gets much more than just the negative portraits of the genocide happening around the hotel. It has a lovely relationship with Paul and his wife and family, definitely some humor, and a total sense of it's time and place-- including the oasis of the hotel. A poster mentioned the line ""the world would watch and then go back the their dinner"" (or there abouts.)The director mentioned that line in particular in our Q&A. It's not in the American version of this film. Joaquin Phoenix implies it, but it is not said directly.

"Horrible, bloody war seen from the sidelines","It's the spring of 1994. UN peacekeepers are about to pull back from Rwanda, a nation that used to be ruled by Belgium. Now the Belgians are gone, but they have left behind a divided people, having split the natives into two groups, Hutus and Tutsis. The Tutsis used to be in power, but now it's the Hutus that have the power. And some of them hate the Tutsis with a fiery passion.History has named this spring and its events the Rwandan genocide, so you can imagine it's not exactly a lighthearted, feel good movie. As the name implies, it focuses on a single hotel, run by Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who took in hundreds of Tutsi civilians to shield them from the Hutu militia. The film is also known as the African Schindler's List for a reason.It's a fascinating true story, but it also means that we don't see much of the war and genocide happening outside the hotel grounds. We see glimpses and flashes here and there, but mostly this is a movie about what war is like for those that are close to it, but not directly involved. Which has its novelty, but it also means that you don't get that emotional impact you probably went in looking for.Then again, I have to admit it's brilliantly acted and all-around well-made. Cheadle especially gives a powerful performance. And the subject matter is heavy enough to carry the film, even if the focus is not on the heaviest possible aspect.Worth checking out if you have a thing for historical war drama and would like to expand your experiences outside the boundaries of Europe.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Amazing Film,"I went and saw Hotel Rwanda recently. It was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. It was so powerful, inspiring, and well done. Don Chedale acted amazingly as Paul, a hotel manager who saves hundreds of people from genocide in 1994. Don is on screen in just about every minute of this fabulous film, and each scene is acted with strength and emotion, and the fact that he was on in almost every scene while doing such an incredible job was alone enough to give Don a best actor bid at the Oscars. Jamie Foxx was great and deserved this award. While many, including me, might find this film disturbing, it really is uplifting at the same time, to see how one man can truly make a difference.

Not even the Holocaust was portrayed in film as hard as we can see in this film, where the theme is Rwanda's genocide, by the eyes of a friendly hotel manager who just wants to protect himself and his family. They are caught in the midst of a series of political and social twists that escalate and turn into a genocidal civil war, and we can see how they suffer and fear for their lives. The way they quickly capture our sympathy turns their fears into our fears, in a powerful and very emotional way. Suddenly, those deaths also affect us and the initial sense of detachment fades. What more could a movie want? Despite this, the film isn't very graphic, we are spared the most painful scenes, although it has many shocking scenes. The film also criticizes the inability of UN to intervene there and save lives. Don Cheadle led the cast and made the biggest film of his career to date, shining in an inspired and profound performance. The environment, the scenery, the costumes... everything was meticulously thought out to reproduce the events and the realism paid of. Although unsuitable for the most suggestible, its one of the most intense films I know.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"a very hard film to watch, but no more than we deserve","I saw this film in the theatre this afternoon and I can honestly say that not since ""Schindler's List"" have I been more moved, saddened, shocked and angered by a movie than I was by ""Hotel Rwanda"". It is a well-crafted, hard-hitting script that is both a testimony to one man's courage and a searing indictment of the West's unforgivable indifference to the tragedy. It is not easy viewing, but I can't help but think that really, we deserve this. We all have blood on our hands. The acting was excellent, particularly Don Cheadle and Sophie Okoneda (Oscar nominations, anyone?). But I was a little irked by Nick Nolte rather ""uneven"" Canadian accent. If anyone to learn more about the man who inspired Nolte's character, read ""Shaking Hands with the Devil"" by General Romeo Dallaire. It's every bit as disturbing and compelling as ""Hotel Rwanda""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Best Factual History Film Ever,"This film was a hard hitting fact about how weak our United Nations can be in a hot spot like this! Living in a fantasy world, always thought that nothing like this would ever happen in my life time---but this movie shows differently...It is very scary that these atrocities happened only ten years ago!!! What is wrong with this situation??? In this wonderful world of ours, nothing like this should ever occur. We give United Nations probably billion of dollars and they don't have squat for power.The film was excellent and it sure depicted a terrible series of events. I think this movie is frightening and makes one think that these events should not have happened..I applaud the director and the actors. They all did a wonderful job in getting the story across. So much so it is a horrific film. Lets just hope and pray that this is a lesson to all of our political leaders so nothing like this happens ever again... Once again the actors and film makers should be applauded and hopefully awarded for a job well done.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I cannot write a review.,"When the subject matter of a film moves you so much, gets to your veins and haunts your thoughts even after a day of watching it, you cannot possibly discuss its quality of acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing or like that. You cannot write a critical review of this film, in plain words.When I went into the theatre I partially regretted the fact that I hadn't done necessary research on the political issue of Rwanda the film is based on. I don't see the importance any more. Now I don't care about Hutus or Tutsis or what really happened in 1994, I only know that this is all about the blind hatred between two racially/religiously/culturally different groups of people. I live in a country which is not exactly alien to such conditions. In fact while watching the film I couldn't help remembering the Gujarat massacre and riots that happened in 2002. I am not comparing the two incidents, it is just my way to personally relate to this film.I left the theatre with another thought. Whom do we call a hero? I thank Terry George, Don Cheadle and others for making a film on a true real-life hero, a breed which humanity is always struggling to produce. Paul Rusesabagina is a hero, perhaps more than Oscar Schindler who had always another choice and more favorable position that Paul. He is a hero that even you and I could turn out to be in necessary circumstances. Don Cheadle is magical, but perhaps that's my half-dead movie-reviewer self talking.Perhaps someday I'll delete this comment and write something more informative and complete. Before that I have to get over the experience that I actually saw this film, saw its subtle yet shocking depictions of horrible reality. It's not an experience to remember. Its an experience of learning how to produce and face reality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Oh Puhleeesse!,"First of all, can we have a decent movie without getting hit over the head with a ""political correctness"" club! This is a story of two African tribes murdering each other and the blame is placed upon the European colonists who originally ""elevated"" one tribe over another (because they had more Caucasian facial features) which ""created"" the bloodbath. Then the ""white foreigners"" were blamed for supplying them guns! Then the ""white governments"" were blamed for not doing anything during the genocide, because ""they didn't see Africans as worthy of their time and concern"". There is a similar situation in Iraq, after Saddam has executed thousands of people and everyone is protesting our involvement. The film was well acted, and very good, but enough of the insidious attacks on our culture! If there was a message here it is that people, regardless of race, are responsible for their choices and actions. It was infuriating to hear that millions of innocents were slaughtered by fellow Africans and the Westerners are to blame. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the individual to choose to kill or not. Enough already!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A True But Unbelievable Story,"If you are a timid person, you better not watch this film, it is full of blood and incredible. But if you are a humanitarian, you must look at it because it is history, this is historical fact.
It's hard to imagine how a Hutu hotel manager who was originally selfish and well-disciplined would rather sacrifice himself and protect these Tutsi refugees. He can be called a hero.The war between races is terrible and humanity is extinct. Maybe in the Interhamwn, killing people who don't blink, the classmates, neighbors, and colleagues who are joking with you for the last second, took the knife and gun in the next second, rushed into your house, hacked you and your family. It is incredible.
Peace is commendable. I hope that we can all cherish peace and maintain peace.

amazing Paul,"I think Paul is a hero even though he is just a citizen but he saved over thousand of refugees and protect his family, the orphan , even his neighbor.At the last part of the movie, when he argue to the General and he use a confidence power to say it that let the General went back and save the refugees.I think we can not do these action when we were in such dangerous situation.
It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country.
I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped.
If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can.
I think it is a good movie but it is a good documentary because it can let us know the true dark history of this massacre.So when I visited to Rwanda I will focus more on the history of this civil war.
I will recommend the marvel series movies because most of them are about superhero",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The movie is the true story of a Hotel manager in Kigali, Rwanda who housed over a thousand refugees during the Rwandan genocide. This movie depicts the entire situation in a very realistic manner. It feels like you have been transported back to that time and are experiencing the entire situation. This is not about war or violence but rather about the human nature. How the willpower of one man changed the lives of many. The story is backed by some great acting and direction. This movie moves us and makes us feel. This movie cannot be expressed by words.

One of the best,"Don Chedal Is a great actor and he has done some phenomenal movies but none of them compare to this film about a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered more than twelve hundred people during the massacres that happened in 1994.I'll admit that I knew nothing about this event in history other than the fact that it happened. This film was an eye opener, a powerful look at one of the most devastating events in the history of the world. A dark part of the history of the world made worse by the apathy of the rest of the world. And how those who were being needlessly slaughtered where protected only by there own determination to survive and by the help of a few great men who risked everything to fight an impossible battle.This is a film that should be not only experienced but remembered, it is something that could change you and how you view the world. This is a film that sends a message to all of us. We cannot simply ignore these atrocities, we cannot put our political and diplomatic agendas above the lives of innocent men women and children. It sends the message that there are things that are worth fighting for and that there are some things worth dying for. It is a message that still has significance today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing!,"One day Rwanda president die in some ways that anybody could considered suspect. The president was the only one who was able to put the nation United despite all conflicts and differences between ethnic groups. Facing the death of the president some racists groups start to pop up and Over sunddently gaining more and more power.
The story tells us how Paul Rusesabagina (performed amazingly by don cheadle) manage to protect and save hundreds of refugees and his family.
Sophie Okonedo dispite of not having as much time in the screen she creates a big impact almost working like a mirror for what Paul Rusesabagina is feeling inside but cant transmit to the outside maybe because is afraid of showing wickedness in front of the people who trust him to keep them safe or most importante because he knew the risc and responsibility and didn't want to distract and keep on the plan that was working to save everyone.
One last thing that I want to mention once again was the don cheadle performance. What a lesson to all actors. He's able to express so well every kind of emotions, like happiness, worry, desperate when facing some realities that he didn't understand, like the lack of empathy from the first world citizens when confronted with the reality of hopeless people who are being kill day after day.

Hotel Rwanda - genocide and conscience,"My 19-year old son and I saw this movie when it opened in New York.It's one of those stories, which is so powerful in fact that it need notlike so much of Hollywood's farebe over dramatized. Fortunately, director Terry George kept the storytelling simple and straightforward. As a result, the movie depicts the manager of the Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda, as a good man who rises to a state of grace under fire.Early on, as ethnic tensions mount, there's a brief discussion about the ethnic differences between Rwanda's Tutsi and Hutu peoples. The physical differences are negligible. As one of the script lines says, ""They had to measure our noses to see if there was any difference."" But historically, the Belgian colonizers of this country selected some of the natives as colonial administrators, leaving the majority to do the their bidding. That's the difference.As war breaks out, simple survival becomes a daily struggle. Hotel Manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle in his finest role to date) becomes an adept at sparing the war's refugees, lodged in his care after the Europeans visitors have been evacuated. While a few of the film's reviewers on this Board expressed disappointment over a perceived lack of drama, I'd argue they weren't watching or listening closely. The drama resides in the hotel manager's quality of thought and action, premeditating and improvising the stratagems that allow him and his wards to live another day. Stratagems of bribes, promises, favors owed and collected, words and deeds, which a book I once read termed ""the weapons of the weak."" Thank god, good people rise to the fore in the worst of circumstances, armed only with their wits and willing to pit them against guns and the men and boys who wield them..A long time ago, I heard an interview on the NPR show ""Fresh Air."" The guest described the ""ethnic differences"" between the peoples of the former Yugoslavia. Again the differences were negligible. But the guest noted, the racial distinctions were so similar that the different groupings (Bosnians, Croats and Serbs) often resorted to mutilation to eradicate the very appearance of similarity.When Don Cheadle appeared as a guest on Jon Stewart's ""Daily Show,"" he noted it took 5 years for Terry George to raise the funding to make this film. Kudoes go out to him and (from the credits) the British, South African and Italian interests, which jointly invested in the production to bring this kind of story to light.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Educational and emotional,"Hotel Rwanda shows the unspeakable atrocities of the war, a civil war in this case and one that is a real-life event, which is even more painful.It also exposes the inability/unwillingness of United Nations to intervene in a meaningful way and the overall hypocrisy of the West. There's a quote from Joaquin Phoenix's character that perfectly sums it up: ""I think if people see this footage they'll say, 'oh my God that's horrible,' and then go on eating their dinners"".However, there's light even in the darkest places. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) doesn't wear a cape, but is one of the biggest cinematic heroes one could think of, saving more than one thousand lives. The comparisons to Oskar Schindler are well-founded. Fantastic job by Don Cheadle who finds the right tone and portrays Paul more as a human than as a hero.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"As Powerful and Moving as ""Schindler's List""","""Hotel Rwanda"" masterfully humanizes the enormity of the Rwandan genocide by focusing on the sane humanity of one man and his family when the whole world around them has gone insane. It ranks with ""Schindler's List"" as a film and a statement of the potential for action when faced with man's inhumanity to man.It is not just Don Cheadle's superb inhabitation of the real life hero Paul Rusesabagina that makes this film captivating. Co-writers Keir Pearson and director Terry George (who has previously shown through Irish films his understanding of fratricidal civil war engendered by colonialism) do more than guide us step-by-step through the facts of a few horrific days in 1994.We also see the transformation of a man who had benefited in an ironic oasis of a four-star Belgian tourist resort as a proud Hutu accomodationist to elitism, corruption and racism. Less a docudrama like ""Bloody Sunday,"" this is gripping story telling of personal relationships, quick thinking and moral responsibility.The film is not only edge of your seat suspense on the roller coaster of events to know what happens next to people we get to know (Sophie Okonedo has magical chemistry with Cheadle in portraying his spirited Tutsi wife) but also full of the humor, pathos and individuality of human foibles and emotions.The wider background to the situation is explained very quickly in passing to a photojournalist moved to care, played by Joaquin Phoenix, as a legacy of racist Belgian rule that sounds like the plot of a classic episode from the original ""Star Trek,"" so is even the more shocking for being true.We've seen before the agonizing futility of ""the whole world is watching"" hope in films going back to ""Ship of Fools,"" here painfully racist as well, and we've seen films about incomprehensible African strife through the eyes of sympathetic white witnesses that come across like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin."" Revelatory are how the African vs. African tensions are demonstrated, not only the culminating tsunami of violence (the visual gore is minimized such that seeing dead bodies, particularly of children, to the horizon is effectively stomach-turning enough so we don't need to see close-ups of machete wounds), but we are caught up in the build-up to the tensions, the humiliating negotiations to try and maintain civilized behavior, the class clashes, tribal treachery, and the specter of future repercussions, all scarily recreated.The U.N. peacekeepers, represented by Nick Nolte, are presented more positively, and not as helpless, as their bitter depiction in Yugoslavia in as ""No Man's Land."" The ever-present ranting radio, whose managers have been accused of war crimes, is a frighteningly heard presence in orchestrating the horror.The closing song, ""Million Voices"" by Wyclef Jean, sounds quite much like Peter Gabriel's tributes to Stephen Biko and Nelson Mandela, but the Afro Celt Sound System's score well exemplifies the movie's theme of a bitter tragedy for African and European cultures.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Phenomenal Film...MUST SEE!!,"I thought this film was fantastic. The directing wasn't perfect, but it was good enough. I like the script because it educated you about the conflict and provided some history to the two tribes. The background information made the movie all the more real, and put you in the middle of the situation. The only real weakness I saw was Nick Noltes performance as the conflicted general who was witnessing the atrocities but couldn't do anything about it. HIs performance was a bit cliché. This movie may not have been technically perfect, but no movie has made me feel like this movie did, in a long time. And isn't that the point of a movie. To stir up emotion, to put you right there in the middle of the situation. This movie did that. And for that, I would give it best picture. Moroever, this is a topic that went ignored in the news media, therefore the American public is very uneducated about the situation.

The World Needs To See This,"I found myself in tears many times during the showing of this film, and for good reason. I think the producers/director ought to consider adding a statement at the end, pointing to the fact that this sort of genocide continues even today; not in Rwanda, but in Sudan. The world needs to wake up to the fact that this atrociousness is not consigned to the past, as in Hitler or to Albanians or American Indians, but to Serbs and Croatians and in the 90s, the Tutsis and now in Darfur. Don Cheadle is to be lauded and commended and hopefully presented with award after award for his incredible heartfelt and moving performance. And the rest of the cast lived up to and surpassed expectations as well. Mind blowing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Injustice Behind Hotel Rwanda,"It should be noted that a great injustice was committed in the making of Hotel Rwanda. For the most part the story is true, Don Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina was a hero amidst terrible acts.The injustice lies in the portrayal of Nick Nolte's character, Colonel Oliver. Oliver is a fictitious person, but there is no denying the comparisons to Romeo Dallaire, a Canadian hero and the man in charge of the UN peacekeeping mission. For whatever reason, it was decided that the true story would be altered for the movie. Dallaire, recently voted as the 16th greatest Canadian ever by a CBC poll, was depicted by Nolte's character as ineffective and a drunk. This is far from the truth. Dallaire had limited resources and insufficient personnel to be able to stop the oppression and genocide, but he stood his ground. The world turned its back on what happened in Rwanda. The UN committed such little resources and soldiers to the mission that there was no chance of success. It is true that hundreds of thousands of people were massacred, but this number would have been considerably higher had it not been for Dallaire.It is unthinkable that such an important man and his actions would be altered in the retelling of this story. A more accurate account of the Rwanda genocide is available. Romeo Dallaire tells the story from his perspective, good and bad, in ""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"". Perhaps one day this story could be retold by Hollywood and give Dallaire the proper recognition he deserves.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful original pre-release poster,"I have yet to see this film but I would like to comment on the first pre-release poster I saw on a huge billboard. The image was very minimal and stark. A black background with a horizontal side-view of a shiny, scuffed machete blade. The only text being a very amateur looking 'Hotel Rwanda' in gold coloured Times New Roman font. Why was this image so powerful? Firstly I could see no clues as to what this poster was advertising, apart from the title obviously but the image itself didn't look like other movie posters, there was something nonconformist and more real about it. No airbrushing, no stylised fonts - just a stark, quite unsettling image of a weapon designed to cause a lot of damage. As much as the poster shook and to some extent impressed me because of it's originality, I thought it was tad insensitive but perhaps that is good for westerners who know so little about what happened. A few days later I could no longer see the original poster, it had been replaced with a more acceptable Hollywood style image, still depicting the machete blade only with airbrushed sad faces of the central characters inside it. That kind of killed my curiosity a bit but nevertheless I'll be renting this out when I have some money. Oh and I rated it 8 to be polite as I haven't seen it yet!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This film is shocking,"I think Hotel Rwanda is better than Schindler's list.I give a 8 out of 10. Retrospecting human history,genocides seem everywhere.so we need films such as Hotel Rwanda to remind us the horror ,we must avoid the massacre,but sadly it happens again and again.Seeing this movie,I thought a lot about the massacre happened here in China during the World War 2nd,the Japanese army killed about more 300,000 Chinese people,but we haven't made a single big movie to reveal that history.there are lots of movies talking about the killing Jews,and there is a Hotel Rwanda telling the world what happened in Rwanda,but why don't we Chinese make a movie showing the world what the Japanese done to us back in the 1930s in Nanjing? About Jean Reno in the movie ,he seems a bit rigid in acting,I think he should be more passionate .The art direction is good.Terry did a great job.The screenplay is good too.the music is OK,Jean Wycle sung the song well. anyways,I am going to show my family this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Light perspective of the Rwandan Genocide,"Obviously Hollywood can't really show what the violence was really like during the Rwandan civil war but even what this movie did show it would be enough to frighten any kid who happened to watch it. However, even with the restrictions of recreating the war the cast did a great job of showing the intensity of what happened at the hotel staff, the UN soldiers and the refugees there. There were times that the movie had me on the edge of the seat and so I cannot imagine what it was like to actually experience the genocide personally. While the movie focused on Paul Rusesabagina, it did a great job portraying the other important people at the hotel like Madam Archer and Colonel Oliver. While this movie can't show everyone who fought against the genocide the few people it can show it does an amazing job and I would recommend it to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

When conflict starts to intensify ...he shows his dignity, love, courage and effort to do what is right.I love the way the director interjected burst of the Hutu radio propaganda ...and the vile venomous words of hatred being spewed out...urging the Hutus to massacre.I cant see how this film could have been made much better.

"One of our most shameful times as a human race, sad but true.","After watching Hotel Rwanda, I realized why this film is considered as the ""African Schindler's List"". Based on a true story, Hotel Rwanda managed to capture the brightest and darkest sides of the human race - from the heroic deeds of Mr. Rusesabagina to the horrendous Rwandan genocide. Until I watched this movie, I had only heard about the Rwandan genocide, I had no idea about how terrifying and brutal it really was. The film didn't only manage to portray the cold-blooded actions of the Interahamwe, but also the West's shameful ability to neglect and ignore the genocide of almost a million innocent Tutsi and Hutu refugees - one of the reasons to why this was one of the most shameful and horrific times of our race. The plot was mostly historically accurate as far as I know (except some dramatization in some scenes such as when Paul doesn't get on the bus with his family and stays behind at the hotel instead). Surprisingly though, the movie was not dramatized in the violent aspect, as according to Mr. Rusesabagina, the violence in the movie was far less severe than it was during the actual genocide. Nonetheless, I must add that Cheadle's performance really had me, his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina was astonishing and real (as far as I know), while Nick Nolte's acting also kept me satisfied. Finally, a word to the man himself, Paul Rusesabagina. You, sir, have inspired me a whole lot. I cannot think of anyone else who has affected me in way that you have and I hope that your legacy will live on forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What about Sudan?,"I do think people should see this film. Don Cheadle's performance is stunning, perhaps reaching its apex when the film's script seems to take a page from Franz Fanon. Paul Rusesabagina realizes that the he spent his career working for a group of people who ultimately care little about the fate of Africans. In his European suit and tie, he stands in stark contrast to the bright-clothed Hutus threatening to kill his family and their Tutsi neighbors. His connections to Europe, however, provide him only with tenuous protection.My critique of the film is echoed in one of the message board comments, one that suggests that 'the West' should stay out of Africa, given the problems created by colonial and post-colonial interventions. Very little historical context is provided in the film for the Hutu aggression against the Tutsis, and as such, it's possible to read the entire film as another example of violent African tribalism. In other words, it's possible to suggest that the West, having made a big enough mess of Africa already, should just leave people there to their own devices.On the other hand, the 60-year anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz has just passed. Many commentators on that anniversary stressed the necessity of ensuring that such a massacre never takes place again. It is precisely the same kind of massacre that took place in Rwanda in 1994, and is now taking place in Sudan. My greatest hope for this film is that people see it and realize, first, the terrible mistake made by the US in abandoning Rwandan Tutsis to their murderers, and second realize the importance of intervening in Sudan in a way that actually makes a difference.My last comment, somewhat disconnected from the main purpose of this post, is simply that one of the most affecting portions of the film features a radio broadcast from the Hutu militants, enjoining Hutus to ""cut down the tall trees"" and ""squash the cockroaches,"" referring to the Tutsis. I heard a recording of the Hutu power broadcasts during my first visit to South Africa in 2002, and I remember the fear they produced in me even then, in a bright, sunlit room on a university campus. Hearing the broadcasts again in the movie theatre only heightened my awareness of the terrible obstacles the Tutsi faced during the genocide.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A true life story of Paul Rusasebagina a man employed as the manager of the most luxurious hotel in Kigali the capital city of Rwanda. Rawanda came into news when the most inhuman barbarous crimes against humanity were committed during the period of June-July 1994. I still remember the bodies falling from water fall i watched on CNN and BBC, i remember the brutal slaying of 2 Tutsi women by Hutu men by machete's caught on a distant camera. In these times a man which is portrayed in this film voluntarily gave refuge to hundreds of Tutsi people in his hotel, although he himself is Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. By doing this he himself endangered his own life by being labeled as a traitor to his own tribe but in the long terms he saved so much lives. This movie also shows the callous and extremely non serious attitude of the world community the U.N , NATO Eurpopean union And The U.S , they left the whole country at its own in such a horrendous , horrific and merciful situation when so many helpless folks needed them. If u see the movie collateral , u ll see tom cruise quoting about Rwanda "" ten of thousands of people were massacred before sun down , no one has killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki"". It almost really happened. While talking about Paul rusasebagina it also reminds me of another person , a Hutu politician i saw on BBC at the 10th anniversary of Rwandan genocide, he allowed quite a few Tutsi children to leave the country under a safe passage while the militia men were standing in their way with their fear some weapons but he risked every thing to save the lives of Tutsi children. I believe the world needs people like these , which are free from hatred prejudice narrow mindedness and aggression in their hearts and minds. If the film is concerned i like the work don cheadle, the direction and production , induction of nick nolte and Joaquin Phoenix and more over the song ""million voices"" in the end which some times brings tears into my eyes.

Hotel Rwanda,"Hotel Rwanda is a powerful and emotional film based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who saved the lives of over 1,200 people during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The film, directed by Terry George, stars Don Cheadle as Rusesabagina and Sophie Okonedo as his wife Tatiana ¹.The movie takes place in Kigali, Rwanda, where Rusesabagina, a Hutu, manages the Belgian-owned Hôtel des Mille Collines. As tensions between the Hutu-controlled government and Tutsi rebels escalate, Rusesabagina's hotel becomes a refuge for Tutsis and moderate Hutus fleeing the violence.Throughout the film, Rusesabagina navigates the treacherous landscape of corruption, bribery, and violence, using his connections and cunning to protect his family and the refugees in his care. Meanwhile, the international community, including the United Nations, fails to intervene, leaving Rusesabagina and others to fend for themselves.Hotel Rwanda received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Cheadle's performance and the film's thought-provoking portrayal of a devastating real-life event. The film earned three Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Cheadle ¹.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A moving film that sees the situation from a human perspective,"I loved this film. After living in Sub Saharan Africa for many years it was refreshing to see a film that portrayed people there as humans rather than caricatures. It also should shame us in the West for the complacency over situations there, often caused by our own selfish politics.This film intersperses the sadness and tension with wonderful flashes of humour and little touches that remind us that people are people even in the most horrific circumstances. The film also assumes no prior knowledge of the reasons behind the genocide, but explains the situation in a way that is understandable and natural rather than getting in the way of the narrative.See this film, if it moves you great, but if it causes you to question why the West can treat large populations of the world as less than human then even better!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Film- now prove it worked-,"-There is no doubt in anyones mind that Hotel Rwanda is an inspiring film. However I fear that the message still did not work. Today April 19, 2006 there are genocide's occurring in Western Sudan. The only way to stop it is to get off your rear and do something about it. You can google Sudan genocide or Darfur Genocide(Darfur is the region where the killing is taking place. For those unaware of the situation let me fill you in. The Sudanese government is killing non Arab black people in the region. As of now there are no US troops, no European troops and saddest no UN troops. Please read my post and go on to one of the many sites on the internet to sign a petition to president Bush to send troops into Sudan. President Bush when asked about the possibility of a genocide today said ""not on my watch"". As of now 9 million have signed a petition urging him to send help.

Sometimes a story alone makes a movie,"There are movies that even though their quality as a movie may not be more than average, the story makes it better. In this case, there is no greater story. The madness and the kindness of human kind. What is anything that may happen compared to this. If this was not a true story, no one would believe it.It makes me wonder what would I have done in a similar situation. Would I have run with the other westerners or would I have stayed and died to protect my Rwandan friends? I would like to believe that I would have stood against hatred and killing.The unshown tragedy is that the whole division between Tutsi and Hutu is artificial. It was Belgians who originally divided the Rwandans to the upper and lower class to mirror the society they were used to in their own country. Then they increased the division by educating only the upper class that they called Tutsi.The whole story is so unreal that it could be written by Orwell. But it wasn't.

Helpful,"Hotel Rwanda (2004) is a remarkable and deeply emotional film that not only educates its viewers on one of the most devastating genocides of the late 20th century but also explores the heroic power of human compassion in the face of unspeakable violence. Directed by Terry George and starring Don Cheadle in an unforgettable performance, the film brings to life the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who saved the lives of over a thousand refugees during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. With its powerful storytelling, stellar performances, and sobering portrayal of historical events, Hotel Rwanda is an important and compelling film that leaves a lasting impact on its audience.Hotel Rwanda is a deeply affecting and thought-provoking film that tackles an important chapter in history with grace, sensitivity, and powerful storytelling. Don Cheadle's incredible performance anchors the film, making it both a sobering history lesson and an emotional journey that calls on us to reflect on the world we live in. The film is a reminder that even in the darkest times, there are individuals who rise above the cruelty and make a difference. For anyone looking for a poignant, well-crafted film that tells a vital story of survival, dignity, and humanity, Hotel Rwanda is essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
So Great,"Besides the story is so well told, it was Don Cheadle's acting which makes the film so great.Watching this film is witnessing mankind's virus of hatred. But nevertheless, real hero's don't wear a red cape with a golden S on their chest. Or costume themselves in red/blue body-tights with spider design. Nor they command young people to a country to bring them western democracy or peace.Hotel Rwanda is shaking, thought-provoking and mainly great piece of filmmaker work. Which does not mean, that this picture should be seen as entertainment, because it's simply not.It's really hard for me to write about technique, screenplay or storyline, because the movie almost is a documentary about those horrible happenings down there in 94.Bravo, Don Cheadle ! Bravo, Sophie Okonedo !

human tragedy personified,"War is hell, it has been said, and this hell was just one example of our continuing inhumanity upon each other. This movie is so powerful, it reached down past the pit of my stomach in what it showed. Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast were tremendous. The scene on the foggy, bumpy road when the van was forced to stop, and the resulting scene that unfolded before Paul's disbelieving eyes was one of the most gut-wrenching horrors ever, likened to the carnage at Auschwitz. And just as real, as history has shown. This is a tale that the whole world should have seen while it was happening. And those who heard of it, and could have done something to stop it, but did nothing, are responsible for all the carnage. Unfortunately, we still live with similar slaughters every day all over the world. Kudos that at least some people continue to tell the stories and fight the fights.

The power,"Hotel Rwanda is one of the most powerful films; made even more so by the current crisis in Darfur, which has been compared to that of the Rwandan genocide, and where thousands of innocent civilians are being slaughtered by various factions in society. The film does so much more than make you cry incessantly for the most part of it; more than anything, it involves YOU. It makes you enraged and disgraced, to know that the international community stood by and did nothing for these people. Moreso, it forces you to ACT on humanitarian catastrophes which are taking place right now, and to consider whether you are similarly standing by to watch. Hotel Rwanda is a brilliant film which should be seen by everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Million Corpses,"By the time this movie ends, you really have no choice but to sit back and take a deep breath as you process the insanity of the fact that this really happened. A million corpses. That's the note this movie ends on, in estimating the carnage caused in Rwanda as a result of the Hutu slaughter of Tutsis in the early 1990's. ""Hotel Rwanda"" offers just one glimpse into the madness - but a soberingly powerful glimpse.Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Belgian owned hotel in the capital of Kigali, who is left in charge when the Europeans leave and finds himself the sole protector of what would become hundreds of desperate Tutsis, who find shelter in the hotel. Paul is a Hutu who is married to a Tutsi, and who is horrified by the escalating violence. Sophie Okonedo is equally brilliant as Paul's wife Tatiana, under threat for being a Tutsi, her children under threat, her brother and his family missing in the midst of the chaos. You get drawn into this family's nightmare, but the movie never becomes solely about them. It's always about the insanity, and the complete failure of the international community to do anything about it. From that point of view, Nick Nolte plays Col. Oliver, a Canadian officer in command of far too few UN peacekeepers, who knows what's happening but is powerless to stop it. Oliver is essentially a representation of Canadian General Romeo Dallaire, who was the UN Commander in Rwanda at the time. Nolte wasn't as brilliant as Cheadle or Okonedo. I thought he struggled a bit with the part, although he drew out the character's frustration and anger at the UN's impotence.The movie reminded me a bit of ""Schindler's List"" - particularly as Paul bargained with Hutu officers for the lives of Tutsis, just as Schindler bargained with Nazis for the lives of Jews. The first hour or so I thought was a bit slow, although director Terry George built the suspense nicely, and one of the more interesting parts of the movie came in that first hour with an explanation of the difference between Hutus and Tutsis. It apparently isn't a traditional tribal designation. The Belgian colonizers divided the natives into these two groups, based on the lightness of their skin and the wideness of their noses! There's no happy ending in this movie. There is a family reunion of sorts (a partial one, anyway) but the haunting memory for me was that closing caption - ""a million corpses.""

A disturbing truth.,"I saw this movie while serving in UN mission in Ivory Coast. I saw this movie because it relates to another UN mission in Africa.I really did not know much about Africa and its people. This movie helped me to get closer to the African problem.It is really hard to believe that diversity of ethnic group is a curse rather than being a blessing in Africa. Surprisingly they don't fight for religion, what we see in South Asia. But they fight for ethnicity. Ethnic division was not that big problem before europeans arrived here. But now this issue has captivated whole Africa.The movie tried to avoid graphic violence and tell a sort of family story. It mainly focused on the love and commitment of a man to his family and to his community. But in the process you see a brutal genocide.The killings were more brutal in reality. The whole history was more brutal. You can at least sense it through this movie.You will feel more attachment to the people of Africa. Africa is no more a place what you see in National Geographic. It offers more than just colorful ceremonies of animists.I sincerely thank the people who worked for this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A very good film,"Much has been said about this film, both good and bad, and I want to try and add my measured response to the film.To cover the basics: this is a movie about the genocide in Rwanda in the early 1990s. The main character shelters hundreds of innocent refuges in a large luxury hotel as chaos breaks out around the city. He uses his extensive political contacts to keep the murdering militias at bay while seeking a way for the refugees to escape.The movie is gripping and intense from the start to finish. The characters are easy to identify with and well cast. The director does a wonderful job at creating an environment of impending doom and chaos. Most importantly this movie depicts a very important chapter of history and records it for future generations. Much like Schindler's List this is a movie that all should see so that the world never forgets what happened.As a movie it does have it's flaws however. It drags on a bit too long and as a result some of the tension is lost. Repeatedly throughout the movie it seems like the bad guys are about to be victorious only to be thwarted at the last second (literally, the last second) by the main character. The combination of repeat last second saves gives the movie a strong feel of The Boy Who Cried Wolf and the omnipotence of the main character. It's hard to maintain tension when you've seen the same conflict resolved multiple times in the same manner by a character who seems to be able to deliver anything.This issue should not keep anyone from seeing this movie however. For the subject matter it's pretty easy to get into, which was one of my main worries coming into the movie. Highly acclaimed for good reason this is a movie that won't do you wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Now I can understand that how much one's life can be hard and to what extent. This blend of reality & direction in this movie is simply heart warming and breath taking.

Powerful film,"Powerful film. Matching the tone of the film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at the 2005 Oscars. Cheadle's accent in Ocean's 11 was the worst cockney this side of Mary Poppins but here he gets the accent and mannerisms just right and made me forget that he was an American. His character changes throughout the film and he copes with it really well, producing a character that is easy to get behind and provides a very human face to the story. Okonedo is superb and is almost impossible to watch without being moved to tears more than once. Nolte is effectively gruff although he is less a character than he is a symbol of how ineffective the UN was at the time. In a similar vein Phoenix is excellent in a small role although really I could have done with a few less starry cameos as they tended to distract from the main material. Outside of the lead two, the actors are not given as much to work with as the lead two but Cheadle and Okonedo are superb and match the emotional impact of the material.9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brutal and Brilliant!,"This film is best described with two seemingly unrelated adjectives - beautiful and gut-wrenching.Both these adjectives can in fact be used to depict the two faces of human nature as shown in this outstanding film.A harrowing account of the true-life genocide that occurred in Rwanda in 1994, 'Hotel Rwanda' is a remarkable effort in every sense.Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina,the manager of a Belgian-owned hotel in Kigali,Rwanda,gives an exceptional,career-defining performance.The dignity he brings to the part,and the determination and resourcefulness of his character make for truly compelling viewing and I often found myself choked with emotion as I watched one disturbing sequence after another unfold.Supporting performances by all are excellent, with a special mention for the amazing Sophie Okonedo.Terry George's direction has the required lucidity and delivers solid solar-plexus punches as the story moves along at a (surprisingly) brisk pace.At the end of it all,we are left with a deep sense of regret at our insensitivity towards anything that doesn't directly affect us.Cinema this moving doesn't come along everyday and I recommend it highly for all discerning viewers out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The actor Jon Cheadle did an exceptional job at replaying the life of Paul Rusesabagina and helps the viewers get the real feel of the situation that Paul and his family experienced. The film has such power that it brings tears, sadness but also hopefulness. I had no real idea of the massacre that occurred in Rwanda and the film really helped explain the conflict and the horror that many of the people suffered during the experience.

This story also portrays a struggle for unity and a better life that is challenges by a conflict that causes many deaths and causes panic amongst a whole country.

How this movie differs from Schindler's List,"Hotel Rwanda definitely is a top grade movie.But what makes this movie so special is the way the African unrest in 1994 was portrayed.Unlike Schindler's List(which is another 10 on 10 movie)this movie do not have too many violent scenes, but still manages to maintain the intensity of the subject matter.Schindler's List captures a lot of violence and has a negative way of building the tempo and intensity of the movie, whereas, Hotel Rwanda has a very positive way of building the tempo and intensity of the movie by concentrating on incidents where lives were saved.To site an example, there is a sequence where Paul(Don Cheadle) thinks his wife and children have jumped off the roof and killed themselves instead of getting butchered by Hutu machetes.However, later he found his family was safe.In this sequence, even if it were shown that his family was killed, it would have added to the intensity and drama which was building up.But that would have been the negative approach.Another such sequence is when Paul finds his son behind a bush all covered up in blood.Here also it could have shown that it was his son who was attacked.But later it reveals that it was not the boy's blood,it was the blood of another victim killed in front of the boy.Here also ,once again,violence was minimized, but without losing the impact and the viewer can always feel the tension and horror going around.Also, instead of showing the incident on screen,there is a conversation between Paul and a Red Cross worker where she narrates a horrible incident she has seen: an orphan child from her orphanage butchered to death in front of her eyes.This passive way of creating the savage environment of the riot is commendable as this makes the movie open to people who do not like explicit violence.The movie actually used just one incident where a Paul Russessabagina saves 1300 people with the riot in its background. Unlike Schindler's List, it id not use the riot itself with the main incident as a part of it.Personally, I feel this movie is something that is bound to touch a viewer's heart and something which lingers in your mind for a long long time after you have watched the movie.Hat's off! 10 on 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Important story; gripping portrayal,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from go to woh. Not only is it an important story to know about (it's based on real events in our recent history), but it's delivered to the screen with panache.Those who, like me, feel long since overdosed on screen violence, will be happy with this. Even though he could easily justify a violent portrayal because the horrific events really happened, the director protects the audience from the harshest visuals. Instead the emphasis is much more on the build up of events, and the characters' responses as the drama unfolds.It left me with the oh so important, but oh so unpleasant understanding that This Could Happen To Me - to you, to us. The way such extreme events crept up on ordinary good people is a precious education for the viewer.The best thing? Sophie Okonedo. She is nothing less than brilliant. What a classy performance. I sometimes find myself watching actors respond to terrible events thinking, ""In real life they would be more upset - they'd be wailing, going out of their mind."" Sophie delivers emotional truth in extreme circumstances like no performance I have ever witnessed. Remarkable, unforgettable and incredibly generous.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Important Film About An Often Ignored Subject.......,"When it became apparent, in 1994, that genocide was impending in the African nation of Rwanda, much of the west deemed the people of that impoverished country ""unworthy"" of aid or resources. On the part of the United States, Rwanda was low on the list of priorities; fresh from the Bosnia conflict, and interventions in Haiti and Somalia, the US did not want to risk involvement there. A small unit of UN peacekeepers were deployed, but suffered under heavy restrictions. They were given little money and outdated equipment. When Rwandan president Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April, the dam broke and Hutu flooded the streets out for blood. The minority Tutsi were considered the enemy and were targeted by roadblocks and constant radio broadcasts calling for their extermination. Moderate Hutu also came under the blade of the machete (the preferred weapon of the masses). What started as essentially a social conflict, or what most thought a prelude to civil war, erupted into chaotic slaughter amongst a poor and uneducated populous. Bodies lay strewn in the streets, in the houses and rivers. Even before the violence reached its apex, and the term genocide became unavoidable, the world powers seemed to have forgotten Rwanda and left the country to burn.It is in the city of Kigali, during this period, that the film HOTEL RWANDA takes place. It focuses on the real life story of the manager of a five-star resort named Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who has found himself integrated into the ""style"" of the west. He procures fine cigars and expensive whiskey for his foreign visitors and for the military elite who frequent the hotel. He is a Hutu married to a Tutsi woman, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), their children being of mixed blood. When the violence of April 1994 reaches his doorstep, he does everything he can to save his family, but finds himself a part of something larger. As the situation worsens, and the UN forces diminish, Paul uses his money, limited resources, and social contacts to protect the hundreds of people who sought the hotel as a refuge. He quickly realizes that there will be no intervention; the scenes involving Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the frustrated UN peacekeeper, are pointed as he explains to Paul that the world does not care about him or his country. It is hard to deny that elements of racism played a part in the decisions of world powers and Paul feels betrayed by the false prophet of the west. In one of the most poignant scenes, Paul watches as foreign nationals are evacuated from the hotel. A busload of white faces pulls away, and with them the security forces, leaving the defenseless group of Africans to meet their fate. But events leave little time for self reflection, as there are almost hourly threats against the hotel and the people inside. Eventually the payoffs and bribes no longer work and Paul is left only with words, which he uses to play on the fears of men like General Bizimungu (Fana Mokoena), creating a sense of power he does not really have. After words fail, only hope remains.Don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, is truly memorable. It is an important performance, and rare, where the actor ceases and only the character remains. Observe the scene when, having returned with supplies, Paul is overcome by what he has viewed on the roads. Cheadle is mesmerizing here, but he is just as nuanced in the smaller moments which makes his breakdown all the more effective and real. He does not falter for a moment. Sophie Okonedo is just as good; she is strong and avoids the ""woman in peril"" clichés so prevalent in film. It is Nick Nolte who reminds us here that he can be an actor of great depth when given the opportunity, and the entire supporting cast helps immensely. HOTEL RWANDA marks a departure for director Terry George, who is from Northern Ireland, and has worked almost exclusively with Jim Sheridan on stories about that region. Here he creates tension without gimmicks and allows the characters to develop. He puts a human face to the abstract bloodshed of Rwanda during the massacres, but avoids preaching or over sentimentalizing the harrowing subject matter. The cinematography, production design and music help George in recreating the time and place. HOTEL RWANDA seems effortless in its portrayal of the events, but these are, in fact, the hardest films to make.It was difficult for me to imagine a film about the genocide in Rwanda as having a PG-13 rating. In a way it is good because the film will reach a wider audience and shed light upon a recent atrocity which was ignored at the time and has been largely forgotten since. Having seen various documentaries on the subject, read participant's accounts and seen chilling photographs of rivers choked with corpses, the true scale of violence was staggering. HOTEL RWANDA does not quite capture the brutality and horror of the events where mobs of people used sharpened car parts and bicycle handles to kill Tutsi as well as Hutu ""traitors."" It instead chooses to focus on the personal story of Paul and his efforts. He is a brave man who saved the lives of many through his efforts, although chance seems to have played a large part. The film should also help us look ahead to the events in the Darfur region of the Sudan where many of the same things are happening today and which has been obscured by other world events. The message of HOTEL RWANDA seems to be that something like this can happen at anytime, in anyplace, and that each instance is as worthy of our attention as the next. I hope this film will continue to have an impact but in the long term it is people, not films, that will make a difference. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Finially the massacre in Rwanda has been brought to the world's attention, only 11 years too late.","Hotel Rwanda is one of those few cinematic masterpieces that you can recant over and over in your mind, to your families, friends and educators. The movie depicts the desperate situation of a nation torn by civil war and genocide between two major tribes in 1994. However the main focus of the movie deals with a hotel manager who desperately tries to save his family and refugees from the slaughter occurring beyond the hotel property. Normally I am aggravated when a director goes out of his way to give his film a pg-13 so preteens can see it, thus increasing profit. however this movie's rating is highly justified. Everyone deserves to see and care about what had happened in Rwanda, because the world leaders and media at the time of the atrocity certainly did not. With the recent production of numerous WWII movies, the holocaust has been brought to light while the Rwandan genocide had been swept under the the rug, until now. Done Cheadle did a superb job in his role that made me feel like i was right there with him. He is very under-rated and i feel he can out-act even the best such as Denzel Washington. Nolte plays a Canadian UN field leader who is obviously modeled after the Canadian war hero Romeo Dellaire whom attempts to bring the crisis to the international authorities' attention and in return tragically gets his squad of UN peace keepers reduced. This only adds to the desperation of the situation. The movie touches on the personal lives, politics, religion and culture of Rwanda during this short but dark chapter in human history. Much of those who were able to change the outcome of the situation at the time deserve to be shamed by this movie. So many times has society claimed that genocide will never happen again, but i think what society really means is that it will never happen to ""white"" people again. Such a statement can draw this review allot of criticism, but I feel it taps into the darkest part of the human soul where self denial and racism are clearly present. Hotel Rwanda deserves all the accolades it receives and will be shown in homes and classrooms for years to come. My hat's off to the production team, the cast and the crew to bring such a turbulent, dark, short, yet important era of human history to the forefront of the media world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent film,"One of the best films I have seen. Great cast, great acting and excellent portrayal of the main character. Its been a while since I saw it so I don't remember all details. But I did watch a documentary on the Paul and I wonder why no Oscars for that excellent portrayal by Don, down to the accent. Would recommend it to all who are tired of the run of the mill movies out there. The tale is of courage,of cunning, of survival and is true. How Paul tries to ""save up"" on favors for a rainy day, how conditions make him form a man out to survive into a hero of his own scale to save others. How he deals with having to juggle his position between the factions that he belongs to and that of his wife. In bits and pieces, it is all there. And the end is amazing. A worthy film that portrays what sick things can happen and how easily we all turn a blind eye. Well this film reminds and tells us we were there and we were blind as it happened. Kudos to the cast and crew. Effort was complete, not just a quick documentary or total Hollywood whitewash of the topic. Characters are built and influences and incidents are interwoven well. 10/10 any day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great, just not ""PG-13"" Material","This was an amazing movie, incredibly made, and is definitely Oscar- material. But I just wanted to say, this movie should NOT be rated PG-13. I went to see it last week (I'm fifteen) and was sobbing throughout the whole feature. It is really thematic and intense, and, although I'm glad I saw it, it should have been R. They never show too much, just enough to get the story across, but some of the scenes are really emotional and disturbing. If you think you're up to it, by all means see ""Hotel Rwanda"" but don't bring ten or twelve year olds unless they're really mature. ""Hotel Rwanda"" puts small children in dangerous situations and has many dead bodies. It is kind of telling that our rating system puts movies like ""Billy Elliot,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Motorcycle Diaries"" in the R category because of homosexuality, swearing, violence and leprosy but won't rates a movie about real-life murder and genocide PG-13.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Why are Belgians innocent?,"It is shown as if Belgium has no fault. Belgium is the country responsible for the deaths of so many people. There are no Tutsis or Hutus, there are Rwandans. The Belgians made up these two terms.However, it is still a very successful film and conveys the pain to the audience well. In terms of casting, Don Cheadle is perfect for the role.Rwanda is not shown differently than it is, which is a good thing for the film. It takes a lot of talent to bring such tragedies to life.

Anti-UN and Western World,"During the course of this movie the scenes of Genocide and the actions committed by the UN and the Western World create a sense of direct friction from the people in Rwanda that need help and the world who will idly stand by and watch the atrocities form their T.V.s. When I the theater i thought to myself about why the world never did anything to interject. At the time this went on my father was in the Army and i was unable to vote. Why did you people not act? My father asks why as well he was willing to go there and give his life in order to stop the mass genocide. I blame the fact that this movie is so empowering on the failings of those that had a voice during that time. If you are one of thoughs people then i hold you responsible for not acting. As the movie displayed individual people did act and made a difference, why didn't the individual people here make a difference. Namely Bill Clinton, he could have done something about this but he was afraid of political opinion with out the backing of the UN. He was a afraid of another Somalia event, which by record wasn't really that bad, it's the basic fact that America doesn't except that when one joins the Military the are forced to sign a paper stating that there is the possibility that they will get in harm's way and that the will possibly die because of it. Hopefully this movie will open peoples eyes and the will see the failings of ourselves. but unfortunately when i saw the movie there where 6 other people in the theater excluding myself and my friends. I encourage everyone to see this movie and may it reflect upon their lives and their attitude toward the world, because there is Genocide going on now in the Sudan and they need our aid.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
why the praise?,"I'm surprised at the amount of praise this movie receives; through the Oscars, on this website. Only 23 negative responses, and most of the comments are around six. Well, I'm going to have to lower the number, people. I'm stickin this puppy at around four. Why? I'll tell you.Granted, the story is ""moving"", but it feels very well worn and very familiar and like a million other movies of its ilk, but a different territory. None of the people I saw it with (seven others) enjoyed it and the general synopsis was that a documentary would have been sufficient to convey the power of the story; the story of Rwanda, that is. There are some very good performances, especially Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, but the problem is that the movie is ultimately a feel good drama that churns along a very familiar path. It's another ""hero"" story, which is fine (the hero tries to save a whole bunch of his people by keeping them in his hotel; ultimately making big sacrifices at the expense of his own potential survival), but not when so much of it is cheapened by oversentimentality, emotional manipulation and characters that have very little depth. I didn't find his wife to have much depth. She is the poor suffering wife. That's it. We see them in various intimate scenarios while this genocide is ravaging the country, and for some reason we are meant to care. I just couldn't. It seemed like cheap romantic scenes thrown in to force us to feel. I couldn't. If anything, they slowed down the film. The story really felt like ""Rwanda 101"" a way to give us a sanitized version of what happened in 1994 in a simple way, full of overwrought dramatics. It's also yet another movie that has non-English speaking people speaking English with each other for two hours. For me, that automatically cheapens the story because you can basically see the minds at work behind that one: let's make a movie that is palatable for the American public, instead of having their original languages spoken. What's wrong with subtitles? Some of my favourite movies have subtitles. I realize many people don't want to read subtitles, but considering 90 percent of the movies made outside of North America, which already have trouble getting exposure, have subtitles, I think it is out of respect that people initiate themselves into the subtitle world because I can honestly say that subtitles have not ruined my appreciation for a single movie. Also, if we are to experience the true, authentic nature of the world of these characters, isn't their language incredibly important?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A beautifully acted story of the ugliness in Rwanda,"Picture a world where you are hated and your life forfeit, simply because of some choice made by a ruling democrat decades ago. Now picture yourself being one of the objects of that hate in Rwanda during the civil war in 1994.One of the most poignant and striking moments for me in this movie, was when a soldier asks to see the main character's passport (Rusesabagina)and makes a potentially life or death decision based upon a blue rubber stamp at the corner of a page. To decide whether to hate a person and wish them dead based upon such a (seemingly) insignificant mark left me feeling cold and a little sick.This story is filled with such aberrations.When we picked this movie off the shelf, I had a small idea of the atrocities in Rwanda and was prepared for a story reminscient of the ""The Killing Fields"". It that regard, it was predictable. However the empathy for the characters, played so well, each emotional high and low broadcast from their faces like a bright light, left me tearing up when pulled into the dark drama of genocide in Rwanda.This story demonstrates the full spectrum of the human condition; compassion, greed, hatred, respect, love, dignity and the sheer force of will made available when facing the extinction of loved ones.Hotel Rwanda does not demonstrate more than cursory lesson in the circumstances that led up to the strife, but it does show you what humanity is capable of doing - for good or evil - as a result.Watching this movie left me embarrassed by my lack of knowledge or involvement in such heady themes, and ashamed of how the world treated our brethren in Africa.

The tone of the ignorance...,"This is the movie that serves a shame upon our faces like a slap that how worthless a human being is. We as a human being, from the beginning of the word, have not learned that there is nothing valuable than a living human life. No matter what the comparing factor is, a single human living is priceless. And this is the movie which shows the distinct points taking place in the center of Africa in a very dramatic way.Drinking some beers at the top of a hotel roof while watching the bullets (whatever it is) going through the sky! Think about that, I guess it should not be a good background that is going to be remembered.In the movie the place is symbolic, it does not matter if it is Africa, Iraq, and Vietnam etc; there are unfortunately too many places on earth where such kind of action was taken or is being taken by some superior forces for nothing.Moreover, the act of the cast is very good and realistic in the movie.

A Heart-Wrenching Tale of Courage Amidst Chaos,"Hotel Rwanda is a heartbreaking and powerful portrayal of one of the darkest chapters in human history-the Rwandan Genocide. Director Terry George delivers a gut-wrenching film that captures the brutality and chaos of the genocide, yet also shines a light on the courage and resilience of those who tried to save lives amidst the horrors.Don Cheadle gives an extraordinary performance as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who becomes an unlikely hero by sheltering over 1,200 Tutsi refugees in the Hôtel des Mille Collines. Cheadle's portrayal is deeply moving, balancing fear, desperation, and an unwavering sense of duty. His nuanced performance gives the film its emotional core, making the audience feel every ounce of his character's anguish and bravery.The script is equally compelling. It masterfully builds suspense, capturing the rising tension as the outside world turns a blind eye to the slaughter, leaving Rusesabagina and those he protects in an increasingly perilous situation. The screenplay deftly blends personal drama with the broader political landscape, showing how an ordinary man is pushed into extraordinary circumstances. The way it slowly unravels the impending genocide creates a feeling of dread that is both heart-stopping and heartbreaking.The film doesn't shy away from the brutality of the conflict, presenting gut-wrenching scenes of violence and fear that are difficult to watch, yet necessary to convey the sheer horror of what took place. These scenes are powerful and unflinching, but never gratuitous-serving as a reminder of the human cost of hatred and indifference.While the movie can be hard to watch due to its raw portrayal of real-life atrocities, its message of hope and humanity amidst chaos shines through. The supporting cast, including Sophie Okonedo and Joaquin Phoenix, also add depth and weight to the narrative, making this film a well-rounded, emotionally charged experience.Overall, Hotel Rwanda is a suspenseful, heartbreaking, and incredibly important film. Its brutal story is difficult to process, but its powerful message about the human capacity for both evil and good lingers long after the credits roll. This is a movie that stays with you, earning a solid 8/10 for its impactful storytelling, extraordinary performances, and unflinching honesty.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Rwanda, black people and children","The general of the United Nations explained to Paul in this way that you are not only black, but you are also African.
So in the end no one came, including those so-called humanitarians.
I have no intention of belittle this general, there is no doubt that he is a good person. In those chaotic days, he did help these isolated refugees.
However, how much sympathy is contained in such help? It's not just respect for life.
When the disaster came, he finally chose to leave. Perhaps for him, it is moral to assist the weak, but to stand by for granted.
There are also white people who once lived in Rwandan restaurants. When they left, there was hardly any expression on their faces. Except for the lady whose dog is sick.
They have never personally experienced the pain of the skin of the Rwandan people, so no matter what, no matter what, the sense of superiority as a white man always exists.
Some ordinary people unreasonably despise others from their bones, which is called sorrow.Fortunately, the director did not deliberately arrange for a white savior. It was their black compatriots who rescued Rwandan hotel refugees.

A rare gem,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is one of those rare films that lingers in your mind and heart long after you've watched it. Directed by Terry George, this deeply poignant movie portrays an extraordinary true story of courage, compassion, and the resilience of the human spirit amidst unimaginable circumstances.Don Cheadle's portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina is nothing short of remarkable. As a man caught in the chaos of a world falling apart, he rises beyond the limits of fear, embodying selflessness and quiet strength. His journey is a reminder of how one person's moral clarity can inspire hope, even when hope seems impossible.What struck me most is the film's profound ability to balance the personal and the global-showing not just a story of survival but also challenging us as viewers to question our own roles in a world where injustices are often ignored. It's not merely a historical recount but a mirror reflecting the complexities of humanity, forcing us to ask: ""What would I do in such a moment?""""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't an easy watch, but it's an essential one. It's a masterful blend of powerful storytelling and raw human emotion that compels you to think, feel, and, most importantly, act.

Brilliant Cinema,"From a technical standpoint I found the movie basically flawless. It gets the point of just how bad the civil war was without having to nauseate viewers with blood. It uses the trick of what you don't see instead. The constant sound of sporadic gunfire, sirens, and people running by screaming sufficiently scared the pants off of me.The fact that the film can do this speaks volumes to the quality of script, cast, and production itself. For once the MPAA got the ratings right. 13 year old children have seen and heard far more gory, but the subject matter might very well be far too complicated for them to understand. I wouldn't worry too much about the original r rating beyond that.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Acts of genocide' and acts of bravery,"Just throwing in my 10 points to add up to the total. I haven't seen 'Sometimes in April' yet, so maybe I will indeed scratch my head thinking that one's even better on the Rwandan tragedy, as some say, but right now I'm under the impression of 'Hotel Rwanda'. And I am already pretty sure that those who say this film is a 'light' version of whatever exactly happened are wrong. This film doesn't try to win an Oscar by using brutal pictures a lot to inscribe itself in the viewer's brain. (Though it will still make you feel the violence from time to time.) It's real drama. The background, the genocide, the war and all that, they are important factors, but the point is the drama of hotelier Paul Rusesabagina's family. To steal a US diplomat's words from the movie, you can see some 'acts of genocide', but you won't see 'genocide', at least not for most of the time. And you'll see acts of bravery, but not of the reckless type, not the kind of Hollywood heroism that is an euphemism for stupidity.You can find those very strong scenes in this movie that are so powerful that they will have an effect on you no matter how many times you watch the film. One of those scenes pulls off nothing less than giving the audience a genuine laughter amid a sea of horror, genuine, honest laughter, not forced at all, not trying-to-be-satirical-when-inappropriate, and so not distasteful at all. Check it out. It's scenes like that that reinforce my impression that 'Hotel Rwanda' was in fact an outstandingly good film.One picture that inexplicably stayed very long there in my mind. An RPF soldier firing after militiamen. We don't see where he is shooting. Just that he takes up one textbook shooting position after the other, feeling probably a little proud of himself not being just another peasant given a gun. This is a very small detail that you'll see only from a distance. Now, where you find such hidden values that is a good film. About another war-torn, structurally burdened state, where the warrior-minded have enough providers of the above mentioned textbooks who are ready to supply them from the outside.Don't watch this film as a documentary. If you want insight gained from this film, ponder rather the analysis it gives of how a refuge can be kept safe in the midst of a structural war (think of 'satellites' and 'phone calls' and the like). As long as it is realistic in the treatment of that issue, it doesn't really matter how many small details it got wrong as to the rest of the conflict.

This movie also shows one we can do under stress it shows how ignorant hatred can be if we let it escalate to something were we hate someone simply for one fact. Don Cheadle acting was up to par and the realism was good with the AK-47 and the RPG that were used in the time. Something that got me was if they got back on the bus or it left without them. Also I was not aware that it was the FRench who supplied the Huto army. This was a surprising fact. Also what I liked was the sense of comedy that sprung up at tense moments. What I felt to be the most powerful was the scene with the bodies on the road. It shows what Pele do when it is supported by others. I believe that many of them felt that they did not want to commit genocide but if they did not they would be killed as well. I feel that this movie deserved Oscar over Million Dollar Baby,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a must to watch,"It's a wonderful movie, in these days when Israel attacks Lebanon it makes you think so much. Superb performance by Don Cheadle. It deals with Rwanda's civil war, and shows us how a single person can change permanently so many other's destinies, other than his and his family's. It also gives a very important message in an absolutely non-rhetorical way: war is the worst the human being can do and/or have. No winners, only losers. The movie also criticizes the rich West (Europe & North America) which cares about countries which can make worse our standard of living, but does not care at all about so many other countries who suffer a very bad social, economical, political situation. ONU is powerless sometimes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A MUST-See movie,"I grew up in South Africa, but now live in Canada, and being an inveterate reader of film credits, I did not realize until the end of the movie that this was a South Africa/Canada co-production. I have long been interested in the feature film industries of both countries. This is a movie that could NEVER have been produced in Hollywood, as it is an uncomfortable and scathing indictment of the neglect and disinterest of the West in what went on in Rwanda. The events show in this movie are no different from what took place during the Holocaust, and what is going on in Sudan and other areas at this very moment. It is not enough that every thinking, feeling person must see this movie.

"An excellent film in the style of ""Schindler's List""","A devastating film about the ultimate strength and love of a man and how he changes in the midst of terror. Paul is, like Schindler, a suave, knowledgeable gentleman, with strong values and great pride in his abilities to charm people. He learns to use his charm and wit to save over one thousand Hutus and Tsutsis who are being sentenced to slaughter as traitors or cockroaches. Paul, a Hutu, is married to a Tsutsi, and much is made in the film of how a name label is sufficient to condemn one--there is really little physical difference between the Tall Trees (Tsutsis) and the Hutus. The movie shows how the world, outside Africa, turned its back on the genocide of one million Tsutsis in 1994--including the UN, who described themselves as ""Peace KEEPERS"" not ""Peace MAKERS.""

This is what movies should be about,"I rarely go to the theater. The majority of films produced by Hollywood are solipsistic romps through the same hollow themes. But everything I read about this film sounded different. A co-worker who saw it (and this guy watches all kinds of movies) told me it upset him and made him think. Thinking, real thinking, is like kryptonite is to Superman for most people. So I knew something good had to be involved. This was a very dignified film in that it showed the nobility of a man (Paul) putting himself on the line for family and friends. When American television has shown me so many dumb parents and single parents to whom life is a materialistic game I found Paul Rusesabaginaas as refreshing as cold spring water in the desert. And even though I know the murders of so many people with machetes had to be a gruesome sight I appreciated not being subjected to the usual special effects waterfall of blood and gore. I believe it was a good thing that director Terry George was able to retain control and pick Don Cheadle for the lead role instead of someone like Will Smith. Smith is OK but would not have been the best choice for this part. Hotel Rwanda helps restore meaning to the word ""artistry"". It is an oasis in a celluloid wasteland.

We Think You're Dirt,"I'm not sure how to explain just how moving this movie is. I'd never heard of this movie, just happened to catch it on the Movie Network, and it was one of those rare experiences where I couldn't stop watching.The movie is really documentary in style, and makes you feel, sickeningly, like you are there. Stomach churning, revolting to think what man can do to man, people who are so similar killing each other.You will think it is sad to hear the Western Reporter comment that the two women could be twins, even though one was Hutu and one was Tutsi, you understand the evil in the hearts of some Africans. But that is nothing compared to the UN General's declaration that ""We Think you are DIRT"". His declaration, of course, was not his personal opinion, but simply a condemnation of how the West treats even the worst crimes in Africa.That is when you realize that the evil there is borne of two peoples with a history of hatred, but the evil borne from the West has no excuse. The poor black people in Africa are entirely left to their own means, to let what will happen, happen. Even UN help on the ground is withdrawn.And it would take a fool not to see that this is still going on -- as the west, and the US especially, protects its own interests in Iraq, and ignores current genocide in Darfur, it almost makes one ashamed to be from the West, or it made me feel that way at least.

Its portrayal of the conflict is unflinching, and it serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of violence and indifference.While the film's focus on one man's heroic efforts provides a personal lens on the broader tragedy, it also raises important questions about international response and responsibility.

Good but shocking movie that deserves to be ranked higher,"This is the shocking story of the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 - while the whole world was watching. It is not only a black page in Rwanda's history but because of modern internationalization and media a black page in the history of mankind. One becomes aware of the worthlessness of life and the price that is paid for the colonization of Africa and its consequences. This film is a statement in itself, and remembers us of so many mass murders in recent ages. The superb acting by Don Cheadle who acts like a hero, but a very good cast overall support the story and message. Equally good is the storyline and involvement with the characters. This combined with the fact that violence is always on the background, but only seldom on the foreground (although there are some violent scenes, mainly the results are shown) makes this movie not a vampire movie... This movie should be in history lessons everywhere... with the full background story.

Cheadle is amazing in this heartbreaking movie,"Don Cheadle's Oscar nominated performance drives this heartbreaking and emotional drama set during the Hutu-Tutsi civil war in Rwanda. Cheadle plays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who tries to save the lives of more than a thousand Tutsi refugees by hiding them in his hotel.A few scenes that will be hard for me to (ever) forget, the ""bumps"" on the road as they drive through the fog, the little orphan girl exclaiming ""Please don't let them kill me, I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore"" Yeah, brutal. So anyways. A good movie, Cheadle's performance is amazing, I had a hard time accepting Nick Nolte as a ""Canadian"" UN Colonel, Joaquin Phoenix is essentially a cameo, not a big budget Hollywood film and all the better for it.

Politics....,"This movie was absolutely horrible!!!!!! Horribly good. I cried so many times. I cried for the Paul, the main character and his family. I cried for Rwanda and the innocent people slaughtered. I mostly cried because of my ignorance and the ignorance of America and other influential countries/province. I'm sad to admit I was not even aware of these issues. This movie puts you IN Rwanda. One moves from watching this movie in their comfortable chair to being there in the madness and corruption. Many compare the movie to Schindler List. Horrific wise, sure, any holocaust is just that, horrible. I do not think it is fair to do so production wise because the former is a Hollyowood produced film while the latter was independent. Furthermore I thought the director did an excellent job engaging the audience. With just enough slaughter shot to familiarize you with the environment without making it a gory movie. I'm so glad a the common face of Denzel Washinghton was not present. That would have completely moved the focus from Paul struggle to ""Denzel Washington with a funny accent"" struggle.

A modern  war drama masterpiece,"I am not one to feel for movie characters as I usually tend to see through the script and skip on through to the next scene of events. Ever rarer do I actually go to the cinema to see a movie.However I am so glad I saw this one tonight.Hotel Rwanda is an emotional train ride that for two hours will keep you glued to the screen/seat often with your jaw gaping thinking ""oh wow"". That is really the most anyone will be able to mutter during the screening as from the get go you are captivated by the cinematography and cast presented in this production.One element that completely drives this movie into the high echelon of anybody's collection is that it is a true story. There is little artistic twist and even if there was any you really were unable to tell. All of the events occurring on screen are believable and make the viewer feel like you are actually there. Several times I really thought that if I turned my head I would see something on the screen akin to what I was expecting to see and it did happen in the movie right when I glanced back to the screen. It is not predictable, it simply creates the atmosphere that you can bond with what is going on. You are no longer some distant set of eyes starring at a movie reel, you are there. Few movies have ever been able to convey this feeling.The representation of chaos and serenity is almost painfully beautiful. It is so fake, yet everyone knows it but keeps carrying on. The characters realize that what happens outside the hotel yet they cannot do anything about it. The only thing that stands between them and eternal oblivion is a building and a handful of militarily helpless UN soldiers. The several times we are taken for a ride outside the hotel the other side of the movie is right in your face. Again, there are no dramatic sequences, no extended WW2 type zoom in death shots, just a camera showing you the reality. The reality that is closing in on the people in the hotel. Horrors of a large scale civil war massacre are depicted in a touching manner flowing in nicely with the overall tempo of the movie. Nothing feels out of place or pops out of nowhere to confuse you. The storyline remains simple and linear not burdening you with trying to figure what just happened. There are no complex flashbacks used to basically clue you in. Quite the contrary. The less you know the more you will enjoy this movie. It tells you all you need to know right there, when you need to know it.The tension that the script creates is incredible. Again this was one of the few movies ever that had me doubting what will the outcome be. You really don't have time to think ahead, it doesn't follow a cookie cutter script made for the masses. It is a movie, yet it is a first person documentary seen from the third person perspective.The cast itself was an interesting assembly of people you have seen before. Do not be surprised if you exclaim ""I've seen this person"" playing a somewhat untraditional role. It really works out great. There is a lot of African talent used in this movie so there isn't the crazy hysterical fake emotional trip usually associated with Hollywood. In fact, a lot of the extra cast acts just like you have seen in the shows about world poverty where they would go in a camp and show you what it really is like. A lot of does not feel like a movie so you are really left to enjoy it for what it is and take it as you wish.Some argue that there is a political message however I find this to be highly speculative. Yes politics are plugged in but that only helps illustrate the sheer exasperation the characters go through. Certainly the message of the film is lose terms is that while the world refused to care, one man decided to do just that. Thought it is not really aimed against anyone in particular. It makes you think, but not in a propaganda like manner.The story of a man, the struggle of a family, the indifference of the world mixed in with human savagery collide and yet work together to create a drama that stands above the rest. It will be hard to forget this movie as every single person can somehow place themselves in it at some point and think, ""yes this can happen to me, to my hometown"". The question is, what will you do about it and who will be there for you?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Much better than Schindler's list, more real and succinct. The drama was really felt.

In addition a little more historical background may have been more appropriate for foreigners like myself who didn't quite understand the crisis at the beginning of the film. -such an footnote would have be more helpful.

"I think the film is a 'high 8', but I gave it 9","Don Cheadle's acting was absolutely stunning. I don't know who got the Oscar that year, but Don deserved it 100%. The film itself is OK, but it gets the point across...tells the story enough for people who get a basic knowledge of what went on in 2004. If that sparks an interest then maybe people will want to learn more.The Rwandan massacre is something that really affects me, the people were murdering their own friends,colleagues...even family, simply because they were not of the same tribe. Millions of people murdered in cold blood, people chopped up in cold blood and left in the street or lining the roads. Barbaric...that'd never happen in a civilised country would it? or would it! This was a country where the people lived in relative comfort, many had nice houses and were well fed and clothed. People seem to have a mental image of everyone in Africa being wasted through hunger, with tear stained faces and barefoot....but no, this wasn't the case. It could happen anywhere, Just think about what could happen is the Protestants and Catholics in Ireland were all fired up and one side decided to wipe out the other.....Or put it on a bigger scale, America and Canada. We all call ourselves civilised, anything could happen....I recently watched a documentary recently where a woman lost her husband, all his family and all her own family. She now runs an organisation to care for orphans of the atrocity. This is what is left of Rwanda...brave people just getting on with life, while the so called 'civilised' countries look on and occasionally sympathise with them....in fact, most people don't even know what happened - or even care for that matter.Why did the UN pull out? why is no-one talking about it now? because the people don't seem to have a strong enough voice that makes people sit up and take notice, they need more films like this to be made, they need a big time director who empathises with them, to make a big noise...Stephen Spielberg did it with Schindlers List, another film about genocide.

An Affecting Story Of Courage,"There's an ugly not-my-country-not-my-problem tattoo stamped on the U.S.'s backside. At times, they thoroughly believe in that tattoo; but in others, they gaze at it with a tinge of regret. I'm sure America has felt that potent remorse when reflecting on the Holocaust or the Cambodian genocide. But as one character in Hotel Rwanda puts it, the majority of our nation hears of the crimes, says ""that's awful,"" turns right around, and finishes their dinner. I'm guilty of it, you're guilty of it; we're all guilty of it. There is no one to blame in particular — an ordinary person can't simply drop everything and become a humanitarian — but in Hotel Rwanda, the that's awful mentality is transformed from a mere numbers game to a stinging reality.In 1994, millions of Rwandan citizens were killed in a response to the snapping of the racial tension between the two predominant ethnicities, the Hutu and the Tutsi. When Tutsi rebels assassinated the country's dictator, Juvénal Habyarimana, the slowly growing mentality that the Tutsi, who migrated to Rwanda early in its foundation, were not natural- born citizens and therefore a threat to the country finally hit its climax. In response, Hutu soldiers began exterminating Tutsi civilians without even batting an eye.But amidst any atrocity there is always a hero; in the Rwandan genocide's case, that hero was Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines. By allowing scores of would-be victims to stay in the fluctuating rooms and hallways with no charge, he saved nearly 1,300 people. The film presents him not with the rugged exuberance of a John Wayne type, but rather with a man who feels the need to do the right thing and has the means to do so.We are only given glimpses into the barbarities that took place in the varying neighborhoods and regions, but Hotel Rwanda succeeds in the fact that it's not a lecture or an in-your-face history lesson. It's by turns enlightening, grim and affecting. Because Rusesabagina is Hutu and his wife is Tutsi (therefore his kids are in grave danger as well), there is an added franticness that makes every second more precious than the last.Rusesbagina is portrayed by Don Cheadle, his wife by Sophie Okonedo, with Nick Nolte playing a conflicted French Canadian colonel who is forced to make tough decisions in an environment where there isn't any time to make tough decisions. Cheadle's performance is so poignant because he is willing to risk everything he has in order to save others, despite the fact that he may die in the process. To go from fledging hotel manager to a saint within a matter of hours isn't a smooth task, but he accents Rusesbagina's integrity with a devout spirit. What should he do, send every Tutsi out into the street to die? As Rusesbagina's wife, Okonedo is the emotional core of the film, fearing endlessly for her kids and her valiant husband. Okonedo lays every sense she has down on the table; we feel what she feels.Hotel Rwanda is a terrifically acted and tremendously vigorous account of a monstrous part of our history. Even though the majority of countries looked away, the film places us at an uncomfortable distance to the heinous event, making us rethink that entire not-my-country-not-my- problem philosophy.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An easily accessible and very valuable history lesson,"Co-written and directed by: Terry GeorgeStarring: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Cara SeymourFirst things first; Hotel Rwanda is an excellent film, possibly my favourite of the last twelve months. Terry George's film successfully places an uplifting story of survival in the midst of a real-life disaster, rarely slipping into melodrama. It is content to tell its tale in an understated and unpretentious manner.The disaster in question is the Rwandan genocide of 1994. In the space of three months, one million people were murdered in Rwanda - and frighteningly enough, not many people around the world seemed to notice. Most of these people were the Rwandan Tutsi's, murdered by the Rwandan Hutu's. The Hutu's described the Tutsi's as ""cockroaches"", ""traitors"" and ""invaders"" who ""stole our land"".While all this went on, a Hutu hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) campaigned to save as many Hutu's and Tutsi's as he possibly could. He felt especially close to the Tutsi's, his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), being one herself. And so his hotel effectively became a camp for refugees. But he knew that it couldn't stay that way forever.Certain film intellectuals slam these ""manipulative"" films for making us ""feel good about feeling bad"", and not teaching us anything new. Others will certainly give Hotel Rwanda a hammering for focusing too much on the survivors and not enough on the victims. I seem to recall some people stating similar things about Schindler's List and The Pianist, two critically-acclaimed historical dramas.In my opinion, these writers are way off the mark. Detractors must remember that the aim of both Hotel Rwanda and Schindler's List is not to be the definitive film of the Rwandan genocide or the Holocaust, respectively. They are not documentaries either. Rather, they are stories about how one man made a difference during a horrific tragedy. They never let you forget the seriousness of these situations, aiming to show you how you can find hope and optimism in those times - and they both do so brilliantly.It's questionable, however, how much of an impact such films can have  after all, as one character states at one point during the film: ""After they see this, people are gonna say 'My God, That's terrible' and then go on eating their dinners"". But if film-makers like Terry George and Steven Spielberg believe they can make a difference, then why shouldn't they try? Mainstream audiences should be reminded of events like the Rwandan genocide, and it's to George's credit that he presents the situation in such an effective manner.A hero such as Paul Rusesabagina did exist, so why deny him the compelling story that he deserves, based on the evidence before us? No two-hour film could possibly do justice to the Rwandan genocide, and George understands that. So rather than constantly bombard us with exploitative, over-the-top footage of people dying, he instead focuses on Paul's story, which is the right thing to do. George doesn't take sides either - the film might be seen by some as a battle between ""good"" Tutsi's and ""bad"" Hutu's, but not for one moment is the film as simplistic as that. That we sympathise with the Tutsi ""cockroaches"" is largely down to the treatment that they are receiving.I've known that Don Cheadle was a gifted performer for a while, but to anyone who only remembers him from Ocean's Eleven, the strength of this performance may come as a real shock. The film lies almost squarely on his shoulders, and while his role is largely an underplayed one, it does call for him to be emotive numerous times, and he is up to the task. His Oscar nomination was merited, as was Sophie Okonedo's. We find Tatiana both sympathetic and believable despite the fact that she doesn't figure as prominently. Cara Seymour's Red Cross worker also stands out (in fact, she features heavily in two of the most moving scenes in the film). With the exception of Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, the rest of the cast is largely unknown, but no less effective.Hotel Rwanda would have been a worthy Oscar winner, and is, without doubt, an easily accessible and very valuable history lesson.Rating: ***** (out of *****)",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Captivating film - great work by George, Cheadle - do not miss it!","Wonderful film. Best I've seen in many months. Terry George does a fine job bringing us a glimpse into the horrific events in Rwanda in 1994.The story is told in a way that makes one wonder about countless other stories of other lives - most of whom are gone - many stories that will never be known.Yes, shame on all the rest of us.Easy to understand - good sound, camera work, editing; the subject and events not easy to take in any position or frame of mind.But there is hope that holds you to this story.Acting was good all the way around.

Relentlessly gripping,"Such a powerful movie with performances that left me shattered. A perfect depiction of how horrible and monstrous humanity can be while also showing the best of all of us. If this movie doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you may need to question your humanity. Don Cheadle heads a cast of people who put you on the front line of events that should have never happened. A film like this should be mandatory viewing for everyone. While we can only hope that something like this never happens again, it's bound to happen anytime we view anyone as less than us.

A Great Drama,"This dramatization of a true story hits a few nerves and deflates the chest with its portrayal of survival and hope amidst murderous insanity.Paul Rusesabagina (Oscar-worthy Don Cheadle) is the manager of a posh urban hotel catering to foreign tourists, diplomats and Rwandan officials. He, a Hutu, and his Tutsi family enjoy a crisp, comfortable life for his dedication, but it won't last.Rwanda's ethnic tension roils as rebel Tutsis sit down to peace talks and militant Hutus preach reprisal, rallying against neighbors. Paul lives in denial and clings to his belief that a return to peace and order is inevitable, but his hopes are shattered when the president is assassinated and a radio call to ""cut the tall trees"" signals bloody abomination.Rusesabagina must use his wits, connections and resources to save those he can from slaughter while his U.N.-protected hotel quickly becomes a haven for more than 1,000 trapped refugee Tutsis and Hutus labeled traitors. But he will be left to struggle for their fates alone when the order is given for the U.N. to withdraw.Those unfamiliar with the history of Rwanda's genocide find here in the film smoothly integrated seeds of understanding, from the racist stupidity on which the Hutu/Tutsi ethnic separation was founded to the basics of who-what-how-where-why. The film's treatment is balanced, though it does teeter toward condemnation of the West for its inaction amid bureaucratic tangle. But given the record of history  no intervention and more than a million people slaughtered  it's a fair lean.Of course, this isn't a mere history lesson. Director Terry George does a superb job of drawing a core narrative from unspeakable tragedy and peopling the story with bold characters to powerful effect. The story of Rusesabagina's desperate heroism is a strand of faint light cutting through the fog of bloodletting and provides a well-centered perspective on all aspects of the travesty. It is an intriguing story, and all characters aligned with it are richly rendered, whether they be refugees, executioners, the politically declawed U.N. Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) or complicit General Augustin Bizimungo (Fana Mokoena). Cheadle inhabits the role of Paul Rusesabagina terrifically; scenes between Paul and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) are particularly striking, lending the film much of its emotional heft.Given the severity of the subject, Hotel Rwanda could have easily been overwhelmingly graphic. Thankfully, George chooses to imply the violence rather than spatter the screen with it. That's not to say the film isn't intense. Scenes of evil's aftermath, murder, mob rage, general savagery and countless near misses  all the more potent for their reality chill, haunt, horrify and churn. Thankfully there are brighter moments of appropriate levity and good outcomes, comforting viewers who would otherwise be swept up from the theater floor as simpering, crumpled-up knots of American guilt.Much like Schindler's List, George's Hotel Rwanda is an earnestly crafted portrayal of survival in the face of annihilation. Just be prepared for its impact.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very powerful depiction of war,"Hotel Rwanda is a powerful, heart-wrenching film that highlights the horrors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

The film masterfully portrays the complexities of human nature-both the cruelty and the kindness.

Some Facts,"Excerpt:""In the film, France and Belgium were shown as if they were fine, but in reality France helped the Hutus, that is, the state, with weapons to massacre the Tutsis. He surrounded a certain area, prevented the Tutsi militia from entering, and only watched the Hutu massacre. In short, they have continued passive genocide as they have always done.The United Nations army has recalled 90% of its force under the pretext that 10 soldiers were killed. Despite the fact that 600 thousand people died, he did not admit that there was a genocide and only made observations. He let 1 million people die on his first day when he could have finished everything.When they came to Belgium for the first time for colonialism activities, they divided the people into groups based on their appearance only and caused them to enter each other. In other words, the number one reason for these events to happen is Belgium. As usual, the divide and rule tactic worked, 1 million people lost their lives, and western states filled their pockets.The president's plane was definitely shot down by France, causing internal confusion in the country. The fact that millions of machetes have already been imported from China and France has insisted at the UN that the Hutus (State) should be supported and the rebellion should be ended in this way is proof of this.The fact that Paul Ruses.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Don't Forget to Check Into this Hotel!,"A decade after tribal extremists in Rwanda organized a blitzkrieg of ethnic killing while the world minced its words, Hotel Rwanda spilled out on the screen, aiming to remind us of evils hurriedly forgotten and lessons still unlearnt.The film picks up just before the presidential assassination. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu hotel manager, married to a Tutsi, who never underestimates the value of a bribe, greasing the wheels of commerce and police protection with the occasional bottle of single malt. When the Hutu president is killed by Tutsi rebels, Hutu extremists take to the streets with machetes, slaughtering every Tutsi 'cockroach' they see. Paul finds the four-star hotel he manages turned into an impromptu refugee camp, as Tutsi refugees and their families rush in, seeking out what little protection he can offer. He trusts, still however, in the goodwill of the West. He believes that his activities will be temporary, and that rescue is on its way. But he doesn't immediately grasp what is happening: the West, catching the odd news report, have dismissed the genocide as 'just a bunch of Africans killing each other again', before flipping channels. The UN force, led by a self-disgustedly impotent Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) does what it can to help but it soon becomes clear that Paul will have to rely on his own resilience and back catalog of favors to keep as many of the Tutsi alive as he can.Filled with indelible, haunting images, Hotel Rwanda is a moving and provocative film that shows how one man can make a difference, even when the evils and horrors around him appear unsurmountable. The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favor of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. Director Terry George handles the potentially suffocating subject matter with a grace and subtlety that breathes precious life into a heart- wrenching story about the wretched effects of hateful propaganda and an outside world concerned with capitalism over humanity. George never sugarcoats any of the violence - the violence comes frequently and unexpectedly, making for a lasting impression of horrific imageries (Watch Paul floundering among a scattered sea of corpses that he'd unwittingly been driving over in the dawn fog).Knuckling down to a native accent, Don Cheadle gives a beautifully restrained tour-de-force performance as a singular voice of reason at the epicenter of the carnage. The actor transforms from suave schmoozer of militia leaders, to protective family man, to a reluctant savior who's forever struggling to maintain his fragile composure, all the while sidestepping every histrionic outburst you'd expect. Sophie Okonedo pulls out an equally stirring portrayal of Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana while bigger names like Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte - effortlessly energize the smaller roles.All in all, this is a film of rare courage and imperishable heart that deserves to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Bravery and Genocide in Africa,"How can a film lacking espionage, demons, and meaningless frontal nudity not interest me? Hotel Rwanda shines in murky Hollywood with compelling characters, fantastic writing, and a true plot ignored in its own time. Hotel Rwanda deals with the rising of the Interhamwe forces whose prime directive is to slay a fellow African tribe, the Tutsis. This crisis is severely slowed when a fast-acting hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), provides refuge to hundreds of marked Tutsi.Paul faces many conflicts while avoiding direct conflict. He is a known Hutu, and the Hutu make up the Interhamwe. He knows he is frowned upon having a wife of Tutsi birth, but he denies his heritage for the betterment of man in general. Paul Rusesabagina must also keep the Mille Collines appearance as a 4-Star hotel. Paul battles defiant staff, constant tragedy, and thinning supplies throughout the course of this gut-wrenching tale of kindness.The historical value of this is something our planet earth should recognize. The genocide piqued UN interest in 1994. Officials were sent to Rwanda with strict instructions: No Shooting. This seemed a little ridiculous being as trained soldiers had to simply witness the purge of a people. Whether or not the collective world cared or not can be debated. But what can't be denied is that if Rwanda was going to gain nuclear armaments, or fall to Communism, you would have seen the whole situation cleared up with the entire United Nations at the helm. I personally liked this film because it serves as more of a social commentary than just another ""Based on Actual Events"" movies we hear so much about.One of the most powerful scenes, in my opinion, was as the folks recording the massacre needed to be evacuated. Upon entering a bus bound for the nearest airport, the cameraman with a Western perspective (Joaquin Phoenix) murmured ""Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed!"" This is when the severity of this tale sank in. Someone not even living there their whole life was forced to be another bystander with protests that wouldn't be heard. Though I was a ripe age of four and barely grasped the theory of an all-day school at the time of this monstrosity, I too look back in disdain on the people who wouldn't aid a struggling nation.In conclusion, this isn't a movie with intense wire-fighting or thugs being thrown through the wall. It's a look back on a tale with a thin, though important, chapter in our world's history. Don Cheadle delivers the performance of a lifetime as the harrowed Paul Rusesabagina. This is a movie that will make you think. For a very, very long time. Like the Mille Collines itself, this movie is spectacular. Two Thumbs up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good On All Levels,"Don Cheadle has been operating just below the critical radar for many years. Known to many in supporting parts, his first starring role in a major film (""Hotel Rwanda"") is incontrovertibly a tour de force. Much ado is made in the critical press of the likeness of ""Hotel"" to ""Schindler's List"". Be that as it may this is a welcome addition to filmdom, a veritable eye-opener with a distinctive air.Filmed entirely in South Africa, director Terry George captures the feel of Kigali, a city in the center of a country in the center of Africa. Little of the veld, the jungle or desert is seen here; this is a country of hills savanna about the size of Maryland supporting nearly eight million people (http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rw.html); but that Rwanda lost upwards of one million in a widespread campaign of genocide in '94 clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of the 100 days between April and July that year.As events unfold, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is manager of a fine establishment (Hotel des Milles Collines) that is poised on the edge of an unbelievable maelstrom of events  the death of the President, calls for unconscionable murder of civilians of the wrong (Tutsi) alignment and civil war. Amid the escalating chaos and insanity of the situation stands a kind calm soul thrust into such responsibility as cannot be imagined.And imagination is the key. Throughout the story we find ourselves musing over the fact that we don't know such chaos; being pulled from your car to show your papers, seeming government endorsement of mass killing, neighbors ratting on neighbors, war within the city, displaced children, roving bands of thugs, the list of horrors goes on.Things never unfold that black and white decisions can be made in such madness. And so we can only imagine we would behave or react as does Paul- his solid and basic goodness is what saves him, his family and more than a thousand he touches while Rwanda implodes. As each new decision must be made  where to put some orphans, how to handle a desultory staff, how to continue the flow of supplies into the hotel, how to handle his family, how to react to demands of local political and law enforcement, we watch him spin, not on a downward but an upward spiral, rising above all those about him.Director George says that ""...but I think what we set out to do is tell this modern day African hero story in a way that ordinary people will relate to him, and see that if they can tap into a moral courage, that they could possibly be Paul. He's not a superhero, he's not somebody outside the conceptualization of ordinary people. That was the primary objective, and also to show just the strength of his love story and the family unit, and then this thriller element of the whole story itself. And finally, the political quagmire and the intensity and enormity of the genocide itself. And I think on all those levels, we've done pretty good.""

san ramon ca,"This is a fine film, with an especially moving portrayal by Don Cheadle.

All too human in all respects. All film tech aspects were expert, and the thousands of extras never looked staged. Just excellent all around and very moving.Here comes the .....""but"". Not a critique of the film but of the base cause of this problem around the world. There is now way too many people for the earth's land to carry, and little or no birth control in Africa to control the numbers that will be born and then uselessly die through warfare and/or famine and disease, as this film's subject will happen again over and over. What will get population under control outside of warfare and genocide? Will it be so crowded that we will eventually have to ask permission of the person next to us in order to be able to turn around??? And what if he says ....""no""! Before it even gets to this horrid state, great masses will be killed in warfare all over the world just like that depicted in this film. That is what will happen when our uncontrolled world population hits critical mass within the next 100 years, and you all know it will happen, just not exactly when, and most probably sooner than later.

Don Cheadle Deserved the Oscar,"I saw Ray. Jamie Foxx was good. However, Don Cheadle was superlative in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina. A severely underrated actor, Cheadle took on this role as if it were his own life. I can go on and on about how his performance in certain movies (Rosewood, Boogie Nights, Traffic) have either been ignored or down-played. Oh yeah, the rest of the movie - this movie should be required viewing by anyone involved in US diplomatic work in Africa (particularly Darfur / the Sudan) right now.... I can't believe how much I kept seeing the story of Darfur in this movie. Intentional? I don't think so. The DVD did include Cheadle imploring viewers to take action with respect to Darfur, but I think that's because the tragedies occurring there are so similar to what happened in Rwanda and the Western (""Developed"") world's response to both is deplorable. Anyway, good acting, good direction, incredible story (truth is stranger...). I have to say the presentation of the slaughter - the fact the movie did NOT contain blood-and-guts violence they could've probably gotten away with given the nature of the story. The use of tension and the threat of violence that surrounds them always makes the movie meaningful and poignant. All in all, this movie should be required viewing for anyone with a soul.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Violence is always a matter of choice,"What stroke me the most about Hotel Rwanda was the option made by the writer and director of not using too much scenes of violence as we are used to see in a movie. The situation in itself was already so strong that we didn't need tons of blood splattered all over. They told a very violent history focusing on the human drama, the doubts, hopes, envy and so on. The most dramatic scenes were always happening from a certain distance. That made the film even stronger. It's a nice example of how it is possible to make movies about violent themes with sense and sensibility. I believe this movie should be shown in every second grade schools around the world in order to make us never forget how the West can be cruel with those countries where there is no oil or diamonds or gold...",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
2004's Best Film,"Hotel Rwanda is a film that left me speechless at it's end. This true story tells of one human being's selfless guile that saved nearly 1300 lives in war ravaged Rwanda in 1994. Paul Rusesabagina and his family faced certain, cruel death as he called in every favor owed him by friends and enemies alike, and he sheltered these children, women and men in the luxury hotel he managed. Living in a society where tribal distinctions can be deadly, Paul had to think on his feet, as he faced down a marauding Hutu military committed to the annihilation of all Tutsi's and Tutsi sympathizers. Paul was Hutu but his wife Tatiana, and therefore their children, were Tutsi. Hope, in the face of overwhelming terror and complete abandonment by governments and institutions, including the UN, is the prevailing theme I was left with. Though I still have to question our humanity as I watch the bloodshed continue in the Sudan.

A very powerful and inspiring film.,"HOTEL RWANDA is an incredible movie at all costs.The plot of the film is based on real life events in Rwanda during the spring of 1994, the film follows hotelier Paul Rusesabagina, who attempts to rescue his fellow citizens from the ravages of the Rwandan Genocide.The film, which has been called an African ""Schindler's List"", documents PauL Rusesabagina's acts to save the lives of his family and more than a thousand other refugees, by granting them shelter in the besieged Hotel des Mille Collines. The film also explores genocide, political corruption and the reprecussion of violence.The story is amazing and it scares me in a few scenes because this is a true story and some of it is painfully true in a few areas. The musical score by Andrea Guerra, Rupert Gregson-Williams and Afro Celt Sound System is spectacular and amazingly well-done.The film has received universal acclaim and I think it deserved all of that praise for this film. This film has been on various critics Top 10 lists since it's release. I think the film is okay and they said it's an African version of the Steven Spielberg directed 1993 film, ""Schindler's List"", and the critics are not actually wrong about this film.The acting is superb. Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina is incredible and I thought he should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in the film, but he didn't get it. Sophie Okonedo as his wife in the film is okay. The rest of the cast is amazing in their performances, but Nick Nolte outshines the cast in his performance as the character he plays.Overall, HOTEL RWANDA is a classic film that will be forever remembered by many critics and people around the world and I have no problem re-watching this film again. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hotel Rwanda Comments,Hotel Rwanda is a great motion picture. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in these kinds of issues. Don Cheadle leads an excellent cast who bring you deep into the story. The story of the Rwandan genocide is a deeply touching story and this movie fully represents that. Although much of the violence that occurred in the Rwandan genocide is cleaned up for rating and audience reasons the movie still alerts the audience to the issues of the genocide that were hidden at the time. The reaction of the western world is surprising but true. The scenes can be disturbing with graphic images but its all worth it to understand this piece of history. This movie was deeply touching. It can get a little intense at times so i would recommend that you are prepared for this before seeing the movie.

Powerful stuff.,"Hotel Rwanda tells the harrowing, and as far as the West is concerned, disgracefully story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel owner in war torn Rwanda who shelters over a 1,000 Tutsi refugees from certain death from the rampaging Hutu people in 1994.Don Cheadle is an acting tour-de-force as he as proved when given the opportunity (Traffic) and not given roles which waste his considerable talent (Oceans whatever).The supporting cast is also excellent, Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife, Nick Nolte as a helpless but strong U.N peacekeeper and a small, but excellent role, for Joaquin Phoenix as a U.S war reporter.powerful, shocking, dramatic and uplifting, films like Hotel Rwanda should be compulsory viewing as a testament to man's inhumanity to man and the West chooses to ignore these events when it's Governments see no 'profit'",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing movie,"At one point in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide - also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, ""Hotel Rwanda"" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since ""Schindler's List"" (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives ""Hotel Rwanda"" a sense of urgency.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An event that receives too little attention,"This film recounts the fateful tragedy surrounding the Rwandan genocide in 1994, when the rivalry between the two major ethnic groups, Hutu and Tutsi, escalated into a bloodbath resulting in around one million deaths. The hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who took in thousands of potential victims in his hotel and thus saved many lives, became a celebrated hero.Rusesabagina is embodied by Don Cheadle. Initially a successful manager with a homogeneous family life, he is constantly tested by the constant threat of Hutu soldiers against his loved ones. Being Hutu himself, he is never really affected by this threat. Cheadle's fragile performance permanently gets under your skin. His character has to deal with betrayal, impossible choices and sacrifices throughout the film. Cheadle's close acting also means you always buy into his suffering. Sophie Okonedo gives an even more emotional performance as Paul's wife Tatiana. She is constantly intent on protecting her children by any means necessary and suggests this form of fear in a very subtle way. Her chemistry with Cheadle is very authentic and makes this unconditional love for each other very clear. Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, who plays a commander, don't appear very often but shine in their few scenes with thought-provoking dialogue.Hotel Rwanda brings viewers closer to a subject that has received too little attention and care in world history. This is done in a very extreme way, because some of the images are very hard to watch during the two-hour running time. Therefore, this is not a film that you necessarily have to see several times. It is nevertheless an absolute must-see, as the harsh reality is communicated here to the point. Even tribes from the same country can cause huge damage. The greatest danger does not always come from an external enemy. Hotel Rwanda is brutal, very real and rounded off by its human performances to make a very meaningful historical drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

When asked why he spends four hundred Francs on a Cuban cigar, he answers that four hundred francs to a businessman is nothing, but a Cuban cigar for a businessman is style. And style means good business.Paul is of the Hutu tribe, which was ruled over by the Tutsi in Rwanda for a long time. The Tutsi killed many Hutu, and now that the Hutu are in power there are rumors that they are planning on striking back. Paul is not interested politics though, Hutu and Tutsi are no different to him, his wife being a Tutsi is proof of that. Paul just wants to run his hotel with a minimum of interruptions or trouble.But the trouble comes to his door one night. He comes home from work to learn that Tutsi terrorists have murdered the peace-wanting Hutu president of Rwanda. Hutus around the country are going crazy, killing all the Tutsi they can find. A crowd of Tutsi have taken refuge in Paul's house. He is uneasy. His son is missing, looking for a Tutsi friend. Paul finds the child, drenched in blood. It's not his own blood, but Paul disintegrates nonetheless. Indeed, the man has been hiding his fear.When Hutu military soldiers travel the country, murdering and murdering the Tutsi they call ""cockroaches"" Paul does the only thing he can offer to do: he hides wanted Tutsis in his hotel. Helping him is a desperate Canadian UN Colonel (Nick Nolte) who has been practically abandoned by the rest of the world in this small, conflicted country. The Colonel, named Oliver, has all of three men and a few trucks at his disposal; he has a deep need to save these lives, but his orders are restricting.So the bulk of the movie shows these two men doing all they can to save as many lives as possible. There is a close situation every day, soldiers and terrorists are continually showing up at the hotel door, and food and drink is running out. Paul and Oliver use all of their strength to think fast, bribe, make phone calls, and otherwise improvise their way out of danger. Paul is losing it, watching the bloodshed around him. He is desperate. They all are.Paul is played by Don Cheadle, that actor best known for ironic or violent side roles in crime comedies. He's given quite a few great performances, my favorite being his role as the psychotic ""Snoopy"" in Steven Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight"". That was a performance worthy of an Oscar. But here Cheadle gives his best performance yet, his character, though frightened and frustrated, is full of such warmth, heart, kindness and strength. This man is a hero, but not in the traditional action-hero, long-speech type way. He is a man pushed into a corner with a thousand lives behind him, doing his best to think his way out. This performance will hopefully get Cheadle the recognition he's always deserved.Nolte and newcomer Okonedo are also in top form; this is Nolte's best performance since ""Affliction"" and Okonedo, well, I hope to see her in the future. Her character symbolizes Paul's hope, his love, and his humanity. She is a believable wife too, and her reaction to one of Paul's decisions later in the movie is sort of heartbreaking.A few scenes that don't work, I must say, are some romantic moments between Paul and Tatia. They sort of break the mood and I'm not too sure if they'd have a candle-lit, rooftop dinner when death is at hand. Also, I think the movie needed a little more  and I hate to say it  violence. An R rating would've suited it, I think, because it would've shown us the weight of Paul's deed, what he was rescuing the Tutsi lives from.You hardly think of this while watching though. The movie is all about the strength  and evil  of humanity, the importance of lives and the hardships of survival. It's also about a husband and father's love for his family, and about one of the Western world's greatest sins, turning away from Rwanda. It's about a lot of things.8/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Spectacular!,"Hotel Rwanda is one of the greatest films ever made. You just have to experience it first- hand. It is the most authentically ""human"" films ever made. The acting is outstanding, and the film reveals our own personal flaws and corruption, as well as the honour and complexity of those who choose to resist corruption and hatred.The lead actor incredible, and the film is stocked with real African people in minor roles, and as extras. Early in the film, we are shown how the definition of Hutus and Tutsis was imposed by Belgian colonialists. This is a difficult concept to grasp and explain, but this film makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Most Westerners have very little idea of what genocide really is, and this makes it plain in the most gripping way. I could barely move once the credits began to roll.Not only does it deal with colonialism, it highlights the ongoing Western ignorance towards this horrible genocide - while not ignoring the internal African social problems of revenge and corruption. It is a heart-wrenching, and true to life examination of one of the greatest human tragedies in history.This film is not just ""acting"" - the emotion is so obviously real. That's why I say it is the most human film ever made. there is almost no artifice, it shows life with warts and all, and even managed to inject some humor into a bleak situation.This film will bring any decent human being to tears, and definitely qualifies as an all-time cinema classic, a rare achievement in today's climate of disposable films and shallow acting. Every person on Earth should see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda,"This movie is not like many movies because there is human love here, we see people sacrificing for humanity,
I have never seen such a beautiful movie, it is a very beautiful movie, both good and bad.As for the film itself, we see Paul hesitate at times, but his wife Tatiana turns out to be the exact opposite.We see him protecting his neighbors even when they were first captured. I really liked his wife's role here.We see that Paul is a very good person, but he is very kind to his employees and listens to them.We see that he is a very good manager, but sometimes even if you do these things, he shows the opposite.If you ask why, these are the words I will say here (Tony Kgoroge played him, so his name is Gregoire in the movie. Here we see that he betrays his manager, but when Paul does not speak out, he flatters him). He demands that the general and the general be angry with his own worker.He does this, getting angry at Paul's worker, but then we see Gregoire rat on Paul and almost get him killed, so it shows that sometimes you have to be careful with your workers. But as soon as we know that some workers are working for money, we need to fire them. I know we do business for money, but here we have to do business with love, not for money.I'm telling you, Dudede was a worker, but he helped Paul to the end, so I wanted to tell you that you should pay attention to the workers) and it's a good movie, worth watching, if I say my own opinion. .I wish the viewers a good time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda.,This movie was so moving but it also made me think of the problems that are going on in the world today. The actors are absolutely great. They played awesome roles and made the audience feel like they were involved. I felt ashamed that over here in America we are so lucky and we have everything given to us and over there the people of Rwanda and Ethiopia and South Africa are just trying to stay alive. The movie was absolutely compelling and Don Cheadle was awesome. I didn't feel right watching it because it was hard to understand who was good and who was bad. I did a little bit of research on the computer so that I could distinguish between the good and the bad guys. This movie is good to watch more than anything because it really opens your eyes to the problems in the world and how little attention these countries are receiving. You must see this.

Who needs to watch a documentary with such a film around?,"Not expecting much, and I got a lot. The first time I saw this movie, it was during a geography lesson, and just loved it from that moment. The way Terry George portrays the true massacre is impressive, while tense. Rwanda is very well created and the story too, throughout the film raises several philosophical questions that leave you thinking for a long time. The massacre of Hutus against Tutsis recreated this very well and very real. Don Cheadle is superb, simply embodies his character and delivers this true hero was Paul Rusesabagina; Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic, her character is the most credible and he is unrecognizable.

The Rwandan genocide was something that should never have happened and I am almost ashamed to live in a world where these things are overlooked.

Hotel Rwanda (2004) - Paul Rusesabagina's Life-Changing True Story!,"Based on the real-life events taking place in Rwanda, during the Spring of 1944, ""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, who attempts to rescue his fellow citizens from the ravages of the Rwandan Genocide. This movie shows an example of genocide, political corruption, and brutal violence. While protecting his wife and kids, Paul must do whatever it takes to save his innocent people. A powerful and emotional premise makes a really excellent movie. With an all-star cast including Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo in Oscar-nominated performances, and Joaquin Pheonix, Nick Nolte, and Jean Reno, a brilliant directing job by Terry George, and a powerful script by George and Keir Pearson, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a perfect example of one of my favorite movies. There is nothing about this movie that I did not like. At times, there were moments that were so emotional, that I felt really bad inside. Every moment in the film, I was begging for more, and I was on the edge of my seat during the more suspenseful scenes. Don Cheadle delivers the best performance of his career as Paul Rusesabagina, and he totally deserved his past Oscar nomination. This movie has everything that a movie can offer. Some suspenseful tear-jerking scenes, and some beautiful touching moments are all that's really needed to make the movie good. I was left amazed, from beginning to end, on how great this movie was. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. With a brilliant cast, a beautiful message, and some suspenseful sequences, this is truly a cinematic ""must-watch"".

"Very Good, Also Recommend HBO's 'Showers in April'","I watched this movie last night - after I had learned a bit about in in a class I had taken and after I watched HBO's take on this in a film called 'Showers in April'.While I thought this movie was very well made, very well acted and very interesting - I think 'Showers' does a better job at giving you more information about the actual events of what went on... It starts by explaining where the division between the Tutsis and the Hutus started (thanks to colonialism) and explains what the rebel forces were doing...There are many similarities between 'Rwanda' and 'Showers' (both emphasize the role the Hutu radio stations played), but I think 'Showers' gives a more comprehensive look at what was going on.That's not to say I didn't think 'Rwanda' wasn't an amazing film in its own right - I highly recommend it - but I would HIGHLY recommend HBO's version as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Oustanding Film,"When a film chills to the bone, it is easily among the best of the year, and that's exactly what this film did to me when I saw it: chilled me to the bone. It's rather disturbing that so many people have no idea what happened ten years ago in Rwanda. I know I knew limited things about it. I knew people had died horrible deaths and that's about it. Seeing this story unfold about one man who wants nothing more than for he and his family to survive is something that everyone needs to see. Don Cheadle is that man and his work here left me speechless. I say the same thing regarding Sophie Okonedo. They had such great chemistry together and when apart their acting chops were just as strong. Terry George has done a great thing by bringing this story to the public. We are so selfish and we take so much for granted. This movie will make you realize that and so much more.

Educational and emotional film with a story that needed to be told,"Films like ""Hotel Rwanda"" are important. When it comes to genocide, the human race needs constant reminders that just because we've managed to stop it once before, it doesn't mean it won't happen again and isn't happening right now. The war between the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda in the early '90s is just one example and it's portrayed in a meaningful and emotional light in Terry George's film.""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the courageous story of Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a hotel manager who saves many lives, Tutsi and Hutu alike, by hiding refugees in his hotel and bribing Hutu military leaders to protect them. It's an up-and-down story of how one minute they feel safe with the UN there to help them and the next minute they've been abandoned and left for dead. Rusesabagina, however, is always trying his hardest to do what he feels is right. He is empowered and his leadership becomes invaluable.Though Don Cheadle had been around long before this film, this is without question his breakout role. A much deserved Oscar nomination for a performance that is winning of your heart and sympathies. He might not have the command or the intimidation factor of a Denzel Washington or Will Smith, but that's what makes him so right for this film--he is an unlikely hero of sorts.The story is excellent, focusing mostly on what happens to Paul and his family, placing some context to the fighting by adding in the audio of a propagandist Hutu radio show promoting hate at various intervals during the film. In general, the film doesn't address the conflict as much as focus on the individual story, so while you develop deep feeling for the characters, the impact of the conflict itself in the historical sense is not as strong.This is also not as violent of a movie as it would seem. Although George is not timid about showing you a body count, there is minimal blood and there are no really disturbing images. Some people might need to see it to really feel the impact, but in a sense it's commendable that such a strong and affecting story could be told without a ""gross-out"" factor. It also makes this a strong educational film that everyone can learn from.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Above evil there's love,"I have just seen Hotel Rwanda and i will never forget it. Perhabs words are not enough to describe this movie but the story is absolutely incredible. Who would have thought that all those atrocities were ever possible in the late XX century? If that movie would not have been so successful maybe we would not know today about the events in Rwanda. It's sad that some people need to make great movies so that we can learn about good and evil, about what's right and what's wrong! Somehow we always forget about wars, about holocaust, about all the children killed for no reason, except the fact that they carry the blood of an undesired ethnic group. Watching the film today I felt I would so much preferred that I was dead so all those children in Rwanda would be alive today, not slaughtered like pigs. But I can not turn back the time. When the events happened I was 12, and at that time nobody informed us in the media about Rwanda. Till recently I did not know that in my country the Holocaust took one of its evil forms and I felt like I was a total ignorant. But I discovered that there are many like me, much many, and I think now it's my duty to tell everybody these events, ask them about their opinions and try to change these opinions if they agree with those of the manslaughterers from the movie.In conclusion I think that the human life is priceless, I don't know how children screams while they're being cut into pieces can be ever supported by a normal human ear, I don't know how it's possible to exterminate an entire nation and I can not forget such things. I wish would not happened again and I'll pray to God for that.The movie tell us how love can rise above evil. Keep on loving and you can defeat any obstacles, in life and in death!

good,"In 1994, while one end of the Earth was discussing whether Forrest Gump or a vulgar novel should win the Academy Award for Best Picture, the other end of the Earth was experiencing a devastating million dollar massacre!! It's only 26 years since now. So racial discrimination has been elevated to a particularly sensitive level, and it is natural to be seen as an untouchable political correctness. Even in 2020, the Yellow Peril theory is still prevalent in many places. One of the reasons for the Rwandan Massacre was that Belgium acted as a troublemaker, which was too common for Britain, which had a large number of colonies. The Indo Pakistani War was Britain's ""masterpiece"", while the United States inherited Britain's mantle and continued to create various wars and refugee flows in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Undoubtedly, it will eventually be backfired and reap the consequences! Huajin didn't have many scenes in the movie, but he left behind the most famous lines.

No film has ever invoked rage and fear the way that Hotel Rwanda did. It shed light on an event that was not really covered very well here in the states and it made everyone more aware of how problems like these arise and snowball. For anyone who needs to understand the severity of the Rwandan Genocide that occurred in 1994 or to see how it now parallels what is becoming the next Rwanda in the Western Sudan today, this is the movie to see. I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 15 not because of the visual violence, it is not entirely full of gore or blood, but the feelings that it invokes from the audience may be more than a 14 year old or anyone else who is younger could deal with.

A Very Emotional and Strong Movie... An Instant Classic!,"I haven't gotten the chance of seeing ""The Aviator"" yet, but excluding that, ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are IMO, the two very best movies of 2004! Hotel Rwanda immediately took me in the very first 20 minutes of the film.. The passion Cheadle used in playing this role is remarkable, this being an understatement.. His strong performance only added on to the already amazing story of this tragic incident.. Playing as a Modern Day Harriet Tubman, his character took on a huge responsibility, caught between the rivalry of two tribes, He let some 1,000 people (give or take) take refuge in a Rwanda Hotel that he managed, and him being married to a member of the opposing tribe didn't make his situation any better.. me myself, being a young man, I am not ashamed to say that I cried a few times during my viewing, not only because of the circumstances of the situation, or not even because of the UN's part in this, But simply because Cheadles Character was Such a passionate man, such a strong man who had to make split decisions to protect a whole people, including his family.. The fact that this man really compromised, and cared about his people to an extent to which he did not see the difference in Tribes, they were all people, all African people who'm he felt obligated to protect.. The movie had very powerful scenes and messages, and is one of the most important movies since ""Rosewood"", Where Cheadle also played an important role.. Totally recommended, Rated R for emotional impact though, so beware.. this is one of my personal favorites, it seems as if 2004 has been a very great year for film..

Heartbreaking,"I must admit to shamefully sharing most of the western worlds apathy to events in Africa and knew very little if anything about the Rwandan genocide. This film covers a small part of the atrocities that went on in Rwanda and is a real eye opener.It follows a Hutu man Paul who is the manager of a hotel who houses thousands of Tutsi's to try and save them from being killed by the Hutu militia.This is a gut wrenching, tense and shocking film that conveys the terror of the Tutsi people left to brutally die and whose fate rested with one ordinary man.Don Cheadle is magnificent as the hotel manager Paul, in fact it's one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film. There is fine support from Sophie Okonedo and Nick Nolte. Some scenes are quite distressing and it would take a hard heart not to get choked up at some of the scenes.This is a truly brilliant film and a must watch.

Relive the horrors and grim reality of a nation divided by apartheid and exploitation and how the rest of the world could only watch from afar .,"The nation of Rwanda is made up of two major tribes: the Hutus and Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Hutu, is a manager for Hôtel des Mille Collines, whose visitors are mainly visiting tourists from developed nations. As tension between the tribes rise, Paul Rusesabagina must decide what his priorities will be and if his disposition will be instrumental in keeping his family away from harm.You can only watch in disbelief, disappointment, and disgust as the native civilians of Rwanda are left to fend for themselves. What makes it even worse is the fact that there is no easy way to resolve the conflict, and international intervention is not a solution that can be easily executed despite how easy it may sound. In the midst or the turmoil, the realization and political unraveling of the situation sends a powerful message and a cry for help to those who may simply chose to watch, far from harm, specifically amongst the ones who have the power, authority, and influence to to at least provide humanitarian aid and assistance, and a sliver of hope.The film is good enough that at times it personally seemed like an actual documentation of Rwanda's situation during the time it took place. Don Cheadle and the supporting cast delivered an outstanding performance. Hotel Rwanda is one of its kind and should be considered an important cultural landmark.

History tragedies,"First, i must say that this movie is entirely correct on show the horrors that human being can do. This movie has too much political point of viewing. Its interesting on how people become such a shadow in a time that this Africans people needed more. I have to congratulate Mr. Paul Rusesabagina, who believe in a better world, for having tremendous heart. No one nows what lies inside of each person, it deepest thoughts.Anyway, the movie is really a story to be told so no more of this madness can reach any kind of person, independent of their beliefs. When i was watching this movie i remember Schindler List... so i started thinking... Schindler was German and even though he saved Jews, Mr. Rusesabagina was Hutu and he saved too people that were in need. so, my conclusion is it doesn't matter your color, it matters if you have a heart and in what are your beliefs. Movies like that need to be shown cause otherwise people wont be heard. We need to learn with their mistakes. But talking like this i just remember that we must remember that u really did the apartheid was the white man( Belgians)-when they entered in Africa they colonized some countries and divide tribes, and put some of the tribes that weren't friendly with one another as neighbors, and that is how this mess started. Apartheid happen to in South Africa, and we have a model of peace, Mr. Mandela. We need to hear our own voice, we need to hear everybody voice. Because life is worth, and priceless.

Whilst watching this film, the most important (but hurtful) emotional experience for me was the reliving of the pain I felt when I saw a documentary about Rwanda a few years ago. This movie really hurts - in a good way. But that will probably limit the business prospects. The good acting pulls you into it because you feel with the main characters. And it makes you think a lot about how this world has to change and how we could find instruments to minimize cruelties like the murders of hundreds of thousands of children, women and men that happened down there in Rwanda and in other places.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Emotional , Moving, Awe-Inspiring And Captivating","If it wasn't for Jamie Foxx's performance in the movie, Ray then Don Cheadle would've probably walked away with the best actor Oscar in the academy awards ceremony back in 2004. Having said that, for all of the hype surrounding Foxx's efforts and his portrayal of musician Ray Charles, it is Cheadle's performance as hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina that stood out that year, and it is a performance of which is by far the best he has offered on the big screen. I was at first sceptical about the casting of Cheadle- an Afro-American playing an African character because I was a tad concerned about how he'd be able to pull off an impressive and authentic accent. Though afterwards, my doubts about this were erased by the time I watched his captivating performance and he did manage to successfully pull it off.Hotel Rwanda was breathtaking: previously dubbed Africa's answer to Schindler's List and based on a real life account of the infamous Rwandan genocide of 1994, it documents the efforts of Paul- a Hutu native, as he tries to forge a pact between the Hutu's and the tutsis and end the long running feud that has been taking place for a considerable period of time. As a result, he managed to save the lives of thousands of Rwandans, despite the West's failure to intervene in the case, as well as the lack of consideration given to their plight by the Western media.The film is not so much a depiction of the actual events itself, but rather one's human interest account of the genocide from the perspective of Paul and his wife, Tatiana- of whom is wonderfully underplayed by British actress, Sophie Okenedo. She did herself justice in this film and it's good to see a British actress doing well in a movie that tries to convey a serious but damning message at the same time. I was disappointed when she didn't win an Oscar, alongside Cheadle himself as they were remarkable in their roles.As for the violence in Hotel Rwanda, it is not overdone in a way that it is deemed gory. This is a drama after all and the characters's thoughts, emotions and feelings, as well as the brilliant acting had more of a resonance and impact during this film than the piling body counts of Hutu and Tutsi victims.It takes a while for the film to kick into gear and yet once it does, you cannot help but be gripped by the suspense and drama of it all.Although Hotel Rwanda deals with the genocide theme in a somewhat delicate and humanistic manner, it also raises questions regarding humanity, culture, race, family and morals. For whilst it is not just about the fact that the West ignored all pleas and all the warning signs, it is to painfully state how ignorance kills. Ignorance can be eradicated by means of education, knowledge and understanding but it can also destroy lives through lack of knowledge and understanding as well too.The cinematography is excellent, beautifully shot and the scenery is great. The independent film is not your standard Hollywood fare, but that shouldn't put you off from seeing Hotel Rwanda.It is brilliant and an emotional roller-coaster of emotions. If you haven't seen it yet, then i'd recommend it to those who love their movies",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mesmerizing, Breathtaking","Hotel Rwanda would have been a fantastic film without Don Cheadle; but his performance gives it so much. It's hard not to be reminded of Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oscar Schindler, but Hotel Rwanda has just the kind of human believability that Schindler's List lost quite quickly. Cheadle is touching, believable and inspiring in this role, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future. It's nice to see some famous faces popping in on Hotel Rwanda  Nick Nolte, Jean Reno, Joaquin Phoenix  but these are all cameo appearances, and it's the less familiar actors, Cheadle first and foremost, that give their whole and make it the fantastic experience that it is.And yet, the actors aren't the focus of this film, or at least not all of it; Hotel Rwanda is practically a documentary, and excluding a few sentimental moments, it makes no dramatizations and no beautifications in presenting the horrors of the massacre in Rwanda. If at times the film seems to drive the message home a bit too forcefully  and it often does; Hotel Rwanda leaves very little to our interpretation, and that sometimes interferes with the drama: I had a bit of a problem with characters uttering lines that explain what we should have figured out for ourselves, like Joaquin Phoenix saying 'I'm so ashamed' to nobody in particular just after spending several minutes showing just how ashamed he is  it's all part of the director's intention. Hotel Rwanda doesn't make excuses for itself: it refuses to leave any viewer indifferent, and it refuses to let you twist its meaning. The message is so plain and strong that it cannot be ignored and overlooked. The film is just enough shockingly brutal to make sure that we get it. And we do; it's a depressing, powerful experience, which makes you as truly ashamed as Phoenix's character was of the kind of horrors human beings are capable of, and of your own inability to interfere.Hotel Rwanda never had a shot at the Oscars  it's just too frank and too straightforward for the Academy to stomach. But it might just be the best movie made this year. At any rate it's an important film, a film that needs to be watched and demands every bit of your attention. It's a true masterpiece that will probably be remembered as a classic for many years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Harrowing,"Drawing similarities to Spielberg's Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda tells the true story of a hotel manager (Don Cheadle in a riveting performance) who saves the lives of hundreds of Tutsi refugees from genocide at the hands of the Hutus. This harrowing picture of the evils and triumphs of the human heart portrays both the insanity and the self-sacrifice that mankind is capable of mustering. Directed by Terry George, the film brings to light an event that most people either ignored or forgot about. With nearly one million murdered, the brutal conflicts between tribes in Africa are a warning against the idea of anarchy as a viable alternative to current government.The performances: Cheadle's strength is at the heart of his character in Hotel Rwanda, a film that leaves little room for interpretation. His Paul is a man whose courage and fortitude amidst unspeakable violence communicates a dignity and humanity that presents an effective counterpoint to man's propensity to do evil. This is a moving, even terrifying, performance from a consummate character actor that finally has the chance to shine on his own. His versatility as an actor has allowed him to give one of the most harrowing efforts of the year. Sophie Okonedo was little known outside Hollywood insiders, but she makes a huge splash here as Don Cheadle's emotionally distraught wife during the Rwandan genocide. Amazingly, she steals most scenes she's in, so visceral and convincing is her work opposite Cheadle. Her cries of desperation are so harrowing that it startles the audience several times throughout the disturbing film. During the final sequences, when she is reunited with loved ones, the power of her earlier work is compounded, registering with viewers in a powerful way. This is a remarkable performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Robbed of an Oscar,"This movie was quite simply the most amazing movie of the year. How it lost the Best Film Oscar to ... Million Dollar Baby?... is beyond me, and how Jamie Foxx won for Best Actor is also a mystery. Sure, Foxx is a great actor, but come on. Not one person who has seen both Ray and Hotel Rwanda has said that Foxx was better than Cheadle. He was robbed of the best actor Oscar in a big way. I almost threw up when I saw that the Academy had given the Oscar to Foxx over Cheadle, but then again, it is the same Academy that gave Titanic a sweep in the 1997 Oscars, so I can't give them much credit for recognizing good movies.Don Cheadle does an incredible job in Hotel Rwanda: his acting is so emotionally charged that I almost cried during my first viewing, and trust me, I usually have tear ducts of steel.

You're black. You're not even a n*gger. You're an African.,"One of the great accomplishments of Terry George (In the Name of the Father, Some Mother's Son) in writing and directing this film was to show the atrocities being done during the 100 days of genocide without getting an R rating so that as many people as possible could see what happens when you don't have oil in your backyard.Despite international news coverage of the violence as it unfolded, most countries, including France, Belgium, and the United States, declined to prevent or stop the massacres. Is that a surprise? There is nothing to gain for us. We generally only take action when there is something we want, like oil in Iraq.Don Cheatle (Crash, A Lesson Before Dying) was magnificent, as was Sophie Okonedo (Aeon Flux), who played his wife.

A truly important piece of film history,"I just saw this movie, not knowing what to expect. I was absolutely blown away. This movie was well-acted, well-directed, and well-written- but even more importantly, it is a direct portrayal of true events. In reviews for this movie I have run across a few negative comments by the critics, and the main one has been that ""the movie is too much of a 'hero' piece,"" and to those critics I respond: yes! It is a hero piece! Paul Rusesabagina was a hero. But it wasn't just that. Nolte's character is a hero. And, even though these characters are seen as heroes in the film, they have their weaknesses. Cheadle's characterization of Rusesabagina is incredible; extremely strong, yet extremely human and emotional. This film is an amazing biography of a real man who lived through a real tragedy.I admit I know very little of the facts on the genocide in Rwanda- and this is why I am thankful for a film like ""Hotel Rwanda"" to open my eyes to it. If there were one thing I would change about this movie, it would be to add MORE violence. It almost seems to me that the director skipped over the violence a bit to keep a pg-13 rating. It leaves the film a little lighter than it probably should have been, considering the immense gravity of the situation portrayed. Did you know that over 1 million people died in the fighting in Rwanda in 1994? To get a fuller idea of that 1 million people, this film should have been even grittier and more painful.But, that aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is among the most realistic, painful, and amazing films I have seen. It wrenches the viewer's heart, to think of the injustices going on in our world. I would list ""Rwanda"" among 'life-changing' films, such as ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Passion of the Christ.""

It takes nerves of steel to stay back and protect others, even after you get a chance to save your life along with your family, especially when you are a common man. The moral behind the story is simply outstanding. The sacrifice that a man makes(who is a husband, father and a responsible manager), even risking his own life, to save others is simply moving, emotionally touching and definitely teaches us all something good.A wife's anger on her husband, because he wanted his wife and children to be safe and endangering his own life in the process, shows the amount of love that she has for him. If every woman loves her husband as much as the wife of Hotel manager loves her husband, then such kind of woman is surely worth to die for!!! This shows the strength of love and bond between a couple and definitely is a good lesson for all couples out there.Conclusively, this is a must watch for everyone!Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Important,"Hotel Rwanda is an important film. It tells the true story (some fictionalization here, but not much) of Hutu hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who, during the genocidal events of 1994, shelters both Tutsi and Hutu refugees, including his family, in his hotel and defends them by bribing the reluctant military and pleading with an ineffective, hamstrung U.N. force.While the film does not strive for shock value, nor does it over-dramatize the events of 1994, the stark reality of the story is, indeed, shocking. And the abject desperation of Paul and the over 1,200 refugees he helps is movingly and powerfully presented. The film's tone is appropriately serious, and the cinematography and directing are very straightforward - giving it an almost documentary feeling. Yet the pacing, acting, editing and script bring out the drama enough to prevent the film from slipping into the doldrums of re-enactment.All of the acting is very good. I am not going to single out Don Cheadle. His ability and what he brings to this role is unquestionable - but what amazed me was the rest of the cast playing their roles right at his level.The film did what it was meant to do - it reached a good number of people who knew nothing about the 1994 uprisings in Rwanda. It also provided a more realistic examination of what people do in a crisis than many similarly themed films I have seen. The denial and paralytic fear portrayed in this film are tangible and true.RECOMMENDATION: I have rated the film on the basis of its entertainment value. My rating is not meant to be critical of the film, but rather to suggest that people who are not interested in a serious treatment of the subject matter are not likely to be well-entertained by this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

(Shame that he did not get a worthwhile follow-up to this film after he proved his ability to handle challenging roles and shine with greatness.)And this is above all a story of heroism, of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager whose bravery in the face of incredible risks should be legendary - and this movie certainly makes a great case for it.This movie also makes you realize how very little we are being told in the press about the goings-on in Africa - and makes you hunger for more information.

Hotel Rwanda nice movie,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a powerful and poignant film that tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Directed by Terry George, this movie is a masterclass in storytelling, with a narrative that's both heartbreaking and inspiring. The film's protagonist, played by Don Cheadle, is a complex and multifaceted character, whose courage and compassion in the face of unimaginable horror are a testament to the human spirit.

The cinematography is stunning, capturing the beauty and tranquility of Rwanda's landscapes, as well as the brutal reality of the genocide. The supporting cast, including Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, and Nick Nolte, deliver performances that are equally impressive, bringing depth and nuance to the story. The movie's themes of courage, resilience, and the human condition are timeless and universal, making ""Hotel Rwanda"" a film that's both historically significant and emotionally resonant.One of the most striking aspects of ""Hotel Rwanda"" is its ability to balance the brutal reality of the genocide with moments of hope and humanity. The film's portrayal of the refugees' stories, their struggles, and their triumphs is deeply moving, and serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy, compassion, and understanding. The movie's critique of the international community's response to the genocide is also scathing, highlighting the failures of diplomacy and the devastating consequences of inaction.The film's technical achievements are equally impressive, with a sound design that's both immersive and unsettling. The score, composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams and Andrea Guerra, is equally effective, adding depth and emotion to the film's most poignant moments. The editing is also noteworthy, with a pacing that's both measured and intense, drawing the viewer into the world of the film and refusing to let go.Overall, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, a film that's both a tribute to the human spirit and a warning about the dangers of hatred, intolerance, and indifference. With its powerful performances, stunning cinematography, and nuanced storytelling, this movie is a must-see for anyone interested in history, drama, or the human condition.

The Timing of the Actual Genocide could not be anymore poignant!,"In 1994, Steven Spielberg and the film, Schindler's List, won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman, Oskar Schindler, caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives. Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda, Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow. Just like Paul, Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps. While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa, we know very little about Rwanda. In 1994, the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups, the Hutus, and the Tutsis as enemies again. The order was removed. The Hutus were incited by hatred, lies, propaganda, and direction from their leader to kill those ""cockroaches"" known as the Tutsis. By the end of the genocide, almost a million Tutsis were murdered. Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company, Sabena, who is put in charge. His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu. The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets. For those sheltered at the Hotel, Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food, water, or supplies. Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis. The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes. Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated. I wished it was nominated for best film of the year. Unfortunately, the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide. Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea. This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Now explaining that, this film is about Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed over a thousand Tutsis refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda.This is an absolutely great and inspirational film. This film is gripping and heart-gripping. There are very tense scenes and this is a very sad film, although I didn't cry.The acting by Don Cheadle is very good and so is Sophie Okonedo's acting.

Go see this movie. Haunting, sad but uplifting. This reaffirms my faith in the African continent. Most times we hear of the many who wreak such havoc and terror on their people but we need to be reminded that there are many Africans who strive to maintain the age old tradition of loving thy neighbor and extending kindness to others.As a west African (Sierra Leone), I thank the director for choosing to bring this story to the big screen.

One man can do miracles sometimes...,"It doesn't matter from where you look at it; ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a story about Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle); a hard working, committed, kind and devoted to his family man with a very big heart. It is also the true story of a massacre that took place in Rwanda because of a civil war with civilians incapable of defending themselves, which led to this number of dead people: one million.A war with no real fundament, you could say; because it was something about the Hutus and the Tutsis and a lot of anger publicly spread by a radio station. Also a war where not many people could intervene, because Rwanda wasn't worth a dollar for the rest of the world at the time. During all of this mess, this man, manager of an important hotel, took in one thousand people from all over the world and he even accepted both Hutus and Tutsis. Being a Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi (Sophie Okonedo).Inside his hotel, a UN division in charge of Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) could only afford four guards at the hotel's gates while outside the ""interahamwes"" were all over the streets looking for Tutsis to kill. A cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix) could get a shot of the army assassinating Tutsis with machetesCan you imagine all this?There's not much more to the movie than the recreation of this events, but what recreation and what an accurate vision from everyone involved in it. Terry George, writer of the wonderful ""Hart's War"", deals with war again in his script; but together with Keir Person, they succeed in showing us how hard reality is, in words. They introduce us a world dominated by bribery, distrust and the ever-present racism.George also directed the picture this time, luckily with the compassion needed to shoot a theme like this one. The camera (a beautiful cinematography by Robert Fraisse) goes to the streets, to the houses and the shelters but it doesn't need the direct blood and violence I'll probably witness in ""Apocalypto"" when I watch it.Performances are also quite effective. Nick Nolte (watch him in ""The Good Thief"") is superb as the Colonel who knows his limitations and can't break the rules. He has a couple of great moments discussing with Cheadle's character. Jean Reno has a nice little part and Sophie Okonedo also achieves some moments of true moving brilliance when talking to Cheadle.Cheadle is, however, in the end, the star of the show. In the best portrayal of his career, the actor assumes the responsibility of being on screen all the time. He does it embodying this man I talked you about completely, with all the characteristics I mentioned above and an accent so flawless that you think of him as another Rwandese actorIt's fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerfully emotional and inspiring,"I look back on this movie and I find myself realizing that it was one of the most moving movie's I have ever seen. Not that I've seen an incredible variety or astonishing number of movies. But I do know that I am a relatively average 17-year-old who loves movies and I was inspired by this movie in a way only a few other films have.Don Cheadle, a Best Actor Oscar contender for 2004, gives his all to his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager that sheltered hundred of refugees during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Hotel Rwanda is more about Paul's story than the massacres in general, and that's not a bad thing. Seeing this catastrophe through the eyes of a man in Paul's position means that we are party to key figures: a U.N. Colonel (Nick Nolte) who wants to help but is constrained by the limits of his orders, a spoiled general (Fana Mokoena) who provides military protection for Rusesabagina's refugees in response to flattery and bribery, and an American journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) who delivers one of the key revelations of the movie: ""I think if people see this footage, they'll say 'Oh, my God, that's horrible.' And then they'll go on eating their dinners."" Africa is too far away for it to be of any concern to people like us.But all these characters take back seat to Paul in the narrative; they occasionally provide obstacles, such as when the general refuses to give any more police support until Paul bluffs desperately, but the movie belongs to Paul and, inherently, to his family. Don Cheadle plays Paul as a man whose family is more important to him than anything else; his first and foremost concern is for his wife and children and there are moments where he must choose between them and the other Rwandans in his care. His wife, Tatiana, is emotionally played by Sophie Okonedo as a compassionate woman who, even as strong as she turns out to be, feels she needs her husband in order to survive. The love between Paul and Tatiana is one of the anchors in this movie, and thanks to the screenwriters and Okonedo, Tatiana is just as well-developed a character as Paul.While Hotel Rwanda may focus in on this one man and his heroism, the movie manages to skillfully indict the outside (white) world for not taking the initiative to interfere in this conflict. The question of whether or not we could have done anything is moot in this movie; when faces as human as these are painted onto the problem, it seems like we at least should have done something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Powerful stuff,"Terry George's Hotel Rwanda is a deeply compelling film about the Rwandan civil war that resulted in an enormous genocide (over a million dead). It is the true-life story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Hutu hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand Tutsi refugees from the other warring Hutus. People have complained Hotel Rwanda isn't brutal enough and too selective in its view of a much larger genocide. Although I concede that it may have benefited from its original R rating, the latter seemed intended. Hotel Rwanda does show the genocide as a whole but its also a personal story.Paul has a few helpful people to look to: a Red Cross worker (Cara Seymour), a sympathetic hotel owner (Jean Reno), and two cameramen recording footage (it also leads to the film's most brutally honest realization that people will look at this footage, say ""Oh my god, that's terrible"", and keep on eating their dinners). However, these aren't alone enough to stop the machetes of the Hutu. And since he is married to a Tutsi, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), his family is in constant danger as well.Hotel Rwanda works just as well as an account of man who in desperate times becomes less concerned about himself and more about helping others. The most obvious comparison would be to Oscar Schindler. Paul bribes Hutu officials with beer and money, hides Tutsi orphans, and is frustrated by the United Nation's inability to physically fight back the Hutu forces. The poignancy of the character is helped by a quiet and dignified performance by Don Cheadle, one of the best I have seen all year. Sophie Okonedo is also great if not a little more underplayed.It may hard to swallow at times, but this is the point. Hotel Rwanda is a reminder of just how much pain human beings can inflict on one other and how much good one can bring to another.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great performance from the leading actor in this moving historical drama!,"The 1994 Rwandan Genocide happened during my lifetime, but I was just under eight years old, and was totally unaware of the atrocities that were taking place. In fact, I knew absolutely nothing about it until ten years later, when I was taught about the genocide in high school. That was shortly before the release of this film, ""Hotel Rwanda"". So, I knew about the mass murder by the time this 2004 historical drama came to theatres, and knew that this was a film about it. I was probably well aware of this movie's existence from around the time of its theatrical release, and I remember being interested in seeing it years ago, but that never happened. I never saw the film before renting it last week, but now that I have seen it, I think I can understand why it was so well received.Based on a true story, conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples in the African country of Rwanda is on the rise in 1994! The Tutsi people are often referred to as ""cockroaches"" by Hutu extremists and anti-Tutsi propaganda is constantly heard on the radio. Paul Rusesabagina runs a hotel called Sabena Hôtel des Mille Collines in this country. He is Hutu, but his wife, Tatiana, is Tutsi. As the danger in this African country increases, Paul and his family witness the appalling assault of a neighbour! Paul has to use his bribing skills to protect his family from the anti-Tutsi powers that be, and it isn't long before the hotel manager begins to provide shelter for Tutsi refugees at his hotel. After he takes his family and neighbours there, many more refugees come from different places for shelter and protection at this hotel! Paul must do everything he can to prevent the murders of as many Tutsis as possible, which gets increasingly difficult.At the beginning of the film, we hear an anti-Tutsi propaganda radio broadcast. With this, the film is already compelling, and it continues this way. This drama as a whole is a very powerful one, with a lot to hold the attention of the viewer with. There's a lot of tension in the film, and it's hard not to admire the protagonist for his courage. Since this is a movie about genocide, it's not surprising that there are heart-wrenching scenes here, such as Paul and Tatiana's son, Roger found injured outside the house (it doesn't take long for this scene to come), and a Red Cross worker named Pat Archer talking about the killing of a Tutsi orphan! There are scenes which viewers could easily not expect and find pretty shocking! In addition to all this, an excellent script was written for ""Hotel Rwanda"", and the dialogue and acting in the film are generally impressive. For a film like this, it goes at a decent pace, not too fast and not too slow. The lead role is played by Don Cheadle, and I wasn't familiar with this actor at all before seeing him in this drama, but many people think his performance here is excellent, and I agree. It's one of the many memorable aspects of this powerful movie!Since this successful 2004 drama is based on a true story, one might wonder how accurate it is. As with any other historical film, I can't be the one to tell you exactly how historically accurate or inaccurate it is. I know that UN Peacekeeping forces leader Colonel Oliver is a fictional character, though he is loosely based on Romeo Dallaire, a former Canadian Lieutenant General who is well known for his contributions to stopping the Rwanda genocide. I'm also sure that it was more complicated than ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows, and obviously not all the events of the genocide are shown in this film. On the other hand, it seems some people have praised the film for its historical accuracies. Well, even though it obviously can't teach you EVERYTHING about the genocide and the conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples that led to it, it's still a very well made film, and it can really make viewers think about the cruelty and danger in the world! It's obviously not the most pleasant movie to watch, but if you're looking for a gripping emotional drama based on a true story, I recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A film which justifies the existence of the industry, even if nothing else did.","The breathtaking intensity of this film sweeps one through it's true life story at such a pace and with such punch that one is stunned by all that unfolds.Watching this film should make you think deeply about your own ability to retain your head (literally & figuratively)& what principles you may now believe are important while they're not endangering your life, while the world around becomes a savage & bestial hell. Watch this with friends, you'll have a lot to discuss and visit wikipedia afterwards & donate to Paul Rusesabagina's charity's website which helps the victims of what you'll see. If you can't be bothered to do this much after watching this film, ask yourself, what kind of person you are at heart or if you'd have an atom of the strength of this incredible man; an unsung hero of our times that dwarfs heroes of our past & present. Though a hard hitting film it does not make you suffer or feel distraught, it totally engages & inspires. If anyone doesn't get something from this film, then they are truly lacking in every way that counts. You will never forget it, it will inspire you in times of crisis, as does it's hero Mr Paul Rusesabagina who should get the Nobel peace prize.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Riveting, powerful, memorable","What greater compliment can I pay to this film than to say its characters -- ESPECIALLY Don Cheadle's Paul -- linger in your mind for days after?No newspaper article, no politician's speech, nothing short of personally being present or speaking to survivors could make as vivid for us as does this film the magnitude of the tragedy, the humanity of the victims, and the shame of the developed world's indifference.I am sorry to see Hotel Rwanda was not nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, but Don Cheadle's performance should win him the award for Best Actor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gut wrenching yet not sentimental,"The danger with movies like Hotel Rwanda is that the history swamps the story or the story doesn't do justice to the history. The story achieves a perfect balance between the 2 by not forcing a view of events on us rather showing enough of it's impact on the characters to allow us to form our own opinion.The characters are thoughtfully built up without being one dimensional and the acting is out of the top draw. Each of the characters evolves as the movie develops. We see the superficial being peeled away to reveal the betrayed Paul, the impotent yet heroic UN captain and tens of other characters that will stay with you.Don't go expecting to enjoy the movie rather go expecting to be moved deeply by it. Much to the shame of the Western world it is a modern day Schindler's list and a reason for the UN to exist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hotel Rwanda,"On April 7, 1994 conflict broke out in Kigali, Africa. It was an estimated 937,000 dead Tutsis and Hutus that were assassinated by Hutu extremists.The Movie Hotel Rwanda shows a generous hotel owner named Paul Rusesabagina helped refugees, he gave them a place to stay and food. Through my point of view I think this movie will be one to cry through. This movie shows us how thankful and grateful we are in the United States. For years in Rwanda under the Belgains, the Tutsis ruled and killed not but a few Hutus. Now the Hutus are in control, and armed troops creep around the nation, killing Tutsis.By: Nour Salem",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Watch this movie,"This movie isn't easy to watch, but it's a must see. I think everybody needs to see this movie. I literally was sobbing through much of it, mostly because I had no idea any of this had happened. And I went to school, I've taken history classes. I think everybody needs to see this movie simply to realize goes on in the world that we are sheltered from, and to know that it is wrong for us to stand on the sidelines. Watch this movie, tell your friends to watch this movie, talk about it with your family, anything. People need to know. In America we are so sheltered by our media and what the government decides to tell us. But we as a people need to stand up and fight for human rights. If nothing else I hope this movie opens your eyes, it surely did mine. If you aren't affected in some way by this movie, well... you should be. Don't be afraid to watch though. It isn't gory or anything. It is disturbing on the level that such atrocities were committed while so-called ""1st world"" countries stood by and did nothing. Please, watch this movie and open your eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Where was I?,"After watching this movie, I kept asking myself ""where was I during those times?"" I realized that I was so busy making a name for myself, earning money, gaining prestige...and on the other side of the world people were dying, scared and not able to sleep peacefully, not knowing whether they'll see the light of the next day's morning sun...and I have not even said a brief prayer for them.The movie is a great eye-opener: on the differences between beliefs, principles, race; on what the United Nations stand for; on what an individual can do.I love the actors - they made every moment real. The feelings were there and all who watch this movie would feel it. Superb! To every one in the cast, the actors, directors, scriptwriters, the crew - all of you rate 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
amazing. inspirational. touching.,"this bitter-sweet true story triggered many emotional strings in myself, and everyone too i think. this story made me cry buckets and for the first time, i announced it to the world. not only are the actors superb (they should get the Oscars!!), the story itself is so powerful that the success it got is no match to the movie itself. the most memorable part of the show is when jack said 'they'll say how horrible and go to at their dinner'. this made me realize how little are we doing to really help the people in the world. NO ONE IS DIRT. NO ONE IS DUNG. this show inspired me beyond words and i highly doubt any movies i will be seeing to make me feel the way i feel now. being to watch such an incredible like this, made all the wait in my life in search for that perfect movie, is at last found.
