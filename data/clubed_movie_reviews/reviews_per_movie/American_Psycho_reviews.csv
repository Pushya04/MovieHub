American Psycho is not a story about murder,"The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality.
People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despairIt's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman's interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he's not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can't distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn't care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.Everyone we see in Bateman's company appears to be the same person. It's no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he's unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he's seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cruelty and Christian Bale,"A very funny horror flick. A worthy companion piece to its literary roots. A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in ""Little Women"". Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don't feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable. His rough sex with two women while he rides one of them looking at himself in the mirror is one of the most disturbing film moments I've ever seen. I wonder if Bale will ever be able to play goodness, convincingly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You can always look thinner,"'American Psycho' is NOT a slasher movie. It is a depiction, a fantasy if you will, of the life of modern man and his place in society.Nothing is enough. Money, sex, social stature, there is always someone else who has more and everyone else expect from you to try harder for even more.This movie is about eliminating competition the easy way. By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.'American Psycho' retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.The scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis & the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.You can analyze 'American Psycho' for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie. Even if you don't like the story, you will love Christian Bale's excellent performance.Enjoy.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Two Chainsaws Up,"Without a doubt the most underrated movie of the past decade, ""American Psycho"" is a piece of American cinema that shouldn't be missed by anyone, regardless if they do not like the violence (which does have its reasons).Christian Bale gives a flawless performance as the troubled, deep down wannabe Yuppie who has psychotic, violent impulses. This is true acting here, folks. Not phoned in Tom Crooze acting. Some people object to Patrick Bateman narrating the movie [always a weak sign in a movie] and not letting us figure his motives out on our own, but if you watch closely, Bale shows us Bateman's vulnerablity through every minute of every day of his life. The movie is at times hysterical, as his character uses dominant Alpha Monkey behavior around the opposite sex. But again, it's all for good reason.If not for Bale's performance, see it for the knife twisting satire of the '80's -- from the clothes, to the hairdos, to the music [I'll never be able to hear Phil Collins in the same way again!] The production value is rich in '80's nostalgia from the ""Black and White"" set designs to the enormous cellphones [how could we forget those?].This is a movie that major studios are too afraid to touch. This is film making. Remember film making? When films took you on a ride in someone's life and you would walk away with a piece of their mind? American Psycho doesn't have any real morals or answers, but it shows the deep psychological insecurities some men suffer everyday. Oh yeah, and it was directed by a woman, so all you feminists shut up!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A film that teeters between Miracles and Mania,"Having just finished American Psycho, I came to IMDB to get some clarification on the ending. And it seems I'm not the only one left vaguely adrift by the ambiguous ending.I've browsed some of your comments, not all 400+ to be sure. But some of them. A good sampling I think, and this movie has three distinct cheering sections.Those who consider it a masterpiece, those who consider it unredeemable, boring trash, and by far the largest segment, those who see it as a flawed masterpiece.I fall into the latter category. And no, I did not read the book. But as others have stated any movie that requires you to read the book, to ""get"" the movie, is ultimately a failure as a movie.So my review is based solely on the merits of the film. And contrary to what some have said, the film does have many merits. I found it brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking.Even before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It's only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman's(Chris Bale's) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he's wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn't familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I've grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.Mary's restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn't he? And in the end, now that I write this I'm thinking maybe the answer doesn't really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping.I think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Still crazy (and overrated) after all these years...,"Up until a week ago, when someone asked my opinion on ""American Psycho"", I would tell them it was a boring and preposterous film. But that was mainly because I only saw it once, when it got released in 2000, and I was too young (or too dumb, or too eager to exclusively see violent carnage) to capture the true essence of Easton Ellis' novel/screenplay. Urgent time for a re-watch, I'd say! Twenty years later, ""American Psycho"" is still a bonkers film with over-the-top satire, excessive violence and an outrageous performance from Christian Bale. And yet, I still don't like it that much. Some sequences are brilliantly absurd, like when the egocentric yuppies practically orgasm over their own personalized business cards, but the majority of the film is just plain absurd; - period. Also, and be honest, who seriously cares about the frustrations of yuppie scum from the 80s? The film is at least ten years overdue. I read somewhere that Brett Easton Ellis envisioned a film version of his novel in the early nineties already, set immediately after the decade of the so-called ""young upwardly-mobile professionals"" of Wall Street. That would have made more sense, probably. Bale demonstrates that he's a fantastic actor, for sure. The film also features a long list of uber-talented supportive cast members (Dafoe, Witherspoon, Sevigny, Leto, Theroux, ...) but they are all quite redundant, since the plot exclusively revolves around Patrick Bateman. Brilliant soundtrack, too, but - again - overdue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Saved by the performances,"Since the movie started I struggled to engage, I wasn't able to care enough, the story felt mild. What kept me watching was Bale's good acting. Still, throughout the film the motivation of the main character seems to be to keep killing without getting caught. I couldn't figure out other goal, so I didn't feel any interest for the ending. We have the detective who seems to be talking the story somewhere but didn't make any difference. The film is full of clever moments and some humor, but these don't advance the plot. It was mostly entertaining, hence the 7. At the end, we get this speech that I struggle to make sense of. What is the evolution or change in the characters or the story?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Incredible performance by Christian Bale. Film itself is complete garbage.,"The only thing in American Psycho that makes sense is Bale's performance.Everything else is contrived, shallow, pointless, schlock horror masquerading as edgy, primal, subverted, dystopian black comedy.Thoroughly predictable. Utterly contrived; neither shocking nor particularly comic.Bale is incredible though, that much is obvious, and his character carries the entire production. In fact, all the major actors are fairly spectacular, there's not a bad performance in the film.Such a shame then that the writers are more obsessed with making a Wall Street Clockwork Orange than they are producing something remotely original.Massively overrated. 3.5/10 based on performances alone.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Christian Bale the new Peter Cushing,"Now it all makes sense. Christian Bale was born to play horror characters. I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like ""Velvet Goldmine"" He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In ""American Psycho"" - a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination but, fortunately, he didn't.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A must see,"Having read the novel by Easton-Ellis a year ago I was intrigued to find out how it could be made into a movie.Whilst turned off by the totally uneccesary details of Batemans crimes in the book, I felt that Easton's insight into superficial 80's yuppie culture made it a classic.Who could play a credible Bateman? Leonardo Di Caprio? I think not.How would Mary Harron deal with those controversial torture scenes?What we got was one of the finest movies I have seen for some time. Of course, those of closed minds will slate this film without even bothering to see it, simply because of the book's notoriety.I was impressed to see how closely Harron followed the book, replacing the un-filmable seens with suggestion, aka ear-cutting scene from resevior dogs, so that you believe you have seen more than you have. There are more parallels with Tarantino, such as the use of classic (& non classic ) 80's pop to create a stylised feel to the movie, that has not been seen since Pulp Fiction.Casting was superb, with Cristian Bale giving the performance of a lifetime, We, the audience, saw the souless monster within, Batemans superficial aquaintences, saw another faceless human being.Just like the book, you are never sure wether Batemans crimes are real, or just imaginary, but his slide into insanity is clearly real and paced expertly by Bale.Rheese Witherspoon as Evelyn was disappointing, ""Election"" showed what a great actress she is and although this role called for an airhead performance, it was clear that she was cruising.Mary Harron deserves the credit for creating an excellent film, that could have so easily been just another slasher movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Clever adaptation of Ellis's novel,"""American Psycho"" is a very clever adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's cult novel. There are very gruesome murders in the film, but you never get to see them which I am grateful for. The Patrick Bateman of this film (brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale) is not the Bateman I imagined while reading the book, I don't know why, but the Bateman I saw before me was more cool and distanced. However, I like this Bateman better (as a character in a film/book, not as a personality) and Bale really brings something special to the part. Truly a great performance. Other than that, prepare to laugh a lot while watching the film. It's a satire and it's *very* funny. For example, Bateman's monologues about music before he kills and some very funny scenes involving business cards et cetera et cetera. However, it isn't a masterpiece and while it's a good film I still feel there's something missing. I don't know what, though, but I'll have to give ""American Psycho"" a 6 out of 10 = good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
American Psycho,"There were two novels written about the 1980s corporate greed culture. Bret Easton Ellis's gory American Psycho. Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities.Both novels were difficult to adapt. Feminist director Mary Harron aims to make the story a barbed satire of American corporate Yuppies. Part black comedy and horror.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is the shallow successful commodities broker and vice president. His life revolves around personal grooming, working out, eating at exclusive restaurants, British pop music and kinky sex with hookers.Bateman also fantasises about killing people. Homeless peoples, prostitutes and even rivals. There is an amusing scene where his colleagues compare business cards. Bateman is visibly shaken when one of them has a better business card.Harron wants to highlight the selfish empty vanity of these people. Bateman is empty inside. The only thing that makes him feel alive is going on a killing spree.The film has an emphasised surreal edge. Maybe it is all in Bateman's mind.It has an intense performance by Bale. He also gets the black humour that Harron is aiming for. The movie however just peters out in the end and it loses its tension.American Psycho is also a film that seems to be admired by the same type of audience that liked Fight Club. Not realising that is satirising the boorish machismo men featured in it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A daring film which pushed a lot of boundaries,"This is primarily a comedy-horror which critiques big-city capitalism, '80s culture, hyper-masculinity, and more generally the sincerity of daily social interactions. Agree with the themes or not, it does exceptionally well at what it sets out to do. Wolf of Wall Street seems to have heavily drawn influence from this film, while this film seems to have drawn from Vampire's Kiss-- complete with the psychotic businessman yelling at his secretary. 4chan culture was heavily influenced by this film, often posting memes of Bale's silly poses and quoting the morally ambiguous one-liners frequently. The amount of politics this film touched on is significant alongside Bale's compulsive and direct character portrayal.There's a certain maliciousness in the way traditional stereo systems are portrayed in the film, especially at a time when the MP3 format was taking hold. People used to socialize around the family stereo system, so to associate it with mental instability and violence is extremely jarring. In fact, physical media in general is portrayed in a rather negative night, often riding on the inconveniences of rental videos as a running gag. Admittedly humorous, it came at a time when the internet was shifting to DSL and YouTube would debut not long afterward.This film features a lot of famous, recognizable actors and no doubt played a part in why actors such as Bale and Dafoe went on to do various superhero films. Bale claims that he was channeling Tom Cruise's ""fake interview smile"" throughout the film and there are moments where I sense he's imitating '80s sitcom stars such as Bill Cosby. This is an '80s business film which may or may not literally take place in Hell. Prepare yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I believe people like this movie because they think they are supposed to like this movie,"I was looking forward to see this one after reading a lot of positive comments about this one in IMDb....Now that i have seen it, i am posting a comment because I want to do my bit in helping any other prospective viewer from seeing this.First of all...i will admit this is NOT a bad movie...but it is not a movie you want to look forward to either....I have said this is NOT a bad movie, because I could sit through the movie without getting too bored. I kept on waiting for the ""good parts"" until the end of the movie.Let me also tell you that for any movie reading a book should not be a pre-requisite....if there is , then that is a flaw with the movie.The movie deals with a psychotic character Patrick Baleman who hides his psychotic part from his co-workers and friends(?)....In reality Bateman has no friends, everyone is superficial...As the movie progresses Bateman's veil of sanity slowly falls off....When you watch the movie, you are unable to interpret what is real and what is imaginary....The film depicts how these could co-exist.....It depicts the movie from the view-point of a psychotic So why did i find it boring???? 1)Because there were no clear explanation of why Bateman became a psychotic....it is not necessary that a movie explains this...but I find it interesting only if that is explained...Then the movie can be enjoyed ....You find fun to see a mind unravel...FightClub is a good example...Apart from the fact that FightClub deals with a more ""visually interesting"" psychiatry case viz MPD....there is a proper logical explanation of the main character became a psychotic....not the case with American Psycho....Add to this the fact the condition he suffers from is not a very ""visually stimulating"" one and that it is in fact depicted in a boring fashion, makes it a forgettable movie experience.Let me give you an analogy....People enjoy playing chess, its fun to use our mind designing strategies...Its even fun to watch a game of chess....You find it fun to watch the moves, how one player uses a strategy and how the other counters it....But can u enjoy a game of chess if you don't understand whats going on -if the game goes above you head(like if two top level players are playing)....Now imagine a situation where two fools are playing it...Again u can't find it interesting to watch their game....u don't get it, because there is nothing to get!!!! I don't see where is the fun in knowing just that Bateman is paranoid...Afterall you are seeing American Psycho and Mateman himself declares from the start that ""I am mad"" 2)Also because..some psychiatry oriented themes can be interesting even if u don't get an explanation of the psychosis...if the premise is interesting...""Identity"" is a good example, there is no explanation as to why there is the disease per se.....but the premise was interesting...In American Psycho there is no premise, because the boundaries between real an imaginary is not clear...You see hallucination after hallucination or delusion after delusion...interspersed with reality -but you don't know which is which and you soon loose interest (atleast I did) In short I found nothing interesting with American Psycho I believe people find it interesting because they think this is a masterpiece and you are supposed to like it.One guy has said (in another comment) American Psycho is fascinating because Bateman is a complex character..yes it is complex...its more than complex it is psychotic, but not interesting....I don't find it interesting to know that how a psychotic can exist with a a very thin superficial mask of sanity....Here i think the director is at fault or the writer of the book...that they failed to make it interesting.....Why would anyone want to know about someone just because he is psychotic The only thing I found interesting in American Psycho was to note how Bateman's co-workers could be so indifferent to his problems...in fact they don't even realize there is a problem!!!!!",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Classic masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece, and it is so underrated. So many quotable moments, true perfect cult piece. Violence is measured, much milder than in the book, which is improved on.

Dark comedy genius, with classic shiny ax scene perfectly in tune with ""Hip to be Square"" music, that Weird Al and Huey Lewis parodied in perfect meta homage.

This is a COMEDY!,"When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it. But I watched it with the wrong attitude. I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras (apart from the deleted scenes), unfortunately, are pathetic.e movie with a scene of Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine) that the point of the satire is nearly lost: Without the fickle trends of society, Bateman is an empty shell. Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.Harron tones down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of the film.Despite a lame ""Is Patrick really nutso?"" twist that hurts the movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on her hands.Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic, Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman will be a career maker.Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well. With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other actors are window dressing. Witherspoon's role is written so blandly anybody could have played it, while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her characer moons over Patrick.

I am not sure how a real-life psychopath's brain works, but each killing in the MOVIE should mean or represent something.

Behind the Mask,"While I haven't read the book and it clearly is playing in another era, than it was filmed, this still has quite something to say about our society. While I'm pretty sure this was also in the book, the really weak follow-up to this, showed us that even with a great source material, you don't have a guarantee that the movie will be great. In this case and with Christian Bale on great form (maybe only his part in the Mechanists overshadows this performance to date, end of 2010), with a very quirky and darkly funny script.While everyone is talking about the ending, this is exactly what the filmmaker wanted us to do. And I love it, because it adds another layer/level to the whole movie. Which is just great. And in case you haven't read the book either, this is not for the faint hearted. Be advised that this does deliberately offend and provoke. You may not like what you see. Actually it would be a big surprise if you really liked the characters at all. But that's the point. Which could also work as a downfall for the movie. But it is handled with great care by the director.Edit: rewateched this and have to admit, this still is as amazing as I remembered it. And while I understand that some may think I am rating too nice or too high, I think I should have given this the full points from the start. So influential, so good. Even if some things may have been a lucky accident - pun intended. Like the one sided face ""paint"" after a violent scene. Interesting that they had to cut some language and the scene that contained almost all of the nudity - but no problem when it came to the violence. To be fair, the book is apparently even ""worse"" or more descriptive when it comes to the things that may offend you.Whatever you may feel about the movie - you can't deny its structure, it cultural and social commentary and that pitch perfect performance by Christian Bale.

"Cynical, loony, and a great performance from Bale","Bale's over-the-top performance is what really keeps this loony, dark dramedy afloat. I suppose it was only a matter of time until someone got the idea to create a character who is both an arrogrant, narcisssistic, upper crust young businessman and a vicious serial killer, but writer Bret E. Ellis gets the credit. There is not much to like here, and hardly anyone to root for, with the exception of the main character's secretary. It is Wall Street in the 1980s, and the characters are vapid jerks, lost in a world of designer clothes, reservations at chic restaurants, and cocaine-fueled partying. The cynicism is laid on with a shovel, and the outbursts of evil madness and humor are pretty bizarre.

"Businessman Bateman makes a killing, both at work and at home.","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, good-looking Wall Street businessman with his own office, a pretty PA (Chloë Sevigny), an attractive fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), a desirable Manhattan apartment, and a fine collection of sharp implements and power tools, perfect for hacking up hookers and ridding himself of pesky professional competition.American Psycho, based on the controversial cult novel by Bret Easton Ellis, is a razor-sharp satire of the yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with the late '80s, an era when success was often measured by how much money you earned, who you knew, what suit you wore, and which restaurants you could get reservations at.Bale's narcissistic Bateman epitomises the yuppie stereotype—self-obsessed, materialistic, power hungry, and predatory, his life is dedicated to feeling superior to all those around him, no doubt because that, secretly, he knows that he is devoid of genuine worth: his position in the company is shared by several indentikit employees (so alike that there are frequent cases of mistaken identity); his fiancé is having an affair (but then so is he); and the only person who truly likes him (apart from himself) is his secretary, who he stupidly deems unworthy of his magnificence. Deep down, he's a very insecure and confused individual.To compensate for his shallow existence, Bateman extends his lack of empathy and ruthlessness much further than most: he not only humiliates and dominates all around him, both at work and at play, but he also kills!Both the book and film have been accused of being overly violent and misogynistic, and it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing and very gory, with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by an emotionally disconnected Bateman; but not only is American Psycho a very unsettling affair, it is also a very funny one (particularly for those with an extremely dark sense of humour), with hilarious satirical displays of oneupmanship between the high-rolling yuppies, amusing deadpan critiques of popular music as Bateman casually prepares for more bloody mayhem, and towards the end, several scenes of sheer unbridled lunacy (try keeping a straight face as Bateman attempts to feed a cat to an ATM).In the film's closing chaotic moments, events become very confusing, with a crazed Bateman finally revealing all to his lawyer over the phone; the very next day, however, we learn that the lawyer has not only taken Bateman's confession to be a sick joke, but also seems to believe him to be someone else entirely. At face value, this all seems terribly unlikely, but it does adhere nicely to the reoccurring theme of lack of individuality; it is also a deliberate ploy by director Mary Harron to allow her audience to come to their own conclusions about Bateman's predicament. Is he free to carry on killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred in Bateman's unhinged mind? Hell, by the closing credits, we aren't even sure if Bateman is actually who he thinks he is.Usually, I don't like ambiguous endings that much, but in such a demented, twisted, schizophrenic movie, it seems like the only satisfactory way to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This movie makes me want to get a business card with a watermark.,American Psycho is way better than Psycho.Alfred Hitchcock passed on American Psycho in favor of Psycho because American Psycho was too American for him. Being British he couldn't handle the Americanism of the subject matter.Originally Patrick was to be Norman's Father. But given the 40 year window of their release dates; it's now Norman who is Patrick's father. Which probably works better; like Luke in Starwars the force is stronger in Patrick and he becomes a better psycho than his father. BUT both the bates are good its just Patrick is the better bate's man.American Psycho is the must see film of the decade. I haven't seen a better constructed; intellectually executed slasher film since before the genre was incepted. The scene where Patrick introduces himself to an unemployed homeless black man named Al and tells him to get a job before stabbing him to death became an instant; all-time-classic.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Bale and Good Movie,"""This is, so to speak, a base"" :)But seriously, without all these jokes, then you and I have a very high-quality work directed by Mary Harron with the wonderful Christian Bale in the title role, which I consider one of the best in his career.The film is clearly not for the faint of heart, there are tough scenes in it, but it's no secret to anyone, even the title should already inspire)
This film is not the easiest to perceive satire on our society.The image of the protagonist/antagonist of the film (Patrick Bateman) was taken by many as ideal.

A violent and bloody film from the controversial best-seller by Bret Easton Ellis.,"A wealthy New York City investment banking executive called Patrick Bateman lives luxuriously, he is handsome, well educated and intelligent, but he hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. Bateman has greed in wanting what others may have, and disgust for those who do not meet his expectations and for himself in not being the first or the best. No Introduction Necessary !. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip !. Killer looks. Killer inside. They got the look right, but then, that's the point, isn't it?.Trimmed-down and slightly cleaned-up adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's widely hated novel has Christian Bale as 80s Wall Street exec and apparent serial-killer Patrick Bateman. In spite of some changes, the vast majority of the dialogue in the picture is taken word-for-word from the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. A decent but unpleasant film in which all characters are antipathical and not very attractive for the general public. Like the decade it portrays, this movie is far from subtle and the roles are barely register as two-dimensional, let alone three. Starring Patrick Bateman is the poster child for Reagan-era excess and preference for style
over substance, a subject matter with which the movie, while filming the satire, beats you over the head. The ominous starring resembles a certain youth containing only greed and disgust, that only seeks self-complacency, enjoy sex and money, the ambition to progress a world to be the leader and live the luxury of consumption society. The production drew protests in Toronto, where some scenes were filmed. Christian Bale is quite good as Patrick Bateman, a twenty-seven young and living his own American dream but at night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence. Bale gives a nice performance, overacting sometimes, or it maybe required by this nasty character. During shooting, Christian Bale followed the morning routine that his role Patrick Bateman describes toward the beginning of the film. Leo DiCaprio was rumored to be in line to play the lead for a time, interestingly, Tom Cruise is actually featured in the novel. Ewan McGregor was subsequently offered the role of Patrick Bateman, but declined after Christian Bale personally urged him to do so. Bale is finely accompanied by an enjoyable support cast with plenty of familiar faces, such as: Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, David Van Patten, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Matt Ross, Jared Leto, Cara Seymour, Luis Carruthers and special appearance by Willem Dafoe.The motion picture was well directed by Mary Harron (Charlie says, Anna Nicole, The Moth Diaries, Betty Page, The Following, The Nine, Big Love, Oz) , although the story does not intrude you sufficiently in the plot, at times. It is followed by a sequel: ¨American psycho 2: All American Girl¨ (2002) by Morgan J. Freeman, in which the only victim who managed to escape from serial killer is determined to become his follower, being starred by Mila Kunis, William Shatner, Lindy Booth, Robin Dunne.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Brilliant,"AMERICAN PSYCHO is Mary Harron's second feature film after her acclaimed I SHOT ANDY WARHOL(and an episode for the TV series Homicide). Her movie has been long in the making, frequently having been discussed, because the studio obviously wanted Leonardo Di Caprio for the leading role of the young big business executive who is - for a pastime- also a serial killer. Harron was opposed to this casting decision and she managed to get Christian Bale whose greatest role till now might have been as Little Jim in Spielberg's EMPIRE OF THE SUN. I read Bret Easton Ellis's infamous novel and must admit I was quite bored. It is an endless succession of what Mr. Bateman wears, uses for his hygiene, what he eats and what he thinks about everything in general, all in a disgusting yuppie pseudo-smartass tone. His very drastically described massacres hardly contribute to making the book more accessible. Mary Harron, however, accomplished the amazing: a movie which is much better than the book! Here she has found a style to envision Bateman's vanity, delicately focusing on the empty icons of this strange society of yuppie executives and staging it slightly as satire with many occasions for the audience to get a laugh. This is something which Ellis is completely incapable of, but probably had intended. The best scenes are where the guys compare their business cards and everyone is envious of the other's, although they all look more or less the same. Bateman eventually kills one of his colleagues for just the reason that his card looks more exclusive. Bateman's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality slowly intermingles so that, at the end, he cannot  distinguish between the two sides of his existence anymore. Although his hideous crimes, artfully staged by Harron between horror and hilarity, can't be overseen anymore, the people around him are so vain that they don't even notice what's happening. As Bateman realizes at the end: ""My confession means nothing at all"", so has the film managed to show us that his existence is just the same. In a small role as Bateman's secretary, Chloe Sevigny is well cast, as always a bit sleepy and slow, but just perfect in this movie. One detail I really liked especially: I always knew that Nouvelle Cuisine was nothing but disgusting and an insult to true cuisine culture. I'll give 10/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

LENGTHY BOOK TO FILM COMPARISON: MAY ONLY MAKE SENSE TO THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM AND WERE DISSAPOINTED,"There are numerous things wrong with this otherwise faithfull adaptation in terms of it's structure, plot and ability to portray a strong focus on it's lead character (although heavily watered down). For starters, it is far too tame. You may argue that a lot of the explicit sex and violence in the book was unnecessary but the truth is the Patrick Bateman in the book is obsessed with detail, perfection and routine, so he explains popular culture, food and restaurants and bathing products with the same explicit nature as he describes his killings with his victims and the sex he has with them beforehand. This was missing. I never once heard Patrick Bateman describe what he likes to do to his female victims in sickening detail. Although this was sick it does serve a purpose and would have proven to be a very uniquely cinematic function that would be very disturbing and almost something we have never seen before in a film. Plus the fact it would sidestep the censors as its not physical violence being committed, merely psychological. They lost something unique in this. Also Patrick Bateman in the book does some unbelievably f***** up things to his victims which makes it hard to read. That's why there was all the controversy. The film does NOT have this effect and it should at least have been shocking, and the fact that there was no controversy surrounding the films release sums it up quite well. It's like a book that is really heartbreaking and sad and brings you to tears but the adapted film doesn't make you feel this way- you often think that something important was missing and the film makers have missed the point.Secondly were the production values. In the book you imagine the locations- Bateman's apartment, his office, the parties they attend, the nightclubs and restaurants, to exceed anything we could ever imagine and associate with 'rich' in reality. In the book they are lavish, far more than we could ever imagine. Now its fairly obvious that this film is relatively low budget and as result it suffers a little by showing us locations we would associate with upper middle class in a TV sitcom, not upper class people who have that sense of materialistic achievement the likes of which we never knew existed. And it's a little too obvious that most of it was shot in a film studio. Many of the characters in the book would frown upon the living conditions of what the characters in the film have.Thirdly was Patrick Bateman himself. He was never this much of a geek in the book. He was a very powerful, ruthless man, who describes all that sense of materialism that is apparently appealing to most humans, whilst displaying a sense of genuine animosity and sinister ness that you would almost regard as 'inhuman'. A lot of people miss the point of this; sometimes your confused as to whether he is human or some form of demon and it plays with your perceptions a little, thereby proving to be the most disturbing element of the book itself. Patrick Bateman in the book is actually very well respected and his possibly so far at the top of his game its no surprise he appears to be inhuman. In the film he is a run of the mill yuppie that is a bit of a loser compared to his mates. In the film he does what he does 'cause he feels he has no choice, in the book he does what he does 'cause he gets such a kick out of it and is such a spoilt brat that enjoying the most expensive things in life are not enough for him. He is so disgusted with meals, clothes, other products etc that don't cost thousands of dollars and aren't the best it is actually quite unbelievable yet interesting, and you get the sense that he spends a thousand just to walk out his door. You don't get a sense of what an expensive life Patrick Bateman lives in the film. Also in the book he really is a ladies man and wherever he goes he always gets a chicks phone number- which would lead onto inevitable consequences. In the film he often has to rely on hookers- one of which the ugly blonde one, who is so ugly the character in the book wouldn't even look at her (the book version of his character is VERY fussy about his women and wouldn't have sex with her unless she was 100% perfect looking, and NOT one that has the characteristics of a yorkshire terrier). In short, the book version of Patrick Bateman would have eaten the one in the film (literally alive) for breakfast in terms of greed and corruption and wanting the best of everything.Fourthly was the scope of the film, again a fault with the films production values. In the book the characters get up to far more interesting things- conference meetings, huge parties, rock concerts, opera and so one, in the film all they ever seem to do is go to the same nightclub and restaurants and sit around and talk. As a result the film shows little achievement as to some of the excitement the characters get up to. That's also what was disturbing about the book, it shows a lifestyle that these yuppies have that entices you and almost makes you feel a little envious of what they get up to. In the film the characters lives are just boring, plain and simple.Last of all (and thank god after all my bitching) the other characters in the book are far more complex and interesting than the 1 dimensional representation we get of them in the film. All of them are obsessed about the same things as Bateman who isn't such a loner and makes you question whether or not they get up to the same things as Bateman despite the fact that they give the impression otherwise. All of them are vain and are obsessed with looking good and getting the best out of everything. Again in the film they are just traditional yuppies.Well I'm sorry I've bored you after this lengthy comparison but if you have read the book long ago as I have; and expected something special and monumental as the book was, rather than a film that was too small scale and lacked the passion and ambition it so desperately needed, I'm sure you'd agree. There should have been moments in this film that really shocked you into realising what a human being is capable of in terms of committing acts of evil towards others but alas, all we got was a naked guy running down a corridor wearing sneakers and wielding a chainsaw. I feel that the strongest thing about the film is easily Christian Bales' outstanding performance, and you wonder what could have been achieved in the hands of a greater director like Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma or even Martin Scorsese, who had a bigger budget and a little more verve and daringness to do it more justice, rather than Mary Hannon's merely competent but pedestrian and un-cinematic take on the book",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Frightening and fascinating,"This is hard to watch at times. Patrick Bateman's cruelty is what is at issue: how is it motivated, from whence does it come, is it in everyone? At times this film seems to suggest that the unrestrained mayhem and viciousness displayed by the main character are present in all humans; and the social masks we wear are merely thin disguises for the aggression, greed, and cruelty which operate below the surface. The movie presents society as a tightly rehearsed dance of protocol, virtue signaling, discreet conformity to social norms. In one scene characters display business cards with subtle differences in what appears to be a critique of how restrictive society is that the only thing left to choice, the only mode of self expression is a water mark on a card, or raised lettering. When Patrick Bateman snaps it is a horror show of epic proportions. This is not easy material to render and the director deserves a lot of credit. Sexuality is presented as naked aggression, animal-level conduct divorced from sincere emotion or communication. Characters in this movie exist in profound isolation, unaware of their motives, operating at a level of seeking or maintaining status. If a darker vision of modern society exists on film I am not aware of it. Even Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' had a few moments of familial contentment, and an expression of love, which you won't find here. Not to suggest this movie needs any of that. It is a psychological study, a dark one at that; and if you are inclined to ponder the depths of what is inside the human animal this movie is ""food for thought.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Exploring the Mind......not Everyone will Understand!""","""American Psycho,"" directed by Mary Harron and based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel, is a darkly satirical film that delves into the psyche of a wealthy investment banker in 1980s Manhattan.

I just want to fit in,"***SPOILERS*** Black comedy about the pressures of making it big on Wall Street circa 1986 that has one of those stock market whiz kids-Masters of the Universe-stock brokers Pat Bateman, Christian Bale, flip out and completely lose it in order for him to stay on the top of his profession that he, in his deranged mind, feels he's slipping off from. Having a great job at the firm of Pierce and Pierce Mergers and Acquisitions with all the perks that goes along with it, including custom made business cards, Bateman's dark side soon take over as he ends up insane In him feeling that he's not quite up to the job.That's when a co-worker Paul Allen, Jared Leto, at the firm got the coveted Fisher Account that Bateman felt was to go to him. Getting Allen good and drunk at a local Wall Street watering hole Bateman invited him up to his pad where he ended up hacking the drunk Allen to pieces and dumping his body parts wrapped in garbage bags in a number of neighbor trash dumpsters. In him, for the time being, getting away with murder has Bateman soon go over the top in in his crime spree. That in him abusing and murdering a number of hookers as well as civilians and even police to prove his new found powers in getting away with his crimes.The fact is that Bateman is not what he thinks he is and it seems that he's living in some kind of fantasy world where nothing in it is what seems to be in real life. Not a likable person in the first place Bateman gets no support from those, fellow Masters of the Univers, he associates with who are in many ways as rotten and back-stabbing as he is.

Impressive. Very nice. Now let's see Paul Allen's review.,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste.

He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.

Gleefully Subversive,"Highly satirical in tone, ""American Psycho"" punches Wall Street in the gut, and does so better than any other film I have seen about that odious institution. The story, set in 1987, ostensibly focuses on a 27 year-old exec named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who works in a Manhattan high-rise, for a company in the corporate ""mergers and acquisitions"" industry. He hobnobs with the chic and trendy. And his personality fits right in with that crowd: amoral, shallow, deceitful, condescending, selfish, sneering, and slick. But in his off-hours he commits blatant acts of violence. Patrick Bateman is a psychotic Gordon Gekko.Yet, the script implies no back-story for Bateman or motivation for his antisocial behavior. Thinly veiled behind the obvious plot line is the film's subversive message. This Wall Street jerk is not a person so much as an analytical construct, an idea, representative of financial violence that lies beneath the veneer of material power and success that Wall Street prides itself on. Because Bateman exhibits overt physical violence, there's no way that viewers can look up to him as a role model like they can theoretically look up to Oliver Stone's Gekko. As such, ""American Psycho"" surpasses ""Wall Street"" (1987) in thematic potency.The dialogue even says as much. In voice-over, Bateman tells us: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me."" And Patrick's ""confession"" at the end is the confession of modern Wall Street.The film's non-script technical quality is quite good. Cinematography, editing, costumes, prod design, art design, sound effects, and acting are all high quality. The semi-classical music in the opening credits provides clever irony. But I didn't care for the 1980s songs, though they are representative of that era.The humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone prevents the film from being perceived as a too heavy-handed cinematic lecture. Instead, the film infers ""black comedy"", adroitly mixing the usually discordant genres of horror with social commentary.In the Patrick Bateman character, ""American Psycho"" accurately describes the Wall Street mentality of the 1980s. That mentality has become blatantly more intense since then. As such, the film continues to be relevant and probably will remain so for a long time to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Psychopath,"American Psycho is a film directed by Mary Harron and adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name. While critiquing the shallow consumer culture of the 1980s, the film unveils the inner world of its main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Patrick appears as a typical white-collar investment banker in New York, masking his true nature as a psychopathic serial killer.The film sharply criticizes the emptiness behind the flashy and luxurious lifestyle, the superficiality of human relationships, and Bateman's disconnected state from reality. Beneath Patrick's flawless appearance lies a lack of empathy and emotional insensitivity towards others. His perverse inner world is expressed through gruesome murders and deranged rituals.The film engages viewers in a profound contemplation as they attempt to comprehend Bateman's madness and the dark side beneath his seemingly normal life. The camera closely follows Bateman's mental breakdown, often blurring the line between reality and hallucination. Bale's acting effectively portrays the character's internal conflicts alongside his cold-blooded murders.American Psycho serves as a sharp critique of the corrupted reflection of the American Dream, targeting the frenzy of consumerism and the loss of humanity. Through visual and symbolic storytelling techniques, the film presents Bateman's complex mind, filled with psychopathic thoughts and impulses, delivering an unsettling experience to the audience. Harron's directorial skills combined with Ellis's story create an extraordinary psychological thriller.In conclusion, American Psycho is a striking film that exposes the dark truths beneath the surface of shallow living and the conflicts within an individual's psyche. Patrick Bateman's madness and the decay of society serve as a mirror, provoking thought and shaking viewers by reflecting the depraved aspects of the modern world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
'Darkness very darkness is sectional' - Gertrude Stein,"American PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company. The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting boy Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage). Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the 'look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her. Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.American PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance.

The Undiagnosed Psychopaths,"The modern fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman might easily have said..."" They will look back with interest and say that I gave birth to the 21st century"". This, of course, is a bastardization of the well known quote from real-life psycho Jack the Ripper. It is pertinent here because it was a brilliant concept of Novelist Ellis that the real blood-letters and psychopaths were not the usually profiled, although Patrick Bateman does say ""I'm a child of divorce, give me a break"".But that is a doubtful creation of the empty, soulless materialism and ""cremation of care"" mindset that befits and thus spawned these greedy Wall Street monsters. Witness the recent financial meltdown. If that isn't a reality based on the metaphor of the Novel and the Film, then you just don't get it. But the American people got it in the form of taxpayer bailouts, unemployment and a sluggish economy.The Movie is an artsy, slick, sombre, but ""playful and mysterious dish"" of dark humor, insanity, and the instability of the insatiable yuppie in-crowd. For these American Dream killers there is so much detachment that even the names of people that work closely together are interchanged and forgotten. It is to this point that our modern manifestation of ""success"" loses his grasp on reality and fails to know who or what is going on.The last third is purposely ambiguous and for that it has a necessary unsettling and unresolved feel. A sense that...even our President can be delusional while appearing to be in command...""A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not."" (Ronald Reagan in a National TV address).The fact is that this is one great parable of a Movie that inaugurated the new Millennium with reflective and relevant prognosis.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Review of American Psycho,"American Psycho is captivating film that masterfully blends psychological thriller, dark humor, and social commentary. The film is a gripping exploration of identity, madness, and the superficiality Wall Street culture. Patrick Bateman is portrayal as a charming yet deeply disturbed character that keeps you on edge throughout the entire film.The story is filled with layers of mystery, keeping us guessing about what is real and what is a product of Bateman's warped mind. The film's ambiguity is one of its greatest strengths, leaving us to decode the complexity of Bateman's world and actions. Whether you're analyzing his interactions or trying to decipher the film's surreal moments, there's always something to uncover, making each viewing experience feel fresh.The film is incredibly well put together in terms of pacing, direction, and cinematography. Every scene is meticulously crafted, contributing to the unsettling atmosphere. The iconic 80s soundtrack enhances the juxtaposition of Bateman's outward perfection and inner chaos. American Psycho is not only a thrilling watch, but also an engaging puzzle for the audience to solve. A must-see for anyone who enjoys psychological films with a dark edge.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I'm Just a Happy Camper :),"I watched this film yesterday evening and haven't been able to stop thinking about it since, it gripped me in a way that not many films do and stuck in my mind.The story is very simple, it follows Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, as a seemingly normal man who murders hookers and homeless people in his spare time, the cinematography is simplistic but it feels like it works perfectly with the story of what everyone assumes is a normal man, the music choices all compliment the movie sublimely, adding to every scene they are in and the cast is all pretty strong, this film though is really carried by one aspect. Christian Bale.He puts in one of my favourite performances of all time as a narcissistic, violent, sociopath, someone you can't help but hate. Bale perfectly captures the duality of Bateman, trying to fit in but struggling to keep up the charade and every time the mask drops you truly believe that he has gone crazy, the physicality and dialogue come together perfectly to give us a simply unforgettable performance. Without Bale I don't think this film would be anywhere near as good and this movie cements him as one of my all time favourite actors.Some people have problems with the ending and I originally felt similar but I think it encapsulates how even though Bateman is the villain, everyone around him is responsible for his actions as well, that's the best way I can put it without getting into spoilers. If you haven't watched this film yet, please do, if only for Christian Bale's amazing performance. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Later, his illogical fantasies escalate and he submits to an uncontrollable bloodlust.The movie has some top notch actors not just the lead (Christian Bale) but Willem Dafoe plays a great detective that makes it all the worth watching.You should check it out for sure, it's funny because of all the YouTube clips that have made this popular, that's what makes it funny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The film caused much controversy involving activists and censors for its graphic violence and glorification of serial killers, but in the end it was all much ado about nothing: there isn't enough resembling humanity to be offensive, and it's all undone by an ending that renders the entire film completely invalid.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the great films of the 2000s!,"Look at that subtle and polished script. The tasteful cinematography and direction of it. Oh my God, it even has Christian Bale's finest performance.American Psycho is a captivating study of a madman who simultaneously obsesses and criticizes the shallow culture he's a part of and attempts to hide his chaotic personal life through excessive vanity and beautification. Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

He's been compared to Ted Bundy, but I think Patrick has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Towards the end the producers released this; The chainsaw scene!, their most crazy scene. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Paul Allen's murder"". A dialog so sinister, most people probably don't listen to what he's saying .

Strangely Satisfying,"A friend of mine has been on me to watch this movie. I finally did. What a weird, violent, over-the-top film! I love that Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) was trying to confess the whole time. The scene in the club when he tells the model he does ""murders and assassinations"" and she asks him if he likes it because no one she knows in mergers and acquisitions likes it is brilliant.Dark comedies have a fine line to walk in my book. If they go too far they become farce and I'm not a big fan of slapstick (unless I'm high). This one worked for me.

Witty satire on 80s prep lifestyle.,"Although it takes an avid imagination to fully appreciate American Psycho, it is an excellent portrayal of image obsessed professionals in the mid 80s and what this lifestyle does to the mind of Patrick Bateman.Do not expect the gore ridden blood fest that this movie may seem to be. It is much more tame than the book and the emphasis is definitely not on this aspect of the film.American Psycho is definitely a BLACK comedy.  Not to be grouped with Silence of the Lambs or other serial killer films.As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale delivers an Oscar worthy performance.

Starts Off Very Strong...Then Falls Apart,"I just got back from a screening of the new Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) film, American Psycho.  I am of mixed feelings when it comes to this film.  I read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis before seeing this film, and I think that potentially changed my final opinion of this film.  So keep that possible bias in your mind while reading this review.When entering this film, I really didn't know what to expect.  I really did enjoy the novel American Psycho and I didn't know how the point of the film could truly be expressed even by Harron, who had done only one feature to this point, although it was an amazing one.  I settled in and began to take it all in.  The film starts of with a relatively humorous tone...very light compared to the novel's strait-laced opening.  It basically introduces Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as your everyday-high-end-yuppie-who-kills-people-on-the-side kinda guy.  It lets us get acquainted with Bateman's friends, loves, and co-workers as well.  Not too far into the film though, it begins it's slight descension into surreality and nightmarish scenes (don't worry though, the violence in the film is a mere shell of the over-the-top-near-unfilmable violence in the novel, in fact nearly all the violence happens off screen.  Toward the beginning of slide, the film keeps up it's satirical and very humorous look...then it becomes more dark and takes a more serious look at the goings on.  By the end, the viewer has lost touch with what is real in the film and very confused about what to feel for Bateman.I think that the most impressive thing about the film is the combination of the lead performance and the cinematography in the film. Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, is amazingly great.  It is one of the most oddball performances I have seen, but it is also the most outstanding I have seen as well.  The fluctuation between outright insanity to social restraint, with a melange of emotions in there, is quite simply remarkable. Now none of the other performances merit as much acclaim.  William Defoe as Detective Donald Kimble,following Bateman's case, also registers to a lesser extent in a subtle performance that is the closest the film has to a real person.  Chloe Sevigny has a role that some found impressive, but I find just lacking all around.  Ditto for Jared Leto and Reese Witherspoon who barely register in basically cameo length roles.The other aspect of the film that really got me was the cinematography of American Psycho.  The lighting cast upon Patrick gives him ""split-faces"", kinda like Jeckyll and Hyde syndrome.  In addition there are just peculiar, but catching scenes of cinematography..such as noir-ish looking cigarette smoke hanging in the air and various camera angles that just lend themselves to the feeling in the film.  The direction on the other hand wasn't nearly as impressive.  It seems as though Harron knows what to do to convey the feeling of the book for like the first 45 minutes, but then it spirals out of control, becoming a (too) dark fall of a yuppie.  It doesn't help that the pacing toward the last 30 minutes is completely off...there is about 15 minutes of monologues about Bateman's flaws, then a horrific murder scene, then close with another 15 minutes of dialogue.  The screenplay, while the pacing was off...the reason why the film's pacing was off, does really do the best possible job of getting the point of the book across, and comes very close to pinning down the exact feeling of the book, except for the self-indulgent finale.Overall, I would say that it is a film that you could probably wait for video or DVD.  But if you are a fanatic of ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" or of the book American Psycho, try to make out to the theatre as soon as possible.My Rating : 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Good for what its doing,"This was my second time watching this film. I have not read the Easton-Ellis novel, and, despite being drawn to books that are causes for scandal, that novel never did attract my interest. The film, on the other hand, from what my understanding of the novel is, does the gist effectively. However, I understand the overall level of grotesue violence and other insane things that our protagonist Parick Bateman engages in, is toned down a fair (which is not saying much, just read a plot synopsis of the novel, you'll know what I mean).The general point I got from the film is that the absolute worst kinds of people are hidden in plain sight among us, and we just do not see them. In addition, the finale of the film suggests, that we turn a blind eye to it. It is a concept worth thinking about.Aside from that, Christian Bale is both revolting and funny at the same time in this film as Patrick, so he does what he is supposed to do.If you like horror-comedy that verges upon the grotestque, or you like the novel, you'll probably like the film too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Deep,"American Psycho is not a movie that most people will even begin to understand on the first try.  It goes beyond a satire of a limited range of 1980's yuppy culture, it is an evaluation of American society as a whole. Pay careful attention to the movie's ending and ask what it means.  The meaning is definitely there, but I won't explain it for you, even though it's subtle, I would rather people understood it on their own.  A casual movie goer looking for an exciting thriller will be horribly disappointed, especially by the ending.  However, if you want to see something that combines the best aspects of ""Fight Club,"" ""American Beauty"" and ""Natural Born Killers,"" this movie is a must-see.

Not perfect but much better than the self indulgent book,"Patrick Bateman works on Wall Street for a major accounting firm.  He lives in a life that is material to the extreme and is more about where you can get reservations at than what you do with your life, where conversations never go deeper than music and the ultimate status symbol is the business card.  However Patrick Bateman is also a serial killer who mutilates colleagues, homeless people, call girls, anyone he can in order to try and feel something.  This film is his confession in his attempt to feel something.I must be totally honest and say that I hated the book.  I hated it to the point that, although I normally take old books to a charity shop, I simply put this one in the bin after I had read it as I didn't want to be responsible for anyone else reading it.  The concept of the book was good and it made it's sole point within the first few chapters.  After this point it simply made the same point over and over and over again in a very thick book that seemed to take pleasure from writing about increasingly violent murders.  At the end of the book I sensed that the author had long forgotten the point he had set out to make and was more concerned with shocking or sickening me.  So when the film came out I simply ignored it as I didn't want any more of my cash to go to this hack.However it came onto terrestrial tv recently and I thought I would give it a try, although I was ready to turn it off if I saw it going the same road. Surprisingly the film is good where the book was awful.  Both make the same point but one makes it in 90 minutes where the other makes it over hundreds of pages.  The film uses violence sparingly, mostly occurring off screen or in the imagination where the book lavished in it's increasing gore.  The effect of this is that the film is much more focused and controlled and works a lot better as a satire on the emptiness and shallow nature of our society.  It is set in the eighties but I feel it still applies today and Bateman could easily be any Western businessman whose concerns are so trivial on a global scale but so important to him/her.The film doesn't labour this point but is able to pick the strongest parts of the book to good effect.  Of course it still isn't perfect and it may seem a little hollow to some (but that is the point I guess) and some may miss the point.  The fact that a sequel has been made that is a straight slasher movie suggests to me that a large section of the audience missed the boat totally.  The main reason this film worked for me was a perfectly cast Bale.  He is a perfect Bateman and is almost otherworldly in his delivery, getting the dead eyed look of Bateman perfectly and contrasting it with his excited chatter on music and his sheer disregard for everything but himself. The support cast is surprisingly well known (Lucas, Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe) but it is Bale's film all the way and easily one of his best performances.Overall this film is not perfect and won't be to everyone's taste.  However just remember that I hated the book with a passion and I still liked the film.  The short running time makes for a more focused approach, the more controlled violence means it doesn't get distracted and a perfect performance from Bale keeps it all on track.  Much better than the horrid book from which it came.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A delve into madness,"American Psycho (2000) really is all about Christian Bale's descent into complete madness. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a very handsome 27 year old business man who has an extremely dark, sadistic side to him that nobody knows about. The plot revolves around Bateman and this dark side of himself, and what the horrible consequences are. One thing is for damn sure, this is not a flowery happy film, it's a dark film that isn't for everyone. It's a crime film but it also has some satire to it as well. There are other well known actors involved too. Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, and Josh Lucas. Lucas and Theroux play Batemans jackass colleagues. They aren't deep characters, they're just kind of the stereotypical chauvinistic privileged jerks. The other characters in the movie aren't really focused on though, this is Bale's movie, it's all about him. I will say that Bale's performance is very good, it's skillful and I don't think anyone could have played it like he did. I think this is a good film, not an excellent one. I didn't really care the satirical aspect of the movie, didn't appeal to me. The main thing I enjoyed was Bale's acting. I suggest it if it's your kind of movie, but it's not highly suggested.

Exceptional,"American Psycho is a movie that ticks all the boxes. It's intelligent, funny, enjoyable, filled with iconic scene after iconic scene, and perfectly nuanced. I love how it finds the perfect balance between strange and accessible, simple yet meaningful, it's just a perfect example of so many things that make a film good.Let's start with the main character, Patrick Bateman, and more specifically, Christian Bale's performance as him. As someone who'd only seen Bale act in Batman Begins, (don't get me wrong, it's a role which he acts well, it's just that it's a role that's a bit too stiff to really get a grasp on the limit of his talents), American Psycho was an eye opening display of his talents. Many of his best moments are when he turns feral in the more violent scenes (the best of which easily being his confession to his lawyer), but even in the scenes where he's more tame, his excellent delivery and mannerisms make him an absolutely mesmerising presence. It's one of those situations where a character and an actor are just so perfect for each other that they made a simply undeniable combination. In fact, the entire movie is incredibly well cast too.I feel as though one detail that some people criticise about American Psycho is that any value from any character other than Patrick is virtually nonexistent, but people who make that claim, while they are right, are kind of missing the point. The men look, sound, and act completely the same, the women look, sound and act completely the same, but it's an essential part of the movie's commentary and is very deliberately prodded at by how indistinguishable Bateman quite often is to his peers. Even more importantly is that it draws attention and emphasises the main point of the film, which is obviously Patrick. It's certainly a character study film and a brilliant one at thatWith that being said, one of my favourite scenes in the movie is the one where Bateman and his companions compare their business cards. It's such a hilariously overdramatized scene that says so much despite doing barely anything at all. The monologue in the scene is quite good, but there were times in the movie where it did merely feel as though it was stating the obvious rather needlessly. The fantastic opening monologue is, of course, an exception to this.Another one of the most valuable comedic parts in the movie is Patrick's ranting about music at completely inappropriate moments. It's so bizarre yet so damn hilarious. It still made me sad that he disrespected early Genesis though. Selling England by the Pound and Foxtrot are incredible records.American Psycho wouldn't be anywhere near as good without the ending, which is definitely among the most befuddling endings to a film ever. It makes you question anything and everything that's happened in the movie up to that point. The best part about it all is that it adds a whole extra layer to all the social commentary that'd appeared in the movie up to that point. Definitely one of the biggest ""double take"" moments in entertainment.I also love how stylish the film is. With the material of the plot and the class and era of people the movie's satirising its personality is a match made in heaven with the other elements of the movie. One of my favourite moments in the movie is right where it begins and there are red drops going down the screen reminiscent of blood before it's revealed that it's just part of a dish at the restaurant where Bateman and his friends are dining at. One of the best decisions for the movie that aids its personality is how most of the kills are off screen and most often only the victims bodies are seen briefly (many of which in one individual scene pretty far into its runtime). They really know how to show without telling.Overall, American Psycho is a superb movie that I'd recommend to anyone. There's no particular aspect of the movie that lets it down in any way, everything is just so tight and it coalesces into one of the best classic movies since the turn of the millennium.

Referential Wrappers for Dummies,"Spoilers herein.I disliked this movie, not because it is intelligent but because it is a sophomoric bleaching of a powerful idea. That idea is that the FORM of the narrative should convey the MEANING of the story. In its simplest forms (Faulkner, Kafka) it deals with madness and what has come to be called the surreal. More subtle exercises in Joyce and Nabokov extend that to an emotional breadth and archetypal depth. But that results in hard work for the reader, so from time to time, lesser novelists recycle the idea at the high school level so that a larger and lazier readership can 'get' it.Films have a harder time with this problem, because they work with a more constrained imagination, and have a tighter integration with societal semiotics. Still, we have some intelligent work with the idea. Greenaway is my own favorite, who incidentally doesn't shy away from the edge of violence as is done here. (Why? To preserve the comic stance? If so, the filmmaker is unwittingly like the society she portrays.).One branch of the possibility of such ""wrapped"" films focuses on the actor, incidentally playing a character. That's the model attempted here. More mainstream recent film examples of how this is managed well are 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'The Pledge.' The former creates a faux documentary narrator who imagines the subject. In this instance, the central actor pulls all the strings. A similar dynamic occurs with 'Pledge' where the wrapper is within the story (excluding the narrator). Easier to read.A related problem is that Harron mistakes style in the costumes and actor's bearing for cinematic style. Really thin. This film is as lowbrow as 'Being John Malkovich,' cleverness for dummies. 'Fight Club' was more artful and intelligent, though it wasted its opportunity. The only intriguing element here is the probably unintended notion of Dafoe as an imagined Moriarty. This isn't taken anywhere, but Dafoe does have a haunting presence independent of this simple effort.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The originality and craziness almost compensate for the awkwardness throughout,"American Psycho (2000)This isn't quite a dark comedy, not a satire of psycho slasher movies, and not a straight up suspense crime flick, either. Or is it all these things?It might depend on your sense of humor. If you try to take it seriously, which you shouldn't (the first clue is in the credits when the dripping blood turns out to be a red sauce for a fancy meal), you'll end up mystified and unhappy. If you find this funny, if Christian Bale in this pre-Batman demanding role is really wry and comic for you, you'll love it. Most of the time.I was somewhere in the middle. Bale is playing a caricature--the overly rich and conceited playboy businessman in the Reagan 80s. But he plays too often the caricature directly rather than letting it come through the performance organically. Sometimes this is fine, or even great, but it puts a little strain on other scenes. (The women I know who saw it or have seen it don't think this matters so much because he's really hot, and really naked, in lots of it. And it's directed by a woman, Canadian Mary Harron who cut her teeth, not surprisingly, with the artsy ""Who Shot Andy Warhol."")The plot is important and clever, and hard to talk about because there are some key twists, the twists becoming really huge by the end. Appropriately. Because above all this is camp. It's hammy without being slapstick. It works best, in a weird example, with the recurring fascination with the business cards among this group of young pampered business jerks. Jealousies over the color of the paper and the quality of the type lead to, well, some unrestrained behavior.The movie is sometimes bloody for sure, but most of the blood is so gratuitous it isn't quite disturbing. The main character is insane as the title implies--more than you realize at first--and the people around him don't always see him for what he is. Or do they? Or do we?There are a lot of movie tricks here. Scenes shift reality, or echoes from one situation visually resemble another, and in that sense it's a smartly made. But it also manipulates too openly for anyone trying to actually enter the movie. And ""entering' the movie is a mistake. It's all show, and once you realize it's a farce and the characters don't really matter because they don't really exist (it's just a movie, the movie insists), once you realize that you're going to enjoy it more, but also realize it's a capped off experience. It only goes so far.By the end I wanted it to end. It's an odd, affected, curious, and almost period-defining movie. If you liked slightly odd creepy moves like ""American Beauty"" which has an odd echo in the title, you might want to give a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Madness in Manhattan,"American Psycho is a razor-sharp satire that delves into the dark underbelly of ambition, excess, and identity within 1980s Wall Street culture. Directed by Mary Harron and adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel, the film is a masterful blend of psychological horror and dark comedy. Its unique approach creates a thought-provoking and unforgettable cinematic experience that challenges societal norms and perceptions.Christian Bale delivers an iconic performance as Patrick Bateman, a character who epitomises the era's superficiality and moral decay. Bale's portrayal is chillingly precise, capturing Bateman's duality-a charming, polished exterior masking a deeply disturbed psyche. His meticulous mannerisms, haunting detachment, and eerie monologues make Bateman one of cinema's most compelling and unsettling anti-heroes. Bale's commitment to the role elevates the film, offering a biting critique of the emptiness underlying the pursuit of wealth and status.The film's satire is as stylish as it is scathing. Harron crafts a world that is both visually striking and unnervingly detached, using sleek cinematography and a carefully curated soundtrack to reflect the era's obsession with appearances and consumerism. Famous scenes, such as Bateman's monologues about pop music or his obsessive attention to detail, perfectly encapsulate the absurdity and horror of his character, while providing darkly humorous commentary on societal values.American Psycho stands out for its fearless exploration of uncomfortable themes, including greed, identity, and the dehumanising effects of capitalism. The film's ambiguous narrative invites endless interpretation, blurring the line between reality and delusion. This deliberate ambiguity, paired with its graphic content, may alienate some viewers, but it's precisely this boldness that gives the film its power and lasting impact.While not universally accessible due to its challenging tone and subject matter, American Psycho is a provocative examination of materialism and the fragility of identity. It balances its horror elements with sharp social commentary, sparking conversations that extend far beyond the confines of its narrative.In conclusion, American Psycho is a daring and incisive piece of cinema that earns its place as a modern classic. With Christian Bale's unforgettable performance, Mary Harron's deft direction, and its biting critique of 1980s excess, the film remains as relevant and impactful today as it was upon its release. It's a provocative work that invites analysis and lingers in the mind, cementing its status as one of the most compelling explorations of identity and ambition in film history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

There was nothing well new or exciting in this film.  What kept it interesting was the direction and the acting.  Mary Harron is one a hell of a director--she gets inside her characters' heads and lets us know all about them visually.  The acting is superb--especially Bale.  He's playing a sociopath and a serial killer, but he makes you understand and (believe it or not) actually care for the guy!  Everybody else is great too, but Bale is just incredible.  So, good job all around, but there's no way this could ever be a good movie.  Still, it's worth seeing for the direction and acting.

So sigma,"This movie is absolutely absurd. Patrick Bateman is a literal psychopath yet is living in a world even crazier than he is. I'm gonna be honest, I'm not 100 percent certain I know what's going on but I do believe this movie is up to interpretation to a certain extent. Patrick Bateman as a character is very interesting. The dude is crazy, yet he's also extremely meticulous, cold and calculating. Despite all this he's extremely materialistic and envious, like in scenes such as where all the buisnessmen are showing they're cards. Which all happens to say vice president btw, another indication that Bateman is crazy.The ending was quite good as well. Did bateman's lawyer have lunch with Paul Allen, or was it just another generic, sociopathic businessmen? Either way this movie is definitely a fun little commentary on American buissness man and a pretty thought provoking one at that.

A failed attempt to explore psychopathy,"When I watched ""American Psycho,"" I came across one of the most disappointing and disturbing films I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. With a promising premise of delving into the dark mind of a psychopath, the film miserably fails to deliver a coherent and meaningful narrative.The story revolves around the character of Patrick Bateman, and presents a series of grotesque and violent events that serve only to shock and provoke disgust in the viewer. The screenplay is completely empty, lacking any character development or even a compelling plot.Furthermore, the film fails to establish an effective social critique, as expected. The portrayal of Manhattan's high society is simplistic and superficial, failing to meaningfully explore issues such as materialism, individualism, or the false appearances that society can conceal. Instead, we are bombarded with scenes of gratuitous violence and pretentious dialogues meant only to shock the audience.Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is one of the few redeeming qualities of the film. His acting is intense and convincing, portraying the character with a chilling coldness and sensuality. However, even his brilliant performance cannot save a film that is so poorly structured.Mary Harron's direction is disoriented and lacks cohesion. The choice of framing and sequences is confusing, giving a sense of disorientation to the viewer. Moreover, the lack of appropriate pacing makes the film drag on and become tedious, despite its short duration.Another problematic aspect of the film is its handling of violence against women. The scenes of murder and torture are particularly disturbing, and there is no intention to critically explore or discuss the gender issues behind these actions. Instead, the film seems to glorify violence and misogyny, becoming deeply problematic and offensive.In summary, ""American Psycho"" is a deeply flawed and unnecessarily disturbing cinematic work. Its lack of a coherent narrative, meaningful social critique, and its irresponsible approach to violence and misogyny make this film a waste of time and a distressing cinematic experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You Wanna Get Nuts!?,This is another film I've never seen all the way thru so I decided it was about time to change that and having done so I had no idea how deep this movie was. Sure watching the enigmatic and overly eccentric Christian Bale as a yuppie venture forth on a murderous killing spree of hookers and hobos is entertaining but the end of the film is really what gets inside your head. The ambiguously prolific ending of the movie where it has you second guessing everything you witnessed prior to the finale scene is something that's as intriguing as it is at the same time somewhat frustrating. Ambiguity in cinema is always a love/hate relationship with me. On one hand I enjoy the philosophical point of view and critical thinking it eludes to. But on the other side of the spectrum the other half of my brain just wishes they would have given me a clear and present answer and conclude the movie so I don't have to down a rabbit hole on Reddit forums until the wee hours of the morning. That's I think the movie's biggest strength yet also it's biggest flaw in its sheer ambiguous nature. Other than that it's pretty great to see the devolution of a man go from being obsessive to compulsive to downright unhinged then struggle with what he's done by the end of the film. His biggest punishment is not the fear of getting caught and facing consequences of his actions but rather never getting caught and having to live with the agony of nobody ever knowing or wanting to conceive he was able to commit such injustices and crimes. By him never attaining true notoriety for his heinous acts he's forced to stay forever in limbo stewing in his own shite until his final moments. With that all being said I can definitely recommend it to those who haven't seen it and want a sure fire thriller and a movie that'll get inside your head a bit.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Undisputed masterpiece,"I'm usually inclined to scrutinize a song for how memorable it is, but generally don't hold film to the same standard. If a movie entertains me in the moment, then it's done it's job, even if I never think about it again. Which makes it kind of remarkable to realize that American Psycho still takes up a great deal of real estate in my mind, twenty years after I first saw it. I mean it doesn't hurt that the film has wormed it's way so deep into pop culture that the memes and references are virtually inescapable. Revisiting it just feels like singing along to a greatest hits compilation, ""Here comes the business card scene! Watch out Paul Allen!""It succeeds by offering surface level entertainment with more under the hood. The exaggeration of both the violent and the mundane lighten the mood of the morose subject matter, making for some unexpected hilarity. Like the little dance that Christian Bale does right before lacing into Jared Leto, it's a pitch perfect comedic performance that makes the ensuing mayhem an infectiously good time.It's clear throughout that there's more to this than the surface level story, yet instead of beating you over the head with it's message, it smartly remains vague, staying open for the viewer to interpret it's themes. Obviously an indictment on 80s wall street yuppies, it's unclear how broad the umbrella is meant to stretch. Is Patrick Bateman a personification of all soulless capitalist greed? Are we all him as we modify a public persona to chase unattainable standards?

The descent of American values in recent decades, and the poignant examination of such trends is what is truly distubing about this film. That, or the scores of mindless fools who just didn't 'get it'. Maybe because the truth has a learning curve greater than zero (or less than?).Some see American Psycho as little more than a satire about materialism, and they're correct, but only in part. American Psycho, if you watch (or read it) closely, is much more than that. It is really an indemnification of what America has become. Bret Easton Ellis is quite possibly a patriot in this regard, for he sees the realities of this fading Republic and shows us all, in vivid fashion, the hideous and despicable qualities that have risen to dominance in our culture today.Patrick Bateman is the embodiment of modern America.

"Wonderful, but not what I expected","Having heard all of the hype about the twisted violence and sick imagery of the book, I was very curious as to how I would react to this movie. Movie violence usually doesn't bother me, but on occasion, I have been incredibly disturbed (example - ""I Spit On Your Grave"" which I could not sit through again). Here, though, I was very surprised to see very little violence, suspense or blood. This so-called ""sick"" movie was not sick at all. Despite not being scared, I thought that the movie did a wonderful job at satirizing the business world in the late 1980's (and it featured a great sound track of 80's music!). When I walked out, I was feeling a bit disappointed - not just by the under usage of the immensely talented Reese Witherspoon and Chloe Sevigny - but by the story itself. I wanted to know more. But the more I thought about it on the way home, the more I liked the way the movie handled the story. It really made me think, and it featured some very interesting twists.

It was all about chic restaurants that were approved by the New York Times, and, sexual proclivities which satiated Bateman's immediate hedonistic desires!!

For the real world, yes, for Bateman, of course not!! This film gives the movie audience an enticing invitation to the irrational thought patterns of Patrick Bateman.. I took them up on it, and indulged the entire film with a sort of heinous empathy for Christian Bale's character. I totally understood that he was the American psycho who had an intensely high testosterone level which was motivated by an exhilarating avariciousness!!

The film ""American Psycho"" translates to unscrupulous chicanery being the end result of a nauseating arrogance... All of us are human, we fall prey to personal motives and pecuniary fixations, it is just a matter of which people have the proper credentials to implement these desires the most expeditiously!!

Christian Bale's acting performance in this movie is one of the best performances I have ever seen!! His perceived superiority was his convoluted form of amelioration!! Think about it this way, people can raise a family on less than $40,000.00 a year, but, they find a cuss word offensive? The same might hold true in the case of Patrick Bateman's covert vindication for his antics of absolute depravity and blatant disregard for human life!! How do these two statements correlate?

a searing indictment of '80s yuppies,"""Wall Street"" showed America's billionaires as worthless human beings, but ""American Psycho"" goes one step further: it tells of a Gordon Gekko-type who is actually a murderer. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is quite possibly the most despicable kind of person imaginable. For starters, he's as vain as can be: only twenty-seven years old, he is already using excluding mask. He has gotten a job in his daddy's firm and spends all day listening to CDs while his secretary does his work for him. Whenever he and his equally despicable buddies (or is that ""cronies""?) get together, they brag about their business cards.

American Psycho,"Mary Harron's depiction of Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, is a true, original MASTERPIECE! The most beautiful part about this movie, was the ambiguous approach Mary Harron took. Her direction and story telling had a dark comedic tone, with so many open ended outcomes, having great detailed narration from Christian Bale. She also utilized a lot of foreshadowing, allowing things to really brew up into a fantastic story. Mary Harron used a lot of focused, close up shots, to really display the raw emotions in each character.Christian Bale is an actor, man. I personally connected with a side of his character, because of my OCD nature, quick, sly remarks, and my blunt tone (just not to his extreme). His character is a real narcissist jerk, that is super high octane. Christian Bale did a phenomenal job getting into this role, working out, and really filling the role as an inside psychopath. He paid close attention to detail, really displaying, and explaining the true characteristics of a psychopath. The fact that Bale didn't get nominated for his performance, is a little absurd, considering this is one of his BEST performances. This was mainly a character study of Patrick Bateman, but we also had a lot of great performances across the board, for the supporting cast in Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis and more.The screenplay by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner was terrific! They really focused on making this a dark comedy movie, along with the drama/thriller/horror aspect. All of the dialogues had so much intelligent word play, having countless uncensored vulgar conversations, with many righteous remarks. Though there are some scenes that are genuinely horrific, Harron & Turner didn't shy away from incorporating consistent dark humor laughs, that came from the soul.The action was brilliantly utilized, not overdoing it, being very graphic and unsettling.

Christian Bale delivers an outstanding performance as the titular character, Patrick Bateman, a successful businessman with a dark and twisted personality.The film's slick visuals and chilling soundtrack contribute to its immersive atmosphere, while the screenplay manages to maintain the novel's satirical tone, which is both hilarious and terrifying.The supporting cast, including Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto, are equally impressive, bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles.Overall, ""American Psycho"" is a thought-provoking and provocative film that will leave a lasting impression on audiences. It's a masterful adaptation of the novel that manages to capture the book's essence while standing on its own as a compelling work of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
psychotically.... average,"I was intrigued about this movie hoping that it wouldn't turn out to be another generic ""psycho"" movie stemming of different versions of Psycho itself. But it lacked in a copious amount of areas. The screen writing the plain average with Christian Bale's voice narrations sounding as fake as his smile. Though his character was supposed to be this dull within, it could of been executed and performed substantially better such as Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs.The story had no depth deep down as the audience is left to frantically follow the life of the cereal killer, wondering what is the point of this movie?Nonetheless, some scenes were bizarre but, interesting at the same time",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Quotable, memorable and perfectly executed","When I think of Christian Bale's performances, two come to mind: Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight Trilogy and Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.American Psycho follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy businessman in the 1980's that hides his alter ego from the people he knows during the day and enjoys his murderous tendencies at night.Easily one of my favourite films of all time, American Psycho is a film I won't ever get tired of. To be clear, American Psycho isn't meant to be viewed as a serious thriller but rather a dark comedy. The film does such an excellent job introducing us to Bateman's persona as we really learn how narcissistic and superficial of a person he really is. It leaves great hints into the violent thoughts he has at the start and slowly descends into the chaos in a way that feels organic. Not only that, the film provides us with very clever commentary on the self-adulation of businessmen during the simplest of scenes such as a group of them discussing business cards. The direction, sound design and acting all combined tells us all about Bateman and his co-workers. Mary Harron directed this story with immense skill. She balances the violence with enough comedy that somehow makes it hilarious rather than disturbing and the script, filled with memorable sequences and quotable lines, attribute to that tone.The creation of the 80's is also an aspect I admire. From the visual representation of New York City to the monologues on music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston, all of this meshes to create an accurate representation of that time period. When it comes to performances, Christian Bale steals the show. One of his best performances to date, Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman is brilliant on so many levels. With the tone he uses for certain lines to reveal the character's narcissism to the deep, dark and piercing effect he creates once he goes about violent tendencies, Bale's acting is top-notch. Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto are also great in their short roles.American Psycho is a unique character study that works incredibly due to the synergy between Mary Harron's direction, the script and Christian Bale's powerhouse of a performance. It's a beautifully constructed piece of work that will remain as one of my favourite films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Clever, Witty and Disturbing","'American Psycho' is a brilliant horror satire that blends disturbing imagery with social commentary about the superficial and materialism aspects of the 80's. The movie does a fantastic job of adapting the novel by Brett Easton Ellis by focusing more on the satirical aspect of the book, yet still manages to include plenty of violent set pieces and thanks to a smartly written script, superb direction and an iconic leading performance, everything comes together beautifully and creates an entertaining viewing with layers beneath the surface.The plot = Set in the 1980's Wall Street era, a wealthy investment executive Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) has everything going for him, but he's also a psychopath and decides to act out his violent fantasies.The narrative is somewhat loosely told and plays secondary to the satire, but thanks to strong production values, stunning cinematography and the overall tone of the flick the movie is smart as it is engaging and all of that is thanks to the amazing central performance by Christian Bale whose absolutely perfect in this role, he delivers the look and delivery the character needed, a lesser actor would have taken the movie down with him, but thankfully Christian Bale is one of the most talented and diverse actors out there and this was a star making turn for him.Overall 'American Psycho' is an excellent feature through and through and still holds up well after more than 20 years. Clever, witty and horrifying, this movie is a treat and a modern day classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary on the '80's","Seeing ""American Psycho"" right after ""High Fidelity"" is like going through a fun-house mirror, as it's a warped, caustic view of many of the same issues ""HF"" deals with humorously and with humanity.The monologues on pop music are disarmingly similar, but here they are just foreplay for uncontrollable hate and blood lust as a way to try to poke through them for feeling, as if it's ripping through Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" video for blood.I have no idea about what the original book is like, but this is a ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" of the single '80's set. One weakness is that we don't actually see the interchangeable yuppies work so we don't see the testosterone rush at work that is so frightening in ""Boiler Room"" and would have added more tension and maybe even explanation here, where all we hear is that ""Mergers & Acquisitions"" is synonymous for the lead character to ""murders and executions."" They are all so interchangeable (shades of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" taking over Jude Law's character) that I was really not sure of what is real or fantasy when others keep saying that he must be mistaken about murdering a co-worker when they met with him.The lead character, played beautifully narcissistically by Christian Bale, is equally murdering men and women here, so the misogyny charges filed against the book don't apply here, and he's equally unfeeling to both. But as he breaks down, the irony is that he's not unfeeling about his crimes--the rest of the people around him are.It's a very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary.(originally written 4/15/2000)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very Disappointing! The scariest part of the film is the Close up of the Phil Collins C.D. Cover!,"This had the potential to be brilliant, but is very poorly written.The dialogue is weak to say the least. The main character's dialogue is inane and pretentious, and the feeble attempt to add depth by petty obsessiveness does not work to the judging eye.Also he is remarkably insecure, which is greatly at odds with his achievement in life - a brilliant, calculating careerman, which is what he must have been up to this point in his life to get the office that he has!In the parts where Bale is about to wreak havoc, he embarks on post-modern soliloquy, based on the careers of Pop Stars. No doubt, the aim of these commentaries, was to chill our spines, that this highly reasoning, exponent of individualism, could use his intelligence to mindlessly chop people up!However, rather than being spine tingling, the dialogue merely bores us to death and the victims surely would not have felt any pain, and they would have been rendered unconscious by his mind-numbing long before he got around to dismembering them.Where the hell was the end? Perhaps they realized it was going to be as pants as the rest of the movie and cut it!The scariest part of the film is the Close up of Phil Collins C.D.

An Unimpeachable Masterpiece,"Oh, don't be fooled by the title; ""American Psycho"" is far from just another slasher flick. It's a riveting, artfully-crafted exploration of 1980s consumerist culture, wrapped in an intricately woven narrative that explores identity, superficiality, and the primal nature of man. It's much like, say, a perfect Valentino Couture suit - exquisitely tailored and flawlessly presented, but with an undercurrent of danger that's undeniably exhilarating.Christian Bale brings a transcendent performance as Patrick Bateman. It's undeniable that his portrayal, straddling the line between corporate sophistication and unhinged brutality, is nothing short of brilliant. With chiseled good looks, a body that's testament to countless disciplined hours at the gym, and an impressive command of dialogue - he's perfectly suited to embody the paradox that is Bateman.Bale's monologues, particularly his assessments on pop music (Phil Collins' ""Sussudio"" and Huey Lewis and the News' ""Hip to Be Square"" come to mind), are so utterly captivating, it's almost as if he's revealing deep, meaningful truths about the universe - or at least the universes of high finance and high fashion. These ruminations, delivered with such smooth, calculated precision, are proof of Bale's mastery and the script's razor-sharp wit.Director Mary Harron brings a perfect sense of style and substance to the film. Every shot is purposeful, every scene meticulously arranged as if it's a work of art (and it is). The tonal balance she strikes, between icy satire and shocking violence, is as exquisitely crafted as a meal at Dorsia. Harron's ""American Psycho"" is a profound critique of the excess of the 80s, our obsession with appearance, and the emptiness that can lie beneath.The rest of the cast, including Jared Leto and Willem Dafoe, also turn in stellar performances, bringing to life the vapid, image-obsessed social circle of Bateman with just the right amount of cringe and comedic timing. Every character in the film is a mirror, reflecting the absurdity and artificiality of this world.""American Psycho"" isn't just a movie, it's a visceral experience, an exploration of identity and the human condition, and a sharp commentary on a society lost in the surfaces of materialism. A must-watch, even if your reservations at Dorsia need to be postponed. Oh, and did I mention the business cards?",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What an in-depth character study this is.,"Possibly the most pretentious character in film history. The film delves into so many themes like materialism, hypocrisy, manipulation, influence, trends and much more. All themes are viewed from the protagonist's perspective yet all of them are about him really. But what makes this different from other films is that here the protagonist is self-aware of some of all his misdeeds. The protagonist is so complex that even he himself isn't sure if he knows himself. This is some serious work where every scene could be analysed for ages of what it all means. This is top-tier writing and execution. The film leaves dozens of questions unanswered, yet provides us with enough information to fill the gaps however we want.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
sloppy,"I found American Psycho to be rather disappointing. This may have been because of the fact that I built up my expectations too high, or because of the fact that this is a compelling theme that deserved more of an explanation and a more thorough study of Bateman's psyche than the film actually offered.From the opening credits 'till somewhere halfway the story, i believed that this film had tremendous potential. Halfway trough the movie however, I was forced to revise this opinion, waiting for some explanations of what Bateman is doing or a deeper look into Batemans psyche and what is real and what imaginary. Instead, he just randomly kept murdering girls in random places (the apartment with all the corpses?), strange things happen (Paul Allen's apartment cleaned up all of the sudden by an accusing real estate agent?, Bateman going berserk without any consequences?, Bateman imagining drinking whiskey?) that make you understand that not all of what Bateman does is real, but no explanation is given for this, and we never get to know what in fact is real.By the time I understood that Bateman was imagining certain things, I was hoping that this film would draw to a 'Fight Club ending' and a 'aha-erlebnis'. Instead, it ended with a lot of unanswered questions and a 'Taxi Driver ending', which left a very sour taste and spoiled a movie with heaps of potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Psychopath with unforgettable scenes,"A movie I went in with high expectations thanks to some friends and social media. But to be honest, I was not disappointed. The film was relatively short, which I like, and you could feel that they did not try to drag the storyline and the film.The main character Patrick Bateman was incredibly well thought out. An interesting character, however, I do not understand how so many can compare themselves with him when he is utterly insane. The film was grotesque in a fitting way and Bateman had an interesting character development where you became more and more familiar with him. The end is the only thing I would say was confusing. I did not understand whether he had just imagined everything. The film is from the year 2000 so, you can understand that the scenes are not perfectly beautiful but, they still did a fantastic job but still feel that you could have worked more with colours.At the same time, all the characters were well thought out, there were only a few amounts of characters who all played their role and character. The director did a great job getting rid of all these unnecessary characters that usually exist.

I watched this film fall further and further apart and I hoped that at the end it might all come together but I was too hopeful, obviously.

He's literally me,"A Sigma male is a man who lives outside the hierarchy by choice. He does his own thing and dances to his own beat. A Sigma Male is also very attractive to women, right at the top of the socio-sexual hierarchy alongside the Alpha.There is a male hierarchy, where men stratify themselves on a totem pole, and the higher up the totem pole you are the more rewards of life, social and sexual, accrue to you. That's why everybody wants to be the king, the chief executive, or the rock star.Please note that Sigmas are just as high up the sexual Totem pole as Alphas - but are outside the hierarchy by choice. Sigmas often share many of the qualities of Alpha males. They are usually self posessed, self sufficient and charismatic.Like Alpha males, Sigmas can be very successful with women - but without having to build up an infrastructure around themselves. It's common to split the typology that originally came from zoologist's studies of primates, which is you have an alpha, a beta and an omega.The alpha is the king, the leader of the troop, the head lion and everybody else follows him. He lays down the law and the females naturally gravitate towards him because as the leader he is sexually attractive. He is best able of all the males to impose himself onto the world.The mass of the population below are the beta males. The followers, they are the cubical drones, they are the normal guys and they follow the alpha. They're fighting over the women that the alpha doesn't want, the leftovers. The alpha gets first pick and the betas get the rest.Then at the very bottom of the pile you have the Omega Male. They are the socially invisible, the losers, the dregs, the guys living in their mum's basement playing World of Warcraft. These men experience women primarily through internet porn and escort agencies.So to reiterate, a Sigma Male is a man within the socio sexual hierarchy who chooses to live his life outside of the normal social dominance hierarchy structures of society.

"The dark side of vain masculinity, unveiled by Mary Harron ...","I was 27 with high enough a salary to be a chain-dater, taking girls to the same expensive restaurants, especially one with the best panoramic view on Casablanca. My face became familiar to the waiters and they did a good job pretending it was my first ""visit"". I could bring girls regardless of any intentions to build a relationship; what mattered was the status. Two evenings could cost me a tenth of my salary but it was worth it. And that's the degree of vanity to which I could relate to Patrick Bateman, 26, embodying that point of a man's life where the more he eats, the hungrier he gets.""American Psycho"" is set in the 80s but things haven't changed much; in the 2010s, we could all have a nice girlfriend and yet keep on lusting on that sexy profile on Facebook. Maybe the late twenties is an age where the manly ego roars too loudly to listen to reason, maybe there are so many possibilities that we're more likely to make decisions lingering on fantasies rather than reality, moreover in a time where sex is trivialized by porn and violence by pop-culture, which ""American Psycho"" shows (as opposite of ""tells"").The film, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel and directed by Mary Harron, is about that state of vanity driven to its more extreme and disturbing form. Here is Bateman's existential dilemma: should he surrender to the comfort of conformism at the risk of becoming a mediocrity (in his own terms) or acting free in the name of a supra-individuality that puts him above everyone else? The film is set during the Reagan-era and centers on arrogant yuppies who measure success by their capability to get the best tables, the most exotic meals and fulfill any kind of sexual fantasy. And Patrick Bateman is the most troubled of them: he's attractive, articulate but his moments of social adequacy are punctuated with anxiety driven by jealous rage.But the weirdest aspect is less in his behavior than the way it keeps getting unnoticed. It's very telling that the final line of the film is ""That confession meant nothing"". Many movies tend to use violence to make a specific comment against society, channeling ""Taxi Driver"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" (there's even a scene that echoes Kubrick's film where Bateman confronts a homeless man) but in ""American Psycho"", violence says more about the perpetrator and the environment that can't perceive him as the degenerate man he is. It's not about the vanity of men who reached the top but the way they are seen as perfectly compatible with civilization although they're acting below animals, it's like a more cynical version of ""Being There"" with Peter Sellers.""American Psycho"" can also be regarded as an alternative to ""Fight Club"". In Fincher's film, men compensated the vacuity of their lives by uniting and draining their energy from their survival instinct, with a collective voice, and rejecting capitalism because it rejected humans in the first place. Harron's perspective shows men who exist individually, but whose existence are lead at the expenses of a social conscience, or any conception of love or family. It's all about consumption, competition, buying, eating, trading, a world where even women are treated like products whether prostitutes or strippers or disposable fiancées. These men didn't fight the system but embraced it, men being wolves to men.Patrick Bateman took it a bit too literally: anyone above him is a dead man, anyone who admires or loves his Alpha aura might get away, someone with no goal whatsoever, no philosophy of life, deserves to be killed. Destruction is what connects both ""Fight Club"" and ""American Psycho"" but if in the former, the mayhem was supposed to build a new order, the message was still contradicted by its homoerotic undertones and its constant gaze on Brad Pitt's beautiful abs. The film was tantalizing our voyeuristic tendencies. We get the same gaze on Bale, when he's taking a shower and narrates his cosmetic morning routine, but it's devoid of passion, it's cold and soulless and his naked body is often associated to scenes of horror that connects between the two worlds of fantasy: violence and nudity. It's just as if the real motive of the 'Fight Club' was to create a sense of belonging, to build a collective male body instead of restoring justice.Mary Harron deconstructs the myth of masculinity through the portrayal of many metrosexual men as self-important and gossipy as the Beverly Hills housewives. Bateman has everything: a steady and gratifying job, a huge apartment in New York, a beautiful fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) and yet he's devoured by a constant urge to destroy whatever can spoil this feeling of perfection, even someone whose business card looks better. The film blends toward horror and comedy with rather gruesome episodes, but there's never any attenuating circumstance, Bateman has no moral alibi. He was raised by pop-culture, Reagan, and considers killing something as casual as ordering a hamburger.It might be the extreme point from which we understand the inconceivable: why would someone who'd accept that thousands of people die from a transaction accept to be ethical? Why would someone who's at the top of the human pyramid, decides to have casual sex with an average Jane or accepts marital commitment? Why would he indulge to normal behavior? That's the point, the higher climb as a man and the looser will be your sense of moral, (look at the Weinstein or Epstein scandals) and maybe Bateman, whether he commits the actual crimes or dream of them, is the embodiment of both masculinity and capitalism dark side.And Bale's extraordinary performance is crucial because he never tries to make his character sympathetic when he confronts us to our potential for degeneracy and hypocrisy. ""American Psycho"" is an underrated 2000s film, oddly prophetic, revealing new depths at each viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
They almost hit the satire... but not quite.,"Let me start off by saying that American Psycho is not nearly the movie many reviews make it out to be.  I refer to both the good and bad ones.  It is by no means the best satire ever made, nor is it completely worthless. American Psycho is a near miss of a great movie.The basis of this movie is not, as many would believe, the random killings of a psychotic man, like in recent teen-slasher films.  The basis is actually a satire aimed at the rich and famous's power in the world we live. Think O.J.  Such power is represented in this movie through the use of one psychotic businessman.  The commentary lies not within his actions, but rather within his ability to get away with them.While I love a good satire of big business as much as the next guy (Fight Club did a fairly good job at this subject), it is in this respect that American Psycho tries hard, but seems to miss the mark.  While scenes involving dealings with business cards and discussions of fellow business employees are relatively amusing, the movie as a whole falters with its blatant use of cheesy killing scenes.  I had the opportunity of viewing this movie in the theatre on my college campus with many other college students. It was these scenes that turned the theatre from a horrified, yet curious crowd into one that was laughing as if they were watching [insert recent teen comedy hit here].American Psycho had serious potential to be a well written, well acted dark comedy.  However, between the choice to use a Tom Cruise look-alike as the main character and the choice to play off the killing scenes as if they were straight out of Evil Dead, the movie could not survive.  Overall, I rate the movie my average score of a 7/10, as it was better than many movies nowadays, but no where near the quality it could have been.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The film intricately blends satire, psychological thriller elements, and dark humor, creating a unique cinematic experience. Its commentary on materialism and superficiality in the late 20th-century corporate world is sharp and thought-provoking.However, on a personal note, the film doesn't completely align with my taste in movies.

Still Undecided...,"It's been about a year since I watched this film and I still don't know what to think of it. When I picked it out at the video store, I did so strictly because it was depicted as a horror/suspense film (which I love) and it had Christian Bale in it (who I liked as an actor even though the only movie I'd seen him in was Little Women). Maybe it was the fact that I was going into this movie with visions of Laurie (Bale's character in Little Women) still in my head or that I had absolutely no idea what the plot was but I was stunned to say the least.My family and I (all adults) sat down to watch MY big selection (which they all made sure to point out after we were done watching, and actually only my sister and myself made it all the way through it the parents evacuated not long after the first gory scene), and needless to say we were all shocked at what we were watching. My mouth literally dropped open and stayed that way until the end. I didn't know how to feel after I viewed all the cold-blooded gruesome murder scenes followed by Bateman's even colder reactions to them. Yes, the humorous actions like talking about music choice was quite funny but I was bracing myself for whatever was to come next, after all I really had no idea. It was a very realistic performance from Bale, which has now forever changed my visual image of him as an actor. I had no idea he had such range, such talent. I will forever be a fan. He really was Bateman, I got chills just watching this character, listening to him speak. But I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They were all so materialistic and selfish it was hard to feel empathy for them.Perhaps, one day I will brave viewing it again so I can really gauge the overall movie but for now I'm content with knowing I've seen it. The main thing I remember when I think about ""American Psycho"" is man, Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman was one scary SOB. Maybe I'll read the book first then watch the movie. This film definitely takes you outside the typical movie goer comfort zone so be prepared for anything.

A dense and bizarre psychological thriller,"Welcome to the mind of Patrick Bateman: Wall Street broker, fine diner, playboy, oh and serial killer extroadinare. Bateman claims only part of himself is based in humanity and similarly, only part of this film is based on reason or sanity.""American Psycho"" is easily one of the top five most deranged films of all time. Those with a taste for the bizarre and an interest in the abstraction of realism will find it great, those who prefer movies grounded in, well, something, will at the very least be amused by the perverse nature of the plot and Bateman's psychotic character.Christian Bale does some pretty great work with Bateman, giving us a very dissociative identity look to the clearly insane killer, showing him as very cold and crafty while also emotional and irrational. His character jumps all over the place and Bale really has the look and skills to play all those kinds of characters.I have to say that while I like Mary Harron's visual choices with the film, overall I don't know if we got deep enough into the meddle that is this plot and the cavernous mind of Bateman. The thin line between reality/imagination, sanity/insanity is very clear, but the social commentary is sort of overshadowed by the film's taste for the absurd. I definitely think there's richness, but there is a lot of thickness too.I suppose if you come at this film with a more abstract perspective than a desire to sort things out and make sense of them, you'll find more things to enjoy about the film other than Bateman's philosophical conversations about sellout recording artists while he indulges in one fantasy or another. It's strange, and while strange is good, strange also needs to be handled a bit more thoughtfully than in ""Psycho.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I have to return some videotapes. (Or Netflix and...Kill?),"My Rating : 9/10Christian Bale is PERFECT as Patrick Bateman.Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people.""'American Psycho' is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is : Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality. People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Bateman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair. It's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.Highest Recommendation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant adaption of a very transgressive novel,"I remember when the novel American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis was first released. It caused huge amounts of controversy on account of its scenes of extreme violence which were considered to be very misogynistic. So much so, that someone even worked out that an anagram of the author's name was 'to sell be nastier'! I ended up reading the book myself and it is true that the acts of violence get progressively more and more extreme and grim, they are disturbing for sure. But it was also equally true that this was a highly satirical work of the blackest comedy.The film version came along after quite a long genesis and naturally it got people wondering how such a book could possibly be made without being banned in almost every territory on Earth. As it turned out, the film version was a very clever interpretation of the novel which wisely understood that it could not possibly depict the violent excesses of the novel in their undiluted form but instead deftly finds ways to get around this. The ultimate result in my view is one of the few examples where the movie matches up to the novel.Set in the late 80's Manhattan the film centres on Patrick Bateman, who by day is a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who is obsessed with success, fashion and expensive restaurants, and who by night is a serial killer. By focusing on this character the story is perfectly positioned to become a satire of 80's America and the greed and selfishness that is synonymous with certain subcultures of that era. Bale himself is emotionally sterile, he has lots of money, an expensive apartment and a beautiful fiancé but he is utterly shallow and devoid of taste. Some of the funniest scenes focus on these aspects of his character such as when he hilariously offers up his opinions on his favourite music, giving detailed, yet inane, analysis on the very mainstream 80's acts Phil Collins, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News. In another brilliant, telling scene Bateman and several of his peers compare business cards; as Bateman eyes each, practically identical, card you can sense his discomfort that his card might not be 'the best'. This scene is presented like it's a highly suspenseful revelation from a thriller and is played completely straight. That's what makes it so funny because it is negligible subjects such as the font of a business card that truly are the things of paramount importance in the world of Bateman and his cronies.It has to be said here that Christian Bale in the title role is nothing short of a revelation. It's one of my all-time favourite performances from any actor and it really showcases what a brilliant talent he is; he completely nails this character in a way that honestly feels like it could not have been improved by anyone else. Much credit also must go to director Mary Harron who has taken on a pretty challenging project in trying to adapt such a novel. There is no question in my mind that she has succeeded better than could ever have been expected. The film has to tone things down for sure but it still contains some pretty disturbing scenes nevertheless; but the focus is more squarely on the satirical elements of the story and those are explored very well indeed. In the final analysis, I would recommend both reading the book and watching the movie, as both are very high calibre examples of their type.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"not bad, but hardly a classic","There's a lot of talk about this film, basically down to the book presumably.Christian Bale was good, but this was hardly a classic.  It was a little dull actually, as a tale of 80s debauchery and some utterly tragic music - which I thought I'd forgotten about!It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't cross the road to see it.

Patrick Bateman was right,"This was a great movie that only a small handful of people might be able to fully appreciate.  Without going into to details and saying how much I could relate with Patrick Bateman (thereby saying I'm some kind of psychotic killer), let's just say the movie has very intense moments of craziness, yet terrifyingly believable.And Patrick Bateman was right, 'The Greatest Love of All' was Whitney Houston's most powerful song on her debut album.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A dark and violent satire of America in the 1980s.,"American Psycho the novel remains a controversial piece of literature. Though now it's considered to be a modern classic. American Psycho the film turns out to be much less controversial. That's because just about all the coarse language, sex and torture scenes weren't included. Instead director Mary Harron smartly focused on the novel's black comedy and character study. Christian Bale is fantastic in the lead role. Just watch his confession on the phone at the end of the film for proof. The looks he gives, the way he talks and moves, and his appearance are very good. In my opinion he's not quite the ideal Patrick Bateman but he comes very close. The murder chapters in the novel gave it an edge, made it more memorable. The exclusion of most of these murders from the film made the cinematic endeavour tamed in comparison. Let's face it, what's shown in the film isn't anything new for cinema. There are films that are much more disturbing and bloody than American Psycho. In any case the murders would have been hard and costly to film if they were included. With the film's minor budget and the controversy surrounding the novel these scenes weren't attempted. What surprised me most, however, was that fitting actors were cast in the supporting roles. They looked and acted the way they were supposed to. Reese Witherspoon played the role of Evelyn Williams. Very nice. Harron's direction turns out to be good as well. Most novel to film adaptations are junk, but here the results are quite good. Thankfully, Bateman's 1980s music reviews (Genesis, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis & The News) were incorporated into a few scenes. Not in their entirety obviously but some of the best parts are there. The film's comedy is very fine. The story's horror elements are what's best though. Bateman has many characteristics of 1980s society and modern society in general. That's what makes him so important; he just represents the extremes of what people think and how they act nowadays. Even if they don't like to admit it many people resemble Bateman in some way. The soundtrack is, for the most part, upbeat. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula captured the New York scenery that was necessary. It's not an ideal-looking film set in the 1980s but it's not bad. American Psycho the film is not a bad companion piece to the novel. It's an intellectual horror film; one of the best horror films of the last decade in fact. I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Amazing movie,"The film regards the male executive lifestyle with the devotion of a fetishist. There is a scene where a group of businessmen compare their business cards, discussing the wording, paper thickness, finish, embossing, engraving and typefaces, and they might as well be discussing their phalli. Their sexual insecurity is manifested as card envy. They carry on grim rivalries expressed in clothes, offices, salaries and being able to get good tables in important restaurants. It is their uneasy secret that they make enough money to afford to look important, but are not very important. Overall i enjoyed every second of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Christian the Only Saving Grace in This Movie...,"I have to say that Christian Bale as patrick bateman was really good in this movie, his character was complex, yet I was a little confused that he would confess towards the end, seemed against what a sociopath like him may do. I was also let down that there wasn't an ending face off with Willem Dafoe, his part playing the detective investigating Paul Allen's disappearance seemed to fall along the wayside. Also, all the supporting characters weren't very interesting, way too superficial and clueless (even though that was probably the intent here, to show the superficial 80s). Anyways, seems to me that all of the supporting characters seemed forgettable except for the hooker that patrick liked to call ""kristy"", seemed to me she ""got him"" all along but kept it to herself since she had a ""job"" to do.Anyways, one good thing from this is that I look forward to seeing Christian in more films [and who could forget that body from heaven!].",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Epitome Of Iconic,"Pros:
1. Christian Bale (Patrick Bateman) delivers a great performance.
2. The humour, though slightly ridiculous in nature, never feels distracting and it always lands.
3. The costume design, although largely simple, is perfectly elegant and encapsulates the wealthy back-drop nicely.
4. Willem Dafoe (Donald Kimball), Jared Leto (Paul Allen), and Justin Theroux (Timothy Bryce) give stellar side performances.
5. The score does a fantastic job at adding to the comedy moments, whilst also cementing the gritty scenes.
6. The violence is brutal, impactful, and highly memorable - especially the scene involving Paul Allen, or the naked chainsaw run.
7. Patrick Bateman's slow descent into madness is both captivating, and mostly well-done.
8. The subtle critique of the rich and their lifestyles is never overpowering, as well as being deftly handled.Cons:
1. The decline into insanity for Patrick Bateman feels a little rushed, and could have been examined more in-depth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The gold standard,"Captivating and thought provoking work of art. This movie encapsulates the 80s ""yuppie"" culture without feeling like a movie released over 20 years ago.

Apt Title,"Christian Bale lets his dark side out to play in this thriller about a playboy gone delusional. Bale plays the renowned Patrick Bateman but is cast in a much different setting - corporate America. While not given any background as to his psychotic break, Bateman appears to us initially through his stream-of-consciousness, in which we get to hear what is going on inside his head. By day Bateman is the son a corporate mogul, but by night he is fueled by his insatiable carnal and murderous cravings. The corporate world in which he lives in is portrayed as being grossly decadent, full of nothing but materialism and foolish pride. But Bale's intense desire to maintain appearances and be the perfect facade or image of what people are looking for, make him all the more dangerous. Underneath the surface, his hold on reality begins to slip away. His introverted nature cares only for his pride as he competes against his coworkers and fulfills his sexual ego in his relations with several whores. When he loses touch with reality and the consequences of his actions, the blood begins to flow.""American Psycho"" is a unique look at how people have different sides to their personality, some of which are scarily schizophrenic. It gives us a bizarre behind-the-scenes look at a very disturbed individual, much like the film ""One Hour Photo"", although I wouldn't say ""American Psycho"" has as much creepy plausibility. 4/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Delivers Some Shocks, But Ultimately Just Hollow And Boring","Much like its contemporary ""Fight Club"", the film ""American Psycho"" attempts to express dissatisfaction with the status quo of modern society through shocking (and typically violent) means. However, while this intent can be applauded -- sometimes, it's good to shake things up a little -- the execution cannot. ""American Psycho"", for the most part, features unlikable, unsympathetic characters doing unlikable, unsympathetic things to one another, ultimately creating a film that's very difficult to care about . .. or to take seriously.Based on the overrated novel by Bret Easton Ellis, ""American Psycho"" is the story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a young, handsome Wall Street stock broker who's finding it more and more difficult to deal with how utterly hypocritical and fake his life has become. He hates the world so much, he doesn't feel like a real person, so the only way he knows how to feel real is by committing acts of sadistic depravity -- rape, torture, and murder. The ironic thing is, Bateman doesn't try to cover his tracks particularly well -- he almost wants to get caught -- but no one else believes he's capable of such heinous acts; after all, how could such a young, good-looking successful man be such a monster?The problem with ""American Psycho"" lies with the psycho himself -- Bateman. Christian Bale does an admirable job with the character, considering how badly the part is written, but the fact of the matter is that Bateman is never a particularly sympathetic protagonist. Yes, the people he tortures and kills are a bunch of unpleasant, two-faced hypocrites, but considering that Bateman is really no better than they are, there's no way of understanding, let alone condoning, his actions. He also has options besides becoming a serial killer, obvious (and more positive) options.  Think about it -- Bateman's been given more opportunities (money, friends, intelligence) than most people can ever even dream of in his life, and he chooses just to squander them as an Ed Gein-wannabe?  Come on.  Another problem is that Bateman is far too sane. He's nuts enough to think up some incredibly sick stuff to do to people, but he's rational enough to realize what he's doing is wrong. It may not have made him more sympathetic, but it might have made the character slightly more believable if he'd been crazier, thinking that his sick actions were just as rational as the mundane, boring things he did at work. (A subplot involving the idea that Bates isn't actually killing anybody -- all the murders are just in his head -- helps to make the film a little more believable, but not by much.) The result? One mean-spirited person kills a bunch of other mean-spirited people. Who cares?Visually, the film's fine. Director Mary Harron moves the film along at a smooth pace, flipping with great style between false notes of security and genuinely disturbing. However, since the disturbing elements are diluted by the fact that it's difficult to care at all about the characters involved in ""American Psycho"", some tremendous efforts in regards to cinematography and editing get wasted. Ditto the performance of the actors -- as mentioned above, Christian Bale is very good as Bates, Willem Dafoe is good as the criminally under-used private investigator Donald Kimball . . . but no actor or actress on the face of the Earth could ever make any these characters remotely interesting, likable, or for that matter, watchable.""American Psycho"" deserves some credit for trying to be daring, but it's ultimately an emotionally hollow film filled with some oddly gratuitous, clinically detached violence.

Brilliant,"New York, late-1980s. Patrick Bateman is an upwardly-mobile Wall Street investment banker. His life revolves around partying, looking good, sex, drugs, and one-upping his equally ambitious colleagues. However, Patrick hides a deadly secret: he's a brutal serial killer.The book upon which this film is based, American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, is one of the most shocking, graphic and lurid ever written. It's also a telling indictment on modern society, its pressures and superficiality and on pretentious yuppie culture in particular. Due to the graphic nature of the book, adapting it directly into a screenplay would have been impossible without the film being censored into non-existence.Thus, the fact that this film even exists is quite a feat. Even more impressive is how the film manages to retain the powerful themes and profundity of the book. Writer-director Mary Harron creates a powerful, thought-provoking examination of the facades people create and the superficialities of modern society and how this affects behaviour and personalities.Even if you ignore the themes, the film is wildly entertaining and, in spells, hilariously funny in a dark sort of way.Aiding the superb screenplay and deft direction is a spellbinding performance by Christian Bale in the lead role. He inhabits the role and makes Patrick Bateman the quintessential American psycho. He is helped in his endeavours by an excellent supporting cast which includes Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Reese Witherspoon and Justin Theroux.Quite brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Toned down from the novel, but the satire is still intact.","Bret Easton Ellis' novel was thought to be unfilmable, but it's great someone tried, and pulled no punches about it. Sure, some of the more sick and tasteless scenes were omitted, but the tone and biting satire of the piece remains, and that is what's important.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a 1980s Wall Street tycoon in NYC who has it all...and he KNOWS it--good looks, a nice body, loads of money, a penthouse apartment and a rich bitch fiancée (Reese Witherspoon). He's also a psycho suffering from the shallowness, prejudice and personal anonymity in his upscale lifestyle who can't control his homicidal tendencies.This film is initially an assault on yuppiedom and 1980s conservatism (with perfect music score by John Cale and appropriately sunny pop tunes), and although this doesn't necessarily have enough satiric stabs for a feature length movie, it's compulsively watchable nonetheless. In a world of platinum cards, Valentino suits, decadent nightclubs, A-list restaurants and exaggeratedly vapid characters, it's pretty outrageous seeing Bale (who's terrific) stab a bum (""Get a goddamn job!""), axe a coworker, aim a nail gun at the back of his meek secretaries head and, covered in blood, chasing a hooker down a hallway with a chainsaw. He also quotes Ed Gein, watches Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (and porn tapes), and listens to Ronald Reagan lie on national TV about Iran Contra.Like Harron's I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, the movie, no matter how out-there it gets, is grounded by the extremely passionate, uncompromising beliefs of the protagonist. Harron co-scripted with Guinevere Turner (who also appears as a victim). On a side note, the amusing raincoat/murder scene may have actually been borrowed from the film Hollywood CHAINSAW HOOKERS!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"highly original, bale is terrific","Sometimes it's hard for movie reviewers to adequately discuss heavily artistic movies. With so many metaphors and imagery, the films become almost impressionistic in that viewers interpret the meaning so differently.""American Psycho"" fits the description well. The movie is so heavily dosed with abnormal scenes, viewers have to decide for themselves the message being sent.Christian Bale plays a successful businessman in the 1980s with an insatiable appetite for killing. The movie is more of a confession than it is a story, with Bale's character becoming more insane with each passing scene.""American Psycho"" is a bit like ""American Beauty"" in its overwhelming artistic endeavors. What ""American Beauty"" did for suburbia in the 1990s, ""American Psycho"" tries to do for yuppie life in the 1980s. Both try to act as examples of what actually happens behind the facades of those who are rich and successful.The movie also has a pretty remarkable, although underused, cast. Reese Witherspoon, Chloë Sevigny (nominated for an Oscar in ""Boys Don't Cry"") and Willem Dafoe all make appearances in the film, but really not much more than that.However, Bale is spectacular as both a stuck-up yuppie and a psychopathic killer. What makes his performance - and the movie, for that matter - so disturbing is how believable Bale is at playing both parts at the same time, as well as being able to make the transition from one character to another.Another disturbing element of the film is the haunting mixture of comedy with horror. One of the most amusing scenes in the film shows Bale's character becoming angry because of the impressive embossing of his co-workers' business cards. It's humorous, yes, but sickening when combined with the fact that he plans on killing one of the men because of the business card.In spite of some troubling scenes in the film, ""American Psycho"" still has the ability to be a rewarding film for viewers. If for nothing else, it should be praised for stunning originality and terrific acting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

An Idea,"One of the few stories that has managed to age better than its state when it was first left, American Psycho has fermented in our culture in an exceedingly resonant statement that seems to only grow more ironic as Western culture, a whited sepulchre continues to let its mask of sanity slip.The most key message this work bestows is that it is not a film in which the homicidal maniac is caught, defeated, or escaped in the end. It is in fact a menace whose punishment eludes him. He isn't allowed to go anywhere, because he fits exactly right where he is. His menace is drowned out in the lack of sanity and order around him, and it takes titular Patrick Bateman the entire length of the film to realize this.It is not insanity for which you are punished, but awareness.A trail of mayhem long enough to bridge Manhattan to Long Island, it is the story's pivotal device, Paul Allen, who manages to evade the malice once and for all. This is both an illustration of man's oblivious hierarchical preference, and of the inhuman's most cowardly fear to be ousted from its throne of conformity.As a story that becomes eerily more possible by the year, as the leaders speaking from our screens become less coherent, the pop culture we idolize grows more numbing, and the schools we populate grow more depraved, so evolves the inhuman's capacity to camouflage amidst our own declining sanity, and the thrills that he seeks, climbing in metaphysicality and intangibility.In an environment suffocated by its own insatiable lust and animalism, it becomes so much easier to wrap your hands around the throat of the woman without pause, and twist the arms off of a thoughtless doll and drain all of its blood, circulating its pointless life.After all, it is all music, art work beheld to the mind. Reality is just one point of view, from eyes that will only see once, crying for help in words spoken that will never be shared.There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory.I really like this film which I have just viewed for the first time, in spite of its flaws, perhaps those elevate it. But I have to maintain objectivity.This film would have been elevated by better editing and musical score. The music itself and its placement did not seemingly invoke a psychotic state of mind any more than it did an unbearably straight-laced bystander beholding its chaos. It stuck too closely to normality in its attempt to illustrate the world's indifference to chaos where it should have placed a few more moments amplifying the sheer agony and psychosis in which Patrick Bateman resides.The film's understated critical reception is a perfect ode to its point: that you just don't get it because you're standing right in the middle of it.

"""Inside doesn't matter"", the anti-capitalism of yesterday as well as today","At times absurdist comedy, horror slasher, psycho thriller... ultimately a very clever classic film, although it probably misses a lot of content from the novel. Right from the opening credits there's a play on appearances, mistaking juice for blood. Superficiality and the cult of appearances, ""inside doesn't matter"" is a spear through the heart of Judeo-American capitalist society. Monstrous inequality, as portrayed in scenes with a homeless man and a prostitute. People as commodities, which, to be clear, is the same conclusion Pasolini came to when he addressed fascism. All this and much more is successfully presented in scenes such as the one with the personal cards, as sharp as it is hilarious. We are avatars. Chloë Sevigny's character puzzles me, and it's one of the things that might be lost in this film adaptation. The same goes for the detective's hints and the entire last act, of which I have my own theories.The suspense is simple but effective, the horror imagery is sparse but perfectly timed and it's definitely an achievement how seamlessly it combines different tones and rhythms. I'm not sure what to make of the album reviews but I think they were pretty good.I'm so late to the party, I just never felt like watching this, not sure what to expect. It's probably been widely misunderstood, I'm sure feminists view it as an unintentional documentary (to be fair it's worrying how some men seem to like it unironically). In reality the same observations can be made today, they're just as relevant. Yuppies have only changed in a matter of aesthetics, we have the same pill-driven rat race.

A Chilling and Thought-Provoking Masterpiece,"American Psycho is a darkly comedic and disturbing film that explores the psyche of a wealthy, young Wall Street investment banker who also happens to be a serial killer. The film's plot, based on the novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis, follows the character of Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, as he descends into a spiral of murder and madness.One of the most striking aspects of the film is its ability to balance its dark themes with a darkly comedic tone. The film's themes of materialism, superficiality and the emptiness of the yuppie lifestyle are relevant even today and it's also a critique of the 80s culture. The performances from the cast, particularly Christian Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman, are outstanding. His transformation from a shallow, narcissistic yuppie to a deranged killer is chilling.Mary Harron's direction is masterful and the film's score, composed by John Cale, perfectly complements the film's mood and atmosphere. The cinematography by Andrzej Sekula is also noteworthy, capturing the glossy and superficial feel of New York City and Bateman's world.The film's pacing is well-done, with each scene building on the previous one to create a sense of unease and uncertainty. The editing is seamless and the dialogue is sharp, witty and memorable.In short, American Psycho is a film that should not be missed. It is a bold and daring film that has left a lasting impact on cinema and popular culture. The film's themes and performances continue to resonate with audiences today, and it's no wonder it is considered one of the most iconic films of the 2000s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The film with no ending,"I think this film is a bit funny, there are supposed an ending to this and there is no clear explanations of how the person he though had die reappeared, who did it?A very good suspense but lack of strong support for the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Beautiful on the outside - ugly on the inside.,"Well, I finally watched it.. The film has many virtues... but its main character, played by Christian Bale, steals all the attention. The image created by the actor is just amazing. Beautiful on the outside - ugly on the inside.This movie is certainly not about a psychopath. This movie is the personification and elevation to the maximum degree of all the feelings of a deeply unhappy person. A person who has put money rivalry and the achievement of his own superiority over others in the main place in his life. That's why he (Patrick Bateman) is constantly suffering and wants others to suffer the same way. But he is absolutely helpless in this situation, into which he was essentially dragged by society itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Thought provoking...,"I have not read the book upon which this is based, but I kinda get the impression that, as with most book to movie adaptations, corners were cut and sacrifices were made. Hats off to Bale, who was 100% committed to the character, but everyone else feels a bit... one dimensional, which may or may not have been intentional. It's not an essential film by any means, but it is definitely an interesting one...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"The beginning of the downfall, of the horror genre start with this awful porn film.","American Psycho is another one of THOSE movies. You know, the ones with a high-rating that just happen to suck.Lots of people rant about the downfall of horror after 1999 and although I have a lot of favorites from the 2000's I have too say they speak the truth. Horror nowadays is basically bad acting, sprinkled with bits of gore and vulgar language. This horrible movement began with this film.American Phsyco is about a 27 year-old business man named Patrick Bateman. Patrick is popular with his friends, drowns in women every night, dines at the most expensive restaurants and has a very nice business card. But what his co-workers don't know is that his smirk hides the life of a dedicated pshycopath.The films holds your interest for a good while with scenes of gratious gore and plenty of black comedy, but it's not long before we realize that American Psycho is stuck in a time-warp. The same thing happens every day. Patrick goes to work, barely conceals his psychopathic alter ego from his friends, picks up a whore, has sex and then kills the whore. Our reward? To see him do it all over again, except next time with different bland dialouge.AP had potiental, and some bits are interesting. But the final product is quite a mess. Horror fans should at least give it a viewing though. After all, some people enjoy crap. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Magnificent.,"If I'm honest, I'm only here for Huey Lewis. Just kidding... although I do love Huey Lewis. I do love this film too though. It's a rare occasion where I like the film as much as it's source, maybe even more than. Easton Ellis' book is a masterpiece, even more gruesome than what's committed to screen here, but what it doesn't have is Christian Bale. He's on fire here, my favourite performance (he's also great in The Machinist and Le Mans 66). Here though, as Patrick Bateman, the meticulous psychopathic yuppie, he's magnificent. Bateman is cinematic gold, good looking, successful, intelligent and articulate. He's also a stone cold, calculating killer. For an 80s yuppie, that most loathsome of sets, he's oddly captivating, every bit the anti-hero. Narrating as he goes, Bale's voice sounding unnervingly like Easton Ellis... or maybe Easton Ellis sounds like Bale?... or Bateman! Anyway, perhaps it's the world in which he operates and it's depiction that makes this work so well. Hyper-stylised restaurants with pretentious names, minimal apartment layouts, the obsessing over business cards and Bateman's desire to fit in, but his competitiveness not allowing him to do so. This all provides a sleek clean surface for Bateman to cover in blood with devastating effect. He's annoyingly likeable... until he kills a homeless man and his dog. However on the flip side, minutes later, it's Huey time! Gleaming Axe, transparent raincoat and the idiot Jared Leto lured back to Bateman's apartment. Paul Allen (Leto) you see has upset Bateman. He has a better haircut, can get reservations at in vogue restaurant Dorsia, even has a better business card and mistakes him for someone else, as do several others. He's in trouble and it's not long until he's hacked to pieces as 'Hip to be Square' blasts out. This though might be his undoing as private detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is drafted in to find Allen and harass Bateman. He knows something's up, that unmistakable smile meeting Bateman's pouting frown, but their exchanges are more awkward than anything else. It's an odd film, no one is likeable to any degree, sexist Wall Street morons, drugged up socialites. Everyone is vile. There's very little thread to it either, aside Bateman's insecurities. Even the persistent detective feels like a nuisance sub plot to the killing spree. Ultimately it's Bateman's slip into more and more extreme and sadistic behaviour that drives this, with the sight of him running naked and blood splattered through the hallway with a chainsaw and him sweating profusely in designer suits as the minutes pass by being the more notable events. Bateman knows he's coming apart, but his lack of emotions confuse him. As he slides further it's difficult to get a grip if events are real or part of his deepening psychosis. It's chilling in it's pointlessness, but fantastic and makes me want to pick up the book again, but first... I have to return some videotapes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Perfect,"The pacing of the film is remarkable, there wasn't a single point where I felt bored or even the slight bit fidgety. The acting was phenomenal, Bale in particular, the ending was perfectly done left me thinking but not yearning. The film was so good it even managed to make Jared Leto look good, as impossible as that may seem, if you haven't already this film is a must see, I feel as though if not for controversy and the softness of modern society this film would have at least a 9 here on imdb, it's also the little things that make this film impeccable such as leading up to the film Bale followed Batemans exact routine.

heh?,"I just rented this for my husband, and after watching had to ask ""Why?"" Why did we rent it?  Why did HE want to see this?  Why was this bland piece of crud even filmed?  I came here to read other reviews hoping for insight, and found none.The movie is fairly boring and pointless.  There is no plot.  There is no character development.  We don't know why this guy is so nuts, and we aren't made to care.It's not a slasher, the violence is too subtle.  (Well shot, I must admit, but that's the only thing going for it.)  The scariest thing in here is the greasy hair on the actors.  It's not a suspense movie, for there is no suspense.  Others have called it a black comedy, but it's just not funny. Satire?  I don't think so.Other's have recommended that we read the book to understand it.  Utter nonsense.  Movies are made as free-standing adaptations of books, not as supplements.  If I have to go find a book to understand Bateman, then the movie is a failure.  Somebody can't manage to tell a story.The movie just follows around a ""serial killer"" as he goes about his daily life.  We are made to admire his physic, his clothes, his stinking business card...And the business card bit didn't even impress me and I typeset the things for a living!I don't wish to spoil things for anyone who is so out of their mind that they are going to go watch this...  But there is a little insight - a revelation - at the end that just leaves the audience scratching their heads.  Why wasn't this worked into the rest of the movie?

Crazy Or Not? You Decide,"American psycho: what a well-aimed title for film! This film does not concern at all the history of PatrickBaitman, a perverted person at most of you. Patrick is narcissists and is becoming o a symbol of all humans. Really , how many from you have not thought the same for their competitors. Simply into this point enters the mental factor that appears in the film in order not to misunderstand the director. Patrick stops acting like a person but behaves as an animal, he tries to exterminates his enemies and he dominates. Patrick is above everyone. Money determines the relations of persons in this film.

The film remained in the middle because the thoughts will not be late becomes action! However Patrick isn't like the other murderers who have sense what they do. Tragic is that he does not have sense of his actions. he imagines what would want him shelf to become but alas social reality bounds him, he feels oppressed and the imagination is the best medicine in these circumstances, however his imagination is sick or no? Maybe he is afraid to know the true love and resorts to the market love?

A Dark and Brilliant Satire on Society's Dark Underbelly,"""American Psycho,"" directed by Mary Harron, is a bold and unflinching exploration of the dark side of capitalism and the twisted nature of the human psyche. With its razor-sharp wit, exceptional performances, and provocative storytelling, the film stands as a biting social commentary and a mesmerizing cinematic experience.At the center of ""American Psycho"" is Christian Bale's phenomenal performance as Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street investment banker with a disturbing secret life. Bale fully immerses himself in the role, embodying the character's charisma, charm, and chilling brutality. He brings a complex and mesmerizing presence to the screen, portraying Bateman's unraveling psyche with both intensity and nuance.The film's screenplay, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' novel, is a darkly satirical critique of the excessive materialism, shallow social dynamics, and moral bankruptcy of 1980s America. Through Bateman's perspective, we are taken on a twisted journey that exposes the hollowness and depravity lurking beneath the glamorous facade of the corporate world.Harron's direction is masterful, balancing moments of shocking violence with moments of dark humor and biting satire. The film's stylish visuals and meticulous attention to detail create a vivid and immersive world, perfectly capturing the superficiality and decadence of the era. The hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack, featuring a mix of iconic '80s tunes, enhances the film's mood and adds to its overall impact.""American Psycho"" is not a film for the faint of heart. It boldly explores themes of identity, obsession, and the blurred lines between reality and delusion. It challenges its audience to confront uncomfortable truths about the human condition and the darkness that can lurk within even the most seemingly polished and successful individuals.What sets ""American Psycho"" apart is its ability to provoke thought and generate discourse long after the credits roll. It invites us to reflect on our own complicity in a society driven by materialism and the relentless pursuit of status and power.In conclusion, ""American Psycho"" is a dark and brilliant cinematic achievement that defies conventions and leaves a lasting impression. With its exceptional performances, sharp writing, and unflinching exploration of societal decay, it stands as a provocative and thought-provoking masterpiece. For those seeking a challenging and intellectually stimulating film, ""American Psycho"" is an absolute must-watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
As realistic as it gets,"American psycho is black comedy  the ""pulp fiction"" of horror/thriller genre with Christian Bale's excellent performance.As believable as it gets!Bale's character Patrick Bateman's does nothing but renting horror movies, bringing prostitutes into his house, having sex and taping it, figuring out what kind of visit card to have, doing presses each morning, doing face masks, taking care of his body's handsomeness. One day he meets Paul Allen. This guy somehow pisses Patrick off. Patrick invites him to see his place and axes. For the fans of the original ""Texas chainsaw massacre 74"", there's a pleasant surprise  it's one of Patrick's favorites here There's an episode Patrick's doing exercises watching it. Later he'll ""use"" the chainsaw himself. Perhaps some of you will find ""American psycho"" lame, but it's really deep. The point is  one day Patrick realizes that he's nobody in this life and when he sees a homeless man with a dog, he is mostly afraid of the same thing will happen to him. And he commits his first murder. I just hated that part. Despite of that scene, the rest of movie has a really slight violence. I say the general part makes black comedy. The scene where Patrick completely naked holding a chainsaw pursues his favorite hooker after she sees the dead bodies is funny. This film can be understood many ways, but the main moral I think is  one don't have to be look like a degenerate, walk with a saw, kitchen knife or an ax under the coat, wear a mask or somebody's skinned face (like Leatherface) to be a maniac killer. The only problem is the seduction of this film. Don't get me wrong, but it has some. Really!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Read the book first,"Now, I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel on which this film is based. I thought I should get that right out in the open to start with.  Because many of you may wish to stop reading this review right now, because I didn't really like American Psycho, but I somehow think that would be different if Ihad read the book first.This film has been out for a week or so now; even earlier if you caught it at the various film festivals around the country.  I rose out my lethargy to write a review of this film after reading Malcolm Knox's excellent article on the book and film in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald Spectrum liftout.  Dig it out and have a read, it is quite interesting.Anyway, as I said, the book looks like it might be a pre-requisite for not only viewing, but enjoying this rather black thriller/comedy.  It uses the old Kubrick standby of making lots of things very white and contrasted, the direct opposite to what is being portrayed in the film.So what do we have?  We have a yuppie, Patrick Bateman, going quietly mad with all the corporate life swimming around him.  And he just snaps and starts killing people.  Or does he?The beauty of this film is that the ambiguity over the deaths is left right until the end, to allow the viewer the chance to fully wallow in the murderous spree Bateman revels in, without the distraction of thinking ""now did that happen or not?"".To give him his worth, Christian Bale is quite good as the killer; a well mannered, precise kind of 80's music loving guy who suddenly starts having a lot of bad days.He typifies in all of us perhaps what we would like to do in real life.  Who can honestly say that at some point in their lives they haven't wanted to kill a work colleague?  Without getting too much into Monty Python territory here I will leave it at that.As I said, I truly believe an appreciation of the book is important to the enjoyment of this film, even if you just read some well researched reviews of it first.

"Fascinating, Ambiguous Film Echoes Hitchcock and Lynch","In a world where appearances are everything and a man's status is determined by the typography, watermark, and paper quality of his business cards, lurks an empty shell of man, who is either falling deeper into madness or satisfying his intense blood lust through a series of brutal murders. Such is the ambiguity of this fascinating film that it easily stands up to repeated viewing if only to explore what is real and what is illusion. Patrick Bateman, who is a distant relative of Norman Bates in more than name, is a loner surrounded by people with whom he never relates. Although he does not hide from the world like Norman did, Patrick's icy facade, which has been conditioned and pomaded into a mask of normality, shields him from the world as effectively as the remote motel hid Norman. With his mask in place, Patrick Bateman intermingles in a world of interchangeable people, who vie with each other for social position through table reservations at trendy restaurants, the quality of a hair cut, or the fabric of a custom-tailored suit. Money flows from toil-less occupations in a New York milieu, where, as Gordon Gecko in ""Wall Street"" so aptly summed up, ""greed is good."" The Reagan era on steroids, although Bateman's peers comment negatively on the president as they watch him try to explain away the Iran-Contra scandal during a televised speech. The young men's remarks about lying are ironic, when their own lives of sham and deceit are considered.But, under the glistening surfaces, like the depths explored by David Lynch in ""Blue Velvet,"" the being who is known as Patrick Bateman lives another life, possibly in his deteriorating mind or possibly in dark back alleys and designer apartments or possibly in both simultaneously. Simply put, Patrick does not like women, and he does not like rivals, and he is eager to dispense with both through his adept use of gleaming stainless-steel axes or state-of-the-art nail shooters. While Norman Bates had deep-seated problems with sex and evidently did not have physical relations with women, Patrick does have sex with women, who are often paid. Patrick's women become debased objects that he abuses, while he admires his own physique in the mirror. Even in the most intimate act of sex, Patrick does not relate with anyone other than himself. However, unlike Norman Bates, Patrick Bateman does not have a mother complex, in fact, he does not seem to have a mother or any family at all. He is a being with no past, no relationships, and no soul. The role is difficult, and Christian Bale as Bateman is outstanding. The perfection of his looks and physique make him physically ideal for the part. But his performance is more than surface sheen, and Bale disarms the viewer as he slowly escalates from a cool emotionless young professional into a psychotic as the character descends further into his own perverted delusions or manic blood lust. Bale's is a performance as ambiguous as the film.The direction by Mary Harron is excellent as well. Harron wisely focuses on the satire inherent in the screenplay and downplays the violence, which is more often suggested than illustrated. Apparently, she has studied Hitchcock and knows that what the audience imagines can be far more powerful than what they actually see. ""American Psycho"" is a stimulating work that can provide fuel for heated discussion about what actually does or does not occur. Does the violence exist only in the pornographically violent doodles in Patrick's office agenda or did an unseen protector clean up the evidence of his series of murders? Or both? Like Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" the film swirls downward like dark water into a drain as Bateman is sucked further into madness, which eventually consumes his entire world and draws the viewer in with him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Some Information Missing,"""Are we really in the head of a homicidal maniac?"" is what I was thinking while watching this movie. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) was fastidiously neat, religious about his morning cleaning and exercise routine, and very knowledgeable about his 80's music. The life he was leading-- working in downtown, making good money, going to lunch and dinner at chic places-- was all shallow and mundane. Emotionally he had nothing but rage and indifference. He was almost an invisible man. His fiance didn't listen to him, he was frequently called by the wrong name, and he moved about almost unnoticed. In other words, he had all the markers of a serial killer and serially kill he did. He moved about with frequent narrations to himself which kept us apprised on what he was thinking or feeling, yet it seemed as though something was missing. I think some crucial information was missing at the end which could've helped greatly with understanding --my understanding anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Did He or Didn't He?,"I haven't read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis (no relation, thankfully), but now that I've watched the movie I feel the book  might help.  There's no possible way to figure out what director Mary Harron has put on the screen, and perhaps not even Mr. Ellis himself could explain it.  Or Harron either, for that matter.  Christian Bale plays a young, successful Wall Street executive whose cup of hate wildly runneth over, and he kills indiscriminately.  Or does he?  Are we only glimpsing his bloody and hideous fantasies?  I tend to think the latter is the case, because he leaves a vast trail of bodies behind him and yet he continues to pursue his usual lifestyle and nobody suspects him of anything.  Well, detective Willem Dafoe (completely wasted) thinks he may have been involved in the first real/false murder, but he disappears from the story early on.  No one else pays any attention to the endless mayhem.  Don't think for an instant that Harron has set up a Jekyll-and-Hyde character.  Bale is 95% Mr. Hyde and yet none of his friends ever seems to wonder what's wrong with this weirdo.  Unless, of course, he's imagining his own demeanor too.  This is a continuing problem with the plot and with Harron's direction: has she any purpose other than to confuse?  Is that a worthy goal for a director?  The story reaches a peak of mindless misdirection in the case of a hooker who ""needed surgery"" after her first ugly encounter with the Bale character.  They meet again.  Does she run away screaming?  Not in this movie.  Once more he entices her with money and soon he gives her a check.  A check?  I burst out laughing.  On another occasion, in his apartment, he sneaks up behind an unsuspecting female guest and has the muzzle of a monster gun within an inch of her skull.  He's psyched himself up to kill -- but suddenly his phone rings.  Several times. He freezes there, patiently waiting to hear the incoming message.  Yes, I think we're definitely dealing with a disordered mind.  Harron obviously loves gore -- real or imaginary -- and wallows in it throughout.  Bale is a fine actor and deserves far better.  If the movie poses the question, ""Are these real or imaginary murders?"" -- I don't have an answer.  If they ARE real, the movie is inept beyond belief.  But after spending two chaotic hours with this repellent thing, I think the American psycho should have considered adding director and writer to his hit list.

Almost perfect despite the ugly storyline,"Oh, it could have been a very very bad movie indeed. The infamous novel is very horrifying and contains the most graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem I have ever read. Oliver Stone, who was to direct, probably would have made a much darker movie with the violence turned up at least a notch or two.As it is, Mary Harron has chosen not to be too graphic but stays tasteful all through the picture, even when the action gets bloody. And there is still plenty of gushing gore and since you don't see everything, the impact of the murders, when they arrive, is even more immediate. However, don't expect a slasher movie.But at the center of it all is Christan Bale as Patrick Bateman. Shallow, self-aware, greedy, narcissistic and completely nuts! As a portrait of a man who has no soul and only exists when he can experience the `high' of murder or have the most stylish business card in his firm, his performance is truly chilling. He is machine, not human, who delights in others pain and degradation, except for one scene in his apartment with his sweet secretary. When he realizes that a murderous rage may be imminent he tells her to get home because `he might hurt her'. Hmmm, in what sense one may wonder? Just kidding. Anyway, at that point, there is a subtle sense that he MIGHT be salvaged by this girl and that he longs for a life that is real.Christian Bale was apparently not a first choice for the part but seeing him here I doubt that anyone could be a better choice (certainly not Leonardo DiCaprio). He is excellent. Actually I didn't know he had it in him and thought of him as a child actors who's work as an adult had been, at best, indifferent. Clearly playing the part of Bateman is a challenge and had American Psycho been a turkey, it could most certainly had been one nail in his career coffin. Brave man! The other parts are also well casted and well played, but it is Bale who has the center stage.Praise must also go to Mary Herron who handles this unpleasant story in a manner as to say: Look, Bateman is a man just like most other men but he just go a little bit further. The script that she and Guinevere Turner has fashioned is an extremely interesting look at male behavior. However, if there is something amiss, it is the lack of someone remotely sympathetic. Chloë Sevigny is the exception but she is too bland to be really interesting. All the others are people you would cross the street to avoid! That way you are never very upset when one of Batemans victims `gets it' because you don't really care. But otherwise excellent!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Pretentious, silver spoonfed crap","After hearing rave reviews from questionable sources, I watched this movie and found myself disgusted.  To be quite honest, there was one scene (chainsaw chase) that was interesting, as well as thrilling, although it did nothing to help the rest of the film.  Although I have not read the novel, I plan to, but the silver screen version seems to have been a method of trapping critics and film snobs into praising a movie that was chock full of hammed-up acting and ""let's see who we can confuse"" direction.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This movie was wicked!!!,"This was a wicked movie. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Christian Bale played a very convincing psycho. I loved his evil stares and the way his mouth was always formed into a straight line. I watched the TV version on TBS so I didn't see that much violence and gore but I saw enough to know what was going on. I didn't quite fully understand what his motive was for killing but I could tell that just about everyone he killed was annoying and he really couldn't stand them. I thought he he did a good job of not letting everyone know about the murders and keeping them a secret. Patrick Bateman was very scary at times. Especially when he was chasing the girl with the chainsaw and he was covered in blood. I really don't have a whole lot to say about ""American Psycho"" except that I thought it was a great horror movie and that the ending could've been better. But Christian Bale was very good in this one and his role was convincing. I recommend this one to anyone who likes this genre of movies. But I'm gonna go now and thanks for reading my review!

Kinda Funny; Kinda Scary!,"American Psycho was a little too dirty. I didn't enjoy seeing so many nude shots with the prostitutes or the bed scenes with that pot-head chick Bateman was having a affair with, Some of that could have been cut out or shortened, but for the most part I enjoyed this movie. Some scenes were really funny. I feel bad for thinking that Bateman's behavior was funny, because the film isn't categorized as a dark comedy, but there are plenty of scary scenes. Bateman is charismatic, intelligent, classy, and frightening. I applaud Christian Bale for taking on this role. Lately he's been casted as sadistic, scary characters that audiences can't help but take an interest in.I can't wait to see him as Batman. He'll play it deliciously. I hope he plays the sadist again - he does it so well - not that I don't love his singing, dancing, Disney side (because I do).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Misunderstood film,"American Psycho has more than a touch of irony and isn't really about murder.It was an homage to the extreme excess and greed of the 80s, with no one at the top accountable.

Better than the book,"I read the book when it was first published I think in the early 90s and was frankly horrified by it being as it is a catalogue of truly awful acts so brutal I can't mention them here for fear of getting banned from IMDB. Seriously, it really is that bad. When I heard they were going to make a film based on the book I was very surprised, how could they possibly film this? Cleverly the film makers emphasize the satirical elements, which although present in the book didn't register with me at the time of reading so traumatized was I by the violence. As the story of Patrick Bateman is a satire on late 1980s Wall Street the film does a better job of telling that story than the book on which it is based. Quite some achievement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Ridiculous and Not Nearly as Intellectual Meaningful as Many Think,"I can't think of one redeeming quality of this movie. I have no idea where people see comedy in it. There's nothing fun about it either as at least half of the movie is just a bunch of businessmen booking reservations trying to flex which restaurant they are going to. For this movie to succeed for me Bale's character needed to be at the level of a Hannibal Lecter level villain and he's just nowhere near that.I understand the movie is trying to send some message about big business corporate culture but it just pushes this too far making it not at all believable. A little subtly would have gone a long way.I've read about how it also is trying to send a message about human nature. This claim to me is just people trying to appear intellectually superior by finding meaning in a movie because it's consider a classic when there is none to be found. The only thing it actually proved about humanity is that there are highly successful, affluent people that can be as deranged as anyone else.Even if you were interested in Bateman's twisted mind the ending makes it unclear what even actually took place and what was fabricated in his mind . It really just made me feel silly for watching it through to the end.The only character I found compelling was Dafoe's character and ultimately he was quite inconsequential as well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"The story has its imperfections, but Bale made me forget about that","Of course I already had heard of this movie before, but it took me until today to finally give it a try. I knew that this was a movie about a serial killer and in my opinion there is no movie with such a subject that reaches the high standard that once has been set by ""The Silence of the Lambs"". But it was my brother who told me that I shouldn't hesitate. He's an absolute fan of this movie and he was convinced that I would like it too.During the day time Patrick Bateman appears to be a normal young man working on wall street at his father's company. But he has a dark secret. At night he turns into a homicidal maniac who likes to kill for fun. He doesn't really need a reason to murder, but it always helps when he is extremely envious of for instance his fellow co-workers. But he also murders out of pure hatred or complete insanity. Gradually his insanity increases, making him kill more than 20 people, ranging from models to homeless people, co-workers, friends, and anyone else who stands in his way. The only person that seems to be save for him is his secretary Jean, although she too almost becomes one of his victims. But is all this actually true, has it really all happened or is it just a product of his imagination, a psychotic delusion. No-one really knows, certainly not Patrick Bateman...I guess there are two ways of seeing this movie. You can either see it as a pure slasher movie full of gore or you can see it as a satirical thriller that tries to show how empty and shallow society can be. I prefer the second opinion, as it is clear to me that Patrick Bateman may well be a typical yuppie from the eighties, but still feels relevant today. Murders still happen and many people still don't seem to care all that much about it, as there are always enough people who will never be missed by anyone.In the end, this certainly isn't a perfect movie. There are just too many imperfections in the story for that. It's for instance a bit slow and sometimes you don't really have the feeling that the movie is telling anything that you haven't seen a few minutes earlier. But it's thanks to the wonderful performance of Christian Bale that I'm willing to forget about that. What he did with the role of Bateman can't really be improved by any other actor. He's absolutely stunning in his role and was by far the best actor in this movie, even though the others did a good job too. It's thanks to Bale's performance that I liked this movie and that's the reason why I give this movie a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I Am Speechless,"I had told myself I would watch this movie after reading the novel first, but I just couldn't wait any longer. I'm glad I did.American Psycho is a masterpiece. So many people could interpret this movie as something and the next person could interpret it as another. For me, it's a story of a man living in his desires that succumb into a nightmare, but a nightmare he accepts. He keeps himself in order, making sure he is clean and yet he could never discard the filth inside him. A man draped in lies. A man draped in a facade. He is Patrick Bateman.I have never seen such a horrible character in fiction. He is cynical, sick, wretched and yet you can't help but want to see Patrick win.

Not what the title suggests!!!,"I understand that instead of the Texas Chainsaw, Friday the 13th or Halloween type insaneness, the movies gone out to try and be clever. But maybe, just maybe it was a bit too clever. The title leads you to think you're in for a real gore-fest type massacre when really it's nothing like that at all. You have to stay on the ball and thinking throughout and that's not really what those kind of people like to be do. So I can see it losing a few fans there. Secondly for the people who do like to combine intelligence with gore, it may have taken the intelligence thing it has going a bit far, thus confusing people. No doubt there will be those people in the middle who it was just right for and that's great. But the question that must be asked is, is there a high enough percentage of those people?Personally, I was unsatisfied at the end. But it's the type of movie that if you took 5 people who'd just seen the movie, sat them down and asked them what they thought, they'd probably all give you a different opinion. Christian Bale truly is great in it, so no matter what I'd recommend giving it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What  a Pretentious Movie,"I must admit to being extremely disappointed with this movie. The mis-anthropic message could not be seen as a metaphor for the 1980's 'greed is good' capitalist mentality, or as a commentary on prevailing western sensibilities. Rather it is self indulgent at best, coating a soft pawn movie with the veneer of social examination.The characters are 2 dimensional with no empathic qualities, The dialogue staged and contrived; although the acting is good you cannot polish a turd.If I had been a 13 year old boy watching this movie I would have been impressed by American Pscho's over-simplistic message, as a man I am not. 'Wallstreet' delivers a far more clever and concise commentary on the phenomenon of the 1980's.

"Love the book, love the movie","American Psycho was always a book that I wanted to see made into a movie. I thought it would be amazing to see Bret Easton Ellis's masterpiece (in my opinion) make it on to the screen. I wasn't so sure, however, of how Christian Bale would do as Patrick Bateman. I didn't see him in the role at all. I don't know whom I thought would be better, but it wasn't him.I was stupid. Bale is fantastic, and rises to what is quite a challenge, extremely well. For me, his portrayal of Bateman is bang on the money. His self-obsessed, emotionally detached nut-job is every bit as unhinged and chilling as Ellis's creation.The movie itself is good, and does something very clever. It takes Ellis's gore factor away slightly, not much, but slightly, and puts a little more suggestion in.What's also in there, is the dark, dark humour of the book, which can be lost when some novels get the Hollywood treatment.All in all, a very good movie.

Christian Bale's Chilling Performance,"""American Psycho"" is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron and based on the novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis. Starring Christian Bale in the lead role as Patrick Bateman, a successful Wall Street banker with a sinister double life, the film is a darkly satirical and disturbingly accurate portrayal of the excess and emptiness of the yuppie culture of the late 80s.The film's sharp social commentary on consumerism and materialism is one of its strongest aspects, with its characters' shallow obsession with appearances and material possessions serving as a metaphor for the moral decay of society. Bale's performance as Bateman is nothing short of mesmerizing, as he perfectly embodies the character's charming, yet disturbingly sadistic personality.In terms of cinematography, the film is stylish and visually stunning, with its sleek and modern aesthetic perfectly capturing the excess and emptiness of its characters' lives. The film's soundtrack also deserves special mention, with its use of popular 80s tracks adding an additional layer of commentary on the superficiality of the era.While the film's social commentary and stylish tone are major selling points, it must be noted that its graphic violence and explicit content may not be for everyone. The film's depiction of murder and mutilation is integral to the plot and commentary, but it may be too intense for some viewers. The film's unflinching and provocative nature is a testament to its impact and effectiveness, but it may also turn some audiences away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Emh..........well..........eh.........WHAT THE HELL was that?,"I do not quite know what the hell I saw the other night, watching this film, which is about a yuppie in the eighties who's got it all. He's got a good job in which he needs to do nothing, for his father owns the firm; he's got money; friends; a beautiful girlfriend plus he looks rather well. But somehow all of that has gotten into his mind and seriously screwed him up. He is just emotionless, greedy and narcissistic. That is about everything this film is about, it is a movie about the lifestyle of an eighties yuppie. There is not much more to it, because the film lacks excitement, graphic display of Bateman's deeds and explanation. I think the latter can be obtained by watching the film for the second time, but for the rest, you'll probably have to read the book. What killed' this movie though was it's lack of excitement (fear of Bateman or even thrills when you start wondering what he is up to next). This film is no classic at all, though I think it could have been, if Stanley Kubrick had directed it (even in the same way), for it reminds me a hell of a lot of A Clockwork Orange and because everything Kubrick made is regarded as a masterpiece (although I often do not get why). Without having read the book I can advise you, read it first and then, maybe watch this movie, for the special think about this story could not even be screwed up by the director, whereas the rest could be. Anyway the movie was pretty vague and somewhere between good and bad, which means it was somewhere between a 4 and a 8, so averaging those two grades this one gets a6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A very good movie, and little like what you may have heard","I must first confess that I read the book before I saw the movie and loved it. And certain parts of the movie were better than the book. I like the way the way Mary Harron took out a lot of the gore and made it more satirical sounding than the book did (you have to really think about the book to realize that it is a satire, while the movie made it obvious). For example, in the book Patrick Bateman talks about music that he loves in chapters that are seemingly just thrown into the book, while the movie makes them integral parts of certain scenes. Also, the fact reminds that this movie is pro-feminist, regardless of what has been written about it. Mary Harron, the director is mocking the way men act, and seems to say that homicidal rag is something more men would turn to if given the chance. While I don't recommend this movie for everyone, it is is still a very solid movie. Christian Bale is spectacular, Reese Weatherspoon plays her role well and Matt Ross is excellent as well. The other actors are somewhat forgettable, but I still give this movie an 8 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A satire on the psychotic nature of big business and the viciousness of Wall Street.,"Patrick Bateman is a serial killer....rather an obvious one.

Brilliant Bale delivers in socially expectant drama,"Patrick Bateman (Bale) lives and works on Wall Street, projecting an image of perfection in his busy schedule, but at night, he descends into his own experiments and fantasises.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman in this Mary Hannon picture and with his sophisticated approach to the needy and greedy protagonist, do we viewers dive into a world where social class is everything to be successful.As the film gets under way we see the central character describe himself as an intelligent being, a man who knows what and who he likes and aims to keep it that way. Starting at a posh restaurant with his colleagues discussing the local works trends and social gossip do we get a picture of what working on Wall Street is like.American Psycho is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel, and the author has clearly a colourful picture on the minds of the highly prestigious workmen in America. This screenplay is marvellous, owing to the fact that Bale's character is so well thought out; a protagonist to envy and to identify with. His work is tame; his colleagues are infuriating whilst his fiancée annoys the living daylights out of him.But he continues down the same path owing to the fact he must project an important image; an image of power and success. The attitude of Bateman is quite remarkable. His self loving success driven mindset is staggering, and the Dark Knight actor is frankly remarkable in this role Many films of course look at social class workings or stereotypes. From the significant upbringing and destiny surrounding Eddie Murphy in Trading Places to the way strangers and criminals look at Sidney Poitier's cop in In the Heat of the Night but with this 2000 release, you get a significant feeling that the way you walk and talk generally affects you persona and your presentation to others, which arguably decides the fate of this film.Bateman's constant conformity to the general high standards of Wall Street leave him wanting more and when he is at home watching porn, experimenting with face products or doing his exercise regimes, he descends into a world of madness, and this is where the film drives into exciting mystery.After Paul Allen shows him a business card and forgets his name once too often, Bateman introduces him to his axe, and after this arguably frightening sequence, the character base is set and the expectancy to see Bateman's next move is anticipation of the highest degree.Honestly even as the caped crusader Bale has never been more impressive. His depiction of this character is completely accurate and interesting. He derives from a standard of madness and makes it fascinating psychologically whilst oddly, surprisingly comic at various points. The character is a joy; a privilege to watch and observe and the madness may give Hamlet a run for his money. A must watch for the sheer brilliance of the character development and Bale's performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The worst waste of money in the year 2000,"I've seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series and many other movies that were more gruesome so the bloodletting in the film is not what irked me.  I've seen dark comedies like Very Bad Things, and I actually found them enjoyable.  Also, I've seen Leaving Las Vegas and Chasing Amy and enjoyed them immensely in spite of the strong sexual content.  This movie didn't really deliver the goods on any level for me.  The dialogue was uninspired and completely ridiculous at times.  Yes, it was satirical regarding the Wall Street mentality of the 1980's, but it was about 5 minutes of average material stretched into 2 hours of bad cinema.  The ending of the movie was truly horrific (and I don't mean bloody or shocking--it was just plain stupid).

suspenseful thriller filled with dark humor,"American Psycho is a suspenseful thriller in which dark humor prevails over probability. The film works thanks to Christian Bale who gives an intriguing, convincing performance being, on a par with that in The Mechanist, the best in his career. His villain is incredibly degenerate due to the sick, aristocratic community in which he lives. His main hobby, apart from murdering of people in various ways, is listening music and talking about it, which leads to many hilarious situations in the film. What was also shrewdly used in the script are seemingly minor obsessions, like owning prettier business cards. The flick tears to shreds wealthy aristocratic environment which is responsible for arising sick atmosphere among people occupying the top positions as well as puts a question about individual's responsibility. Thus, the message is very similar to that in Woody Allen's Match Point. However, in American Psycho black humor is used instead of metaphorical meaning.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The original Norman Bates was a pussycat,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Relatively speaking, that is.This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas. Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial. This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.(And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review): Yeah, RIGHT. Who cares.Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering. Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people. If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself. Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught? Huh? (Resuming control of my review and droning on): ...although the terms ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for ""psychopath"" to be reserved for violent sociopaths. Another reason ""psychopath"" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...(Again taking over): Shut up. Who cares who it starred? The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath. We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System. We are NOT intent on self-destruction. Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it. Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught. And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business? I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on ""Christie""? Give me a break.Oh. You think that it hit her while still running, huh? Ha, ha, ha! Nice shot, dude.(Again resuming control): ..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending. We know that he is going to be caught and yet...(Coming back out of the screen...): We know nothing. The cops are stupid. Nobody will believe...(Shoving him back in...): ...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience. This is the fast lane. Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life? Isn't this the essence of escape? Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended. And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick. It's a satire of sorts. It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman. The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny. Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, ""Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!"" Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath. I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue. Clearly Reese's character did not.Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary. The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person. The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker. Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook. (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it. I wonder who that was. Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?) Finally: real life irony. The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999).

...,"Holy hellI've seen three truly great character studies in my life. A clockwork Orange, there will be blood, and one film that combines the best elements of both... American Psycho. I am having a very hard time looking where to begin on this, beside the obvious, but I'll leave that for last. The cinematography is subtle and meaningful. The soundtrack is electric and complements the dark comedy incredibly well. All of the performances are great. But the two things that make this great are the satire and Bale as the lead. This film is able to make a mockery of 1980s consumerism and the elite of the world in such a hilarious way that if nothing else, this movie is effectively a parody. But Bale is really the one who ties it all together. Without spoiling anything, he is able to play essentially a new character in every scene, feeling like an alien trying to react to social interactions like a Normal person would, but when you get those quick glimpses into the real Patrick Bateman... oh man.

I don't really know how to explain it but the whole vibe of the movie is exactly that. I was very confused while watching this because the script and the direction is actually meant to be fluid in the way that it's never really clear if everything we see on camera did actually happen or is happening only in the protaginist's head. It is a movie that can be interpreted in multiple ways. I thought it would have been a more straightforward story but the reality is different.

Nothing in the whole story bears any semblance to reality. I doubt that any research whatsoever was done into what goes on in the mind of a psychopathic killer - this one had literally nothing in common with any of the real-life ones mentioned in the movie.

American Psycho - A Classic from 2000,This film is definitely a cult classic and very memorable. Christian Bale does a great job of acting here. The title describes the atmosphere of the movie.

Patrick Bateman after Norman Bates,"Toxic Masculinity, this term can be attributed to the title of American Psycho because the movie talks about the narcissistic, chauvinist, and even psychic character of the protagonist (don't know whether he is the protagonist or the antagonist). It's about the life arc of Patrick Bateman, who is leading a business life, a man who is always conscious about his appearance and outfits turn into a man with the above said 'qualities'. The film is going in a steady, clean way where Patrick Bateman is there in 99 percent of the scenes. It's all about the character change of Batemen when he is with his colleagues and when he is with prostitutes. He is so obsessed with sex, even wild or rough sex and he loves to make his counter gets hurt. The movie is shaped through that characterization and the ultimate progress of that characterization reveals the climax of the movie. That is the shocking moment in the movie. Christian Bale did a brilliant job while portraying Patrick Bateman and I feel horrified by that performance. Mary Harron, the director, explicitly uses the image of sex throughout the film without any hesitation. She along with the writer perfectly constructed the character of Bateman, which is an inspiration for novice writers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Movie or audience?,"I think ""American Psycho"" will succeed because repeat viewers will go to the film to watch premier viewers for their reactions to the shocks, ranging from loud and clear racism, sexism, homophobia and oozing violence. This is a phenomenon familiar to fans of the ""Halloween"" genre. My showing began with a young 20-something couple walking out after the characters made some nasty remarks about a Jewish colleague. (Later, I was happy for them. They might have needed resuscitation if they had stayed.)Actually, after observing the many under-30's at the showing I attended, I understood that the dark humor about 1980's Manhattan was wasted on them. They seemed to react to the graphic violence, but they did not laugh at all. Perhaps these times are too similar for them to those in the film?I lived in Manhattan during the period of the movie. I was frequently embarrassed by my own lonely laughter during the film. I was getting Ted Bundy looks myself after a while. It was worth the humiliation. I really did enjoy most of it.As a film, however, it seemed to get sloppy at its end.

An intelligent look at the book that couldn't possibly be filmed. . .,"The problem with Ellis's book was one with the public.  People couldn't get past all of the violence and sex to see the underlying messages and themes of the book.  American Psycho, the novel, was a satire on the decadent lifestyle of the 80's and its trappings.  Of course the consequences were taken to extremes but its point was well made.  American Psycho, the movie, is a well done adaptation of the novel with only a few shortcomings.  Unlike the terrible movie, Less Than Zero, American Psycho stays true to the general fell and ideas of the novels. The sex and violence, while not completely removed, was not as explicit in the book.  Bale is superb as Patrick Bateman, although the Bateman that I envisioned from reading the novel was quite different and I suppose that was the main flaw of the film for me.  While reading the novel, Bateman was much more sinister to me, much more evil.  In the movie, Bateman seems to understand that what he really wants is to be accepted and to be seen as the best.  In the book, he was much more sure of himself.  All in all, I thought the movie was really well done, however it will face the same problems as the novel.  People won't be able to get past all of the violence and sex to see the underlying messages and themes of the film.

Dark comedy that is worthwhile...,"1st watched 3/9/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Mary Harron): Dark comedy that is worthwhile but loses it's thunder in the last ½ hour due to the filmmakers turning us in strange directions. The film is basically about a 80's yuppie who has a secret obsession to kill while spouting off reviews of popular 80's music. Christian Bale is wonderful in the twisted role of a VP for a wall street firm who knows how to say all the right things and has the right acquaintances but can't stand it when one of his comrades has a better business card than his. This jeolousy and overly-perfect perspective leads him to kill those who he thinks deserves nothing and anyone who might get in the way of his own ego. He loses his ability to be cool around all this after a detective starts asking him questions about the disappearance of a colleague that he killed. At this point in the movie the dark comedy tries to take a direction towards whether or not Bale's character will make a mistake and be caught. This is where, in my opinion, the movie goes downhill. His ""don't care about anyone"" mentality is challenged but is never really taken anywhere. The way the movie ends also doesn't make sense and we're left with a good movie that could have been much better. The movie is unique in it's dry attempt to make fun of this yuppie generation and Bale's portrayal lifts the movie above mediocrity but the lack of a good conclusion lessons the films impact. Still, it's a movie to watch and enjoy for the most part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

AMERICAN PSYCHO (DIDIER BECU),"A good friend of mine don't wanna see the movie just because he thinks the film can only be a letdown because of the brilliance of the book, I myself never read the book so I can watch it without prejudices that a good book never can match the equality on celluloid. The story is known...a great businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) lives a double life : at office he's the arrogant businessman who cares about the design of his visitcards but outside he is a serial killer (prostitutes are his fave targets) and his life that is dominated by designers and extreme care for the way you look like, but he also is addicted to pornmovies and yuppiemusic (before he starts killing someone, he first reviews a cd...all yuppiemusic like Whitney Houston, Genesis and Huey Lewis And The News). We all know our Patrick Batemans in our world (perhaps your manager huh?) and Christian Bale plays his role in a perfect way, you just hate him from the early start and you just hope he'll be caught as soon as possible, perhaps it's jealousy. The film itself is filmed like the decors Bateman lives in, all pretty cold and no real depth (the kind of yuppies who pretend to be it while their life is just one bulb), never that violent (except the images afterwards) and tons of sex...and for oldies like us, great songs from the eighties!

Well worth watching,"American Psycho really struck a chord with me when i first saw it at the theater when it came out in 2000. And after seeing it a couple of times more on DVD i can say that the fascination still lives.I wouldn't call myself a fan of the Brett Easton Ellis book that this movie is based on. While i felt the book did have it's points, i was put off by the overly crude descriptions of violence. While i understood the points Ellis' was trying to make i thought it was excessive and not at all to my tastes. Also the book became somewhat tedious in it's descriptions of pop culture and 1980's phenomena.The movie however i feel has removed much of what put me off with the book. The brutal violence and gore is toned down (but still present enough to get the point through i think) and the references to 1980's culture are more easily and quickly done in the format of a movie. In this way i felt the satire was more pure and focused in the movie, of course many people are likely to think that the experience is diluted because much of the extreme aspects are gone. I do not, however, share this view.The first aspect of the movie that strongly appealed to me was Christian Bale. He's just perfect as the well-cut, rich, successful and utterly insane yuppie Patrick Bateman. The casting overall is excellent, but i must say Bale stands out as something of a sensation.I have seen a lot of discussion on many different message boards about whether the murders in this movie were real, or if they were just a figment of Batemans imagination. My return question is immediately: does it matter? Bret Easton Ellis was on to something when he wrote his book, and that point is further refined here. In a world where every man just cares for himself, and nobody cares about anyone else, it's possible to get away with almost anything. For instance ripping a company apart leaving thousands without a job, or maybe even murder... The idea of the psychopath being allowed to do whatever he pleases without punishment, be it physical or economical harm. To me the concept is what's interesting, not whether he did it or not. The fact that he had fantasies about doing it is enough, the only thing really stopping him was his own inhibitions. Getting away with it was the least of the problems for one who was so inclined.I think that American Psycho will appeal to many people for many different reasons. Some people will see it as plain comedy, others will recognize it more for what it is. I found it interesting and well worth watching, no matter if you have read the book or not. I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hey everyone this movie is set in the '80's!!!,"Four stars is generous. Bale's character is completely plastic. It goes beyond portraying an 80's yuppie into a realm where anyone would recognize that he's completely unstable. There is no subtlety at all. The writers continually force down your throat that this movie takes place in the 1980's in a very inorganic way. It's like ""Yep, we get it already, you've proven your knowledge of 80's pop music."" It's not only Bale's character that's unbelievable, it's every character. Nothing rings true.

Blown away with Christian Bale's performance, who up until then I'd only seen in Nolan's Batman trilogy, which managed to be hilarious, narcissistic, sympathetic and absolutely terrifying in equal measure! The way it's shot is beautiful too, the long wide shots of Patrick's apartment, the night scenes in the back alleys, even the opening scene of Patrick's routine, just lit so well and his apartment is almost too white, in stark contrast to what his night time activities end up looking like.It's so devilishly funny as well, with most of the humour provided by Bale.

A milestone in Christian Bale's career.,"I guess there will be a BEFORE and an AFTER AMERICAN PSYCHO in Christian Bale's career. He was revealed with this film, this performance.

I could not, sorry. The movie is far more ""approachable"" than the book. The adaptation could be compared to THE PERFUME, also a difficult story on paper to put on screen.

"Great Acting, Graphically Violent, Near Miss Overall","""American Psycho"" is purportedly a satire of the 1980s Wall Street culture of greed, but sadly, I don't understand what is being satirized. The characters seem cartoonish, and impossibly venal and corrupted. Is this really the culture of America's big investment banks and its running dogs? After this year's corporate scandals, maybe ""American Psycho"" would be an improvement.Politics and sociology aside, ""American Psycho"" is an uneven film. The acting is superb and Christian Bale's portrayal of the sociopathic young banker, Patrick Bateman, drips cold menace even while ordering dinner. The first two-thirds of the movie are very effective, walking a narrow line between horror and satire. But during the final third, the film changes direction, loses focus, and doesn't finish well.I'm conflicted whether to recommend this movie.

Stylish thriller that ultimately doesn't add up,"This is one of the those movies I like less the more I think about it. I gave it a 7 shortly after I saw it. Not a great movie, a little gratuitous, but with a lot to recommend it. I boasts a top notch cast led by a compelling performance from Christian Bale. It's visually beautiful if at times grizzly. And, for those of us who survived the era, there's a certain perverse nostalgia for New York in the '80's.Having slept on it, however, I had to come back today and pull my vote down to a 6. The strong parts remain, but the weak ones grow more blatant with reflection. I have two major complaints:1) The portrayal of men in the movie is predictably dismal. They're all shallow and horrible and the movie is not without the faintest hint that the men only differ from the homicidal protagonist in the degree of their violence and contempt. I don't know many men like this. In a movie purportedly about the human psyche, such a skewed understanding of the ""norm"" is a substantial flaw.2) Ultimately, it stretches credibility too far. How can he possibly get away with all this? Perhaps I missed something. There's a mistaken identity thread that runs through the movie, but even that doesn't seem sufficient to explain the movie's ultimate outcome.If it wasn't for this site's obsession with ""spoilers', I could go into more detail, but many aspects - large and small - just don't ring true.American Psycho is a stylish thriller worth seeing if only for the magnificent transformation of Bale.

"Worst movie from its year,Bale sucked beyond measures","This is without a doubt the most overrated piece of trash I have seen in my entire life. All this movie had was a guy who killed people for fun\It's hard to summon up enthusiasm for a performance so rooted in bloody banality. I mean, as Patrick, Bale's most emotionally pressing dilemma is: Chainsaw or butcher knife?It's all soooo predictable. Sunday. Monday. Tuesday. Yada, yada, yada. Everything.The book was much better though,but then again it didn't have an overrated Hack like Christian Bale dragging the movie down constantly.This movie was terrible! I found it boring and stupid and the ending didn't make sense at all...definitely would not recommend seeing it! he entire thing is so shallow and masturbatory that it's very hard to care about anything that's happening. Even without a well developed character there was still the possibility that the result would have been entertaining, but the psychotic killer angle was executed without any suspense whatsoever. There never seemed to be any reason for any of the plot developments, and from the very start we are just given a character who wants to kill people for some reason. A Hollywood cheeseball overall. Bad music throughout. Everything felt fake.And Lastly I would like to add,Christian BALE IS THE MOST OVERRATED HACK OF ALL-TIME.PLEASE STOP ACTING AND SPARE US THE TORTURE.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I love it!,"Bret Easton Ellis's ""American Psycho"" is a book and movie that received mixed reviews. While some people adored it, others despised it. When the novel was released, many believed that the author would never make it big again. Nevertheless, I think it's a masterpiece that exhibits Ellis's full range of storytelling skills. Although Patrick Bateman, the protagonist, is unaware, the author is not. The book is a form of satire, but many individuals don't comprehend it and only concentrate on its violent and pornographic elements.Mary Harron's movie adaptation is remarkable. Given the difficulty of the story, the film is a very faithful portrayal of the book. Christian Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman is iconic and unforgettable. The movie's most significant aspect is its satirical nature. It's a parody of itself, and it's hilarious.If you're a fan of ""American Psycho,"" I suggest reading ""Exquisite Corpse"" by Poppy Z. Brite, another horror book that is also quite extreme by a talented author.One of the novel's most extended chapters is about Whitney Houston and Bateman's admiration for her as a singer. However, Houston refused to allow any of her songs to be used in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Cold, soulless and strangely compelling!","In a material world, where everything can be bought and ego drives humans to be disconnected and competitive, where drugs no longer reach that high and human life has little value, the disguise is slipping and the hunger for the thrill is at it's peak.It's not a typical serial killer film, it's quirky, almost arty and is probably appreciated more on its second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Fun,"A great and miticuloys look at the life of a highly professional serial killer. Set in the 90's we watch as a frequent murderer plots and executed his plans on multiple occasions plus everything in between. A simple concept that's executed perfectly with some stunning visual moments and an outstanding performance from Christian Bale (arguably his best) 'American Psychi' has gained its classic status for good reason, worth a watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unique Work Especially for Some People,"This movie has been a profound example for me. As someone who values hard work and often measures success by comparing myself to others, I found a reflection of my potential future self in Patrick Bateman. For individuals who share a similar mindset, this film serves as a striking reminder. It unveils the latent psychological complexities within us-traits that, if left unchecked, could lead to narcissistic tendencies. I highly recommend it as a thought-provoking exploration of ambition, self-perception, and the darker aspects of human nature.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Being A Serial Killer.,"Patrick Bateman is a Wall Street yuppie who has a nice apartment, nice clothes, healthy body, a beautiful girlfriend, and a great paying executive job.  However, all is not normal for Patrick, you see, beneath those high quality assests, there's a monster that lives deep in Patrick's soul.  That monster is vicious and evil, it's the evil side that controls Patrick when he's upset and angry.  And then all hell breaks loose, blood is shed, and Patrick continues with his daily life. That is the premise behind the new Mary Harron film, AMERICAN PSYCHO. Patrick (Christian Bale) A everyday man, who is indeed successful, wealthy, and part of the elite society in the late 1980's.  But he releases his anger by taking care of his problems, which would include disembody a woman's head, chop a fellow co-worker into little pieces, and other horrific things.       PSYCHO is a intelligent satire of the late 1980's, where we were serious about the lifestyle, songs, and attitude that is protrayed in the film back in 1987.  Now we just laugh and are in disbelief on the way we acted and the music we listened to.  PSYCHO shows the strong conservative image that most Americans were living during Regan's power.  But it's the brilliant inside look at what one of these conservative's would be like if we took a look inside their life.      I was really looking forward to PSYCHO, I was hoping that it would be like a look inside the mind of a madman like Hannibal Lecter, or Travis Bickle.  But it's different, it doesn't really tell the viewer why Patrick kills.  Instead, it shows Patrick's daily life-style, which includes putting on tons of different beauty oils, excersising regularly, and tanning. But it shows that the psychos in our world are not the kind that live in the dark in urban American and have special kinds of moths with a skull on it.  No, it shows that the serial killer is not only the person that you know, but your best friend! The acting by Christian Bale is outstanding, he did quite a job by dropping his Limey accent for a pure Yank accent.  I love his speeches on certain 80's music, including Hewey Lewis, Phill Collins, and Whitney Houston.  The support is also good, Willem Dafoe is also good as a investigator looking for a missing person that Patrick might have killed.  Chloe Sevigny is also very good as the Patrick's administrative assistant who has a crush on Patrick.  And Reese Witherspoon is a typical snobby and stuck-up socialite who cares more about what will the wedding look like than the actual marriage. Mary Harron does a great job adapting the horrific novel (although I haven't read it yet), but with the story and pacing, it appears that she got the real reason to why we should watch this movie.  What I also enjoyed is the trickery that Harron uses in this film.  When the viewer thinks that they are seeing something, it's something totally different.  I always love it when a film director messes with the viewer's mind. Overall, I really did enjoy AMERICAN PSYCHO, but it does have it's bad points.  At times the movie goes from a fast pace to a bit slower.  And some of the character's are not explained fully in detail.  But those are just the side dishes compare to the rest of the film. But when you have a film where you have businessmen compare business card's to show their masculinity, it's sad but funny.  It's just a cruel way to show that while others care about their appearence, others are releasing their anger and taking out on others, with their blood.  This film is not really for the faint of heart.  It's not that gross, but it does leave a lot to the imagination, which is more gross. **** (out of five)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I do not agree with Infofreako,"I loved this film. It wasn't a comedy but it was comedic in scenes due to the cluelessness and lethargy of the other characters. Patrick Bateman is a serial killer, plain and simple, but that is not the purpose of this film. The main character thinks that he can get away with anything because he is rich and priveleged. The movie was violent, but not as much of the book. However, I think blood and gore would have taken away from the overall satire of the film by turning it into a campy horror movie. The film had a not-so-clear subtext: The absurdity of the killer's actions and motives equal that of the rich, corporate, snob's. Does a world based on business cards, fancy restaurants, and affairs have any more depth than that of a self-obsessed, unremourseful, unhuman creature such as Patrick Bateman? That is what you'll be asking yourself at the end of this movie. I give it a 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A bit late for a review. But I couldn't stop myself. One of the Good thriller.,"A psychological thriller story that took place in early 20's America.Patrick Bateman lives or acts as if he lives in a well-known rich society. He is a well-dressed guy, He is a good boss, a good person, He is simple and sweet. ""?""
But as the story progresses we really unfold some events which allow both of us and the character to understand what's really happening.The movie is a journey itself. Must watch it for sure.I know it has been 23 years of its release and obviously, almost all of us have already watched it. But I can't stop myself from writing a review for this story.Performances: Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman has lived the character. His eyes are full of fear, anger, and frustration. On point. Willem Dafoe as a detective is perfectly confusing, Even we cant tell if he knew that Bateman has anything to do with anyone's murder. So amazingly played.Direction: Directed by Mary Harron. The direction is simple as the story demands it to unfold the events through the journey, especially in the climax.Writing: Written by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner. Writing is amazing. Especially the character arcs.Cinematography: Andrzej Sekula's Cinematography is good at many points, especially in some horrifying scenes. It feels like we are involved in the murder and we are the next on Bateman's radar.Music and sound design: Fearful, I mean really. In a lot of scenes, especially when he is killing anyone. Music lets us feel what's going on in Patrick Bateman's chaotic Mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Don't waste your time.,"I tried, I really did. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die. Yea, I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. They're wet-paper thin. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.In the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels -- nothing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Frightening - but not in the way you would think...,"For me, the most frightening thing about this movie was the fact not only did I know people like Patrick Bateman in the '80's, I STILL know people like that...I never read the book, but the plot was quite not exactly brilliant and in many ways, unsatisfactory. However, the acting was good, and I thought the way all the cliched stuff of the '80's was brought was brilliant. AS were Batemens comments - particularly those in nightclubs... As for the horror and depravity of it all - for me, the movie just seemed to aimlessly plod along like a needle stuck in the groove of a record with the same thing being rehashed again and again, and when the needle finally skipped out, it was only to sink back into another endless repetitive groove... This meant I would keep sinking into a stupour in the long hours (or so it seemed) between plot changes and thus didn't really appreciate if something had happened after seeing the 'horror' the first time...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"U care for no one in this film, and that's the idea","Bale plays ""Patrick Bateman"", an upbeat all-with-it corporate business man working in Wall Street in the mid late 80's.  Being the son of the companies owner, he is pretty much in a cushy position, high paid, surrounded by other yuppies, goes to upscale restaurants, spends time in his high scale Manhattan apartments, and shmoozes with all his other same yuppie friends.  The only difference between him and all the others, is that Patrick is a serial killer.There's one thing I can say about villains in movies, we all secretly want them to win.  Bale in the yuppie peak of the 80's is surrounded by fakes, and jerkoffs, and other sick kind, so Bale fits right in.  Since he is a serial killer, he has no emotions NONE, and he blends in so easily with all his normal yuppie compatriots.  This is what makes this film unique, in that it's more of a statement on what the era was like than on Bale's horrible obsessions.Bale's acting is amazing in this role, playing such a complicated character. The murder scenes are filled with such tension, and the idea of chopping someone up into pieces whiles doing a soliloquy of why Huey Lewis's songs and music is so influential (which Bale's does as he usual waxes nostagicaly about 80's music while he's about to pounce on his victims) was just unreal.Interesting twist in the end as well.  However, there is only one interesting character in this film and everyone else is pretty plastic and uninteresting.  But I suppose that's the idea, thus making us feel no sympathy for any of these yuppie scums.Rating 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

You need to rewatch it to appreciate it more,"Upon my first viewing if thus film I was bit very impressed and would have rated it about a 4 or 5. Although, when I rewatched it quite recently, I saw how it was intended to be seen as first time. Unfortunately I did not see it like that first but now I will share my thoughts.It is a good film, it has a few flaws admittedly and is slightly overrated but the performances are spectacular. Christian Bale portrays this sociopathic murder with spine chilling accuracy. Willem Dafoe is also very good in it and overall all performances are great. Now, onto the negatives, there are a few ""strange"" shots which take awaya a bit from the experience but nothing major. The dialogue can also seem a but sketchy at times but again nothing major. Now, my biggest niggle with thus film though is the ending, which is very emotional but unfortunately is up to interpretation which can work very well but in this case I don't think it did.Nevertheless, this film is certainly good but slightly overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A great character study.,"I love the character of Patrick Bateman and how the movie goes deeper and deeper into his mind. When he goes insane you feel the dread, suspense, and murderous intention out of someone you thought was trustful. Aside from that, a lot of things are done well. Such as his murder spree which was a great touch of action and overall carnage that felt controlled yet totally savage (you can kinda sum up the feel of the film by saying that). However, things weren't explain that I still didn't get which made me a little disappointed. Why was this big confession nothing? How did the cops not find him? It's kinda open ended, which could be smart, but it feels a little lazy. I'd if they explained those small details, but I could understand due to run time. Still a little upsetting though. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Can someone explain that? When he goes into that other guy's apartment and it's for sale and totally scrubbed clean? I didn't get this dialog between Bateman and the real estate lady or why there weren't cops and police tape all over the crime scene...What am I missing there? As far as his lawyer calling him Davis and saying that he had seen the dead man recently in London, that was funny and when the whole thing clicked for me, but I am still wondering what the heck was up with that apartment scene.

Bad adaptation; poor direction,"Read the book and, although it was disturbing and repulsive, I found it to be a well written examination of vacuousness and lack of individuality and purpose.So, what was up with this movie then?? It was B-grade, at best. The direction was horrible. I know Christian Bale is a capable actor, so I can see no other reason for him having been so ""over the top"". The urinal cake scene from the book would have been a wonderfully comic/cruel addition to the film, if it weren't for the fact that the entire movie comes off as comic/cruel. You don't know if you should be laughing or not, it's so ridiculous. It simply sucked. It was a joke. Too bad...it held great promise.

You like Phil Collins?,To this day this is still one of the best examples of a movie that dives into the psyche of someone without coming off as cliche or generic. Patrick Bateman is a perfect example of how someone can seem so normal but be so unstable. Showing that even the big Wall Street tycoon Can be Murderer and cannibal at the same time. As some of the most memorable lines that a psychopath could ever utter. The film also captures the feel of the 80s better then most modern movies From the suits to the business talk to the music it feel like a 80s movie.

I simply am not there,"Mary Harron's intelligent adaptation is much funnier than Brett Easton Ellis' controversial novel, and manages to capture the essential ambiance of the book without relying on gross-out schlock horror tactics.The ultra-violence is completely toned down in favour of a more subtle approach, and the most effective scenes are frequently not the ones featuring Patrick Bateman's nocturnal chainsaw frenzies, but instead those concerned with the banal, superficial world of designer-obsessive, over competitive uber-execs working on Wall Street in the 1980s. In this respect it's something of a period piece, employing 80s trappings such as absurdly chunky mobile phones, decidedly suspect hairstyles and Hugo Boss power suits.The ability to secure a reservation at the latest exclusive restaurant is the benchmark by which these characters are judged. Essentially it's as much a satire on the materialistic ethos of the decade as it is a study of terminal psychological disintegration.Christian Bale, in what might be a career-defining role, carries the whole movie - but that's not to detract from the extremely witty script which recreates some of the book's seminal scenes to great effect. It's a tribute to his strong central performance that despite Bateman's glaring character flaws (vanity, self-obsession, a penchant for slaying innocent people with nail guns) he actually succeeds in making him quite sympathetic. He even attempts to warn people about his psychopathic tendencies, but these random pleas for help go totally unheard by the hip disaffected Manhattenites he's forced to hang out with.Trapped in a nightmarishly amoral world, and devoid of any recognisable human emotions other than anger and disgust, Bateman ultimately comes across as the biggest victim of them all. Even when he openly admits to his multiple crimes, his yuppie contemporaries refuse to accept the confession, because mass-murder just isn't the done thing. There's even the hint of a conspiracy of silence, a suggestion that somebody might be covertly covering up the evidence of his deranged activities.There are also some great supporting roles, notably from Chloe Seveigny as his doting secretary and Willem Dafoe as the cop who is aware of Bateman's guilt but doesn't seem that concerned with stopping him. Like the book, the film has no satisfactory resolution, and the audience is left with the impression that Bateman is still out there, drilling holes in prostitutes heads, waiting in vain for someone to catch him. Considering the problematic pre-production period, this film has triumphantly emerged from development hell to give moviegoers a serious slice of the very blackest humour. And thankfully, no Leo Dicaprio to spoil the fun....",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
American Psycho,"American Psycho is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron, adapted for the screen by Mary Harron, and based off of the novel of the same name. This film is a cult classic, as it's dark humor, ridiculousness, bloody violence, horror film traits, and insanely quotable moments mix well with its satire and criqie of collective identity, individuality consumerism, capitalism, and yuppie culture. Bale's breakout performance in the film is absolutely phenomenal and iconic. The main themes of the film are lack of individuality, collective identity becoming personal identity, the greed and self indulgence of those in high society, and what a psychopath can get away with in a world like this. All of the men on Wall street look and act the exact same. They are interchangeable, as are the women. That's why people constantly get names mixed up in the film, and that ends up saving Bateman. Bateman only cares about other view him. He is in a constant hunger for conformity and to be seen as better, as he ends up killing Paul Allen because he had a better business card than him. He has been killing for a long time, and has been able to maintain, but starts to breakdown. The film is about how we form a collective identity, pretty much losing our individuality and personal identity. We crave attention, material wealth, conformity and to be seen as better. Bateman does. So do the others. At the end of the film he realizes that nothing including himself really matter, everyone is the same. He is so indulged in a collective identity, that his lawyer mistakes him for someone else, obliterating his confession. No one cares that he kills people, no one even notices. He can get away with anything, even if your a serial killer/psychopath. because he has sold himself a collective identity. He puts value into material things like restaurants, suits, watches, cards, and apartments. He listens to cheesy pop music because its trendy, but much more value into it, than it really holds. He views the homeless and lower classes to be less than him, he just kills them. In this type of high society, the people lose their individuality and distungishable traits, and just become greedy, power hungry, emotionless, interchangeable and unoticable nothings. The only difference between Bateman and his banker colleagues, is that he kills people. But everyone is so wrapped up in themselves and collective identity, that they dont notice. Bateman sees women as meat or objects, and men as something to be better than.At the end of the film, after his breakdown, Bateman realize that he and everyone else he knows is meaningless, interchangeable, and that he can get away with anything. He can Indulge in his murderous hunger all he wants. He presents himself in the collective identity, fitting in losing all sense of self. It will go on. He becomes more and more hungry and uncontrollable and his private life becomes integrated into his professional, and he realizes that he take it, and get away with it, there is more to take. Don' become a Patrick Bateman. He craves to stand out and be better. His view of himself is skewed by his psychosis, inflated ego and sociopatheology. His fantasy and reality become jaded, mixed, and goes insane because he can't really tell the difference. His killings all happend, but some are partial truths, or over aesthetically elaborate type chainsaw massacre killings. He so disconnected and detached from reality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The business card scene was just great! I skipped through the two commentaries and both seemed to be decent but I didn't really care for the featurettes much.

Fairly good adaptation,"I just saw this yesterday. I think Christian Bale is a great actor also in Equilibrium and Batman, and he really does a good job playing Patrick Bateman. Anyway, having also recently read the book, I don't think it did a fair job to the book. Anyway, that is impossible. It is like the adaptation of Watchmen. Simply impossible, so why even try? Nevertheless, both the Watchmen movie and the American Psycho movie has turned out to be rather interesting. A weak aspect of the American Psycho movie was that some of the interesting dialogue was cut out. For example, Ted Bundy's name is mentioned in the book but left out in the movie. It would have been powerful to hear Ted Bundy's name spoken out in the movie, since the Bateman character is incredibly much inspired by Ted Bundy's story. Actually, it is amazing what a genius Breat Easton Ellis is. He is like a living Dostoyevski. His psychological insight into the Bateman character is incredible, and naturally this is impossible to bring to the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
To the point,"Patrick Bateman has everything: money, good looks, health, nice apartment, and an easy going high paying job. Beneath this business school success story, however, lies a dark man who knows and even acknowledges that he has everything, but wants more...Since this is an adaptation you can see this movie as too different things: as an adaptation of the novel, or as just a movie if you haven't read the novel. As a movie it is well done, especially with Bale's frightening performance as the callous Bateman, and it is that with the general ambition that went into the project that overshadows the film's obvious limitations. And there are quite a few of them. I have never read the book, but have heard about it enough to see that the film is aesthetically way below the scope of the novel. The locations and sets simply just barely manage to cut it. However the film is a success due its tone.The themes, metaphors, and idea of the book presented in such a way that you get the feeling that yes, the filmmakers know the source material, like the source material and put in an honest effort to get it translated to the screen. After all, it is the themes and ideas that matter more than the actual physical look of the film. ""Apocalypse Now"" looks nothing like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" - different time period, different locations, etc... - but the fundamental themes of the novel (the stuff that matters most) are there and it is a great movie based off of a great book. With ""American Psycho"" fans can delight in the adaptation as also being faithful in the aesthetic sense.However, fans should also be ready to forgive. Think about it, would any major studio release a movie with a seriously f***ed up lead character like Bateman? Author Bret Easton Ellis was himself shot down by publishers before he got his book out, so this isn't mainstream thought and metaphor here. It is un-PC, hard to swallow, but daring in it's ambitions and that is what makes the film good. --- 8/10Rated R for strong violent content and sex",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Delightfully Dark Dance of Depravity,"If you're looking for a film that will make you question your own sanity while laughing at the absurdity of it all, American Psycho is the perfect mind-bending cocktail. In a world where conformity reigns supreme, this film takes us on a wickedly entertaining journey into the deranged mind of Patrick Bateman.Christian Bale's performance as the enigmatic and psychopathic Wall Street investment banker is nothing short of iconic. His portrayal seamlessly shifts between the charming and charismatic yuppie of the '80s and the sadistic serial killer lurking just beneath the surface. Bale's commitment to the role is both chilling and darkly hilarious.The film's satirical take on the excesses of the '80s yuppie culture is razor-sharp. It's a world where business cards are scrutinized with more intensity than murder mysteries, and the pursuit of the perfect reservation at Dorsia is a matter of life and death. Patrick Bateman's obsession with materialism and his meticulous grooming rituals are a reflection of the shallow, narcissistic values of the era.Mary Harron's direction infuses the film with a darkly comedic tone that keeps you uncomfortably entertained throughout. She skillfully balances the macabre and the absurd, creating a narrative that blurs the line between reality and Bateman's delusional fantasies. The film's use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for Bateman's psychosis is both unsettling and brilliant. The film's palette of dark, muted colors and a hauntingly retro soundtrack add to the film's unsettling charm.American Psycho is a wicked satire that subverts expectations at every turn and delves deep into the psyche of a man teetering on the edge of madness. This film isn't just a psychological thriller; it's a darkly hilarious and thought-provoking film that challenges our perception of reality, forcing us to question whether Bateman's atrocities are real or merely the twisted product of his mind. And it's also a biting social commentary on the emptiness of consumer culture and the dehumanizing effects of unchecked capitalism.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Uneven.,"I think the main issue I had was that most of the actors seem to have been directed to talk in a flat, monotone-like voice. I'm guessing this was done in order to make the characters show that they are cool and sophisticated...or at least to make other characters *think* they are such. Thing is, when you have to hear movie characters talking this way for most of a movie's running time, it becomes boring itself after a while. Or so I found.Then there were at least two contradictory moments. The main character is supposed to be a hygiene freak, yet he seems to have no problem 1: having sex in his work clothes; then 2: hitching up his pants up without showing the slightest interest in cleaning his private parts. Really? Later on, after having made it clear what a clean freak he is, he flicks a cigarette ash on the floor of his office. Really??These may seem like trivial moments to some, but I found them distracting.What did I like about the movie? Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe. They were the only actors/characters who seemed to act like real people.So, I give it a 6 out of 10. At the same time, however, I have to give props to any movie that's older than fifteen years that's as highly rated on IMDb as this one is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Do You Like Huey Lewis And The News?,"Christian Bale is a great actor who has been in a lot of great movies, but to me this will always be his best performance. Patrick Bateman is a terrible human being, but he is also fascinating. This film is probably not for everyone, they get too hung up on all of murder and blood. Which is fine, but if you can get past that, it is actually one of the best black comedies ever made, and I don't mean basketball black. The characters are all complete psychopaths, but that is why it is so funny. I think it rips Wall Street to shreds in the same way Zoolander ripped the modelling world apart.

Another way of reading the novel,"Regardless of all the controversy, I just loved and love Brett Easton Ellis' novel. I thought and think it's a bold, challenging and tremendously original work and not just anyone can fully appreciate all the dark humour and despair beneath the gory surface.The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (ie the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pathetism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorisation of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for mysoginy here.To sum up, this is a more accesible, much less ambiguous approach to a difficult character. While the novel is fascinating because it constantly pushes you to new limits as a reader, the film becomes a highly witty parody of it all. A bit more of social criticism is missing in this adaptation but however thumbs up to Harron for her feminist way of treating an unbearably ridiculous mysoginist lunatic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"American Psycho Review - Money, Materialism, & Murder","""I have to return some videotapes."" - Patrick BatemanYou know, I love horror films. Who doesn't? There's nothing more entertaining than turning the lights out at night and watching a good scary movie. But my favorite kind of horror is psychological horror. You see, with psychological horror it's not about a monster, a masked killer, or a zombie apocalypse, but it's about the fear and horror within yourself and it also explores what drives someone to kill. One film that manages to take that concept and mixes with satirical 80s black comedy and ending up being, for the most part, devilishly clever, insane, and hilarious at the same time is American Psycho.Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name, the story follows Patrick Bateman, who, by day he's a wealthy, but self-centered and materialistic stock broker in 1980s New York, but by night he's a bloodthirsty, psychopathic, and deranged serial killer who kills people to indulge his sadistic fantasies. But the line between reality and fantasy begin to blur as Patrick's dark side starts to reveal itself on his mask of seemingly outer perfection as his bloodlust rises.While it's not really a straight up horror film, it's more like a character study of someone who, on the surface, may seem like he's literally living the Dream and has a lavish lifestyle, but, in reality, he's a lunatic who craves murder, torture, and sex. This movie also satirizes the 80s Yuppies culture; young and wealthy people who work high-end jobs, have dinner at lavish restaurants, and pretty much say or do whatever they want without any sort of repercussions.However, it doesn't stray the focus away from the main character, thanks to its well-written screenplay. Much of the story is told from Patrick's point-of-view; he's obsessed with the lavish lifestyle; always trendy, always looking handsome, and living among the rich & elites, all this which hides his psychopathic dark side. But, at the same time, he despises it and often criticizes it for how shallow and soulless it can be, despite being obsessively indulged in it.I especially do like the look of the film and how it feels like the period that took place at the time. Cinematography is also on point here, especially viewing which side of Patrick we're seeing. It can be calm and soothing when he is normal, but then becomes crazy when he goes ballistic and starts killing people with an ax, a nail gun, and a chainsaw. Editing moves the film at a steady pace and the soundtrack cleverly fits with both the setting and events that unfold. You'll never hear the song ""Hip to Be Square"" the same way again.Lastly, the performances; they all do their parts well, but it's Christian Bale who is the real star as Patrick Bateman. This was the film that made Bale into a household name, and this was before he was Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy. It's amazing how committed an actor like Bale can be to match his physicality with the character's physical appearance as well as diving into the psyche of a psychopath.Overall, American Psycho is an interesting blend of comedy, horror, and satire that just works. The only thing that I didn't like too much was the third act, which I feel is when it started to decline a bit. But the humor, the satire of yuppies culture of the 80s, the excellent direction, and Bale's performance makes this an underrated gem. Defiantly worth watching.Final Verdict: 9/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.Now if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Admirable combination of laughs and fears,"Impressive adaptation of the brutal satire detailing early 90's yuppie excess, Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel comes to sparkling life with equal measures of hilarity and depravity. In ripping the often referenced book for a cinematic reincarnation, director Mary Harron certainly had her work cut out for her. Substituting some of the unbearably graphic images which would fester inside readers heads for a more suggestive style, Harmon brilliantly recreates this hard-edged satire for the silver screen with very few discrepancies.Thriving off of the psychotically committed effort from lead Christian Bale, American Psycho might not be as bluntly effective as some of it's harsher passages would beckon, but nonetheless remains one of modern Hollywood's most brilliant and scorching satires on the materialistic excess plaguing the late 80's early 90's for many ambitious Americans. It is that memorable time period that is captured so convincingly amidst Bateman's psychotic urges that makes the film larger then it's subject. Many will classify American Psycho as a horror film on the warped mindset behind a serial killer, though it becomes clear by film's end that a sharply cutting comedic commentary on those highly egotistical years play more of a role in describing what makes this violent and sadistic man tick then expected.In turn, American Psycho becomes a glorious dark comedy, even if a little repetitious, whilst Bale continues to terrify audiences with his disturbingly perfect portrait. It is a character definitely prone to caricature, completely convincing in the rare evil silences we witness when Bales becomes engulfed in his struggling darkness, which viewers will, upon further viewings, analyze further due to an ambiguous ending. Though short of the character study masterpiece I had ideally hoped for, the film will remain a nihilistic joy with stinging psychological sentiment for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Materialism In America,"Is Patrick Bateman a psycho or just a normal person? The movie ""American Psycho"" shows the audience that many people in America have the same mindset. As people struggle for the ideal image Batemen is tired of the same consitency found in his life. The movie revolves around his killer tendecies to show the true meaning of what it is to be normal. As everyone fades away to being normal, Bateman is the only one with common sense. As his tendecies define him as unique and different. This movie is a great representation of expressing individulism.

Brutally funny but something's missing,America Psycho is a good satire of 80s culture; taking shots at everything from yuppies to music to politics. And it is pretty damn funny at it as well. Christian Bale is perfect as the somewhat unhinged Patrick Bateman and is suitably OTT. His analysis of his CD collection is hilarious.However the film does have its flaws. For one thing the plot is a little thin and the whole affair runs out of steam towards the disappointing ending. Also the supporting cast although stellar on paper seem almost anonymous as they drift in and out of the story.American Psycho is cool and sleek with Bale in a killer role but falls just short of a perfect translation of very difficult material.

"Patrick Bateman's Dark Descent into 1980s Excess: A Razor-Sharp Satirical Thriller, Leaves a Haunting Impression","""American Psycho"" is a groundbreaking film that masterfully adapts Bret Easton Ellis's book into a terrifying and humorous reflection on the excesses of the 1980s. As Patrick Bateman, a wealthy and seemingly successful investment banker with a sinister and tortured alter persona, Christian Bale gives an enthralling performance. Viewers are left wondering about the real purpose of Bateman's violent adventures as the movie deftly balances reality and his hallucinogenic universe. With a keen sense of humor and stylish imagery, director Mary Harron deftly conveys the decadence of the time, emphasizing the moral degradation and emptiness that lie beneath Bateman's opulent exterior.Beyond the horror genre, the film explores topics of consumerism, identity, and the dehumanizing impacts of societal expectations with a sharp social critique. Bateman's fixation with outward appearances and his spiral into lunacy are contrasted to produce a gripping story that has a lasting effect. ""American Psycho"" delves deeply into the shadowy side of a materialistic society while simultaneously being a compelling psychological thriller.

A movie you'll hate to love,"American Psycho is by far one of the best films of the year. Many critics and some viewers are claiming that the film is shallow and pathetic...exactly right. And that's the stunning beauty of it all. AP is so deep its shallow and vice versa.Christian Bale (in a trying-way-too-hard American accent) does a top-notch job playing Patrick Bateman, a rich New York Wall-Streeter who lives an utterly empty life. His fiance (the always excellent Reese Witherspoon)is a drip, his friends are drones, and even the people he passes on the street seem to be pathetic, soulless creatures.Finally, we see that Patrick DOES find a way of escaping all of this 80s nonsense...through random acts of hideous violence. The first shocking killing, involving a homeless man and (gasp!) his dog, jolts the audience with its intensity..and humor. Patrick's murders (while not that graphic) make you squeemish because the director has done such a superb job of making them FUNNY. You're laughing as people are chased with axes, nail guns, chainsaws, etc. This is BLACK COMEDY at its finest. You hate yourself for loving every delicious moment of mayhem.The overall point to the story is that in the world of excess, a heavy price of being ""not there"" comes along with all of the wonderful restaurant reservations and business cards with gold lettering. Some may say the meaning is shallow and overplayed, but I truly think the filmmakers accomplish what they set out to do...show that everyone has to find their identity somehow...and hopefully it won't be in the psychotic ways that Bateman does.One final note...unlike the similar in message Fight Club, this one's twist ending is NOT a total betrayal to the entire movie.

Unfortunately, popping out business cards to show virtually identical ones with slight changes of color, which I realize is to show how ridiculous all of it is, is not my idea of fun. The conversations in the film were about as 'entertaining', including this diatribe about music the lead character spouts out in his apartment from time to time.Some of the early narration felt a little like an attempt similar in nature to Fight Club's narrative, yet in no way compelling like Fight Club.

If you watch this and you don't get it please and sit and watch a video explaining it because otherwise it'll make no sense unless ur smart which I am not lol. I do recommend it just cause of how much of a classic it is but this is a thinky up for interpretation type more so just prep yourself to think before you pull this movie up.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Blown away by Bale's performance!,"Blown away by Bale's performance! The film wouldn't have been as good if not for his chilling acting. Very gory scenes that seem so surreal they actually made me laugh out loud. I loved the bit about the business cards, it shows how obsessed Patrick is with anything that concerns his image and what others think of him.I would have given this 5 starts had the ending been a little less ambiguous. I get that that is the whole point - not knowing what is real and what isn't - but I would have loved for everything to have been a sick fantasy of Bateman's.One of the few movies I've watched in which Willem Defoe doesn't play a villain/someone creepy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Look into a dark psyche,"American Psycho, based on a novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis, is a story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), an investment banker on the Wall Street, whose life revolves around a few things. Looking good, one-upping his coworkers and listening to music. Only, he does all of these things in the most destructive, psychotic and capitalistic way possible. The movie is nothing if not a look into the psyche of a seriously disturbed man, who also happens to stand in for the rottenness of modern society.Most of the good things in the film can be summed up in two words: Christian Bale. One of the defining roles of his career, and the man absolutely nails the outwardly pleasant high-lifer, who nonetheless has the eyes of a dead man. Whenever he smiles it sends shivers down your spine because even though it looks alright, there's something messed up behind it. And then there are those scenes where his inner psycho comes out to play. Freaky stuff.Not that the other aspect of film making are lacking. It's a well-shot, well-acted, well-made film all around. But it's really Bale's performance that elevates this above the crowd. Well, that and the themes explored, but there are other films that have dealt with similar issues equally well, if not better.A movie well worth a watch. Not for the squeamish, but if you can stomach it, it's a fascinating journey down the looney highway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Bateman's Giant Ego,"Known for Christian Bale's remarkable performance, ""American Psycho"" (2000) is one of the most recognized works within the theme of psychopaths in the history of horror and thriller cinema, starting the new millennium with an iconic and expressive film.The project flirts with dark comedy at various times, focusing on dialogues and scenes of acid humor that work very well most of the time. The cast's performances are excellent, but Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, stands out in an iconic way, establishing himself as one of cinema's most memorable psychopaths. His performance balances menace, humor, narcissism and other layers of complexity. The soundtrack adds a striking contrast, bringing unexpected music to a film of this genre. The plot develops by exploring themes such as consumerism and the superficiality of capitalist society, alienation, existential emptiness, violence and misogyny, offering an incisive critique of male power. Furthermore, the film presents scenes that have become unforgettable within horror cinema.With an ambiguous ending, ""American Psycho"" stood out not only for its memorable performances, but also for showcasing a serial killer with characteristics distinct from other works of the genre, consolidating itself as a classic of the 2000s.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Didn't like it,"I really did not enjoy this movie. It did have a message about the dog eat dog world of business, but it was not that good. It tried to use dark humor that really did not work and it tried to show much violence, which also did not work. I was left confused by what happened. His schedule book was not at all explained: did he have a schizophrenic (sp?) disorder or was he really sick? Perhaps we are to figure it out, but the rest of the movie does not help. It moves from one proposterous scene of businessmen trying to prove their penis size to a scene of violence and back again in a cycle. This is like the movie Kids where the message is good, but the delivery is not. It did not glorify or condemn the business world and its cutthroat mindset. I do not recommend this film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Psychotic charisma,"A film everyone knows to at least exist. A film that is said to capture the ugly underbelly of modern society, of modern America. And, in a way, it does just that. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a horrible human being. He's man obsessed with style, fashion, appearances, pop culture, sex and looking good in front of the crowds, a flawed human being that we all want to be. We all want to be him because he's rich, successful, extremely good looking and sexually active. He's everything we are told to be and everything we want to be, in our darkest dreams.This is a brutally honest film. It's very direct, very straight to the point and it has a clear message: modern society is obsessed and its obsession is not productive. This single point is supported by a clear vision from the director, an amazing acting talent from Bale and a story that has no wasted motions, no wasted scenes. It's all a single, flawless trip through a flawed wasteland that is a modern day utopia.A lot has been written about the ending. Some say it's just perfect, some that it's hard to understand, some that it could have been better, some that it ruins the whole film and some that it's the single flaw in a perfect film. I tend to think that the whole film is about the aimlessness of modern day society, about the meaninglessness of living in a society this obsessed with appearances. So why shouldn't the ending be just as meaningless? Still, it's a pretty jarring ending that will alienate at least half of the viewers, which is never a good thing. It could have been better, in my opinion.This is a fascinating film. It's brutal, it's stylistic, it's honest, it's confusing, it's slick, it's jarring, it's an experience worth having.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bell's one-man stand-up shows the tranquility,"Bell's one-man stand-up shows the tranquility, madness, trembling and relief of a madman with a neurotic performance.

A tale of fragile masculinity,"American Psycho is the story of a psychotic investment banker - Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). He has a nice apartment, a beautiful fiancée and a nice job. However he also has a darker side. When he isn't out partying with his friends, he is out murdering prostitutes, homeless and anyone else who annoys him.While the movie certainly diverts from the book (written by Bret Easton Ellis). I'd say it diverts for the better. The book may be darker and use a lot more disturbing imagery to get its satire across, the movie instead uses a lighter tone. It still manages to deliver that biting satire about yuppie culture in the eighties.This is a movie that shines on re-watchings. The subtle details that the actors and actresses display is phenomenal along with the small things that pull it all together. The movie displays fragile masculinity in its purest form with vain and cruel men in focus. It shows how cruel this yuppie world can be, and at times you almost sympathise with Bateman on his quest to be noticed and stand out. The movies use of the song ""Hip to be Square"" is quite apt.The ending may feel a bit lackluster to some but the unsatisfyingness (best word to describe it) fits with the narrative.It may not be perfect. But considering that I've written a full length essay on this movies subject, and it still holds up - I'd say it's a great satire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

If Patrick Bateman was Batman then alfred would call him Master-Bateman,"American Psycho is a 2000 black comedy horror film directed by Mary Harron. Written by Harron and Guinevere Turner, it is based on Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel of the same name. Set in the late 1980s, the film stars Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a yuppie New York City investment banker who is gradually revealed to be a serial killer preying on homeless people, work colleagues, prostitutes and finally random members of the public.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Nice business cards...,"My first question after belatedly watching American Psycho is this: why isn't Christian Bale more revered? Every time I have seen him in a film he has been excellent, and as Patrick Bateman he was nothing short of electric. The film itself made a valiant stab at capturing the essence of the novel whilst also structuring it as a workable movie for the casual viewer, and was never going to be as jaw-dropping as the book. However, a top class cast and some shrewd writing and directorial decisions delivered a film that was better than I expected it to be, and Bale's mesmerising Bateman made sense of the pointlessness of his actions, creating a monster that needs no back-story  he is simply what he is and does what he does because he wants to. This lack of cohesive motive actually works in his favour and it was nice to see no compromise ending. Good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
First MST3K Worthy Movie of 2000,"Plainly put, this movie was horrible.  The attempt to satirize the greed of the 80's was neither original or well done.  What's lacking in this movie? Basically everything, but here's a quick outline:Plot- Obviously the directors found no need for a plot to be included in this movie.Acting- Bale will win an award for this one, I do agree.  But saying it will be an Oscar is absurd.  The only award he's going to win for this is a Razzie (Worst job of acting for the Year). Also, the movie as whole (assuming no other movie can equal it this year) should do at the Razzie's what American Beauty and Matrix combined did at the Oscar's.  The casting and acting for the other characters was horrible, but then again they weren't given much to work with.Comedy- The only thing they semi-succeeded with was comedy in the movie, but not for the reasons they hoped.  While we were supposed to laugh at the depraved nature of the greedy man of the 80's, I instead found myself and the other 300 in the theater that didn't leave half way through (which about 100 did) laughing at how stupid the things he did were (beyond psychotic) and how useless many of the sex scenes, dialogue, etc. were.Ending- Like plot, the directors found having an ending unnecessary.  I stayed in the theater (prescreen for University students) because I figured it would have a decent ending that might make me think and make the movie bearable.  Wishful thinking.In summary, don't waste your money or your time on this movie in the regular or dollar theaters.  Once it gets past those in a month, don't rent it either.  Don't even watch it for free on HBO... your time has to be worth more than that.  Watch the cartoon network or dumbo or something.  The only time this movie might be worth watching is once the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 get their hands on it and make fun of it (see the worst 100 movies on IMDb for examples of how MST3K can make bad movies bearable). However, this movie is so grotesque at points, they probably can't show it on cable.  It's the Devil's Advocate with more useless sex and absolutely no plot.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Incredible horror satire,"Memes aside, American Psycho is an incredible horror satire film. American Psycho delves into many thought-provoking themes such as consumerism, conformity, human connection, pop culture, class & more-and loads of essays could be written about each one. I could get into each of these, but for the sake of brevity, my most significant takeaway is below.Many people ponder whether Patrick actually committed the murders (I don't think he did), but the bigger question should be: What is Patrick's desire? Well, he actually tells us. The key line of dialogue occurs when Jean asks him if he ever wanted to make someone happy, to which he replies, ""I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special."" This, in my opinion, is Patrick's genuine desire. Throughout the film, every relationship he engages in is shallow and vapid, with coworkers solely focused on wealth and status, and sexual partners viewed merely as objects.Also, the remarkable humor in this film cannot be understated (see the business card scene). The balance of satire, humor, and horror in American Psycho is truly masterful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the Best movies ever,"I sincerely love and adore this movie, and that feels sort of strange to say. Given how violent and disturbing this movie is... it's still is kinda funny!

Christian Bale is a little too good at playing a psychopath in fact, he completely makes this movie. There are some flaws that weight this movie down though. First off, some scenes were a little too unnecessary for my tastes. I also am not a big fan of narration in any movie, and this one is no different.

A film that tries to say a lot but ends up saying very little,"""American Psycho"" is a film that, despite its ambition, fails to deliver a coherent or meaningful message. While Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic, sociopathic Wall Street banker, is undeniably intense, the film itself struggles to strike the right balance between satire, horror, and social commentary, resulting in an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying experience.One of the film's major flaws is its tone. It tries to juggle dark comedy and psychological horror, but the result is often muddled. The satirical edge, which aims to criticize the superficiality and moral bankruptcy of 1980s consumerism, feels shallow and repetitive, lacking the sharpness and depth needed to make a lasting impact. Instead of offering biting commentary, the film revels too much in its grotesque violence and Bateman's sadistic fantasies, making it difficult to discern whether it wants to critique or indulge in the excess it portrays.The violence, which was controversial at the time of the film's release, comes across as gratuitous and shock-driven rather than serving any deeper narrative purpose. It feels as though the filmmakers are more interested in pushing boundaries for the sake of it, rather than using it to enhance the psychological horror or provide insights into Bateman's unraveling psyche. This over-reliance on extreme violence detracts from the film's supposed satire and ends up feeling hollow and pointless.Furthermore, the characters surrounding Bateman are barely fleshed out, reducing them to mere caricatures of Wall Street yuppies. This might have worked in a more focused satire, but in American Psycho, it makes the interactions feel one-dimensional and monotonous. There's little emotional engagement, and the story lacks a compelling narrative drive. As a result, the film's attempts at social critique get lost in a sea of stylized violence and disjointed scenes.While Christian Bale's performance is widely praised, even his portrayal can't save the film from its flaws. His intense commitment to the role is undeniable, but the character of Patrick Bateman is so unlikable and detached that it's hard to invest in his fate. The film's ending, which intentionally leaves the viewer questioning what was real and what was fantasy, feels frustratingly ambiguous rather than thought-provoking, offering no real resolution or insight into the character's psyche.Ultimately, American Psycho is a film that tries to say a lot but ends up saying very little. It flirts with the idea of being a clever satire, but its lack of depth, over-the-top violence, and inconsistent tone make it a disappointing and shallow attempt at exploring the dark side of human nature. While it may have a cult following, it's a film that, for many viewers, feels more like an exercise in excess rather than meaningful cinema.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Perfect Screen Adaptation,"A masterful adaptation of words to cinema by Mary Harron, this is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 novel that was set in the 1980s. Though at the time it was called sexist filth by some. Christian Bale's performance is brutally riveting, playing a man disconnected from reality, thats established subtly from the start through Bateman's skewed priorities, like valentino suits, thick business cards and dinner reservations. Defined by consumerism living in the language of ads and driven forward by consumption. And his point of view does not define objective reality, this is represented by his inflated ego, his psychosis and many other mental illnesses - presumably his narcissistic and borderline behaviour. The film is basically a black comedy, and a critique of male behaviour.There is many scenes that points towards that - it was all in Bateman's head. But in fact its meant to be ambiguous and the film isn't about that question, and not about murder either for that matter. American Psycho is about yuppie culture, the melding of identity and the craving to stand out from such a superficial homogenized society.Patrick Bateman tries like the rest to fit in, but lives a double life as a killer, but he's not the killer he think's he is. As he goes insane he cant distinguish fantasy from reality. His over the top chainsaw killings, may be an aestheticised elaboration on partial truths. Ultimately the film doesn't care, the bigger point of the movie's absurdity is that within his society Bateman is not the psycho at all, he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality secretly discontented American psychos.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Good Watch,"I just finished watching American Psycho, and I have to say, it was pretty good. The film kept me engaged from start to finish, and I understand why it has such a dedicated fan base. What really stood out for me was Patrick Bateman. Christian Bale was incredible in this role. He brought a creepy, intense energy that was both unsettling and fascinating.The plot itself was intriguing, although it did drag a bit at times. There were some standout moments, like the famous business card scene, which I thought was brilliantly done. The dark humor sprinkled throughout the film also added a nice touch. That said, some parts felt a bit overdone and were a bit hard to follow, which made the movie seem confusing occasionally.But, Bale's performance as Bateman really made the movie shine. He perfectly balanced charm and menace, keeping me on the edge of my seat. His acting was so compelling that it overshadowed everything else. The other characters and parts of the plot didn't leave as strong an impression on me.In conclusion, American Psycho is a good watch. It's definitely worth seeing, mainly for Bale's outstanding portrayal of Patrick Bateman. He truly stole the show and made the movie memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Eh, whatever, let me go get some pizza. Did you do the laundry?","If there is a single movie that suffuses as the poster-child for the countless ""What was the point of that?"" movies, it's American Psycho. It's not necessary bad, it's just boring and pointless. It's the kind of movie that will leave the average person thinking about their laundry when the credits roll rather than the movie itself. In other blunter words, the movie is wholesale forgettable from opening to closing. If you know anything about real-life serial killers, or have seen any other cliché serial killer movie, you've seen this. Hundreds of times.It opens up just like every other first-person narrative movie, and some lines even made me wonder if they were copied directly from Fight Club. Regardless of when the two original novels were written, I think this just proves the insane unoriginality of both.Speaking of unoriginality, American Psycho is nothing but one long, bloated serial killer cliché with nothing to differentiate it from the countless others just like it. The main character is a mix of Hannibal Lector and your average no-name B-movie serial killer. He does exactly what every other serial killer ever does: kill, have sex, and kill having sex. He's a dull cliché with legs. (And a butt, if you want me to mention the constant immature use of rear nudity that has no point but to make the 13-year-old girls horny.) There is no real plot, just, as I said, kill and have sex, and that's the ""brilliant, masterful"" plotting that everyone is speaking of. Kill, sex, kill, sexI think we know what sells in America. That's why American Psycho is just so safe. It's a safe idea that has been used hundreds of timeskill, sexand was destine to get great reviews because it plays so safe. I think we've learned by now that safe movies get the critic's good scores, and safe movies sell. Am I really the only one who gets it? American Psycho is a movie for safe pansies who's idea of a ""brilliant, masterful"" plot is: kill, sex, kill.But with all the killing, I was left wondering: where is all this gore everyone is speaking of? How is this gory? Every single kill is off-screen. I've seen low-budget 60's horror movies that show more gore on screen. There isn't a single moment of brutality. There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama. Maybe that's because, no matter what you want to believe, American Psycho is a drama. It isn't a horror moviejust the idea of typing that makes me laughand it isn't an action movie. It's just a cliché, dull drama.The only good I can manage to scrounger up: - Bale knows how to act. - The chainsaw scene was interesting.Now, back to the bad for my conclusion. American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining. It's so forgettable the exact thing I thought when the credits came on screen was: ""I need to order some pizza . . ."" and didn't even remember I watched it until I sat down to write this review the next morning. There are countless movies out there exactly like this, and I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person alive who even gets that there actually ARE interesting, entertaining, original movies out there to watch.

And while I didn't entirely get the satire, as I was just a kid when all this raging consumerism was going on, I can tell you this...the movie itself is a laugh riot... ...provided you can appreciate relatively black comedy and have a sense for the truly absurd. I think it's safe to say that this movie was designed to be funny. Some of the scenes are so awkward you know it was intentional. This movie basks in genre-referential humor and a taste for truly absurd comedy. So while my friend and I were rolling in the aisles, I noticed a few people in the theatre just didn't get it.Go to see this movie without expecting anything in particular from it. Go to see it to be entertained. Loosen up a bit. It's not supposed to be chilling, or frightening, or horrifying, or thrilling. It's supposed to be funny. I just think the distributors screwed up how they were supposed to bill it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Strong Concept that is Just Missing Something,"Adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' famous novel American Psycho, Christian Bale stars in the horror mystery that delves into psychological stability.Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, an wealthy, idiosyncratic investment banker stationed in New York. His unique illustration is one that remains unanswered throughout the film, though his psychopathic tendencies are explicit to the audience, and he begins to struggle keeping his private life separate to his personal life.The blockbuster that saw little movement in the awards categories still refused to go unrecognised, with Bale's portrayal of Bateman described as 'convincing' the protagonist succeeds in capturing the sheer intensity of the character and his materialistic personality. It must be noted that the British actor is almost playing two roles, the polished, controlled, rich Wall Street worker and the vicious, violent, brutal rapist and murderer. The previous readings may appear to be spoilers but Ellis' primitive and original ideologies were implemented intelligently by Mary Harron into the screenplay, making American Psycho far more than a 'catch the killer' type of film.The film's movement is much like a story, it is progressive, and builds up quickness to entice its audience and keep them hooked. It's finished look is one with strong articulation, the detail is clear in every scene, from Bateman's actions to the timed music and even the lighting displayed.The selling point of American Psycho is that it doesn't hold back, the gore and violence is horrifying and the demonisation of the protagonist is nothing short of bloodcurdling. It won't go down as a classic, but might be hailed the one that got away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"After Good Start, Falls Apart","During the 1980s, a Wall Street yuppie leads an alternate life as a serial killer. This starts out as a delicious black comedy, with Bale delivering a terrific performance as a man who is not only a cold-blooded killer but a connoisseur of pop music. It's quite amusing listening to him analyze the music of Huey Louis and Whitney Houston. Unfortunately, the film falls apart down the stretch. Harron's direction is crisp, but the screenplay fails to reach a satisfactory conclusion, perhaps a difficult feat to pull off given the nature of the source novel. There are too many loose ends and the ending is much too ambiguous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Itll spook ya!,"American Psycho is a film that is well done, but will keep you thinking, ""I must be crazy to watch this"".

What if all you were left with was subconcious?,"American Psycho is a daring movie.  It is not for the faint of heart, but looking past the gore you will see there is a great deal going on here.The film is nominally about a very eccentric Wall Street type whose life revolves around the parties, the lunches & the women that make up his lifestyle.  At first you are hit with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms...no one would associate with this wacko in real life.At first you figure ""he's overplaying.""  Then, as you get deeper into the film, you realize what is going on here.  This is not life in the real world.  This is life inside this guy's head... it's his subconcious.  You are never told this... you have to figure it out; none of the characters ever walks up to the screen and announces it.  But, once you get it, the film is much more enjoyable and it finally begins to make a sort of bizarre sense.For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air.  It appears campy at first.  It is violent, especially towards women.  But it is not brainless.Take the time to actually watch this movie and think about it.  You'll see there's much more than meets the eye.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good movie about a man who blurs between reality and fantasy,"American Psycho's story is about a young banker named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who at age 27 has it all: a high position in his dad's company, a very expensive apartment in the heart of New York City, he's very handsome, is engaged to a beautiful woman (with a few girls on the side..) and he likes to kill random people because he likes it... Yes our Patrick is actually very unhappy about his life and claims he doesn't feel empathy or love at all. He's so out of touch with humanity that several people mistake him for someone else, even people he knows for years. His only escape out of his life of wealth and power are his fantasies of sex and violence and acting out on it. But how long can he go on without people suspecting something? Or is everyone so busy with boosting their own ego's that they fail to notice that there is a psycho in their midst?This movie does a good job in displaying how a mind as twisted as Patrick Bateman works and how he is on a downward spiral as the lines between his violent dreams and reality get more and more blurry. I was impressed with Bale's performance, especially the scene where he breaks down and calls his lawyer and when he is going full blown crazy running around with a chainsaw. The rest of the cast also does a fine job in portraying the rich snobs and dumb girls that circle around Bateman. The only voice of reason and the only person who shows empathy is Bateman's secretary (excellent performance by Chloe Sevigny), I really liked her role in the movie.The movie started a bit slow though, the first 45 minutes could be chopped in half because some parts don't add much and are a bit dragged out. It also didn't feel like the 1980's, I was often wondering what the time period was supposed to be, despite the excellent 80's soundtrack. And I couldn't help but compare this movie with another story about a psychopath: Clockwork Orange, one of my favorite movies of all time. But I guess it takes a movie maker like Kubrick to really show how the mind of a psycho works. But like clockwork orange, this movie ending get's you thinking. It leaves it up to the viewer how to interpret-ate the events that happened.So all in all a good movie with a great performance of Christian Bale. Definitely check it out if you like movies about crazy people and don't mind a few violent/sexual scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Movie Review: American Psycho.,"*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.Movie Review: American Psycho.I'd like to say I'm slightly disappointed, but the movie isn't bad. I expected a lot more plot, the police part more present in the film, and unfortunately, I watched a kind of sick comedy, which is not bad, it just wasn't really what I was expecting.The investigator (Willem Dafoe) had interactions that, despite being very good, were very punctual in the film, in my view. This criminal cop side of the movie could have gone further, instead they did the wacky killer comedy, and that's okay.On the other hand, they brought the mental issue a lot, as theoretically happens in the mind of the psychopath, which is good, because it brings a vision almost not explored by other films.I would still like to insist on the idea that if Willem Dafoe had played the murderer instead of the policeman, it would have been a lot more bizarre, but it's just a daydream of my sick mind. Furthermore, this version of Bruce Wayne leaves Joaquin Phoenix's joker in the dust.It's a good movie, leave it to watch alone when you want to have a few laughs, if you like a darker humour. Otherwise, I think it's best to skip this movie.Rating: 3.5/5 - Good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A fun mood,"Everybody's a little Psycho.It's great movie and it couldn't have been better than it is. Christian Bale portrayed Bateman beautifully. The film told more then it actually showed, it kinda implied most of what you see. And you can easily see how brutal Bateman is, without the director showing the murders. The cast is great and Christan is the only stand-out in my opinion.I was not sure if I should give it a 8, but it's not good enough, then 7, It's not that bad. I decided to go with 7 cause I could not see it be with those masterpieces that i give 8,9 or 10.We get to know Patric really well in the beginning of the film(like we got to know Jordan Belfort in the beginning of The Wold Of Wall Street), he's a man who takes care of him self dose not care about other, his needs are always a priority. I want to see other film do that instead of doing unnecessary scenes just to learn a character likes this kind of flower.Overall it's a good movie there's nothing really special but there were memorable moments in it that all movie buffs should know. It's not a have to see, but i recommend this film to anyone who likes (moderate) bloody films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good but could have been better,"When I first saw the movie on opening night, I was absolutely astonished at how good a work of cinematic art it really was.  And then I read the novel. The film's script butchered the book, yet managed to retain a good bit of the story (as much as it could have, I assume).

Fortunately not as horrific as the novel extract I read,"Many years ago I read an extract in The Age newspaper of Bret Easton-Ellis' novel ""American psycho"". Didn't even manage to real all of it-I found it so absolutely vile I stopped reading it and knew that I would never read that book (the extract was the literary equivalent of coming across those photos from SBS TV autopsy shows in The Age-God knows why The Age feels that a TV guide needs shots of actual autopsies-again and again). The book then and now, presumably, requires it to be wrapped in a plain brown paper bag for taking away after purchase (as it's rated R).Anyway, the other night a commercial network here in Australia screened this movie around midnight. I PVR'd it and watched it soon afterwards. I'm assuming that it wasn't different to the cinema release.The plot: Christian Baile plays Patrick Bateman, a corporate high-flyer in the 1980's (with a touch of the Jim Carreys about him)- a time of corporate piracy and excess. He's about to get married, or so his girlfriend thinks and the petty jealousies at work fill him with such rage that he becomes quite the nasty psycho killer (Quest que cest?). This is the kind of slasher movie which has more in common with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" than Carpenter's ""Halloween""-i.e. you get a fleshed out portrait of the murderer and not some automotan killing machine. As in those movies, it isn't really a gore-fest, though one or two scenes in it are not very pleasant-to do with dismemberment.Apparently the novel was a biting satire of the excess of the times.That does come across in this movie, though I wonder if the book itself says more about the rivalry between artists (Easton Ellis) and the corporate world he seems to despise-in other words, perhaps the sickness of the novel says more about artists as a class than supposedly bad corporate raiders.There are a couple of telling scenes in this movie where others precisely pigeon-hole Bateman and you know they've nailed his character.Bateman is a very odd character-stylised and amusing at times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Shower Work Kill Shower Work Kill,"""American Psycho"" focuses on the excessiveness of the business lifestyle of the late 80s. It is an interesting exaggeration on several levels. Because it is such an over the top story, it is a good comedy and a good movie.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a typical businessman on wall street. He is a rich yuppie stud with an apartment that looks more like an art work. His daily morning activities include lengthy showers and healthy work outs. Patrick uses at least four or five various soaps and lotions to keep his skin smooth and perfect. His main area of focus is his handsome face. Patrick is also very fit since he tells us that he is able to do 1000 crunches every day. He dresses in fancy suits and goes to work, where we hardly see him do anything different than watch TV or listen to music. His favorite activity is going to expensive restaurants and having cynical conversations about business related topics. His friends are not much different looking than him. In fact, Patrick is mistaken for another man from his company on more than one occasion. This is no coincidence. The person continues to address him incorrectly, believing he is speaking to someone else. Patrick also has a girlfriend played by Reese Witherspoon. He hardly pays any attention to her. He prefers to listen to his walkman. Finally, whenever he finds the time, Patrick is a psychopathic serial killer.""American Psycho"" is very stylish and very well directed by Mary Harron. She creates simple and perfect surroundings appropriate for a man so concerned with his looks. Christian Bale plays the obsessive businessman very well. He gives the film the additional mechanical feel. Everything he seems to say is such a package. Nothing seems human, but rather an excessive and unnatural pose. He talks like an ad for restaurants and like a review of his favorite albums. Nothing seems to separate him from his friends, except for his dark secret. He takes pleasure in killing. And this seems very mechanical as well. Why does he do it? Why does he do anything?There are some great scenes in ""American Psycho."" One of them is the shower scene described above. Another excellent scene takes place in an office where Patrick and his friends are comparing business cards. They all carry them around in special metal cases as if they were worth a fortune. As they show them to each other, the cards seem exactly the same. Yet this is a tense scene. The subtle differences (the color of one card is described as ""egg shell"") create competition. Patrick shows signs of his paranoia as he realizes that his card is not the best one. There is also another good appearance by Jared Leto, who essentially serves the same purpose here as he did in ""Fight Club."" In my opinion, he is perfect for the role.And so, Patrick Bateman kills people. It has been criticized that the movie is pointless and there is no motive for all the murders. It doesn't matter. ""American Psycho"" is a SATIRE. The murders are funny, not always, but often. Patrick bateman is confused himself. He is having an identity crisis. This is the only thing that separates him from anyone else. The murders are an exaggeration just like the rest of his life.""American Psycho"" is a good film that lags at certain times. However, Chirtian Bale gives a great performance in a movie that is very attractive in its mechanical nature. It is such an exaggeration that it cannot be taken seriously like other serial killer movies. This is a comedy that looks good and works well. Overall, an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An Uncomfortable Viewing,"I rewatched this after 20+ years having a hankering to hear Bale's character over-analyze 80s pop artists in an amusing manner. This film gets more complex the deeper the story unravels. As to no surprise, Bale plays a serial killer who lives the high life while completely pampering himself, drinking with buddies in his sphere, sleeping with escorts and oh yah, murdering random people at random times. What compels him to do this? That is the underlying question. He sort of seeks help for his mental state but no one will truly hear him. Will he ever stop? The dialog in this film was strange and intriguing and the scenes were striking as well as uncomfortable. This is one character you may never forget.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Psychotically Humorous and Iconic!,"'American Psycho' is a really intriguing character study that dissects masculinity, consumerism, and individuality.Bateman's performance is iconic. He effectively brought this character to life, with subtle face movements and over-the-top gestures when required. You can often forget how humorous this film is as there is some absurdly funny dialogue and Bateman's snarky inner monologue.Furthermore, I thought the themes and character analysis presented in the film are fantastic.

American Psycho and movies based on novels.,"I'm a movie guy, what can I say. I wish I were `well read', I'm just not a book guy. That's not to say I'm an illiterate boob. I enjoy a good novel every now and then. But usually I rely on the printed page for books of the non-fiction variety.  I'm almost always irritated when I hear some snob complaining how the movie they just saw wasn't as good as the book. You know what I'm talking about. At one point in you life you have been on one side of one of those kinds of conversations. I'm usually on the side that says.'well I don't know about the book but the movie was swell' or `well I don't know about the book but the movie sucked' Either way I feel that a movie should be judged on its own merits. The two art forms, novels and films, are completely different.  At least I that's how I felt before I read Bret Easton Ellis's novel `American Psycho'. I picked it up because I was in love with the film. I sorta went into the whole experience of reading the novel expecting it to be a sort of `un-cut' version of the film. This intrigued me a great deal. Needless to say upon reading this great novel I came away less a fan of the film and more a fan of the printed work. The novel sort of ruined the film for me. And I in subsequent conversations with my pals I ended up on the other side of that afore mentioned book to film comparison conversation. I remember viewing my DVD of American Psycho right after I completed the novel and being completely disappointed. It now seemed that so much of Patrick's character arc was just ignored. His relationship with Jean his secretary was entirely ignored.  Characters names were seemingly arbitrarily changed. There wasn't enough narration, after the entire book was told almost completely from Patrick's narration. And that one scene in the film where Jean reads his journal and finds the macabre sketches seemed a complete betrayal of the story's first person nature. My problem at the time was that I was making all the comparisons that I think shouldn't be made when a film is adapted from a novel. The theatrical film medium is extremely limited in the narrative it is capable in bringing forth to the audience. Traditionally you get 2 to 3 hours and you have to rely on what is primarily a visual medium to adapt a written one. That is one thing most filmmakers and audiences forget. Filmmakers rarely utilize the picture tells a thousands words school of filmmaking and stoop to cheesy music and bad dialogue to get the point across. This is true for most films nowadays let alone those based on novels. And audiences foolishly expect a scene-by-scene adaptation of their favorite literary work. Once I re-examined my criticism I viewed the film sever times over. I came to the conclusion that it is indeed a good adaptation. It is brilliant how they incorporated the music review chapters. I also realized its not that the violence in the film is a watered down version from the book. It's more that those ultra-violent scenes are simply not in the film. When you think about its amazing how much of the book Marry Haron and Guinevere Turner managed to fit into their script. The answering scene confession stands out as one of the best scenes in recent memory. Bale deserved some recognition for this scene alone.So what we are left with is a good film with a verry Kubrick like feel. A film with amazing performances and witty dialogue, much of which was lifted strait from the novel. Though many of my complaints still stand, they don't ruin what is otherwise a worthwhile movie experience. One could do much worse when choosing a Friday night rental.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Good character study, not quite a movie","I know that this film has a lot of mixed reviews, but prior to watching it I had only heard praise, and because of that, I found myself being disappointed by the movie. It wasn't horrible by any means, in fact I would still call it pretty good overall, but I went in expecting great. If you read this prior to watching I think you should keep your expectations fairly low. I'm not saying that you'll hate it (some people love it), I'm just saying that you should be aware of what you are going into. This film is very focused on Patrick Bateman as a character, and less about the narrative he leads. The film hacks a coherent narrative, rather serving as a collection of scenes that flesh out the character of Patrick Bateman. There is a story that unites the movie, but I find it to be the weakest part of the film. Christian Bale does a great job as the character, and most of the supporting cast does good as well (though none are really developed as characters). The incoherent nature of the film could be entirely intentional as it is told from Patrick's perspctive, which is meant to be unreliable, but it didn't work for me.

A psychological and ambiguous piece that's as uncomfortable as it is satirical.,"'American Psycho (2000)' is an interesting and unsettling film that is never as straightforward as it initially seems to be. It's almost frustrating in its determination to not provide answers in the way in which you expect it to, though this is ultimately one of its core strengths. It's often an uncomfortable experience, using its comedy more as a tool to make you squirm rather than laugh out loud. The 'funniest' stuff is actually the smart underlayer of satire that roots the picture in a knowing world of its own. The plastic smiles of self-important businessmen are there to be examined on a much deeper and slyer level than you'd perhaps expect, before they're carved off with a chainsaw, that is. The feature trusts its audience to not only form their own interpretation of the plot's events but to also understand that it isn't as superficial as it may perhaps seem, that it doesn't align itself with its psychopathic protagonist even if it never directly challenges his actions. It's quite bold, in a way. It's also anchored by a fantastic central performance from Bale, who puts everything he has into playing his utterly unlikable character. Ultimately, the thing is ambiguous, challenging, smart and self-assured. It's compelling and unsettling in almost equal measure. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I do believe that Christian Bale did an absolute amazing work in this movie with this awesome acting... but I didn't find the purpose behind the actions... he is a psycho, so what...

Watered Down,"Of course, when watching the movie it is almost unavoidable that you compare it to Bret Easton Ellis's classic novel of the same name. Having been truly horrified by the disturbing yet entrancing mind of Bateman in the book, I watched the movie expecting incredible things. Somehow, in an intangible way, the movie just didn't sit well with me.As an individual film, it can claim to be something of a flawed masterpiece, a dive into the deep end of the human psyche and the nature of morality. Add in a dash of the theme of empty materialism, and you have a movie that should not soon be forgotten. A memorable performance from Bale, as he flies between flamboyant charmer to dead eyed murderer and everything in between, I don't think another actor could have done a better job. Add a slew of great supporting actors, including a surprisingly decent turn from Jared Leto (whom I normally avoid at all costs)and you have the makings of a classic.However, the movies somehow just can't live up the mastery of the novel, and the seemingly random switches between Bateman's abstract thoughts and his terrifyingly intimate descriptions of his murders just don't seem to flow here. Also, the movie never lived up to the true disgust created in the novel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Great perfomance!,"However, the script doesn't quite match Bale's intensity. Ellis's novel is a darkly satirical exploration of the American dream gone grotesquely wrong. It relentlessly skewers the superficiality and moral ambiguity of 1980s yuppie culture, using Bateman's escalating violence as a metaphor for the emptiness lurking beneath the materialistic facade. The film adaptation, however, dials back on the satire. The violence, while undeniably disturbing, lacks the same symbolic weight. Scenes that push the boundaries of taste in the novel feel gratuitous in the film, stripped of their context as a critique of societal ills.Would watch again for sure!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best films in Christian Bale's career.,"This film is based on a book I never read and talks about the life of Patrick Bateman, a successful New York stockbroker who lives for appearances because of his exacerbated materialism. He loves appearances, personified on his perfect face, on his business card, in his home and ostentatious way of life. However, he feels that something is missing, and that he can not be complete with just that. Then he begins to kill and maim all those he can (prostitutes, beggars, people he hates) in order to extricate the contempt he feels for others and feel a more intense emotion. Thus, this film becomes a huge criticism of the world of appearances in which we live, and in which a monster only needs to look beautiful and successful to be well accepted by our society. However, its such an implicit criticism that many people focus on the crimes and ignored the philosophical reflection around the character. Christian Bale was huge in the lead role, and his strong and impressive acting is undoubtedly one of the main reasons to watch this movie. He is definitely to be congratulated, having made in this film one of the strongest roles in his career. The rest of the cast gives the actor a strong foundation for him to grow and shine. In spite of all this, it is a hard-to-watch movie, with very crude and violent images of murders and mutilations.

"Great subject, but poor casting, acting","I like the subject of the movie, particularly this confession at the end scene reflecting the moral story of it."" My pain is constant and sharp. And I do not hope a better world for anyone.In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. ""But I am not sure if the cast, acting, camera , music were overwhelmingly supporting this moral message.Though there were a couple of scenes I loved.One was when Patrick wants to kill Jean scene where he says ""Put it in the carton"" to Jean warning for the spoon she was going to put on the table.I love this about his obsession with order and neatness. This was also a reflection about his concerns about his face, body,
dressing that he is putting so much energy for the life style his surrounding expect him to be.Another scene was when Patrick and his business friends showing off their business cards he goes mad with jealousy , because Paul Allens card looks better
There should have been more scenes showing off Patrick's greed, jealousy, and resentment in more horrifying but also subtle way.And he also hates himself for all this
But the link between his hate of himself, and his murders were not strong.Also about the cast, I have doubts if Christian Bale was the right person for this movie.I think only two characters were ahead of others giving more enjoyment.One is Jean (Chloë Sevigny), and other one is detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Watered down version of the book,"For those who didn't read the book, the film is a shocking and disturbing film. After reading the book, I was hesitant in seeing the movie, because I knew it would probably be  disappointing and tame in comparison. I was right, although I was relieved that most of the violence is implied, rather than explicit. The torture/murder scenes in the book are sickeningly violent and cruel. Had Quentin Tarantino directed this one, he would have held nothing back, and the movie as whole would be better. The movie comes across as flat, truncated, and very watered down.

American Psycho - A Flawless Exercise in Style and Madness,"I have to return some videotapes, but first, let's talk about American Psycho. Directed by Mary Harron, this film is an exquisite dissection of materialism, masculinity, and the sociopathic tendencies lurking beneath a perfectly tailored Valentino suit. It is, without a doubt, a masterpiece of aesthetic precision, drenched in neon-lit excess and ice-cold brutality.Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is, simply put, mesmerizing. He doesn't just act-he becomes a god among men, sculpted to perfection, a walking embodiment of '80s consumerist culture gone horribly, beautifully wrong. His monologues, delivered with a mixture of deadpan sincerity and manic glee, elevate the film into something more than just a psychological thriller. It's a work of art. A symphony of blood and Armani.Harron directs with the kind of detached, clinical precision that would make even the most callous Wall Street executive shed a single tear of admiration. Every frame is polished, every shot composed like a high-end fashion ad-except instead of perfume, it reeks of insanity and murder. The soundtrack? Impeccable. New Wave hits from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins, and Whitney Houston punctuate the carnage with a twisted sense of irony. It's almost as if Bateman himself curated the playlist while meticulously selecting his next victim.And let's not forget the business card scene-a masterclass in tension, proving that true horror isn't always in the act of killing, but in the silent, soul-crushing competition of men who all look exactly the same. The bone coloring. The subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark.But what truly elevates American Psycho beyond its slick, blood-stained surface is its ambiguity. Is Bateman a killer? Or is he merely a product of a society that is so numb, so vapid, so obsessed with appearances that reality itself has lost all meaning? The final moments leave us questioning everything we've witnessed, a perfect reflection of the film's central theme: in a world of faceless elites, true madness blends in seamlessly.10/10. Not just a film-an experience. But then again, does it even really exist?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What Brand Was That?,"In this movie, we follow the character Patrick Bateman as he tries to cope with his obsessions in the capitalist system of eighties America, a time when everyone and everything was about brands. First of all, the movie gives the audience the message it wants to give, but it also has some surprises for those who pay attention to the details. In the movie, we see that Patrick Bateman is a classic white-collar worker. Patrick is an obsessed individual who cares too much about himself and his possessions, so far so normal. What is not normal is the dose of these obsessions. Every person has obsessions, but the level Patrick has reached is not only about himself, society has made him this way. Because of the signaling value of goods in modern life, there is a race between people with high levels of wealth. Even if it's a very clichéd example, the business card scene is a scene that summarizes the whole movie, to give another example: When Patrick puts a bag with a dead body in the trunk of a taxi, a friend from work comes and asks him the brand of the bag. Apart from these, in this movie we also see how the value people give to each other decreases, at many points in the movie the characters confuse each other's names. In short, we watch the character of Patrick Bateman who has psychological problems due to the pressure of the social order on him. I pay my respects to everyone who contributed to this work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Book was better,"I waited for weeks for this movie to come out. I read the book first (which I try to do always) and loved it. When I sat down to watch the movie, I noticed that in a lot of places it was word-for-word with the book, but the scenes were all out of context...didn't work well. The movie was a black comedy, a far stretch from the book. I know that murder and rape scenes must be cut back for the movie, but it just took away from the whole story line. The movie was entertaining, and I didn't feel bad about forking out the$6.50 to see it, but my suggestion is to read the book AFTER you see the movie...you'll like it much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Don't touch the watch,"American Psycho is notable for its unique and disturbing portrayal of Bateman as a psychopath with a meticulous obsession for superficial appearances and material possessions. Christian Bale delivers an outstanding performance as Bateman, fully immersing himself in the role and capturing the character's unsettling nature. Bale's portrayal of Bateman is chilling, as he conveys the character's lack of empathy, his obsession with perfection, and his descent into madness with disturbing authenticity.One of the strengths of American Psycho is its biting satire of the materialistic and superficial culture of the 1980s, particularly in the world of Wall Street. The film presents a scathing critique of consumerism, narcissism, and the shallowness of the yuppie lifestyle, as Bateman and his fellow bankers indulge in excessive spending, shallow relationships, and a complete disregard for human life.The film's dark and twisted narrative is visually complemented by Harron's direction, which effectively uses stark and minimalist aesthetics to create a sense of detachment and unease. The use of color, lighting, and music all contribute to the film's eerie atmosphere and enhance the portrayal of Bateman's deteriorating mental state.However, it's worth noting that American Psycho is not for the faint of heart. The film contains extremely graphic and brutal violence, explicit sexual content, and disturbing scenes that may be disturbing and offensive to some viewers. The film's depiction of violence, particularly towards women, has been a subject of controversy and criticism.In terms of flaws, some viewers may find the film's nonlinear narrative and ambiguous ending confusing or unsatisfying. Additionally, the film's dark and disturbing themes may not be suitable for all audiences, and some viewers may find it too unsettling or disturbing to enjoy.In conclusion, American Psycho is a daring and controversial film that offers a disturbing and thought-provoking exploration of a psychopath's mind while providing a sharp critique of 1980s consumerist culture. Christian Bale's riveting performance, combined with Mary Harron's direction and the film's dark and satirical tone, make it a memorable and impactful viewing experience. However, its explicit violence and disturbing themes may not be suitable for everyone, and viewer discretion is advised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Best Movie of 2000 so far,"If you lived through the 1980's, you'll have a much better time seeing ""American Psycho"". Brett Easton Ellis' often gory novel is done as a brilliant satire of the Me Decade, and is hilarious to boot. Anyone expecting a slasher film will leave disappointed, but the intelligent movie goer will have a great time. Christian Bale's breakthrough performance as Wall Streeter-slash-killer Patrick Bateman will make him one of Hollywood's most sought after actors. Forget him in ""Shaft""; Bale is perfectly cast as the well-to-do yuppie with the unquenchable thirst for violence and murder. Although it bombed at the box office, ""American Psycho"" will be one of those flicks that achieves cult classic status on video.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Underrated, but could have been a masterpiece","Don't let the fact that it's about a psychopathic serial killer fool you -- It's anything but a slasher flick. You won't know what to make of it once you are done watching. In fact, what the film is really about is hard to pin down. You will feel that you have learned something, but what exactly? Wall Street scum? Rampant narcissism?As far is the source material is concerned, it's watered down just enough to give it a realistic opportunity of screening in theaters without being tossed outta the window. Keeping such things in mind, I'm confident enough to call it the most faithful adaptation possible without inducing vomit.This exploratory film treks through so many levels. While it delves into the mind of a psychopath, it also simultaneously manages to somehow represent the ills of modern society on screen. Valuing matter over mind, the empty social consumerism, empty words, empty lives, an empty people. It would make a Wall Street corporate yuppie uncomfortable, while those who are too far gone might just even relate.The voice-over dialogue adds to the film's already potent thematics, invoking a better look at the psychopath's mind and inner turmoil. The abstractions and confession-like style pays tribute to Wall Street ills. Yet the tongue-in-cheek tone keeps the portrayed social horrors from getting too heavy.The highlight however is Christian Bale's portrayal of the lead narcissist, Patrick Bateman. There is an intense focus on vanity and appearances involving effeminate morning routines and insistent workouts. The high status he has made for himself provides an eerily effective buffer between his outer appearance and inner turmoils, blending well into his equally shallow peers. A bit too well in fact, unwittingly emphasizing the not-so-stellar performances by the support characters. While Christian Bale's fascinating performance stands well against the rest of the cast, it is hard to tell if he was born to play narcissists and psychopaths or if he butchered the role (no pun intended). The shallowness of his expressions is remarkable, but not particularly terrifying. Whether it was Oscar worthy or not, I leave up to you.While the film (especially the ending) leaves something to be desired, the pioneering aspect does make up for some of it. Nearly two decades later, the film still feels relevant and will continue alluding to film connoisseurs further still.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Read the book by Bret Easton Ellis!,"I really liked the film, not loved, but liked. There is a strange feel throughout you could feel Bateman's loneliness and self absorbed self through the screen. Christian Bale is fantastic in this, he is the film's credit. There are lots of scenes in the film that are very tame compared to the book, I read the book a few years earlier and it is..... terrifying, scary, macabre!! The film has a softer edge, with a lot of the violence from the book not used in the film it makes me wonder if a German or other European filmmaker made it would it be more true to the book? When it comes to the end of the film and he has committed all these murders you want there to be a great ending, which it doesn't quite have. Overall this film is good, watch the film first then read the book!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"The opposite of ""Deathwish""","""American Psycho"" (2000) didn't look like a promising film for me. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of ""Deathwish."" In ""Deathwish"" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in ""American Psycho"" a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.I also got the joke. ""American Psycho"" is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).Thankfully, ""American Psycho"" has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And then the final act strongly hints that none of the murders are real; it's all in his mind and he's going deeper into insanity.***END SPOILER***I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but ""American Psycho"" has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.The runs 102 minutes and was shot in Toronto and New York City.GRADE: B- or C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Incredible Acting, Loose Story","The acting by Bale in this one was nothing short of incredible. Really the acting from all the characters was good. This was not a ""slasher"" movie as one would expect, there actually was some depth to the script. The inner monologues by Bale were fantastic and the dark comedy was sneakily placed and was a great touch. The score was a little funky but played the perfect opposite role to the Psycho. While the script was good, the overall story was very unstructured and disorganized with no particular meaning. Lastly, the Wall Street ""vibe"" wasn't too much, but some aspects were cheesy. Overall, the acting by Bale is enough to watch this as it is an incredible performance and has some great monologues.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Living through the 80s could make ANYONE psycho,"Not a bad film at all.  Christian Bale is GREAT.  Stylistically it is a very, very interesting movie.  The satire of 80's culture is definitely fun to watch if you lived through it.  The dialogue is bang on and the cultural references bring back many painful memories of the idiotic trends (pet pigs anyone?)  The humour is especially sly at times.  For example, all the guys have such similiar haircuts, its futile trying to tell them apart, yet you don't really have to in order to understand the story.  It's the little jokes like that that do it for me.  In addition, the mostly off-screen violence was especially well done.The one problem with the movie is a loss of momentum.  It begins ferociously with Bateman displaying his incredible self-indulgence and force of will. Gradually this slips away as the movie's clarity becomes unfocused in parallel with Bateman's deteriorating psyche.  I think the director could've improved things for the audience either by distancing the narrative from Bateman's perceptions, or by fusing them together more tightly. Unfortunately, she sort of sits on the fence, so we're left doubting her direction.  There are also a number of awkward scenes that really didn't have much point.Still, for all the things this movie could've been, it didn't come up too short.  Definitely worth a rental and I'll be on the lookout for her next picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A detailed explanation of the wealthy Americans on Wall Street,"It is one of the most important films during the last 20 years and one of the powerful movie that left an impact on American cinema. The film talks about a hysterical, insane, murderous character who herself is a character who realizes from within that she is a murderer and describes herself with important dialogue sentences that talk about the nature of the character in the voice of the hero himself.Patrick Bateman was a thug who wanted to convey his suffering to others, and he did not see that no one had a future. He did not show any good feelings to anyone, because his suffering wanted to convey it to everyone around him, while he was without emotion and did not desire anything but hatred and hatred for everyone. It was these sentences at the beginning and end of the movie that were a complete description of the character.The director wanted to show the viewers the nature of Wall Street work and who works inside it in the old periods of this time, and all their concern and only goal was appearances and pretending with suits, glasses and cards that they made for themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A socio psyco path horror movie,"Before starting my review, i would like give a disclaimer that, this movie is not for weak hearted and sensitive people. This movies is all about brutuality, killing bloods and shed everywhere. Please do watch if you have a strong heart. The movie talks about pattrick bateman starring christian bale. He just literally killed with his performances. Oh boy just simply amazing what a performer. No one can give justice to this character other then chrisitian bale. He is so elegant and psycopath he showcased is too good. The climax was anti one. This movie also gives a question whats the take away, which is nothing. The story is good, screenplay seems to be as usual. But overall a good horrific movie experience. Please do watch it available in prime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
