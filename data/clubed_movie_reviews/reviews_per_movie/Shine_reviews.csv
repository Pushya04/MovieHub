Powerful film,"""Shine"" purports to tell the story of David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush, who plays the adult Helfgott), a promising pianist who overcame mental illness, with the help of his wife, and returned to performing.The 1996 film is actually a fictionalized version of Helfgott's life - but even had it not been based on a true story, it remains a powerful, intriguing film.David is the child of German émigrés who now live in Australia. His father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is a self-taught pianist who teaches David his same love of piano and classical music. There is love there, but as portrayed in the movie, Peter is a rigid man who gives his son mixed signals. He drives his son to succeed as a pianist, teaching him that winning is everything, and yet, when David has opportunities that would take him away from the family, Peter won't permit it. The reason for this is that Peter and his wife lost relatives in the Holocaust. Peter is also given to physical abuse toward David when he loses his temper.David finally gets away from him and attends the Royal Conservatory in London, where, with the help of his teacher (John Gielgud), he wins an important competition but then suffers a severe nervous breakdown. The rest of the movie deals with the road back, which leads him home to Australia and to his wife, Gillian. Gillian is actually his second wife, though the first marriage isn't mentioned in the film.The dominant performances belong to Rush and Mueller-Stahl. Rush does a brilliant job of showing us the likable but stuttering David who speaks rapidly and repetitively, expressing himself through music. Mueller-Stahl as the tortured Peter is fabulous, a man who is both monstrous and pitiable. In a small role, John Gielgud of course makes a fine impression as an elderly teacher, a wonderful pianist himself, who believes in David's talent.The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. What I missed in this film is music - there was a lot of talk about David's promise, but until the Rachmaninoff not much playing.Helfgott's work today has been deeply criticized for being - well, lousy. A review in The New York Times of one of his concerts is horrible. The reviewer, however, mentions that Helfgott occasionally showed vestiges of excellent technique. I think it's safe to assume that his playing nowadays is more erratic than it was in his earlier years. There are several examples of Helfgott's playing in the movie: ""La Campanella,"" ""Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 In C Sharp Minor,"" ""Flight of the Bumble Bee,"" Rachmaninoff's ""Prelude In C Sharp Minor, Opus 3, No. 2,"" the previously mentioned Rachmaninoff 3, and Liszt's ""Sospiro,"" and it is all quite stunning. Rush does the fingerings himself. One of the comments also claims that Helfgott's wife has Helfgott perform on no medication so that he'll seem crazy - it's common for performers on medication for mental problems to have to cycle off of it before performing. I don't think the commenter has any idea what Helfgot is like on his medication - certainly in the film, he acts strangely.""Shine"" is highly recommended for its fantastic performances, beautiful music, and its inspiring story.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Intense, Well-Acted & Photographed Movie","This was a very interesting movie and pleasant surprise, although sometimes that theme of the obsessive parent driving a kid crazy gets overworked. Nonetheless, it's a very well-made movie.Geoffrey Rush is fascinating in the lead role as ""David Helfgott."" However, I would give equal kudos to Noah Taylor, who played Helfgott as a teenager, and to Armin Mueller-Stahl, who was Helfgott's father. They were just as impressive as Rush.This is a supposedly true-life story of child prodigy piano player from Australia. As you can imagine, the music in here is excellent. Even better is the cinematography. Wow, this looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.Although not always pleasant to watch, the story is riveting; hard to put down once you've started watching. The ending turned me off a bit with the overt plug for astrology, but is a happy one for all parties and at least leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.In all, a very intense, beautifully-photographed biography.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"excellent film, good in all departments, seriously moving","This is a good film in every sense but will mean most to fathers with strong views :).The story of a brilliant young pianist whose relationship with his father drives him to some sort of mental illness.

A stunning film,"This movie is definitely in my top five favorite movies of all time.  It is unbelievably brilliant.  Geoffrey Rush, dare I say, is perhaps the greatest actor of modern times.  His performance alone is worth watching, let alone the outstanding supporting cast!  Definitely not in typical Hollywood fashion, the movie is a truly great indie film.  A must see for music lovers and indie film lovers alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful little story that is interesting for the majority but heartbreaking at times,"David is a stuttering, rambling man having suffer a complete breakdown as a young man.  However when he was a child his skills on the piano were unmatched.  Driven by his father, opportunities open up in front of him to go abroad to learn, but his father denies him the chance.  He leaves for London where he drives himself to the point of exhaustion before coming back home to find his father has disowned him.It took me years to finally watch this film. I was still in Northern Ireland when it came out in the cinema and such films were not permitted to cross our borders, lest they keep the latest action movies from our 1 or 2 screen cinemas!  So away from the hype and the Oscar hoopla I sat to watch this film and found myself easily taken in by it.  The story is the true story of David Helfgott who was a boy genius before his breakdown.  The film starts with him as an adult then jumps back to see him as a child.  This approach works well to allow us to see the `end result' as it were, before we see what would be considered the causation factors.  These factors are a little heart breaking to watch but they are very well delivered.  As an adult, David is comic, warming and tragic.  The pain in his life is brought out very well.A great deal of the praise for this must lie with the wonderful cast. Rush got his Oscar of course and I'll leave it to the users on the message boards to argue over whether or not you can be the lead actor with screen time of less than half the film!  He is great, walking a difficult line with a `disabled' character but managing not to just make it a caricature at any point.  David as a child is very well played by Rafalowicz and does more of the development work than Rush and hence gets less credit than he deserves for making us care for the adult David.  Mueller-Stahl is as good as he can be and gives a great performance, the only downside being that he doesn't age a single day between the adult and child sections of the story - surely some makeup could have been used?Overall this is a very enjoyable human story that is driven by several really strong performances in key roles.  The story keeps it's tone light but yet still manages to be dramatic and, in some scenes far too touching to avoid being slightly moved.  The music is beautiful when it is called on to be and dramatic at other times - the director does very well to make the intense music translate into intense scenes in the film.  Overall a simple story of a man but one that is interesting and a lot more moving that I expected it to be.",,Anonymous,Music
One of the great biopics.,"""Shine"" is one of the great movies of the '90's, that became an unexpected success in 1996 and was the movie that earned Geoffrey Rush his as of yet only Oscar win and got the movie 6 more Oscar nominations, including best director and best picture.The movie shows how Australian born David Helfgott gets formed and influenced in his early life by his demanding and abusive father (wonderfuly played by Armin Mueller-Stahl), who is in strict control of the family. He asks a lot from the already very unstable David and influences ever step in his life, probably also to make up for his own shortcomings in life. He's an unpredictable character with two faces and you can really feel the fear he puts in the family and David in particular. Things go worse and worse mentally for David as he grows up and eventually goes to study in England at the Royal College of Music. He has a breakdown which for once and for all definitely labels him as a psychotic man. His personality could definitely been described as crazy.He gets perfectly and beautifully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, who truly deserved the Oscar he received for his role. But in fact he is only in the movie for perhaps halve the running time. For ""Shine"" uses lots of flashbacks about Helfgott's early life and as a young adult, when he is being played by different actors. One of those actors is the know very well known Noah Taylor, who also plays the part fine. Also really impressive is Armin Mueller-Stahl. He doesn't usually have very big parts in English spoken movies but in this movie he plays one of his bigger and more interesting roles. It's a true memorable performance from him and he also truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie. I keep thinking it's a great shame he got discovered so late by the big-money movie industry, since he is already close to 80 by now, which should mean that his biggest and greatest roles should already be behind him by now. But who knows, some actors just go on forever, till a very old age. Take for instance John Gielgud, who also stars in this movie. At the time he was already well over 90 years old and he would continue to play on in many more great and big productions, till his death in 2000. Some actors are just truly born as actors. It simply is in their blood and they can't stop playing.Moments in Helfgott's life are never portrayed too long but also never too short. This means that the story always comes right to the point and doesn't dance around it. The movie becomes very effective because of this and on top of that gets presented with a good steady pace. It's a reason why this movie is really one of the better autobiographic movies ever made. It's a really great directed and told movie, from Scott Hicks.But of course like every good biopic, the movie doesn't only presents facts and some things are altered, in order to enhance the movie and its story or characters. For instance right after this movie the real Helfgott became a true full God, while in all honesty David Helfgott is a great piano player but just not the genius one as portrayed in this movie. It's kind of like the piano man. The mysterious mute man who was found in Kent England in 2005. It was said he was a brilliant piano player, while in fact he just simply knew how to play a piano well but was by no means a great or professional player. Just like David Helfgott, it are just the unusual circumstances and character personalities that makes people say they are geniuses, rather than it's an objective reflection of their actual qualities. But like I said, this isn't anything unusual to do for a biopic, to play around a little with the facts and it certainly is no objection when it actually enhances the movie. ""Shine"" truly benefits from its approach and story.I also enjoyed David Hirschfelder nice little musical score (also Oscar-nominated). Of course the movie also benefits from it's classical compositions that are being featured. It's of course a very musical movie, since it's about the life of a musician but you really don't need a classic musical lover to enjoy or to appreciate this movie though.The movie ends quite abrupt and perhaps not satisfying enough but this is of course simply due to the fact that David Helfgot is still alive and active today. Who knows, perhaps they could had better waited for another 30 years to come up with a movie about his life, for who knows what more strange and beautiful moments his life shall know.Perhaps it's not the most stylish or greatest made movie but the combination of the interesting unique story, pace and main character (and of course Geoffrey Rush his performance of him) are what makes this movie such a basically flawless (you simply just forgive the movie for its flaws and shortcomings while you're watching it) and captivating one to watch.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A little slight on the writing, but the acting and presentation is brilliant","When I originally saw this film in the mid-90's, I was absolutely devastated throughout the first forty-five minutes.  So much so, I was pretty much uncontrollably weeping, much to the chagrin of the friend I went with.  Time has softened the film a lot for me, but it still remains a powerful, tender and somewhat inspirational film about a piano prodigy who has led a pretty tragic life.  Geoffrey Rush is unbelievable as the piano prodigy David Helfgott, and although the film is kind of sewn up a little quickly with the Vanessa Redgrave subplot (what about Helfgott made her so in love with him in a short period of time as to want to marry him?) it is a very well done film that I highly recommend to just about anyone, but especially musicians and music lovers.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Title Says It All,"DAMN, is Geoffrey Rush a great actor, or what? I saw ""Les Miserables"" on video and ""Shakespeare in Love"" in the theater shortly after seeing ""Shine"", and I didn't even realize it was the same guy. Very, VERY well deserved Oscar for him. The movie is very good, of course, with an interesting story about how genius is both a blessing and a curse-but it's Rush's show, and he uses every minute of it. And I do love Rachmaninov, so that's a bonus for me. Quietly spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Quite superb...,"SHINE is a compelling and touching story about music, talent, performance, pressure, and redemption. Scott Hicks' masterpiece is difficult to summarise in any traditional review or comment because it touches upon so many facets and ranges of human emotion. It is no surprise that this tale, based 'loosely' on the life of pianist David Helfgott (I say loosely because this is by no means a strict documentary, as many liberties are taken with the script) was nominated for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, and were it not for THE English PATIENT, would have walked away with the grand prize.Geoffrey Rush as the adult Helfgott is amazing and his Best Lead Actor victory for his portrayal of this musical genius was well-deserved as the performance was simply breathtaking. A popular complaint is that Rush was only on screen for less than half the run-time of the film and as such should not have really won. The counterargument is such: it is the quality of the performance that counts, not the screen-time. Armin Muller-Stahl is equally impressive and deserved his nomination. My only gripe is that Noah Taylor was not given at least a nod for his portrayal of the younger Helfgott.The writing, cinematography, and musical score are top-notch and transform this Motion Picture from good to great. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 250 at 206. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Dragged Down By A Weak Second Half,"Somewhat reminiscent (in the basic story, at least) of ""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""Shine"" offers a take on the story of Australian pianist David Helfgott. I understand that there's debate on the accuracy of the film, both in terms of Helfgott's background and his piano playing skill. Knowing nothing of his background and little of the skills needed to play the piano, I'll choose to avoid the controversy and deal simply with the movie. It started off very strongly. The first half offered a powerful exploration of Helfgott's childhood, at the hands of a domineering father as well as a look at the early indications of both his abilities as a pianist and the first hints of mental illness. It was a little bit slow paced, but interesting nonetheless. Something happened, though, at the point at which David seemed to go truly insane after his Rachmaninoff recital. The movie itself seemed to lose its focus at that point, and it became what seemed to me to be a largely unconnected series of events offering a taste (but not much more) of Helfgott's later life in a rush, which was far less interesting than the first half. Geoffrey Rush was truly excellent as Helfgott, as was Alex Rafalowicz, who played Helfgott as a child. I was also impressed with Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Helfgott's father. The character of Gillian (played by Lynn Redgrave, who became Helfgott's wife) seemed to be introduced far too quickly, and I had no idea how they ended up suddenly married. Redgrave did well with the part, but there was little substance to the character. As far as I recall, there was also no mention of the fact that Helfgott had been previously married.The comparatively weaker second half pulled this down a fair bit in my estimation. In the end, I'd say it was OK, but not much more than that. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A consistently eye-rolling clock-watcher.,"If you're looking for a fantastic film about an eccentric, self-imploding, mentally unstable, real-life musician, check out The Devil & Daniel Johnston. Based on its reputation, I thought the Rush performance might be entertaining & impressive enough to make Shine engaging; and while he's good, he's really not in it much, the movie focusing more on the daddy-issue flashbacks, a character motivation that is among the most boring & cliched ever.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
What a difference a 2nd viewing makes,"I don't now why but when I first viewed this a few years back I did not care for it, but after watching it again I was very impressed.  Maybe because I have grown more of an appreciation for classical music in that timeframe. I really don't understand how I could have missed the outstanding portrayal of the nuturing/stultifying father-son relationship, or the moving way that David can only express himself via the piano (notice how he speaks in virtually only apothems).  This is a very great film.",,Anonymous,Music
"""Good God, man!  You can't let him play Rachmaninov's Third! He'll be killed!  KILLED, I tell you!  No-one has ever ..."" etc.","Tortured genius, domineering father, piano music, blah, blah, et cetera. ""Shine"" may be a good movie, but its best friends couldn't call it special.The script isn't at all strong and Hicks tries to make up the deficit with creative presentation of one kind or another.  David is obsessed - at any rate, the film is obsessed, it's not clear to what extent David is - with Rachmaninov's third piano concerto (implausibly referred to as the ""Rach 3""), the first movement in particular.  We never quite hear this movement. We hear in the background on an old gramophone (throbbing dotted notes in the bass entirely inaudible); its themes are woven into the film's score; and in the big climactic scene where David plays it in public for the first time, sound effects are distorted so that we hear almost everything EXCEPT Rachmaninov's music as it really is.  And clearly a lot of work went into arranging the shots in that climactic scene.  The result is a much more creatively presented ""moment of truth"" than is usual in this kind of film.If the presentation isn't threadbare cliché, though, much of the content is. ""Shine"" does all the standard scenes very well - moments of triumph here, moments of despair there - but lacks an overall story that might make some sense of them.  (This is particularly odd given that Scott Hicks felt not at all concerned with sticking to the facts of Helfgott's life, or even getting it vaguely right.)  In the end it feels like an exceptionally well made nothing very much.  Watch it for the performances - those of Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush in particular.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Geoffrey Rush's Tour de Force,"This is a marvelous bio-pic of a man who suffers throughout life for his art. David Helfgott, an Australian, is a wunderkind pianist who is abused and betrayed by his father, and robbed of his childhood. It is sort of the classic smothering that takes place when a sensitive artist loses his soul for a time. Eventually, Helfgott gets to perform but finds himself immersed in schizophrenia and mental illness for years. The world lost him for a time. But there's more to the story. Geoffrey Rush, whom I had never heard of at the time, is brilliant as the damaged artist. He expresses the deep depression of the character and his genius. The film is able to show the darkness of the soul through its cinematography. The film is inspiring but only because of its portrayal of pain",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic Fingers,"Pianist David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush), driven by his father and teachers, has a breakdown. Years later he returns to the piano, to popular if not critical acclaim.I have to say this film did not personally strike me. That is not to say it is a bad film. It is very good film. But just not one that really captured my attention or made me really care about the characters. There is something to be said about talent, genius, mental instability and many other things, and this film says a little bit about each of those. But it did not hit quite hard enough.On the plus side, we have Geoffrey Rush. Today (2015), he is probably better known for his part in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, but some of us remember when he had some great dramatic roles.

A tribute to music and love,"A brilliant film, an intense story, very well performed and directed. One of my favorite films ever. I think George Geoffrey was incredible in this film...he became Helfgot and so did Mueller-Stahl in his role as the father. Sir John Gelgud plays a very important role in the drama as the teacher that marks a notable difference in getting the best from Helfgot. It's a chant to courage, love and music. A must for all music lovers...usually emotional people.

Tender Realization of Prodigy,"It is really difficult to tell who is the genius of this project - Rush or Hicks.While there have been many movies of this type, real story of a disabled but uniquely gifted artist, this one sets the standard.  The story behind the movie is that it took Hicks and then Rush about a decade to develop and finance the whole project.The research that was invested in that decade of preparation paid off in a priceless work of art.

Shine,"This movie is thrilling and so emotional that i think you should be mentally and emotionally old enough to actually be able to understand the true meaning. To understand how someone goes through a mental illness is not for any 'sane' person to understand. Although the hard work put into the movie does justify some aspects of it, the movie as a whole does not tell the truth. I think that the movie skips very important parts of the story such as the time David spent in the mental institute, and we do not get the understanding that he has moved from America to Austrlia.

But ... it's really bad!,"I just can't believe there's nobody else who feels as I do about this movie. I'm not a film snob, and will try to see the good in most movies, but I just found this one hugely objectionable. It actually made me so angry, sitting watching it in the cinema, that I nearly became one of those people who makes derisive noises & spoils it for everyone else (managed to keep a lid on it though, just barely). It's so, SO intensely irritating! I have a feeling nobody here will agree but I need to express this. It's annoying because it has:1)Lame, clichéd characterizations (not the lead, but supporting/minor characters, eg his family, particularly all the women in the family) 2)Patronizing depiction of mental illness (I don't mean to criticize Rush's acting here. It's more the combined effect of script/direction/production) 3)Incredibly heavy-handed, clichéd depiction of the father's issues resulting from surviving the Holocaust (ditto above comment; I didn't have a problem with the actual performance) 4)General oversimplification, hollowness and reliance on emotional manipulation to cover up a lack of insightThe above intruded so much on my consciousness that I just couldn't ignore them & let myself get caught up in the music or the story. I did try.OK, I know ... you all hate me, and all the critics from all the papers disagreed too. I just had to get it out of my system. Sorry.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Plausible harmony,"Okay, so I did some reading after this driven by idle curiosity about the account. The real Helfgott didn't spend 15 years abandoned in a room with a piano, he didn't have to stand in the rain outside of a bar before they would let him in. He was pretty well known in the local scene as a pianist, his father was not a Holocaust survivor and David had been married before. Father and son were never really estranged and David was present at his funeral.But just the same, the 'objective' point-of-view that purports to explain him, or any of us at any time based on a few facts, is in the end no less hypocritical than any attempt to pass dramatization as 'the real story'. This matters. Someone can be present at a funeral without being truly present, and someone can feel forgotten and alone even when they're factually surrounded by people, estranged from a parent even when formally this was never so.The film is at a simple emotional level where the attempt to conquer a maddening complexity (music, life) snaps the tethers of mind and in due time the reconfiguring of this damage into blossoming art. The moral is that we must keep trying and hope for the best, perhaps the worthiest lesson even if it appears slightly trite in the context of a more or less happy ending.Still, why feel the need to invent all those things, knowing you are doing so? When the violence inflicted on the son could be inferred by a more ambiguous tension instead of an outright beating.Because, it seems, we can only choose to accept the lesson if at the center we find a good soul worthy of the saving. In other words, it is not the fact that he gives a great last recital that matters, but that he plays at all; not that a genius was salvaged because he might never have been that, but a human being. And this is what rankles so much Helfgott's critics who find him borderline incompetent in his playing - he is cheered on in concerts because he is the character from this film.Ideally we would be able to discern all these points here instead of one harmony: the truly damaged but kind soul, the inability to place blame for that damage on any ogre father or Holocaust, and being able to somehow experience his music (the real Helfgott recorded for the film) as a trained ear would, fixated flourishes followed by distraction and incompetence according to critics, musically extending the damaged self.For a more demanding film on the same subject of madness and transcendent musical genius see a little known film on a medieval composer called Death in Five Voices: all about the dissonance between different voices trying to harmonize a story and this carried in the music itself.",,Anonymous,Music

The ending showed that Helfgott found out what kind of selfish man his dad was , and cared less when he found out he was dead.Every movement in Rush is absolutely impeccable i thought he was really going through a mental problem, after this movie Rush became one of my inspirations along with Pacino,Penn, Brando, Depp, Day-Lewis and Nicholson.

Music is the universal language,I was so mesmerized by this movie I forgot to watch the Derby. All three actors who portrayed Helfgott were astounding.  And when the Rachmaninoff piece played I couldn't take a breath til it was done-- the power of it washed over me.  The whole film portrayed the power of talent over the deprivations of love.

Abuse does not cause schizophrenia--let's all repeat--Abuse does NOT . . .,"This is a nice story, but it is very troubling how the movie suggests that David's mental state, which is obviously schizophrenia, is somehow cause by his father's abuse. Schizophrenia is an organic brain illness. No one know exactly what causes it, but it is not caused by parental abuse. It seems that nearly every summary of the movie states outright that David's father creates David's ""nervous breakdown."" This belief takes us right back to Freudian psychology of the 1950s, when the belief was that schizophrenia was a reaction to ""refrigerator mothers."" The movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" was more realistic in depicting how schizophrenia strikes seemingly out of nowhere and is a diabolically difficult disease to ameliorate in any way. It is a disservice to all of us to suggest otherwise. Again, it's enjoyable to be swept along in the story, but if you take away the premise about the cause and cure of Helfgott's illness, the movie feels a little hollow.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Based on the life of pianist David Helfgott, who, suffered a mental breakdown and spent years in institutions comes to life with Rush's most urgent performance to date.'Shine' as a film, is a notch above the ordinary. Some biopics are fascinating, but 'Shine' is fascinating and memorable only because of Geoffery Rush! Nonetheless, it's a well-made film.I don't have much left to write about the film, and if I start writing about Rush.. then this review might not even end.

Shine! Shine!,"It's hard to be an artist, both talented and in turmoil by inner demons like David Helfgott. Geoffrey Rush deserved his Oscar for this role. He truly brings the character alive and well to the audiences. Lynn Redgrave deserved a supporting actress nomination for her performance as the woman who would turn out to be the love of David's life. Googie Withers, one of Australia's best known actresses, played beloved Catherine, his mentor and financier in David's younger years. John Gielgud has a brief but memorable performance. I like the fact that they filmed this film in both Australia and England. This film really examines mental illness and how David triumphs over the odds. He was down and out and forgotten. Somehow when you hear his music, you remember how much he triumphed over the odds. Despite his mental breakdown at what would have been the beginning of an extraordinary career, he was down but not out. He had to recover and slowly work his way back to the living. When David plays music, he becomes alive and genius to us. Many people have been where David has been and are still going through the pains of life. This movie is an inspiration for all of us, artists-writer, performers, painters to get up and rise again. When he returns to play live in a small Perth bar, you get chills down your spine. It's a great kind of film and you wish to be in Perth, Australia.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

An essential viewing for those who enjoy music and world peace.,"And most of us do enjoy music. This film is about a story involving the beauty of people, artists, who can be successful, important, and influential without being a leader. The musician is an artist who has an aim at giving aesthetic satisfaction to an audience which is honestly expressed here.Absorption of his satisfaction does not exist, of itself, but of a moving of an audience to a higher goal. The movie gives pleasure, advancement of humanity, and a feeling of how the professional advances are even more private to himself, not shared with the audience.The classics and quickness of kindness and civility among all is captured and recommended, as it has been since 1996, in prolific reviewers and growing audiences today. It is likely to be a standard for progressing beyond that which may be considered a class conscious era in time where the ulterior objectives is not about the perceived ill will or untoward actions of a parent.David shines with his talent and kindness without regard for an audience of viewers pointing out disparities in a real life that is favorably depicted from what is shared with an audience in the film. A caring and ethical respect for special interests and challenges among us all calls for a certain feeling that makes you want to better yourself and remove any judgmental conclusions you may have.I recommend it for all audiences noting how happy the cast portrays a loving truth we find in a talented individual who has integrity in his life.

Moving moments but not a film one takes to heart,"A well-intentioned dud, the kind of movie that has critics raving around Oscar time before it falls off everyone's radar. ""Shine"" chronicles the true story of David Helfgott, a piano virtuoso who suffered a mental breakdown early in his life while under the thumb of his demanding father--who, for the purposes of melodrama, is not just embittered and jealous but abusive as well. Solid performances can't compensate for the jumbled, stop-and-start narrative which skitters over most of the real story, leaving it off-screen. Films about domineering dads go back a long way, to ""Fear Strikes Out"" and beyond, but the clichés have remained intact. This father-son relationship doesn't work because director Scott Hicks and screenwriter Jan Sardi (working from Hicks' original treatment) are too literal-minded about the material, which seems dramatically heightened anyway. There are moving moments, and Geoffrey Rush is worth watching in his Oscar-winning portrait as Helfgott, but the picture itself is rather cold. Seven Oscar nominations in all. Rush also won the BAFTA out of eight nominations, as did the film for Best Sound. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Who Knew That Playing a Piano Could Be So Much Work?,"""Shine"" is a pure joy to behold.  Produced in Australia, it tells the true story of piano prodigy David Helfgott.  Helfgott suffered a major nervous breakdown on the threshold of an imminently great career.  The story shows him through a psychologically trying childhood, to his teenage years when he perfected his skills, to a stay in a mental asylum, and his subsequent return to stardom.  Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) played Helfgott during his teenage and adult years. Armin Mueller-Stahl is also excellent as the abusive father (in an Oscar-nominated performance).  However, the film stalls on several occasions.  This is bad considering that the film is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  Lynn Redgrave's role is terrible, she is totally wrong for this film.  ""Shine"" is a prime example of a near miss.  The film is very good in almost all aspects, but these problems keep ""Shine"" from being the masterpiece it should have been.  4 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Music
Very good film about a great musical talent,"""Shine"" is a great story that needed to be told, and put on film. That it was at all is an amazing story of coincidence itself. This is the story of a boy, David Helfgott, with innate musical talent (some would say ""genius""), who excelled in an Australian state competition then went to London to study and win awards at the Royal College of Music. But during that time, he had problems including Schizoaffective disorder. He later returned to Australia and has been playing and performing since then - to the present, in 2022.The movie is a biographical sketch that is well done. But in true Hollywood fashion (even of films made in Australia or England), it skips some things, adds and massages parts, and fictionalizes some of the story. A considerable bone of contention raised by various family members and acquaintances is the movie's portrayal of David's father, Peter (Elias Peter Helfgott) as a mean, overbearing person with David much of the time. On David's return to Australia, his family welcomed him back and cared for him.The movie portrays Peter as forbidding David to leave Australia because it would break up the family. A brother, sister and other relatives and acquaintances have said that Peter was worried that David wouldn't be cared for, because he had begun to show mental disorders. There is that discrepancy in the film that leads one to wonder how Peter is so proud of his son, as he says, and he wants him to excel even more. But then he opposes scholarships and offers for David to study in America and then in England.The film skips over David's first marriage and some aspect that are less attractive. It's heavy focus is on his character and his disorder. Geoffrey Rush plays it superbly, but judging from other articles and stories about Helfgott over the past couple of decades, his performance probably exaggerated David's condition considerably. Still, for the film it was superb and worthy of his Oscar as best actor.I read articles and listened to interviews and questions and answers about the film given by the director, Scott Hicks. He tells how the film came to be, and the efforts that the makers put into researching, talking with David's acquaintances, etc. It's a wonder then that there would be considerable criticism of the portrayal of David's father in the film, by family members and friends.One can't help but wonder why some might have thought the story for this film needed to be adjusted and fiddled with at all. When Hollywood makes films based on real people and their stories, but glamorizes and adds fiction, the audiences don't wind up getting the real person and his or her story. Are audiences so dense, inconsiderate or demanding that they can't see and appreciate the real details of a person's life? Do so many things have to be changed, made softer or harsher, or glamorized - to sell movies?",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fantastic story, mediocerly executed","Shine is a Fantastic true story of Pianist David Helfgott and his battle with mental illness, brought on by several factors in his life, each resulting from his ""piano prodigy"" status. Although the story is a fascinating one, and very touching at times, it seems to me, to be executed quite poorly for the big screen. David's mental illness itself seems rather inconsistent throughout. One minute he will be talking erratically in his own way, and the next he will be entertaining guests at a modern cafe, by gracefully playing the piano, with several women at his side, only to return to his former state moments later. This only serves to remove any belief in the performances of the cast. One thing I think really took away what could have been a fantastic film, is the portrayal of Helfgott, by actor Geoffrey Rush. It is evident from his initial scenes where he has gotten his inspiration for the role (Dustin Hoffman in Rainman) but the result is more of an embarrasing imitation of an eratic Woody Allen. I know that many people regard this actor as one of the greatest of our time, but Shine represents quite the opposite.What we have here is a fantastic story of battles though life, turned into a fantastic screen-play, and subsequently, and quite sadly, turned into a simply mediocre film",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Shine has a few clouds,"***************POSSIBLE SPOILIERS HERE******************************Shine was a good film but in my opinion, has a few holes that the viewer must assume to fill in the gaps. A film should try and title it's location, especially if it is out of the U.S. I'm assuming that Shine took place in Australia by the credits. Also, when a film goes back to someone's past, like in David's case, they should tell the audience how many years ago it was. The major hole in Shine is what exactly was David's disease?  One place I read said it was a nervous breakdown brought on by David's father and teachers. It seemed to me that it was a form of Parkinson's disease that gradually progressed over 15 years or so.The best part about Shine was the relationship between David and his strict father. David's father seemed worried more about losing his only son than what David could actually accomplish with his gift. It's too bad that the film didn't focus a little more attention on David's ""condition"" and what the root cause of it was.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not the kind of film that's easy to hum along with, but it's brilliant work","A great piece of music -- and this is especially true of works for piano -- conveys a mood or sometimes many moods; it is incredibly affective. While listening you might feel comfortable and at ease at one point and then suddenly chaotic and unsettled at another. This is certainly true of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3 in D minor, the challenging piece that ""Shine"" main character David Helfgott aspires to master. The piece plays a pivotal role in Helfgott's story and as such, this film based on him brilliantly reflects its beauty and turbulence.""Shine"" is not a typical biopic in this way: there are no scenes written or dragged out solely to open your tear ducts. If that happens at all, it's purely incidental. The only thing that's truly reminiscent of a standard biopic is the first half of the film telling the story of Helfgott's childhood and rocky relationship with his father.The beginning is chronological as one would expect, moving logically from scene to scene, showing Helfgott's talents and his father's refusal to let him become his own person. Armin Mueller-Stahl is excellent as the father. He manages to take what we first associate as merely stubborn, stern and demanding and make us really understand that it's not black and white. Though he beats David on two occasions, he doesn't simply become the ""abusive father"" you get in many biopics: he is clearly struggling with David's success and and blind to the fact that he's become possessive and is living vicariously through him. He might indeed be unfairly manipulative, but we clearly see the world view (Holocaust survivor immigrated to Australia) behind it.When Helfgott finally escapes to London to learn at the Royal School of Music, attempts Rachmaninoff for a recital and suffers a breakdown at the conclusion of the piece, suddenly the film becomes a series of clips: scenes that appear to be in order but lack clear objective and purpose with exception of David's piano skills returning bit by bit.This recital/Helfgott's breakdown scene is the best in the movie. It's the first act climax that takes the story out of childhood and into David's struggle to become himself again as seen through the incredible Geoffrey Rush. The Rachmaninoff starts off easy, comforting and grows in intensity. Suddenly there's great suspense to the film and we see David sweating profusely, cut-ins of his father listening to a recording and then silence and blurred camera-work. In the moment, director Scott Hicks' work here might feel over-dramatic, but as the story continues and we never fully get an explanation of what happened (such as why Helfgott needed shock treatments) it becomes emblematic of the struggle Helfgott went through.The end feels disjointed and its pacing frantic. The expectation is that David will make this miraculous comeback and in truth he does, it's just not with the surge of a full string orchestra playing in the background -- it's with the subtlety of Liszt, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schumann or Chopin. It's a bit devoid of feeling or satisfaction but it's justified by the way Jan Sardi has ""composed"" the film. The story is happy being focused on the upbringing and less so with Helfgott's rehab despite Rush's Raymond Babbitt-quality performance. The lack of a cookie-cutter emotional climax and crying and hugging scenes will rub some average viewers the wrong way, but ""Shine"" deserves a good deal of admiration.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't expect a lot of screen time for Geoffrey Rush,"Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, it must have been a weak year. Geoffrey Rush was solid but with such a short amount of screen time I feel his Best Actor Oscar wasn't fully earned. That was my main issue, it took over an hour for Geoffrey Rush's performance of David to fully 'shine'. It was an interesting story but sometimes the passing of time wasn't fully explained to the audience.I appreciate that Shine was based on a true story but the amount of cigarettes that David smoked made me feel a bit sickly. I had a read of the trivia after watching and it seems the filmmakers took some liberties especially with the portrayal of the father.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Movie,"I developed an appreciation for classical music after watching this film. All of the characters who played David Helfgott (different ages) were excellent, particularly the actor who played the adolescent Helfgott. A must-see for people who do not know his story. The Rachmaninoff concerto towards the end of the movie, the performance that precipitated Helfgott's breakdown, was done exquisitely. I played it over and over again and still get chills when I hear it. Geoffrey Rush delivers a stunning performance as the adult Helfgott and allows the viewer to understand the sensitivity of such a brilliant pianist. Overall, the three stages of David Helfgott's life were portrayed by each actor in a way that allows one to see how the effects of being driven by others as well as driving one's self, can create instability, particularly in the sensitive, artistic mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Bit Foggy,"After reading the many user reviews, I think it's great that the movie has made more people appreciate Rachmaninoff's music. And I'm glad this movie made people appreciate how fragile the mental psyche can be. I had some challenges, though, getting past the basic premise of the movie.It has been proved, medically, that a traumatic event, or series of traumatic events occurring close together, can trigger a build up of serotonin or other chemical that can cause (in a highly susceptible individual) what would have been called - in those days - a mental breakdown.But the movie shows such ranging symptoms and treatments, it's difficult to understand exactly what happened. Maybe the symptoms changed from adolescence to adulthood? It was like night and day. I would have liked to have understood what happened better, and lacking that information, I found the inconsistent symptoms distracting.I'm sure many will disagree, but I also have to say, many of the children born to WWII survivors and veterans grew up in what would be considered inappropriate or volatile households today. Counseling came in the form of a casserole in those days. The WWII survivors are the lost generation - growing up in an atmosphere of war and terrible fear - and often themselves just a bit mental after all they had been through.As a result, with corporal punishment considered the norm, an overbearing (WWII veteran/survivor) parent was not unusual. What was unusual was how the child reacted.... if the child was predisposed to mental fragility and broke down.I have no quibble with the acting (although I think Noah did the lion's share of the emotional scenes, while Geoffrey did the virtuoso scenes, so I'm not sure who deserved the Oscar more); all were excellent. The filming was lush, the music was quite good. I have gotten to the point where I just want to hear Sir John read the phone book and I'll gush adoringly. Lyn was awesome, Nicholas Bell was excellent, Armin was great.If the script has just given a bit more detail, provided a bit better understanding, I might have been less distracted and more supportive of the character. It was difficult for me to enjoy the movie as a whole because I could not understand the character.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Nearly Perfect,"A weak dénouement robs this film of perfection. The rest however is brilliant, staggeringly so. Ok you can argue the Rain Man act is done so often that its probably not that taxing on an actors abilities.

Living life through the balance of talent and skill.,"An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life.

It's the life story of David Helfgott, a pianist, how he becomes famous and then how he suffers a breakdown.

I did feel there were far too many piano sequences, it was certainly necessary to show David playing, but we did not need that much long takes, they are powerful at first, tiresome after a while. The cast is magnificent, Geoffrey Rush shines, as he always does, delivering a well deserved Oscar winning performance, his best scenes are with Armin Mueller-Stahl, the chemistry between them is very strong, bringing great passion to their roles.

Outstanding Rush,"Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment.

Simply amazing Geoffrey Rush...,"""Shine"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the life of the famous pianist David Helfgott. We follow him from his early steps as a pianist to his breakdown and his later years when he returns and starts play the piano again.I liked this movie very much and I believe it's one of the best if not the best movie of Geoffrey Rush. This movie combines very well drama with music and presents equally good the struggle as well as the obstacles that David Helfgott had to overcome in order to succeed and make his dream come true. The direction which was made by Scott Hicks is very good and I believe that he presented very well the main character, his dreams, his struggles, his relationships with both his family and his piano teacher. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that I was speechless with the interpretation of Geoffrey Rush who played as Adult - David Helfgott, he was simply outstanding and he won the Oscar of 1997 for the Best Actor in a Leading Role.

"Good, not great","There were just too many problems in this film for me to rate it as great. Geoffrey Rush did a great job, as did the young actor who played the early Helfgott.  The story was interesting, and the cinematography well done. Overall, it was a good film, but it had a few glaring issues I cannot overlook.First, if we are to feel sympathy or understanding for Helfgott's condition, it would be nice to know exactly what it is.  Is he schizophrenic?  Not sure.  I find the label of ""madness"" to be far too vague, and nearly cliché.Second, as a little research on Helfgott confirms, the filmmakers were not accurate in many aspects of the story.  According to his own family, Helfgott never broke down while playing the ""Rach 3"", nor was his father an abusive taskmaster.Third, there were just too many confusing and/or vague moments throughout the film.  There was a scene of David receiving electroconvulsive therapy, at one point, with absolutely no explanation of what was going on.  His relationship with his father, once he left home, was confusing at best. Similarly, Gillian tried to help David write a letter to his old music professor, but we never heard any more about that, either.  Loose ends and apparently superfluous scenes made the film sometimes hard to follow, and left me with an empty feeling at the end.Lastly, I take issue with the implication that overbearing parents and intense mental and emotional labor can lead one to mental illness. Schizophrenia, in particular, is not something caused by your relationships or activities.  It is organic.  Things can't ""drive you mad,"" in that sense. Certainly parents can cause mental and emotional damage, but if that was goal of the film, it should have been more clear.",,Anonymous,Music
It's true greatness shows up compared to A Beautiful Mind,"I saw Shine twice when it first came out, and then watched it again on DVD after going to see A Beautiful Mind - and was immediately reminded how good it was. Not to criticize the brilliant acting by Russell Crowe, but the portrayal of mental illness in Shine is 100 times better than in A Beautiful Mind - the combination of a sharper script, a more imaginative and braver direction and a deeper intention produce a vastly superior movie.Shine really does Shine - and despite the Oscars, it shows A Beautiful Mind to be pretty ordinary.

massive talent in fragile hands,"shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;""non one ever loves you more than me"", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it ""express so completely the inexpressible"" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to ""to play like there is no tomorrow"", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones.

The film and the man himself!,"Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

this is absolute must see movie,This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance,10.0,Anonymous,Music
A lovely film,"Based on the true life story of David Helfgott. Starts with the early years under his possessive father's roof. We discover that this boy is truly a talent and child prodigy pianist with a great future once he builds up the courage to break free from his father, even, if not especially psychologically. Finally one Day he makes his way to London. He goes to further his mastering of the art at the royal college of music now in his late youth where he is attempting his long time dream Rachmaninov's Rach 5, which basically if you ask me sums up life itself and that is why the next thing you know is that he has suffered an intense break down. And it is truly with the help of God that the tables eventually turn, and the fact that no matter how cookoo he appears you cannot help but feel for how adorable he is really. And eventually he finds real love which gets him back on his feet again and leave from the petty bar where he found some work as a pianist again and got his recognition back and basically get back to the stage and the light in which he belongs and that is another story.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This deserved Best Picture.,"Geoffrey Rush was virtually unknown when he played pianist David Helfgott in ""Shine"", but his masterful performance here opened the door to a versatile career in the ten years since. The movie shows how David had a real talent for the piano and wanted to go study in London, but his father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) - who had survived the Holocaust - was afraid of his son leaving home and wouldn't let him go. This eventually led to David having a breakdown, although he later recovered.Rush won Best Actor for his performance, and you'd better believe that he deserved it. If you ask me, this movie deserved Best Picture (why the hell'd they give it to ""The English Patient""?).",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Pretentious, mediocre","My parents bought me this years ago because I play piano. I thought the description of it looked dumb, so it has sat here for years. Last night, I had absolutely nothing else to watch, so I watched it.There are a lot of really major problems with this movie, most of which killed my ability to enjoy it.First, close-ups of someone playing the piano should be done with an actual pianist playing a piano. The old cliche of some ""actor"" banging away randomly at keys while the soundtrack plays perfect music just bugs me no end.Second, the concept of the ""Rach 3"" (ick) having the power to break someone is about like the Monty Python sketch about the joke that kills whoever hears it. It may make nice fiction to those who don't understand the performance of music, but it's actually also very annoying.Third, the overall tone of the movie is uneven and jerky. The overbearing father is too much of a cliche, the actor plays it like a cartoon character. Mommy Dearest meets Prodigy's Father, I'd say.I'll skip a lot of other problems, and jump right to the horrifyingly bad ending. I was about to leave the room to get some food, expecting to come back and watch the ending, but they started to roll credits! Did someone forget to end the story here or what?Maybe to some people this movie was excellent, and wonderful, or a ""celebration of the human spirit"". To me it was a perfect example of something the critics didn't understand, so they figured it must be beyond their comprehension, so they rated it highly. Bottom line: it was pretty bad, deserving of the obscurity to which it has now descended.I wish I had left the movie off and watched CNN instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Shining Through Darkness,"Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.",,Anonymous,Music

He loves to play the piano and likes to display his talent to anyone around, and later is able to display his talent to lots more people.

pushing children,"I found the film to be excellent. As for the reviews and psychoanalyses, I find the film to represent a typical human story -- of parent wanting the best for a child, but in essence causing harm --and of a child wanting to be whom he/she is. It is so easy to blame parents, for they are human, and thus fallible. Anyone who has had children, and who reflects on the experience of parenting many years later (e.g., as a grandparent), wishes s/he had done things differently. Yet children tend to emerge as they will--into beings with their own interests, desires, and aptitudes nevertheless. A good reminder can be found in Gibran's philosophies.

When he gets an offer from a music school in London his father gets furious and says he will split the family if he leaves. But the boy leaves and his father is devastated.Shine isn't a typical ""Hollywood"" movie about a boy where everything is bittersweet and everyone smiles and says happy things. No, this is a movie about true life and the tough way in growing up and become an adult. It's a story about a boy trying to be accepted in the world.The movie is based on a true story. I don't really know what the plot wants to say, but I have some ideas:1. The family itself is important, therefore you shouldn't move away to another country or so. 2. Not everyone can be famous. 3. Maybe as David's father says in the film: ""Life is a struggle you have to fight"".This is a movie filled with sorrow, happiness and some really good performances, among them Geoffrey Rush as David when he's an adult.

World-class Australian film,"While it was generally accepted that Australian films are usually quite good and have a great deal to offer, it was also a subconsciously conceded fact that, in terms of getting recognition from, say, Hollywood, it would be a step-by-step process. 'Shine', however, allows Australian cinema to jump a few steps and really get some world attention.Sure, there have been raging arguments recently as to how close (or how totally far away, as the case may be) the plot is from David Helfgott's life, there can be no doubt that this film is exceptional stuff.The fact that Geoffrey Rush won as Oscar for this film says it all. He really was the one playing the piano in the second half of the film (though Helfgott recorded the sound), so he deserves great credit for that. But that is not to take away from the splendid performance of Noah Taylor, who had as much screen time as Rush, and of Armin Mueller-Stahl and Sir John Gielgud. The cinematography is probably underrated, while most of the sets are fabulously appropriate. And the music undoubtedly appeals even to those who avidly avoid classical music.In a year when 'Jerry Maguire' was the only really good major studio flick, and independent films like 'The English Patient' and 'Fargo' won much acclaim, how good it was to see Australian cinema grasp the opportunity with both hands, and come out with something to be so proud of. 8.5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music
Geoffrey Rush deserved that leading role Oscar,"Coming back to a fondly remembered film after many years can be revelatory - sometimes recalled greatness remains, or even appears enhanced; in other cases, it's more like a bottle of not very good red kept far too long. But Shine, the story of just about world famous pianist David Helfgott, to me is firmly in the first category. The story was just as compelling and engrossing as I recall from the promotional fund raising screening in 1996, all proceeds to The Melbourne Chorale.This was the role that launched Geoffrey Rush's film career internationally, and the film world is the richer for it. Mueller Stahl is totally believably awful as David's overbearing father, where his child prodigy's achievements are the totality of his world. Noah Taylor as the adolescent David and Alex Rafalowicz as the child prodigy are wonderful in these roles, and the visual continuity is convincing. This provides a logical lead in to Helfgott's mental health issues in his early adult life, where he is seen in various institutions in London and Australia.The editing, where Rush is seem playing parts of the scores he can manage, with cuts to other pianists is convincing, and as a medium level player, Rush's visible upper body looks like he is playing most, if not all, of those difficult notes.If you haven't seen it and are interested in the psychology of performers, in classical piano music, or just a well told tale, make the effort to dig Shine out. I don't think you will be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Perhaps one of the most striking films in the work of Geoffrey Rush, and one of the toughest and most sincere portrayals of brilliance that cinema has seen to date.","Even though I'm a pretty serious music lover, and I've always loved classical music, I didn't know David Helfgott until I saw this film. The musical universe is full of prodigies who reveal talent since childhood. Mozart is perhaps the most famous example of this. However, it is one of those subjects that I feel we tend to overestimate, because you can also find prodigious children in other areas of knowledge, including the Human Sciences. It is, however, curious that we have so few examples of musical geniuses with solid and successful careers. Most pianists and musical performers, no matter how talented they are, depend more on their self-discipline and intensive training than on their basic talent.Helfgott, according to this film, had a difficult childhood, at the hands of an overbearing father, who basically pushed him towards a music career, realizing his talent. The problem is that the situation demanded a lot from the young genius, causing him to develop schizophrenia and several other mental problems. With serious speech problems (he stutters and talks compulsively), he is also incapable of maintaining a conventional relationship with the people around him. Of course, in the long run, we'll see how he gets around the difficulties and achieves consecration.Helfgott is played by several actors, but it is Geoffrey Rush who shines in the role. The actor was able, in this film, to cross the doors of international cinema thanks to one of the most complete and immersive portrayals of genius in cinema. Appearing on stage when the film is already halfway through, he dominates the entire work, imposing himself, demanding our attention, deserving applause. Even if the film no longer had any reason to merit - it does! - seeing the performance of this British actor would always be more than enough reason to justify a trip to the cinema. However, he is not alone: the film also gives us an excellent interpretation of Armin Mueller-Stahl in the role of the father, demanding and domineering. Noah Taylor, who gives life to the character of Helfgott in his youth, also leaves us with a job well done and of value.The script and direction also deserve a note of praise. Scott Hicks, who performs both tasks, has managed to create a film that is deeply dramatic, intense, capable of moving and making us think, without making the mistake of making it overly melodramatic or presenting things that are too dark and pessimistic. The film is deeply emotional, it even has several intense, almost painful scenes, but it is never a heavy film. In addition, the film makes a very clever use of cinematography and the soundtrack to lighten or thicken the entire environment in which the action takes place. In addition to the pieces by Rachmaninoff - a piano genius, but who finds equivalents in composers such as Chopin, Scriabin or Liszt, author of the naive but terribly demanding ""La Campanella"", for me the most difficult solo piano - the film has a vast repertoire of classical pieces skillfully inserted into the soundtrack. It's worth seeing how they are used in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Good, not great, film","Being a piano player myself, I was interested in this tale, even though I had no idea who David Helfgott was.  I found it a good movie, though not a great one; the whole thing about the Rachmaninoff piece having the power to drive people crazy was a bit pretentious, I thought.  Other than that, though, it was good, especially when Rush allowed us to see the quiet moments.  And I don't think we were encouraged to see him as ""special"" just because he was somewhat crazy, as some have charged.  I also think Noah Taylor, as the teenage Helfgott, was the most overlooked performer in the cast; this and FLIRTING prove he's got a lot of potential.",,Anonymous,Music
Virtuoso performance by Geoffrey Rush as a disturbed virtuoso pianist.,"Viewed at RIGA, Arsenals Forum IFF, September 20-28, 1998. SHINE (1996) written and directed by Scott Hicks stars Geoffrey Rush as an emotionally disturbed virtuoso pianist in Australia, freaked out by the impossible demands of a father who constantly abuses him with the memory of his own disturbed childhood in Europe and the loss of family in the concentration camps. The cruel father of the child prodigy pianist, passing on his genocide complex to the next generation, is heavyweight German actor, Armin Meuller-Stahl (b. 1930) who is in everything these days, and it ends with a rousing piano rendition of Rimsky-Korsakov's ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"" when the hero, after a long stint in an institution, recovers his senses to some extent ... The true story of David Helfgott (may God help him) -- very absorbing with tour-de-force performance by Mr. Rush. After this he'll be in everything! (And he was).Shine was one of the big films of the year and earned Rush the Academy award for for Best Actor plus a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting role for Mueller-Stall. Also nominated for Best Picture and best Original Screenplay. It included the last screen appearance at age 82 of British born actress Googie Withers who was a big star way back in the thirties (for example, in Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes""). Another elder British giant, John Gielgud, had a cameo at age 94! -- and passed away in 2000.

"Terrific movie, average DVD","Bear in mind that this was one of the first generations of DVDs thatwere released, and so many of the additional features that weenjoy now were never added in these earlier release titles. I dohope that ""Shine"" is re-released with more in- depth features,including something that focuses on David Hefgott, the pianist thatthis movie is based on. I truly hope the decision is made tointerview or document Helfgott in some way. Nonetheless, themovie is outstanding. I would urge those who enjoyed this film tocontact FineLine Pictures, who released the movie, and urge themto create a special edition DVD to include this.The real David Helfgott actually contributed as a musician (pianist,of course) for this wonderful film about his life, dramatizing hisstruggles through his childhood and breakdown as an adolescent.Yet it isn't about gloomy and depressing accounts but aboutsurvival and living to the best of one's abilities. Those who havelittle patience with people who are schizophrenic may become abit uneasy at the performance of Geoffrey Rush who played theadult Helfgott. Rush's acting was impeccable and very believable,which is why some might be a little agitated or confused at thestuttering and incomplete and rambling dialog by Rush'scharacter.But have patience in getting to understand Helfgott as the movieprogresses. It can confuse the viewer since there are flashbacksand flash forwards. But you know, this was one beautifullyproduced movie. It has had high replay, because the film simplytouches the heart. Just relax and allow the movie (and Helfgott'scharacter) absorb you. By the end, you'll really FEEL how much of ajourney that David Helfgott traveled to arrive where he did.And for those who enjoy Lynn Redgrave, my gosh. Her portrayal ofGillian was superb. Redgrave didn't even get any type of top billingand she didn't appear until late in the movie, yet I felt like Gillianand David were my own family by the end.The DVD's special features include a movie trailer, a video clip ofan award presented to Rush (look for Nicole Kidman and TomCruise together in the audience) and a somewhat unusually-formatted Q/A with director Scott Hicks (about a dozen questionsare displayed and when you select one, a video with an answer byHicks plays).""Shine"" wasn't meant to be a tearjerker movie, but it got to me.

The movie displays the audio in an obscure manner,to fortify and illustrate the difficulties and challenges of playing it without a flaw.Reviews on this,will support my opinion,since I have witnessed first hand one particular rendition by Arthur Ozolins of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra,who is brilliant,but respects the concerto as a formidable one.

a favourite,"This is one of my favourites. Rush is remarkable in this role as David Helfgott,  the famous Australian pianist.There have been some comments by other users claiming that a great deal of information is missing, however it would be impossible to show every fact of a  man's life in 90 minutes. This is a problem with film, that continuity and  believability issues are difficult to forgive. However the director/writer has  selected the information that he thought was most important with regard to portraying Helfgotts life as humanly and as cinematographically as possible, and we as viewers will have to trust him on that. Personally I think he did a great  job, and simply seeing Rush as David was far more inspiring and moving than spending time finding out about the particulars of his illness, or indeed accurately biographing his breakdown piece by miserable piece.  In fact I applaud the shape and timing of the manuscript which was based upon conversations between Helgott and the director/writer Scott Hicks.Another user, who labelled the film 'pretentious', being himself accomplished  with the piano, has complained about the embarrassing dubbing of music over the poor keyboard skills shown by the 'actors'. This is an interesting statement,  and if the learned gentleman had access to the director's interview on the DVD  version of the film, he would have found out that the 'actors' did actually play the  majority of the pieces themselves. I, unlike him, therefore thoroughly enjoyed  the playing sequences, especially Rush's who is a talented player in his own right.There are few actor performances that have me genuinely startled, but Rush's is  one of them, and at times his portrayal of Helfgott makes you want to believe  that they are the same man. Great stuff. Bravo sport!",,Anonymous,Music
For Every human being...,"there is a special place that one discovers the true meaning of creativity. This film captures the great imagination of some of the most highly artistic individuals in the world, their struggle, their fight for recognition, and their fight for anything but failure. I was truly mesmerized by the fact that they used Rachmaninoff's 3rd instead of the immensely popular 2nd concerto. This movie was not made for the general mass, but to see it is to have a moment of your own creativity.",,Anonymous,Music
1 more thing...,"i have just one thing to say about this film. geoffrey rush got an oscar. yes he did. but what he really deserved was another one for actually learning to become the character and one more for learning to speak like the character. i was forced to turn on my closed captioning on my television set because i was unable to understand. he talked so fast, it amazed me. well, thats all i have to say, even though it sounded stupid what i just said, i had to let it out.",,Anonymous,Music
