Not as bad as they are all saying,"Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent movie and Jolie should be proud of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good introduction to the book,"I never compare books and movies, but one thing the book has over the movie was the distinct unpreparedness we had for war. The planes were flying deathtraps, and the supplies were totally inadequate.Angelina Jolie had to make decisions about what to include and exclude in a two-hour film, so we missed a lot of important information that was in the book. No matter, the film itself was well worth watching. Not a great film, but entertaining.If you want to be shocked and angered at the aircraft manufacturers, the military that failed to supply the troops ( where have we heard that before?), and the absolute barbarity of the Japanese in their prison camps, buy the book.Come to think about it, watching the film will help you appreciate the book so much more.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unbroken,"I cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie ,are the themes of bravery,endurance and forgiveness outdated?It is well known that the regeime of Japanese prison camps was cruel to say the least.The acting of the lead players was faultless proving again that British and Irish actors can play the roles of Americans.I found the movie moving, inspirational. Yes it was violent but not gratious. Ms Jolie is to be congratulated on her directing. One question did the leads fast for their roles or was CGI used to give the impression of their skeletal frames.The ariel dog fights did use use computer enhancement as did the plane crash.I found this movie much more watchable than the much praised""American Sniper""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
First half superb - last half not,"Unbroken opens with an extended sequence of a bombing run by a US B-17 crew against Japanese targets in the Pacific, and the subsequent attack on the bomber by a squad of Japanese Zero fighters. This aerial combat sequence is one of the most harrowing of it's kind I have ever seen. You actually feel like you are in that plane experiencing that terror and exhilaration first hand. This segment cannot be over praised, it is that good. Another sequence in a bomber, where the plane experiences massive engine failure and crashes into the sea with the crew all on board is also very well done. The flashback segments on Zamperini's running career are also fine, the extended sequence depicting three airmen's time on a life raft floating in the middle of the Pacific ocean is well done. So far it's all good.Then we get to the meat of the film, the prisoner of war scenes, and the film becomes a ponderous slog through torture and brutal beatings of the main character by an effeminate and sadistic Japanese captor. This is essentially the entire second half of the film, and it becomes monotonous and numbing.The photography, sound , and music in this film were all award-caliber, and Jolie shows great promise as a mainstream director.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angelina Jolie really did a fine job directing Unbroken,"Just watched this filmed version of the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who eventually ended up at a Japanese prison camp during World War II, with my mom. We both were pretty shocked by the atrocious events that happened to him during that war especially that one Jap officer really torturing him in many scenes. Angelina Jolie really made quite a compelling account about his survival instincts and also his expert running during both high school and the Olympics of 1936. We also had a female cousin of mine visiting and she had to leave when it really was threatening to get intense. Also loved the footage of the real-life Zamperini running during the Nagano games of 1998 with the titles mentioning how he ended up forgiving the country where his tormentors were. So on that note, we highly recommend Unbroken.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A True Story of Courage,"During the World War II, the bombardier Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and the pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) are assigned in a rescue mission in an old plane immediately after a successful bombing mission. Soon two engines blow up and the plane crashes in the sea, and only Louie, Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock) survive. Louie is a former Olympian from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and stubborn since he was a kid, and he encourages his mates. After a month on the sea surviving in two rafts, Mac dies. A couple of weeks later, they are captured by the Japanese marines and sent to a P.O.W. camp in Tokyo. The commander Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) is a sadistic and frustrated man and treats Louis with cruelty since he was Olympian. But Louis is hardheaded and brave and is not broken by Watanabe, resisting his torture and inspiring his mates in the camp.""Unbroken"" is a film directed by Angeline Jolie based on the impressive true story of the former Olympian Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini. The story is engaging and the screenplay is well written, showing the personality of Louie through flashbacks. The reconstitution of the period is also excellent. However, there is lack of emotion and the film does not touch the heart of the viewer. The only feeling inspired by this film is anger and hatred towards Watanabe. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Invencível"" (""Invincible"")",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Maybe his life is just not suspenseful. Not!,"Director Angelina Jolie has adapted Laura Hillenbrand's great biography, Unbroken, and made a conventional story about one of America's true heroes, Louis Zamperini. I'll continue to think about how Jolie could have made this more suspenseful, considering Louis was an Olympic runner, stayed in a life boat for the world record 47 days, and survived torture in two Japanese POW camps.Although the film shows Louis to survive unbroken, despite the-Passion-of-The-Christ-like torture overdose, and follows his life story accurately, there's no soul, just dutiful recounting of the separate incidents. As a colleague commented, the real life footage of Louis returning as an old man to run the Olympic torch is more engaging and emotional than the whole film.The cinematography of the renowned Roger Deakins is splendid on land and sea while Alexandre Desplat's music swells with romance at the right times. Otherwise, it's business as usual—get the history right. For me, a filmmaker could play with the story to make it more meaningful and involve more emotion if she has to—and Jolie has to.The mediocre writing, that includes work of the Coens and the screenwriter of Gladiator, William Nicholson, repeats this trite line, ""If you can take it, you can make it."" Also this line, ""One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" doesn't sound right, whereas in the book, it does: ""A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain."" Now that makes sense.The villain, called Bird, should be a ruthless torturer with emotional issues tied to his lack of promotion and homosexual longings. However Jolie has chosen an androgynous Japanese rock star, Takamasa Ishihara, who doesn't click as mean or psychotic, just barking torture orders to fill his time with an occasionally enigmatic sentence or two to entice us into thinking we havedepth. Like the film, Bird promises much but delivers too little.As opposed to the boring torture—how about more of his home life or his search for Bird after the war? I want Jolie to do well—she has an exemplary family and solid career as an actress—but, with the negligible first directing effort, In the Land of Blood and Honey, she has yet to achieve as a director.""I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.""

"The Themes of Loyalty, Determination, Perseverance and Forgiveness Make This Relevant to a Young Adult Audience","Unbroken tells the life of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who joined the armed forces in World War II and endured tortured until the end of the war.Although Unbroken is the third film Angelina Jolie has directed, Jolie skillfully recounts Zamperini's life. The first half weaves in and out of Zamperini's childhood and life in the Japanese prisoner- of-war camp.Some of the cinematography is gripping, such as the scene in which Zamperini and his friends encounter sharks while they're lost in the middle of an ocean. The opening shots of Zamperini's crew struggling to stay alive in their airplane immediately engage the audience.Despite the occasional frantic scenes, the movie succeeds best by focusing on its plot, which is intellectually fulfilling. There aren't any extraneous scenes and the story is straightforward. However, I didn't feel emotionally connected. I was looking forward to watching Zamperini develop relationships with his friends during the war. But, there isn't much of that. The ending, which is when the war finally ends, feels a bit rushed and didn't feel gratifying. Most of the film centers on Zamperini withstanding suffering. Although Unbroken is rated PG-13, there are several violent scenes in which the protagonist is beaten. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18.Jolie's storytelling conveys the themes clearly. Zamperini was known as a troublemaker during his childhood. Yet, he worked hard to become a great runner and eventually was good enough to enter the Olympics. After his crew's plane crashes, he manages to stay alive, even despite a brutal 47 days stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. When he's captured by the Japanese navy and is sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, he endures severe beatings. When he's presented the opportunity to live luxuriously in exchange for aiding the Japanese, he refuses. When the war ends, he forgives his World War II enemies and fulfills his dream by participating in a marathon in Japan. The themes of loyalty, determination, perseverance and forgiveness make the movie very relevant to today's society. As Lauren Hillenbrand writes in her book, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption, ""A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain.""This inspiring movie is fitting for the holiday season.

technically sound but emotionally thin,"Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) is an Italian-American from Torrance, California. As a boy, he's a juvenile delinquent. Then his brother Pete notices his running abilities which takes him all the way to the '36 Olympics in Berlin. During WWII, he's a bombardier in the Pacific. He is captured and imprisoned by the Japanese.This movie looks good technically. Director Angelina Jolie shows her competency in that respect. Jack O'Connell is OK. There is simply nothing that jumps out. There is little tension and no excitement. The story rolls on like a recitation with limited emotional content. It's still an interesting life and a compelling one to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Incredible story, horrible screen adaptation","Louis Zamperini's story of survival was robbed of all feeling and emotion in this screen portrayal. Jolie has cast a very flat, laconic, and unconvincing crew of young Abercrombie models who lack the depth of seasoned actors who would have otherwise convinced us that there was actual pain and suffering throughout this. After a month afloat on a raft the three men's hair was well-groomed and one even had a goatee (are there razors in the survival kit?). I felt like I was watching Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers; if you have seen this movie you will know exactly what I am taking about.

"Good, but the spiritual aspects of Zamperini's life seemed like they were de-emphasized.","This film came out a few months ago, so by now there are quite a few reviews--so I'll try to make my comments brief. The film is a biography of the wartime experiences of Louie Zmaperini--as well as a few flashbacks to his life before the war. Zamperini was famous both for being an Olympic athlete as well as his being a prisoner of war in Japan--all of which he later wrote about in his biography. In it, he also talks about his difficulties coping with PTSD and anger towards his Japanese tormentors--as well as, with the help of God, he was able to let go of the anger and life a normal life. In many ways, this is extremely similar to another recent film, ""The Railway Man""--a film which, to me, is better and makes a much stronger emotional impact.What what did I like and dislike about the film? The aerial sequences were pretty amazing--particularly how they used wonderful CGI to make it appear as if Mitsubishi Zeros were attacking a formation of B-24 Liberator bombers. The story also was very interesting. But the film also seemed to be missing the spiritual and emotional side--and mostly only talked about this in the epilogue which was written only. In many ways, interesting but curiously uninvolving at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic movie making at its best,"I finally rented this movie which I had been avoiding since it was released over a year ago. I am glad I did because it kept my interest throughout. I thought the POW theme would be too depressing which it is but there is no glossing over that. Angelina Jolie has become an admirable director. I don't understand the hate directed towards her. This is an epic movie that is very well done. The film has won it's fair share of awards including three Oscar nominations. The acting is great. I am surprised the movie didn't receive more Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Lead Actor, Best Supporting Actor & Best Director. Also the Coen Brothers should have received more recognition for their screenplay",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jack O'Connell is outstanding..,"Lets just say I just saw a great movie about loyalty, courage, survival and redemption. Angelina Jolie has fantastic directing skills and its Oscar worthy. Jack O'Connell knocks his performance out of the park and he's proved himself with this great performance along with his performances in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71"". He embodies the characteristics of Louis Zamperini and the great wonderful life he lived. Jai Courtney had a small role, but really good surprisingly, can't wait to see him as Kyle Reese in next summer's Terminator reboot. The movie slowed at a point but picked it up and blew me away, O'Connell gives an Oscar worthy performance, but given the competition it's unlikely. Who cares though? This is one of 2014's best films and you'll see it at the Oscars I promise you that.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An amazing story, great characters, but very slow paced","Most people know Angelina Jolie playing in action movies. However, she takes the directorial path in this drama set in World War II. Jack O'Connell plays an Olympic track runner, who joins the army during WW2 in the pacific theater. When his crew face a tragic plane crash, him and his remaining crew members are stranded on life rafts, only to get picked up by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp.This movie was entertaining at times, but I felt it could have been done better. It was very slow at times, to the point where I began to lose interest. However, the plot was so beautifully written that I could not take my eyes off the screen (until the end). On the positive side, the characters were quite amazing too. Jack O'Connell did a great job as the main character. I personally think I could have landed in Oscar. It was very upsetting to watch the character struggle through the Japanese soldiers' maltreatment. However, the settings were quite authentic and the way the soldiers smacked and brutally beat down the prisoners gave the film a sense of emotional realism.Maybe this film would have been better if it was directed by Steven Spielberg or Clint Eastwood. All in all, the film wasn't bad and it is probably watching. However, I would not recommend this to children under 14 because it does pretty intense at times.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Must see! A man bigger than life.,"This movie was nothing less of greatness in documenting a man's life so epic on all human capacity. Louis fought with peace and integrity not just for his family, friends or his enemies, but for humanity. We will all die at some point in our lifetime; what do you want the world to remember you as? Despite, many critics and their open opinions about the film, we can't deny the bravery that exist within this film of which depicted Louis Zamperini and many who illuminated his life. Throughout this movie his life broadcast many struggles beyond war, beyond men, beyond race, beyond countries' borders, but of deep faith beyond persecution. Once can only image someone else's pain until they have walked in their shoes.

All Too Obvious Oscar Bait,"As Jack O'Connoll was getting acclaim for his performance in Brit thriller '71 towards the end of last year his star was beginning to burn even brighter by getting the lead role in Angelina Jolie's upcoming UNBROKEN . Cue lots of interviews with Jackie boy along the lines of ""so what's it like working with Angelina ?"" along with hints the film was going to be a major contender at the Oscars . Of all the films from last year this was the obvious Oscar bait . So obvious in fact that there's an element it might have alienated the voters in to searching around in independent cinema for its winnersO'Connoll plays Luis Zamperini an American from an Italian immigrant family who becomes an Olympic athlete . While he's at the peak of his career war breaks out and enlists as a bombardier of a B-25 and finds himself flying missions in the Pacific where he's shot down and spends several weeks in a life raft where he's captured by a passing Japanese ship and put in to a brutal POW campThis is the sort of movie that has the Oscar academy falling over themselves to throw awards at - an epic true life story of the triumph of the human spirit . Or rather it used to and for many years the Academy has been rather unpredictable and somewhat surprising in what its tastes are and what films they nominate and give awards to and there's a strong element in UNBROKEN that it's maybe trying a little too hard , almost as if it's looking at prospective awards ceremonies with sad puppy dog eyes pleading for prestigious recognition . There's also an element that nowadays the second world war is almost as well remembered as say The Napoleonic or Crimean wars and war films featuring WWII need to bring something a little bit different to the table such as the outstanding technical achievements of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , the no holds barred war porn of FURY , or the post modernist lunacy of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS . In comparison UNBROKEN comes across as being traditional almost to the point of being painfully old hatNot to be too negative UNBROKEN has a well structured screenplay by the Coen brothers , the sadistic brutally of the Japanese is emphasised , Roger Deakins once again shows us he's the best cinematographer working today and O'Connoll is Luis Zamperini and never thought for a second I was watching a young British up and coming actor playing an all American hero . That said it its motive with having one eye on awards means there's something missing that makes it an outstanding film and it's never better than being a competent tale about surviving against all the odds",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
survival under severity,"I had never heard of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini until he died last year. My dad had read Laura Hillenbrand's book about Zamperini's experiences in a Japanese POW camp, so Zamperini's death caught his attention. But the news that there was a movie about Zamperini's experience getting released caught my attention.Well, Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken"" isn't a great movie, but it's worth seeing. The point is that Zamperini refused to let his captors break him, hence the title. Seeing what the captors did, I got the feeling that anyone in their positions would do the same. War simply breeds cruelty.The movie's obvious downside is that Jolie probably made the movie with the aim of winning an Oscar. I didn't find the movie Oscar-worthy, and the Academy apparently agreed. In fact, some parts of the movie drug on too long. But I thought that it was a good look at how Zamperini stood strong in a desperate situation. Not a masterpiece, but something that you should. As for Jolie's decision to exclude the part about Zamperini's conversion to Christianity, that wasn't an important part of his survival in the POW camp, and there are a few too many movies in which people's faith ""saves"" them. The movie is good enough already.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A disappointment for this huge fan of the book,"I have been looking forward to this movie, having loved the book and admiring Louis Zamperini like so many others. While the movie was well-crafted and well-acted, it failed to blow me over emotionally. It's one movie that could have been longer, while at the same time tightening up the POW sequence by at least 15 minutes.The director, editors and committee of screenwriters (never a good sign) cut out too much of the back story of what shaped Louie's character as a kid, and (critically) his PTSD and religious awakening at the end. I know this would have made Unbroken a three- hour movie but Louie's story deserved a fuller treatment. Instead, the character is turned into a Christ-like vessel of suffering for his fellow prisoners, rather than a flesh-and-blood person, although he seems oddly unscathed by the ordeal when he reunites with his family.I was hoping for a ""Spielberg"" experience to leave me in tears, and it just didn't happen.

"'A moment of pain, is worth a lifetime of glory.'","Biopics touch people in a way few other stories do. In the case of UNBROKEN the film detailing the life of Louis Zamperini, from childhood in Torrance, California where he was a problem child until his brother Peter challenged him in more ways than one (and who has the most memorable lines in the script) to encourage Louis to run until he not only became part of the school track team but also an Olympic Gold Medalist and ingrained in his the indomitable spirit sense that reigns throughout this story. From the Olympics Louis joins the armed forces during World War II, sustained fighter plane crash only to be afloat at sea with his two companions for 47 challenging days then captured by the Japanese and placed in prisoner of war camps where he endures the cruel harsh punishment POWs traditionally undergo. The story is well known because of the history books and because of Laura Hillenbrand's novel.The screenplay is pasted together by Joel and Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and the film is directed sensitively by Angelina Jolie. Louis is portrayed by Jack O'Connell and his two at-sea mates are played by Domhnall Gleeson and Garret Hedlund. They all give credible performances as do Takamasa Ishihara the head of the prison camps, and Jai Courtney and Finn Wittrock who play major roles while the lads are airbourne.A point is made during this very long film that Louis tells God and Jesus that if he survives he will devote his life to their service – and then that is dropped somehow. The film does a fine job portraying the horrors of war, of prisoner of war camps, of the act of survival and in doing so it becomes a very moving experience. One wishes an editor would have been more sensitive to the prolonged sequences – at sea, in camps – but the film should have been made and we should never forget stories of truth such as this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I enjoyed seeing it immensely — and being in a theater that erupted spontaneously into applause at its conclusion because they were so inspired and uplifted by its powerful themes. My friends who have seen this moving film have reported similar responses from those in attendance — ranging from loud applause at the end to everyone in the theater standing up and applauding for extended periods of time. I mean really, how often does this sort of thing happen at movie theaters? Keep up the great work, Angelina. Hopefully, we'll be seeing more of your films soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Film,"Unbroken was a hard movie to watch because of the torture that Louie Zamperini was put under. When he was taken as a prisoner of war and stuck in a foreign country with the other prisoners of war, it really hurt me to see the way that the human race can treat another person. I think it is cool how at the end of the movie, it showed pictures and gave an update on Louie. For all that he endured, he went back to the people that tortured him and made amends with them. I loved how the movie ended on a semi-positive result even though it was kind of dark. Also, It put me at ease to know that he finally got to run the race he was training for, for so many years.

"Emotionally solid, technically marvelous WWII drama...but with a thick layer of masochism","In 1920s California, juvenile delinquent Louis Zamperini shows an early talent for track and field, eventually making it to the 1936 Olympics held in Berlin, but his endurance as an athlete is nothing compared to the physical tortures he endures as a bombardier during WWII. After surviving a plane crash in the ocean and being lost at sea for some 45 days, Zamperini and a comrade are captured by the Japanese, where they are interrogated and brutalized. Director and co-producer Angelina Jolie does a fine job bringing Laura Hillenbrand's non-fiction book ""Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption"" to the screen, with the gripping aerial action at the beginning particularly stunning. However, once Zamperini is blindfolded and led off to a POW camp in Tokyo, the movie becomes a checklist of masochistic horrors, complete with a sadistic Japanese sergeant portrayed in the same hissable manner as the Indians in an old Republic Pictures serial (with Jolie doting on actor Miyavi's smooth, unfeeling face). The entire second-half is an unending series of brutal, degrading humiliations which, though based on a true account, are not at all enlightening, varied or entertaining. We never get to know the victimized men holed up in this camp--they have no personalities--although Jolie and her scenarists are certainly adept at displaying their agonies and suffering. Strictly on a filmmaking level, ""Unbroken"" is a handsome, serious piece of work with fine performances and deeply-felt emotions at the finish line. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible story....,"I'm not sure if it's the cast, director or producer, but this film was missing the special ingredients that make a true story movie good/great.

This could have been a great 90 minute movie, but it wasn't. I found my attention wavering throughout. This is not a fair representation of this INCREDIBLE story of survival. Out of respect of the story I give this a strong 4*. If this wasn't a true story and if I wasn't a veteran myself this movie would be rated ALOT lower.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A slight disappointment,"Unbroken tells the life story of Louis Zamperini, former Olympian turned World War II POW and does so with some grace but ultimately falls victim to its own hype. Angelina Jolie directs this brutal and inspirational story of Zamperini and his struggle to survive in a Japanese POW camp after he is shot down over the Pacific and presumed dead. This story is so inspirational, it will bring tears to your eyes especially with the charisma and precision that Jack O'Connell brings to the role. The issue here is the screenplay. The film focuses so much on the brutality that Zamperini faced that it is hard to remember any other scenes outside of the torture that this man endured. Zamperini is portrayed as a determined, defiant force, challenging his captors at any chance he can. It is mesmerizing to think that this man overcame so many odds and survived so much and we had to wait this long for a film about his life. It is a truly amazing story that deserved a better screenplay that doesn't wallow in strictly the brutality that this man faced. Jolie proves that she can direct her actors and she does this brilliantly. O'Connell is a star in the making, starring in this year's prison drama Starred Up and now with Unbroken, he is an actor with a rage inside of him and he is destined for greatness especially after seeing this film. His performance ranks among the best of the year. The supporting cast includes Garrett Hedlund, Domhnail Gleeson, Jai Courtney and the magnificent Miyavi, each of them deliver fantastic performances. Garrett Hedlund as John Fitzgerald is a huge leap for the supporting actor and proves that he can rise to the occasion to shine. The screenplay written by the brilliant Coen Brothers is a surprising misfire as I said before. It stays on the brutality of the POW camp and struggles to move around POW movie clichès and it doesn't always work especially throughout its two hour plus running time. By the end of the second act, Unbroken loses its steam and becomes somewhat of a talk fest that doesn't mount up to anything remotely thought provoking. Roger Deakins, a frequent Coen brothers collaborator also turns in some lackluster cinematography that, in comparison to his other work, is bottom of the barrel and by the book. It looks more like a Clint Eastwood film with its monochrome look and doesn't do the film justice. Jolie does her best with a script that could have easily had more of a punch but she makes it work and turns in a decent film filled with great performances. Overall, it is a bit disappointing due to the hype that was behind it but, above all else, Jack O'Connell's performance is the perfect way to honor this brave, tough and brilliant man known as Louis Zamperini.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

It left me cold, I didn't feel a connection with any of what was happening on screen. Louis is such an easy character to sympathise with, he's somebody you naturally want to see survive and succeed, but I never felt that when I was watching the film.

Excellent,"Not many good reviews on here but I thought the movie was excellent, it kept my attention and I enjoyed the acting.Sure, there were a few bloopers, but what movie doesn't have them. I think Takamasa Ishihara did an excellent job with his understated menacing performance of the twisted, effete, Bird. He gave out just the right amount of controlled thwarted sexually driven sadism. I really can't fault his performance. What people forget is that some of the most evil people are those who appear the most ordinary or weird.Jolie has been given a rough ride of this movie, but she did a good job as far as I'm concerned and I think she can only get better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I was hoping for much more.,"A December 14 2014 story by Laura Silverman in The Telegraph had the tag line ""Louis Zamperini ran in the Olympics, spent 47 days in a life raft and survived two and a half years in Japanese prisoner of war camps, but it's his victory over anger that continues to inspire others."" Unfortunately, the movie concentrated entirely on the first part of that idea and not at all on the latter part.I'm not a religious man myself, but I was very anxious to see how AJ was going to portray that part of Louis' life in this movie. She did it with a couple of sentences on screen at the end of the film. Disappointing.I loved the book, and I commend Angelina Jolie for her attempt to bring the story to the screen. What she did put on film was pretty darn good. I just wanted more.If they can split the Hobbit into 3 movies (and the final Twilight book into 2, for cryin' out loud!), Unbroken should have been a two part epic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Honestly...very good,"Unfortunately, the 6.7 rating this movie has at this time does not do it justice. I'm not sure if everyone is trying to pick on Angelina Jolie directorial skills (which I don't understand because it was phenomenal in this film) or what, but this movie was great. It was long...but it was emotional, heart felt, and changes your perspective on life. If you like the book, you'll love the movie, it stays true to his life and seems so crazy of a story of endurance and strength it couldn't be real...but is is. Do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful film. The acting and casting done for the film is outstanding and Jack O'Connell gives a very impressive performance, one that deserves recognition. The cinematography is a work of art and even the graphics are very well done. The directing is phenomenal and I'm not sure why there is so much flack going around about Angelina Jolie not doing a good job directing this movie. Honestly, she took an incredible story, wrote an incredible script, that stays true to the real story, and creates a passionate and inspiring film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angelina Jolie's inspiring epic features star-making turns by Jack O'Connell and Miyavi...,"Read more @ Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)There are so many things to admire when looking upon Angelina Jolie's English language directorial debut. ""Unbroken"" checks most of the boxes of a great film. Inspiring, moving, and emotionally resonate, Jolie's epic lands on the back end of the film year and becomes an instant contender. Pulling out the big guns with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, and a Sound team that includes five-time Oscar nominee Frank A. Montaño (""Gladiator""), Emmy-nominee Jon Taylor (""Apollo 11″), Production Sound Mixer David Lee, BAFTA winner Becky Sullivan (""The Fugitive""), and MPSE Winner Andrew DeCristofaro (""To the Arctic 3D""), both technical aspects of the film are among the very best seen, and heard in 2014. ""Unbroken"" is an uplifting, daunting experience, telling the story of a man who fought against impossible odds to survive. A worldly film that speaks to so much happening today.The screenplay, which went through three drafts by William Nicholson, Richard LaGravenese, and Joel Coen & Ethan Coen, is the film's biggest hiccup. The first half of the film is entrenched, marvelous even, focusing on the survival and story of Louis Zamperini. The Olympic story, as you'd expect, is secondary to our tale. Playing in flashbacks from Zamperini on a flight mission, then to his early days as a child, rambunctious and being inspired by his older brother to join the track team. Jolie focuses on the world around Zamperini in those early scenes. Introducing an Italian-immigrant mother, praying for her son's safety and guidance, along with a disciplinarian father. You have moments in those early scenes that call back to ""Forrest Gump,"" (still unsure if that's a compliment or not) but the visual aesthetics are well positioned by DP Roger Deakins. Gorgeous to look at 100% of the time.The performances are fully developed. Jack O'Connell, as Louis Zamperini, provides another example of a killer breakout year with other performances in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71."" His dedication to the role is undeniable, losing weight, and managing to elevate some of the more stagnant scenes. He's an exciting actor to watch. Domhnall Gleeson's turn as Phil, Louis' ""boat-companion,"" is truly remarkable. I do wish we got a split story of Louis and Phil's journey. There's a beautiful dynamic that the two have, and that could have been explored. I think it's just a missed opportunity.The second half of the film is dominated by the aura and presence of Miyavi (or if you prefer Takamasa Ishiara) as the diabolical Mutsushiro Watanabe, commanding officer of the concentration camp where Louis is imprisoned. Just one year after Michael Fassbender scored an Oscar nomination for ""12 Years a Slave,"" a role that is similar in structure and similar by aura, Miyavi creates a multi- layered man, with so many things going on inside, aching for an explanation for the audience. Not everything will be answered, but he feels the most satisfying of every character on screen. A Supporting Actor contender has emerged in Miyavi. A breakout performance.Angelina Jolie has a firm hand on what is happening on-screen. Rumors have made their rounds that there is a director's cut, likely about 30 minutes longer. I have to imagine that if true, that is the version that feels more complete. The last quarter is problematic, rushed even, and I imagine that's where many of the cuts were made. Jolie's abilities as a filmmaker are way above par for a person on their second feature film. If we look at many director's second outings, I don't think you'd find to many as polished or confident as Jolie is behind the camera. She doesn't shy away from the brutality of the story. ""Unbroken"" is the most fitting title of any story delivered this year. Encompassing everything that this film is about.Oscar race questions? Thought you'd never ask. Easy pick for a Best Picture nomination with all the crafts its likely to eat up including Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and a beautiful score by Alexandre Desplat. In a thin Adapted Screenplay race, the four-man writing team should find wiggle room, and in a just world, Miyavi should join the Supporting Actor contenders and score his first Academy Award nomination. Angelina Jolie will gain lots of respect for what she has constructed. If anything, this begins the narrative and excitement for her next feature ""By the Sea"" with hubby Brad Pitt.""Unbroken"" is a fascinating deconstruction of a man beaten to his core. An enlightening story, featuring star-making performances, and an abundance of masterclass filmmaking techniques. The Oscar race continues.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Movie,"This is an amazing movie about an amazing man and his life. It is as historically accurate as possible. The movie has you running the gamut of emotions from suspense to rage even to misting while you try not to cry in the middle of the theater. My family and I went to see this on opening day here in town, now I had one retired military member and one current military member and I was afraid I would have to listen to them pick the movie apart for military authenticity but to my surprise both of them remained quiet for the entire film, it was a miracle! I must say that for the first time in I cannot remember how long this movie actually got an ovation at the end of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone that would listen to me!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something here is most certainly broken,"It would be right to ask how such an incredible and out of the ordinary true life story could become such an ordinary run of the mill film? The answer however can't be easily given. Is it ""spoilt-brat"" Angelina Jolie's stoic yet uninspired direction? A weakish script that no less than 4 accomplished writers including the Coen Brothers worked on? Perhaps it's the fine yet strangely emotionally distant performances from the films leads? What makes Unbroken such an impressively average film could be anyone of these things and it's a shame that this once touted Oscar contender is what it is.So many things in Unbroken scream quality, from the hugely impressive and well-staged opening aerial dogfight, the often stunning frames captured by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins through to the committed and perhaps star making turn from up and coming superstar Jack O'Connell, there is without question a lot of finely crafted movie making on show here yet it's not enough to suggest Unbroken is anything but middle tier.This feeling of fluctuation between high quality and hallmark movie staples stems from a not always consistent flow, a challenge the filmmakers no doubt had when trying to adapt Laura Hillenbrand's extensive and well renowned biography of Louis Zamperini. Zamperini's stunning life so vividly captured on page fly's by in mere minutes on screen and in some instances disappears all together while other key moments of his life such as his terrible ordeal on the open oceans during World War 2 take up large chunks of the films 130 minute run time. We get these key scenes to make us feel some of Zamperini's overcoming's yet we never feel invested in the man, for such an horrific and human courage filled story, the film barely ever draws out emotion from the viewer and this can only be attributed to the fact we never feel invested in a character we don't really get know, it's certainly not from bad acting.Jack O'Connell, so impressive in the recent film Starred Up, does a commendable and committed job at bringing this larger to life figure to screen, yet with a role that is at times utterly underwritten and un-fleshed out, he can only do so much. Unbroken is absolutely Louis's story and we never get a proper feel for who this man is and from those around him like Garret Hedlund's fellow POW Fitzgerald through to Domhnall Gleeson's pilot Phil, we also don't get much of a feel for those that surrounded Zamperini through his darkest hours. Other elements of his life such as his youth and time as an Olympic runner get the short shift as victims of the films aforementioned flow troubles.Unbroken is very far from a bad film but it's also not a great one by a very large margin. Jolie in her second feature film as director shows a keen eye for an image and a casting choice yet on the basis of this effort, has yet to master the art of getting the audience to invest themselves emotionally into such a tale that so easily could've become a war set classic. It seems as though if you've yet to discover Zamperini's tale for yourself, the source novel on which this is based upon should be your first point of call.3 token Oscar nominations out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Fine,"Just came out of a pre-release screening. It was fine. Above all, the word I would use would be ""safe"". It was a movie created not to fail, and it doesn't. Watching it is a reasonable way to spend 2 and a half hours. A bunch of bad stuff happens to Zamperini, he survives it in an inspiring way, the end.IMDb movie reviews have to be 10 lines, but Unbroken doesn't really deserve it. There's more to be said about Zamperini the person than the film itself. It was narratively predictable, but that's forgivable given the nature of the film. The problem is it was visually predictable too. If someone were to right a textbook on how to make an inspiring movie, they could dryly and apathetically describe this movie shot for shot. So...hoorah I guess. It was fine.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stand strong,"Based on a true story of Olympian Louis Zamperini, Unbroken tell of his grit to survive extra ordinary situations. He was son of Italian immigrants who went to participate in the 1936 Olympics. As a soldier he survived a plane accident and survived 47 days at sea. Not to top that, he went on to survive a Japanese prison of war camp. The movie is grueling at times, but I believe captures the complexities of the fog of war. A remarkable story and one that inspires. Directed by Angelina Jolie and is nominated for 3 Oscars. Regardless of the critics, it is a good movie. It is an adventure entering an era long gone.

one of the biggest Meh(s) in decade,"i don't care if the guys who did the screenplay are famous Cohen brothers, nor do i care or pay too much attention to the director, a female actress who got too many demons in her past up to her present, okay? this flick just made me become a shaking-head zombie when i tried to watch it but failed after wasted 40 minutes of lifetime. first of all, the screenplay sucks big time! too typically formulaic with a lame and pointless storyline, with several guys occupied the big screen for nothing to tell since the brothers recognized by themselves at the very beginning to draft a nothing to tell story. so they used the typical and overly used format to stuff the beanbag of it, centered on one of the guys' childhood, boyhood, hometown, college years, competition, romance...whatever they could borrow from the already overly used stuff, including the kitchen sink and bathroom soap.the air raid scenes when this stupid pointless film started doomed it to be a lousy film right away. the pilot and the co-pilot both looked overdosed with Valiums, they were two mummies, their dumb and dummy facial expressions only exposed that they were in a video mirage created in the movie studio, both looked so unnaturally calm and numb to the situation, two lousy actors led the way to start a lousy film already. then one more stupid scene came up: so many strategic bombers tried to bomb certain unknown target on an island(or whatever or wherever inland of japan?) occupied by japs. there were so many bombers ahead and around this particular bomber, yet none of the others hit the target until this particular bomber dropped theirs and hit right on the mark, then a huge explosion and fireball risen from the ground up. yeah, right, because the film was centered on this particular bomber and its crew, so the glory must be all tributed to this bomber and its crew, other bombers never hit the target, because they were just cosmetic make-up crap. then the typical air combat scenes continued, the .50mm caliber machine guns handled by this particular crew on this particular bomber hit and destroyed so many japs' 0 fighter planes, we heard the non-stop DaDaDaDaDaDaDaDaDaDaDadadadadadadadadadada machine guns bullets fired, fired and fired, but with no ejected shells littered around, while the major lead actor went through the cabin to encourage his crew members with such a calm manners, another guy taken too many Valiums? then the bomber got problem, then it went down and crashed into the ocean, some of the crew didn't make it but some of them survived on a raft, then sunburns, hunger, eating raw fish sashimi, then saved by the japs, became POWs, tortured by the japs, then because the guys were American patriots, they never been broken, they.....well, these crappy scenarios were already used thousand times by Hollywood and the British movies. although there are so many similar or even exactly the same ones, this one just turned out to be a one that absolutely unnecessary. i don't know why this film had to be made, for what purpose, or there's some special favor to be repaid to the playwright or this specific so-called actress-turn-director person. the whole nine-yard endeavor and making simply achieved nothing, a big NADA. the only bless we feel lucky is since everything became digital and computerized, we didn't waste the expensive films anymore. god bless Hollywood and those who so moronically wasted their money in big-Nada movies. everyday or every morning, we have to go to the restroom to relieve ourselves, but there's absolutely no need to ask us to relieve this kinda crap again and again. there's no point and very cruel and heartless.",,Anonymous,Biography
Sometimes surviving is the hardest part of life,"Films of war are so common now, everything that did or could happened has been recreated in one way or another, whether it be soldiers in the midst of a heavy battle taking fire from every angle, a rescue mission attempting to free trapped civilians by a specialist team, a prison camp and the harshness it endures or the last survivor of a family being brought home after his siblings are lost. One thing we have never really seen though is one man's story and all the hardships he goes through in one lifetime during a lifetime of war. Unbroken is Angelina Jollies third attempt at a major release this time though she got Ethan and Joel Coen on board to write the screenplay. So we know she can act somewhat but how is she when it comes to directing? Unbroken is the true life story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini an Italian-American and his life. The film begins with Louie as a bombardier in the United States Army Air Force flying in a B-24 Liberator bomber, and one of their successful attacks on a Japanese Island from here the film jumps back to a much younger Louis. A trouble maker; he drinks, smokes and starts fights with the other boys. One day after being busted catching a glimpse up some girl's dress beneath the bleachers, Louis brother Peter watches Louis run desperate to get away and decides he will train him to be the best he can be as a runner where Louis makes it to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The film jumps forward again back to 1943 where Louis and his crew are back in the air on another mission, this time however the bomber aircraft they are in falls out of the sky and crashes into the ocean. Louis and two others from the crew make it onto a raft, where they wait to be rescued. Days and nights pass with the hope of being rescued slowly fading away, as their sanity slowly begins to fail as well, eventually the survivors are rescued but unfortunately it's not by their allies. (Too much to give away if I say anymore here) At first I wasn't over enthused to see this film, thinking it would be just another run of the mill war film, nothing new to happen but for a few new camera shots and maybe some tricky camera work. The way the film opens was absolutely stunning, the camera work in certain scenes was epic and should be respected for what was presented. Amazing action sequences high in the sky something I have never seen done so well. I was a little excited for what was to come but unfortunately I hate to say, it seems as though all the good juice was used for the first 15mins, the film then turns into a sadistic styled torture snuff feature. I understand that it is based on the biography of Louis Zamperini and I hold my hat high to everything the guy went through, I just feel it could have been told or more to the point shown very differently to what has been delivered. The film works well and tells the story that needed to be told personally though I would have loved to have seen what the Coen brothers would have delivered instead. The camera work is superb the locations are amazing, the script is harsh and sometimes a little forced, and the score is inspiring I'm sure Angelina only had the best intentions to bring this story to life I just don't think she pulled off the film the story is worthy of. Running longer than it should never helps either. Starring Jack O'Connell (Skins, 300 – Rise of an Empire) as Louis Zamperini, I'm sure everyone that knew the real man in life would have loved the character Jack O'Connell portrays in the film. Takamasa Ishihara (is actually a musician known as Miyavi) as Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe, he is very believable in his role at times absolutely horrific, Domhnall Gleeson (as Phil, Harry Potter, True Grit) Garrett Hedlund (Tron, Troy) as Fitzgerald, Finn Wittrock (American Horror Story, Winter's Tale) as Mac. Unbroken isn't anything new, it has been done before, but what you won't get is the story of one man's fight to survive when even the Gods are telling him to give up. Not an ideal family film but seeing a film that was to be banned when released in Japan because it gave them a bad image could be a great thing to discuss after the credits role.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Maybe some parts of this movie were a bit dragged out and some way to short. I just don't know how this could have been better really. I would not watch this at a Theater.

Endure the unendurable,"By any stretch of the imagination Louis Zamperini was a hero and role model in any number of ways. In getting to see a rough cut of Angelina Jolie's film before he died, he got to see how millions and millions unborn will get to see his life. I think that's something you can't ask for more.If it wasn't for what Jesse Owens did in the 1936 Olympics Zamperini's story would be more well known even before Unbroken came out. A kid who had a lot of trouble with the law as a juvenile delinquent and a kid whose family was the only one of Italian origin from his small town of Torrance, California he felt the pangs of discrimination. A wise older brother told him to find an outlet and channel his energies into more constructive ways. Track and field became his outlet and in his time he became a legend, sad to say for posterity eclipsed by that other legend of Jesse Owens and the gold he won at Hitler's show palace in Berlin.He was training for the upcoming Olympics scheduled for Tokyo in 1940 when the World War broke out putting a lot of things in the world on hold. In the Armed Services Zamperini became a gunner in the Army Air Corps and got shot down and with two others one of whom died he was on a life raft for over a month.Rescue comes in the form of the Japanese and he and his fellow survivor spend a couple of years as Japanese prisoners and their treatment of captives was legendarily sadistic. His own strength of character permitted him to endure the unendurable. And he got to see Tokyo from an interesting point of view.I have to say that I did not recognize most of the players in Unbroken, but probably that was better because it became more authentic. Jack O'Connell plays Zamperini and Garrett Hedlund plays his fellow survivor from the plane and the prison. Takamasha Ishihara plays one of the prison camp officers who singles out Zamperini for some special treatment. He is chillingly evil.O'Connell and Hedlund are effective in their portrayals as well. Without star baggage which he will now have O'Connell makes you think you really are looking into the most triumphant and despairing moments of the life of Louis Zamperini. Angelina Jolie triumphs as a director as well. I have a feeling that she wanted to make an inspirational movie for the family she and Brad Pitt have to see.The vistas of Australia and the blue Pacific Ocean surrounding it was a great location and responsible for the Oscar nomination Unbroken got for cinematography. Unbroken also was given recognition by the Academy with two other nominations in the Sound department.Add a Coen brothers inspirational script and story and you have the makings of a fine film tribute for a real hero.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
6.5/10,"The expectations I had going in weren't really anything special, because of that ""Unbroken"" did partly surprise me, but all in all I what I was expecting going in was more or less what I had when I left the theater.I want to start by addressing a thing that has bothered me for quite some time and that this movie finally convinced me to right down. I am fu**ing sick and tired of true story movies that manage to gain emotional punch only by ending the movie with real life pictures and closing sentences. It really frustrates me when they do so and madly manipulate me, whilst they aren't giving quality character empathy where they should. ""Unbroken"" fits right into this category since its main and core weakness is the absence of emotional connection throughout. You really do care for Louie in parts, but for the majority of the duration the only reasons you are given to care for him are badly handled clichés or torture porn. Which brings me to my next point. I am the only one who actually felt this was torture porn? I understand the necessity to feel the stress Louie went through and boy do I feel devastated by only thinking of it, but conveying it in a movie is a whole other thing and showing an hour to an hour and a half of torture certainly isn't the right way. Which again, brings me to my other point: this film in no way whatsoever manages to justify its length and instead makes it even more heavy to get through. Wiliam Goldberg might be my favourite editor in the business right now, but this isn't in no way great work from him, obviously the technicality of the editing is brilliant as always but the pace is so off putting.I have heard many blame Jolie for poor direction and whilst this isn't exactly a brilliant directing piece, it certainly isn't a weak one, on the contrary there are moments where the vision really shines, I really want to see more from her, because her passion really came through despite some weaknesses. She is obviously helped by the gorgeous cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. I point my finger towards the script, being the main weakness of the film for my money. Yet, talking more about strengths the movie certainly has some: performances across the board are remarkable, with the only exception of the Japanese officer maybe, who had his moments, but also became the weak link in others. Moreover, the first hour or so of ""Unbroken"" is very, very good and promised me a movie that I unfortunately failed to get.I did have a positive experience with the film, which gives a remarkable portrayal of this true story, but all in all, as I am thinking back towards it, I do find many flaws with it and think I won't really remember the movie itself as much as the incredible story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Ordeal of Human Endurance,"Director Angelina Jolie's homage to the plight of imprisoned World War II servicemen in Japan focuses on the true-life experience of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete from California. Though we've seen countless, horrific cinematic depictions over the years of how prisoners of war are terribly abused, Unbroken still has a lot going for it. Strong performances all around, added to a compelling story and flawless technical achievement in the art of filmmaking make Unbroken deeply disturbing yet ultimately uplifting and inspirational. One of the things this film rightfully drives home is that ""war is hell."" It's an old expression, but it continues to ring true to this day. And perhaps, as this film reminds us, we should never forget that the price of war is always devastation and depravity before victory.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Too preachy, powerful stuff swaddled, over-mothered, but worth seeing","Powerful sequences of war and prison camp captivity, with gripping performances of human good and evil, high-minded, but with insufficient trust in the audience, or in the material, or even ultimately in humanity, and consequently much too heavy a hand on the moral eye-liner, so intent on spelling out the lessons that the visceral power of the actual events is watered down and scumbled in Sunday school pieties.The film begins very powerfully with us, the camera, in a propeller bomber on a run against Japanese military installations, and just as we start to enjoy the personable young crew hell breaks loose with anti-aircraft flak bursting around us and wasplike Zero Japanese fighters zooming circles around our slow bomber, strafing thru our plane's thin walls w their heavy machine guns, ripping into our machinery and men's bodies w/o warning.But this exciting, frightening, gripping reality is soon undermined by the directorial decision to spell out the character of the hero through an slew of flashbacks to his early life, starting w a sermon he seemed hardly to be paying attention on the text ""love your enemies"", going into his loving immigrant family, and the lessons learnt from mentors as he built himself into an Olympic distance runner. All of which might be quality material if subjected to critical analysis in a different movie, an intellectual meditation, but is just empty calories on the superficial level purveyed here, and, most importantly does not at all belong in this film of war and imprisonment, where whatever transcendence and redemption there is manifests itself only through the various courage and fortitude of men to soldier on through vicious and brutal reality, or to give over to the deadly despair or vicious sadism of inner demons and frailty.Apparently a first directorial effort, fresh ideas, good instincts for performances, but so focused on expressing herself clearly as to blind herself to what the audience is experiencing given what we bring to the film, and so she presses too hard anxiously making sure every theme and motif is spelled out over and over again, until the audience is being drilled in a lesson rather than given the free, open, aesthetic experience needed to evoke pity and terror, profound emotion and illumination.""Unbroken"" is worth seeing for its strong presentation of the ignored dimensions of our humanity in war, brutal captivity, cruelty, and extraordinary strength But it could have been (and might still be?) made into a great film with the necessary editing, something along the lines of what Pound did for Eliot, ripping out all the Sunday-school blather and letting the facts speak for themselves.Hopefully, Ms Jolie will take a tip from Picasso who defined his artistic process as a sum of destructions, removing from the canvas everything that could be removed, until what was left was the painting.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
the award frenzy exceeds content,"Although it is an exceptional story in it's own right, the film fails to dazzle or inspire as the book did. It never fully materializes into the epic experience it wants to be. The script was problematic from the get-go. Attributing a mans extremely brutal POW experience with a spiritual awakening and strength in God does not translate well on the big screen. Blending those two subject matters together in a seamless way while maintaining the violent theme that the director imposes on the audience just doesn't work. This films tries to be too many things so naturally it fails to be anything. You cant please everyone.The buzz over the last two years promoting this film really boosted my expectations. Only to feel extremely let down and honestly, conned. Perhaps it was a lack of budget or the lack of talent behind the screen. On screen the talent was impressive and I think we have found a new budding star in newcomer Jack O'connell. Very impressive indeed.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
So Flat That it Might As Well Have Come in a Cardboard Box Mailed to Jolie's House,"BY RYAN C. SHOWERSThe trailer for ""Unbroken"" did not fool me—I knew something was off from the overly sentimental and uninspired footage months ago. After seeing the film though, I was correct in detecting the film's mediocre quality but not for the reason I thought. Angelina Jolie's directing style, as demonstrated with ""Unbroken,"" is to make the audience respond to her. She wants to see us flinch, jump, and wince. In theory, this sounds like a good quality to have, right? Well no, not if it's the only quality you have to engage the thinking viewer.Imparting the intensity of a situation seemed to be on her agenda as the primary objective. In this regard, ""Unbroken"" does impale us with the extremity of the airplane scenes, the deserted emptiness of the ocean, and the grueling torture Louis Zamperini endured. (The ultimate ""jump scare"" of the film is when a shark attacks the survivors of the airplane crash on their raft. Everyone, and I mean everyone, in my theater leaped out of their seats.)The problem with her work in ""Unbroken"" is that the emotional narrative is left astray. Though Louis remains ""unbroken"" by the actions committed against him, Jolie never lets us inside Zamperini's mind and shows us how he internalizes this physical and emotional pain. The dramatic moments that would have serviced this aspect of the story are deserted by Jolie, and instead, she leaves us to just witness the atrocities Zamperini valiantly overcomes. The action is there, but the emotions and understanding are not.The worst thing about ""Unbroken"" is the ghastly screenplay, a text that surprisingly took a total of five writers to compose fully. This script is one of the worst adapted screenplays 2014 saw. The film's structure for the first half an hour is pointless, flashing back in time while relating nothing from said flashbacks to the present day scenes. The dialogue is terrible; clichéd, cheesy conversations and motivational phrases guide most of the narrative (including the unforgivably trite name-calling, bullying, homosexual jokes). The most damaging of it all is the lack of actual plot of which the movie is made up. There is no coherent ""storyline"" but rather a collection of events that one man was able to withstand.Jack O'Connell does a fine job in portraying Zamperini, but his acting can only take the characterization so far. The characters in ""Unbroken"" are so flat and one-dimensional that they might as well have come in a cardboard box mailed to Jolie's house. The closest thing to an attempt at humanizing Zamperini is by alluding to character flaws through dialogue and that he sneaked alcohol in a milk-bottle as a child. Otherwise he's always seen doing the right thing, being a model for us mere mortals to emulate, and always remaining ""unbroken"". The supporting characters receive even less development. The main antagonist, revoltingly played by Miyavi, is given no justice whatsoever.Jolie, herself, has proclaimed that the message of ""Unbroken"" is the power of forgiveness, yet I struggle to recognize this supposed ultimate-metaphor considering the portion of Zamperini's story that displays his forgiving of the captors is only shown at the end of the feature in the form of title-cards. ""Unbroken"" is actually a loosely-written, action-dependent film about how one man surmounts insurmountable physical plights. The movie Jolie describes was actually made and released earlier this year, ""The Railway Man"", starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman.Having addressed all of my problems with the final product, I must say that ""Unbroken"" is technically apt and deserves Oscar nominations in cinematography, original score, sound mixing, and sound editing. (These technical elements are most utilized in the captivating plane scenes that open ""Unbroken"" and the most of the raft scenes.) The photography illustrated by the great Roger Deakins is especially beautiful and artistic, and the sound design will ring your eyes and pin you to your seat.""Unbroken"" is intentionally epic, almost to a fault. You will grow tired of it by the third act, all of Jolie's tricks will be behind you, and you will be ready to pack up and leave.Grade: C+* * / * * * *",,Anonymous,Biography

Great Story...Weakly told,"If given some of the worlds most incredible ingredients to make a meal, why would anyone instead choose to make a ground beef burger? Well,Angelina Jolie and the Coen brothers did just that!There is so much to this story yet so much is not only left out, yet not told nearly to the caliber it should and could have been. Instead I found myself looking at my watch, hoping for more to be revealed yet the gifted storytelling done in the book and needed here was simply not in the hands of those it needed to be.I'd hope that someone more talented would have done this, in fact I wish it could be redone however that's not going to happen, sadly.What an opportunity, wasted.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good film that misses the spirit of the true story,"Louis Zamperini's story has been floating around Hollywood since 1957. Will his story finally be successfully translated onto the big screen?Walking into the cinema... Unbroken has been one of the most anticipated films of 2014. The book has been an international bestseller and has exposed Louie's inspirational story to the world. When Angelina Jolie announced that she would be directing the film, waves of skepticism poured forth across the media. The hope was that the magic of the story would survive.Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Family value: 2.5 starsLouis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) grew up as the son of Italian immigrants in California in the depression era. His brother helped lead him from a life of juvenile delinquency to a life as a national track star. After an heroic run at the 1936 Olympics, Louis looked forward to running in the Tokyo Olympics in 1940, but World War Two broke out. He served during in the South Pacific on bomber flight crew. After a near-fatal plane crash, Louie and two other crewmen survive and spend a harrowing 47 days in a life raft. After surviving their ocean ordeal, they are rescued by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. Louie is eventually sent to the camp run by tyrannical leader, Watanabe or as the prisoners called him, The Bird (Takamasa Ishihara). Because of his world notoriety as an Olympian, The Bird targets Zamperini and makes an example of him throughout his years in captivity. Through the torture and abuse, Louie and the other prisoners must figure out how to survive until the end of the war.Zamperini lived an unbelievable, but compelling life. Julie Hildebrand's epic tale of Zamperini's life has been celebrated by many around the world. Louie's story has been travelling around Hollywood since 1957, and could not find the right director or lead actor. Angelina Jolie's choice to helm the Unbroken project presented a daunting task for the movie star turned director. Her film would be compared to the much loved literary treasure. Jolie managed to work with Joel and Ethan Coen to write the script. With the stellar production crew and the quality of story, this film has the potential for greatness or potential failure. Interestingly, the film falls squarely in between these two positions. Angelina did an admirable work in attempting to get as much of Zamperini's story into the film. She would have to choose what to keep and what to share, because to capture all of his story into one film cannot be achieved. She was able to achieve much of the back story through flashbacks. Also, the script cuts out much of the finer details from the book. Because of the lack of subtle nuances the film starts in full throttle and never relinquishes it's intensity. The scenes during their ocean experience went a bit too long, but even this portion becomes laborious and exhausting. By cutting out some of the subtle nuances of the book, Jolie seemed to miss some of the light and shade of the story which could have made this film more compelling. The ocean scenes and prisoner of war camps gave the needed atmosphere, but the special effects seemed very elementary. Jack O'Connell and Takamasa Ishihara give excellent performances in their on-screen adversarial roles. Domhnall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund were well cast in their supporting roles, but did not excel beyond supporting players in Zamperini's story. Unbroken was an entertaining experience, but unlike the book was merely a celebration of the human spirit opposed a story of salvation and forgiveness of his actual life.If you have not read the book, this review would be to watch the film prior to reading the book. The film was good, but the book gives a richer telling of Zamperini's life. Hildebrand's book was a joy to read and a true celebration of Jesus' impact on Louie's life. With all of the difficulties and challenges that come into his life, it was not until he come to a saving faith in Christ that the story becomes a true story of salvation and forgiveness. Zamperini's life is truly one to be celebrated, but it all sets up the impact of Jesus on the story that enriches the story and leaves the reader with a more satisfying experience. Jolie alludes to this part of his life, but without it being a centrepiece of the film she misses the heart of the story. I would recommend that anyone would go to see the film, but do it with the intention afterwards of reading the book. Your cinematic experience will be enhanced and your enjoyment of this story will be richer.Leaving the cinema... Rarely does a film finish with audience applause, but Unbroken concluded with a flurry of praise from the cinema's attendees. This is a compelling story and worth seeing, but after seeing it, take time to read the book.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Why does suffering happen in the world? (Romans 5: 3-5, John 16:33) 2. How do people make it through traumatic situations like Unbroken? (Romans 12:12, Philippians 4:6-7 ) 3. How can Jesus make a difference in our lives?

Brilliant,"This film got so much hate and I sincerely don't understand the reason. Based on Laura Hillenbrand's ""Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption"" Unbroken is a brilliant film about friendship, inner strength and love.A great and bright cinematography is provided by Roger Deakins. Coldplay's ""Miracles"" - ending credits - perfectly fits in the story and I couldn't imagine of a better song.Jack O'Connell is the real deal, and puts his efforts to portray such a man.

A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory. Or is it the other way around?,"""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory.""Directed by Angelina Jolie, Unbroken focuses on the inspiring true story of Olympic winning medalist, Louis Zamperini, who later went on to serve during World War II going through all kinds of hardships. Unbroken opens with an incredibly strong action scene (which might be the best in the movie) and as the story unfolds we get some flashbacks of Louis's childhood and upbringing. It is a bit formulaic in the sense that it follows pretty much the same conventions as most biopics have done in the past. One of my favorite quotes in the film is when Louis's brother tells him that ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" but ironically after getting through this film the quote feels like it works better the other way around, ""A moment of glory is worth a lifetime of pain"" because Jolie makes sure we witness all the trials that he went through during the War. She focuses more on Louis's lifetime of pain and only a moment of glory. Unbroken is The Passion of the Christ of war dramas because we experience the hardships that Louis has to go through in a very detailed manner. There is no doubt in my mind that this was an inspirational story, but Jolie spends most of her time going from one scene to the next without ever trying to develop the character or tell us who Louis really was. In other words she tells an inspiring story but doesn't transmit anything about the man who went through it all. There are several reasons why I did enjoy this film despite its flaws and the first one is because of Roger Deakins's cinematography which is always outstanding. I could see pretty much any movie that this man shoots. The second reason is because the Coen brothers were involved in the adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling novel. The Coen brothers aren't as successful when they don't direct their own screenplays, but this time they had strong material to work with. Hillenbrand is a great writer (Seabiscuit and now Unbroken) and the story is inspirational so there is a lot to like.The film hooked me from the opening scene where we experience a great action scene from within a bomber aircraft overflying the Pacific Ocean. Then the generic flashbacks began and the film lost some of its potential. Jack O'Connell plays the lead character Louis Zamperini. After his solid performance in Starred Up, O'Connell, is definitely someone worth keeping your eyes on because he's extremely talented. In Unbroken we see him enduring a great amount of suffering (thus the comparison with The Passion of the Christ) so the film focuses on that aspect instead of giving us any insight on O'Connell's character. I still think the story is so inspirational that it manages to hook us and captivate us throughout the entire run time. Jolie is interested in simply telling the story so we go from one scene to the next without learning much of who the character's really are. The opening was fantastic, the scene where the plane crashes into the Ocean and the survivors struggle to survive was also another highlight of the film, and finally the torture he endures as a prisoner of war was inspiring. The technical aspects of the film are fantastic and Deakins cinematography is gorgeous. The supporting performances from Domhnall Gleeson and Miyavi are also very solid. But by the time the end credits start rolling you kind of wish the film had focused on the later aspects of Louis's life which were perhaps even more inspiring than the torture he endured.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty great. Just great.,"-Unbroken is a film following the nearly unbelievable true story of an Olympic athlete turned WWII bomber pilot who struggles to survive after a crash, weeks at sea, and months on a Japanese POW camp.-If it weren't a true story it would be so over-the-top. But it is a true story, so it's pretty great! -The story itself is fantastic! The best thing about it. It is emotional, compelling, and sometimes hard to watch.-The pace is not bad, but it has one or two slow points, and the film could have been alittle shorter.-The acting is very good. Both the lead and the supporting cast deliver top-notch performances! -The characters are great and there are times where you just feel for them. The feels.-The music is very good. Very Oscar-nomination worthy.-THE FREAKING CINEMATOGRAPHY!!! Oh my gosh it rocked. I want it to win an Oscar for that at least. I noticed it right off the bat and throughout the entire film.-The film is rated PG-13 for some language and some nudity. Butts.-So Unbroken is at times, hard to watch, but it is really great! Great acting, an amazing story, and all brought about through a visually appealing film. Unbroken is worth seeing in theaters and I would give it a solid 8/10. It can't be higher because it is not a 'watch-over-and-over' film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible story but I failed to connect,"Incredible bio pic about the wartime experiences of Louie Zmaperini, an Olympic track star who survives a plane crash in WW2 and later fights for his life (for 47 days) against nature & sharks while stranded at sea and still later as a Japanese POW.Everything about this movie is well done and on a grand scale, the acting, (Jack O'Connell) the reconstitution of the period, the screenplay, cinematography, etc. Yet after viewing this incredibly moving story I was still left feeling strangely underwhelmed. The problem is all the characters (except maybe Watanabe) are without any depth, so there is just a disconnect or lack of emotion and the film didn't ever grab me the way it should have.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Liked this movie better when it was called ""Rescue Dawn"", and that was a much better movie!","""Punbroken"" is the story of how I got pun writer's block!! Wait, Wait don't leave! Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken"" is based on the incredible true story of Olympian track runner Louis Zamperini. Louie Louie won full medal in the 1936 Olympics, and then went full metal by joining the armed forces. During his tour duty in World War II, Louie was involved in a plane crash that left him and two of his fellow patriotas in a life boat for close to two months. Louie was rescued from death on the lifeboat, but the bad news is that it was the enemy Japanese who did it; consequently, Louie was a prisoner of war in two concentration camps. Jolie directed ""Unbroken"" by mostly concentrating on the concentration camp, and lacked character development of her protagonist. The infamous Coen Brothers wrote the film's screenplay, and surprisingly so it was an ""uncoen""-like script that lacked ingenuity. Jack O' Connell did deliver a bravo performance as Zamperini. Also, there was some solid cinematography by the cine steady Roger Deakins. But those pluses were not enough to fully salvage and rescue ""Unbroken"" from the mediocre cinema concentration camp. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best ever WWII films.,"Forget about the ridiculously low numbered IMDb rating and the mediocre reviews on IMDb, this is a film for all to see, especially the leaders of the Japanese government. Yes, a few parts are a little long as is the entire movie so going to the restroom ahead of time is highly recommended. There are some small technical errors related to plane insignia and such but just go and see how the Japanese treated American prisoners during WWII. They did a lot more, much more terrible then what is shown. The American's they despised the most were B-29 crewman.I feel ashamed that I own a Japanese-designed car (Honda) and that I have a big investment in Japanese Camera equipment (Nikon). There are discussions in Japan to ban or boycott this motion picture and Angelina Jolie. After all these years they just cannot handle the truth. Germans have learned the truth but not the Japanese. The Japanese don't really teach their children much of anything about the war. They either sweep it under the rug or state that the U.S. was responsible for all that happened to Japan, especially the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hardly anyone realizes that before WWI began, Japan was already starting to make plans for their control of the Pacific. That's correct – World War I, not World War II. They joined the Allies in WWI and were awarded some of the German island possessions such as the Marianas and the Marshalls. A lot of Americans died in the landings on these islands.The acting is great, the settings (especially those depicting Japan) are great, the aerial sequences are great and the photography is great. Almost everyone in the theater applauded at the end including me. I also had some tears in my eyes at the end, for Louis and for those that put this film together.You may not want to purchase any Japanese-made products for a while after seeing this movie. The fact as indicted is that the principal perpetrator escaped execution by the U.S. Government as a war criminal. The U.S. wanted to forgive and forget and this in my opinion is intolerable. I was too young to fight in WWII so I guess now I am doing it. Better late than never.I have ordered the book on which the movie is based authored by Laura Hillenbrand.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent!,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I decided to go watch Unbroken. I decided to watch it because I heard it was historical, and I'm interested in all things history. From the moment the movie started, I couldn't look away from the screen. I think Angelina Jolie did an AMAZING job portraying Louis Zamperini's life story and his struggles throughout his childhood & during the war. It created a vivid picture of the cruel POW camps in Japan, which I didn't really know too much about. I would definitely watch this movie again if I had the chance to. I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history or wants to hear a good story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unbroken was Doing Fine, But  Lost Its Tracks Along The Way","Unbroken tells Louis Zamperini's story who was an Olympian athlete and were in the American army during the WWII where he went through unimaginable situations. It's a tough movie to watch for showing the cruelty and horrors men did to each other in this dark period of human history but it is also a very inspiring film a lot because of Louis Zamperini's personality. Visually speaking, the set design, make-up and photography are well-done,they manage to create a convincing environment and along with the physical transformations which actors endured to be fit in their roles made the film more realistic. Without spoiling anything, Unbroken was having a compelling and harsh story that was making the audience startled for witnessing what Lou went through, but from a certain point, the film isn't impactful as it was, even if the worst and painful scenes happen after this point.Jack O'Conell plays Louis Zamperini, his performance is impressive,he delivers an emotional and inspiring character. The supporting cast fails to pass the same strength and confidence, having Domhnall Gleeson playing Phil as an exception, when he and Jack O'Connell are on the screen, they deliver intense and heartbreaking scenes. Miyavi as Watanabe, The bird, left much to be desired in his performance. He seemed often displaced making this character not shocking as he should be, although he was one of the greatest responsible for the suffering of Louie Zamperini during his captivity in Japan.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
i hate this kind of movie,"Of course the story and the subject is really interesting, but unfortunately this movie does one thing, that i hate more than anything else. It exaggerates beyond whats humanly possible. The hero of the movie, who is the ultimate victim, suffers more abuse than a real human obviously could take. To see the hero suffer and be abused throughout the whole move for sure is an effective method, to make the audience care about him. But if its not in a realistic way, its just stupid. Everyone that got punched in his face one time in his life...wich i guess are a few people, knows that nobody could survive being bunched in the face with the fist by hundreds of people and still be alive, or further more, still have a normal looking face. This scene just destroyed the whole movie. This is just lazy...",,Anonymous,Biography
The Movie is Fine but should lead you to the book,"The ending was made knowingly and upon request to not include his life after war. It seems this is the biggest criticism of the movie. Since I knew this coming in, I liked the movie. I did not love it but I liked it very much. I also disagree with the reviews on here criticizing the acting. No, that was wonderful on all accounts. The movie did tend to lag on brutality so watch bringing the little ones. However, that is part of Louie's story. The movie is meant to be mainstream Hollywood and no where comes close to the book's inspirational levels. How about enjoying both for the different genres they are? You will not be disappointed if you see the book and movie as separate genres with different goals.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even the Japanese couldn't break him.,"""Unbroken"" - Angelina Jolie's second movie as a director, is based on the incredible true live story of the Italian-American Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), who finished 8th in the Olympic Games in Berlin 1936. Alas everything changes after he joins the US Army as a bombardier. Given orders to go on a rescue and a search mission over the Pacific , Louis' plane crashes into the ocean due to a technical problem, leaving him and two of his fellows alone in the open sea with no food and water. They have to survive on an inflatable boat, which is their only protection from the bloodthirsty sharks. The three survivors, after 47 days of eating fish and drinking rain water, are fortunately, or maybe unfortunately (as Louis says ""I have good and bad news, friend"") are found by the Japanese navy and then put in war prison in Japan.Unfortunately the movie is not as good as good as the true story. I was confused, because so much things happen in the first one hour of the movie that leaves you thinking ""What the hell happened?"". You can not really decide whether this is a sports movie, a survival story, a war movie or a drama one? Maybe It is everything mingled together, but this time, the Coen brothers , who are recognized widely for their movies ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""True Grit"", failed to give us this kind of epic screenplay they used to.Even thought Jolie is still getting into the Directing insides, ""Unbroken"" is a good try-out for her.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unbroken,"True story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who, during WWII was stranded at sea for 6 weeks when his plane crashed and was rescued and imprisoned in Japanese POW camps for the rest of the war and endured terrible cruelties.Quite an epic, covering a considerable amount - olympics, flying, adrift at sea and in the camps, which makes up the bulk of story. All done most thoughtfully and, despite his heroism, it is largely free of derring-do, thanks to the solid direction by Jolie and a wonderfully controlled, understated but moving portrayal by Jack O'Connell. Of particular note are the scenes between Zamperini and his camp commander and later notorious war criminal played by Miyavi, which are often unbearably tense.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Could be great but ends up decent.,"I rate the movie as a weak five of ten. I felt like the Zamperini portrayed in the film wasn't convincing. And not to my surprise, the real story beats the sugar coated adaptation of it for the movie. To begin with, the young Zamperini wasn't a suicidal young teenager, he was a fighter, a young man who ended up bullying his tormentors. There are many spots in the movie where the real story would have made better sense, and actually would have made the movie so much better. Louis Zamperini was a colorfull fighter, at times somewhat of a antihero, in this movie he is portrayed as a very beigue lump of insipidness. I think Angelina and the team behind the movie got caught up in the hero aura of this great man, forgetting that the true story would have given us something much more than a fictitious hero, we would have seen a real one. The craft in pure movie-making would easily lay the foundations of a 8-9 rating, but the otious way the story has been beautified, just makes it bland. Tell the real story, when it is as great as it is in this case.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Real-life cinema,"Released in 2014, ""Unbroken"" chronicles the true-life story of Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) who ran the 5000 meter race in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later joined the US Army Air Corps for WWII. Upon crashing in the Pacific he and two others (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Witrock) must survive on a raft for almost seven weeks. When found by the Japanese they're placed in a POW camp and suffer the wrath of the commandant (Miyavi). Will they survive?Directed by Angelina Jolie and scripted (partly) by the Coen brothers and based on Zamperini's biography by Laura Hillenbrand, this is a totally realistic account of Louie's war-time trials and was a minor hit at the box office. What was it like being in the air on a bombing mission over Japan taking hits by nigh-suicidal Jap planes? What was it like to survive on a raft in the Pacific week after week? What was it like to live in a Japanese POW camp? ""Unbroken"" shows you without amping-up the melodramatics and action. This explains why some viewers call it ""bland"" and what have you. They're so used to ""Die Hard,"" ""GI JOE"" and 007 that movies that aim for real-life bore them. That said, I don't want to come off as a film snob because I DO understand their criticism. It just comes down to what you want out of a movie, real-life or blockbuster theatrics? So before watching this movie you have to psychologically prepare yourself for a film akin to other realistic war biographies, like 2002's ""The Pianist,"" 2006' ""Rescue Dawn"" and 2014's ""American Sniper."" If you want ""Spectre"" you should skip ""Unbroken.""The movie is long enough as it is and therefore doesn't depict Louie's later PTSD and alcoholism or his Billy Graham-inspired reconciliation to God, although it mentions these things in the postscript. In any case, ""Unbroken"" accomplishes precisely what it set out to do, put Louie's story to film for the world to see, and it does it very well. It may not be exceptional like 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" but – being a biography – it never set out to compete with that film.The film runs 137 minutes and was shot in eastern Australia.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Film - Ignore the Naysayers,"I'm not a review writer. I do rate films, but I'm just not into writing about them. I do look at them before deciding whether or not to spend my money at the theater. I did not read the book. The reviews were certainly a mixed bag, but seeing that the film was pretty much loved or hated, I decided to give a try. My take? This is an excellent film. It drew me in from the beginning and kept me captivated to the end. Without giving any of the film away, there were scenes that kept me on edge and at times, had me in tears. From many of the reviews I have read, I have the impression that there are Jolie haters. I don't really have an opinion of her. And I know this is her directorial debut? Or one of her first films to direct? All I can say is she did an excellent job. And the actors can be commended for their work. As far as those who compare it to the book. Again, I did not read it.

But while the scale seems immense, as another reviewer pointed out, sometimes the movie seems awfully bland.

While everything is happening and some other characters seem very evil (almost to a comic degree), the will of our protagonist never seems to sway.

Intense Recreation of WWII Hero,"Unbroken is a very interesting and intellectual film about the trials and tribulations of a WWII veteran. The movie at first is almost an inspirational battle between the hero and himself. As the film progresses this inspiration takes a tremendous turn. The hero as his success amounts begins to show a survival instinct that plays a part in the whole film. The movie in its entirety is a brutal reminder of the reality that this individual despite his talent and bravery was forced to endure. A lot of the scenes were truly heartbreaking in that although his situation and consequences were severe and even at times unfair, he was able to surmount these with an unquenched spirit. Towards the final scenes of the film this reality he created for himself began to pay off. Although he did survive at the end of the movie, despite numerous attempts by his enemy to do otherwise, he brought back a tear jerking tale of oppression and survival despite all odds.

Weak Sauce,"This movie lacks gravity. Which is peculiar because it's one of the most suspenseful true stories of all time.
The book was riveting. So let me make this clear- it is not the story that lacks gravity. It is the movie.
The director/writer is not to skilled at adding weight to a scene, putting emotion into scenes, building up to a scene. It is just flat. Which is a serious bummer because like I said it's the craziest most emotional story of all time.
The first time in movie history that a true story has been DOWNPLAYED by Hollywood. Why? Why would they do this? The story is AMAZING Hollywood material, but they dumbed it down for some reason. Maybe to fit a pg13 rating? I don't know why.
It clearly has a massive budget that they think will hide some of its more massive flaws. One of the biggest being the crap writing. This movie really has poor dialogue. This movie is a classic example of a big budget cover up, they have all the big budget traits- fair actors, great set design and lighting, great filming locations, great cgi and cameras, but the movie is just shallow.
They turned an amazing deeply moving story into some shallow easy to watch Hollywood compilation of scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent film about a POW in the Pacific,"I have seen the movie twice. Being an Angelina fan, I really like what she has done here. My father was in the Philippine army and fought in WW2. I can relate to the atrocities of the Japanese during the time they occupied the country.Unbroken is one of the best war movies in a while and captured the essence of suffering from the enemy in the Pacific as compared to the Germans in Europe.I read reviews for curiosity but a negative one will not deter me from seeing the movie, anyway. If it is an Angelina movie, it is a given that I will see it no matter what the review.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not as emotional as it should be, but there's a lot of good content within","I've heard people had mixed feelings about ""Unbroken"", and I do have to admit that it doesn't really pack the emotional punch that it should, but it is a story worth seeing. You should try and catch this drama if only because its like 4 tales jam-packed into 1. Based on true events, it's the story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (played by C.J. Valleroy as a child and Jack O'Connell as an adult). He was an Olympic runner for the United States in 1936 (a pretty big feat all in itself) who overcame adversity when he and two friends found themselves stranded in the middle of the Pacific ocean for months... only to be ""rescued"" by the Japanese and sent to POW camps.This movie has got so much going on in it I'm surprised they didn't pull a ""Hobbit"" and split it up into 4. First we've got the rise of an underdog, a kid who's up to no good and whose life is spinning out of control who rises to become an Olympic athlete. Those kinds of stories make it to the silver screen all of the time and they're always at least a little bit heartwarming to see. Next, we have the story of survival. Louie and his friends are stuck in the middle of the ocean with few supplies, little hope and plenty of sharks in the water. Think running out of food is a problem? How about becoming food? Think ""Life of Pi"", but with less tiger. Then we've got the whole POW camp thing, with our hero being mercilessly tormented by Mitsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe (Japanese singer-songwriter Miyavi). Finally, the film concludes with the aftermath of the war and what it meant to the people in that camp and Louie's family. What I liked about the movie is that it kept changing. It felt like real life because you never knew what was going to happen next and it wasn't one grand adventure that wrapped itself up cleanly, it was one catastrophe after another. I liked the fact that this was a real uphill battle. It's filled with seemingly insurmountable odds for our hero to tackle. Seeing a spirit determined to keep on going being tested like this, it's exhilarating.While at its core, this movie is about not giving up and always hoping for the best, I also found another pertinent element to it, one that's more subtle and is only said explicitly at the very end of the movie... kind of. The bulk of this film is set during WWII. Despite the fact that you can easily pick out which sides of the conflict were ""good"" and which side was ""Evil"", this movie made me look past the black-and-white element of this war. I think the film is an argument for not judging people, particularly when they are in a situation where you have to become a different type of person to survive. Let me give you an example. Our hero is being tormented by the officers in the Japanese prisoner of war camp. It's incredibly infuriating to see him being so unfairly mistreated. You see some people take less punishment than him, and give up. Your instinct would be to get angry over the quitters, and I suppose I did, but in retrospect, I feel like I'm unfit to judge them. War is a horrible thing. It forces people that would never hurt a fly to kill each other and it steals away innocence. When it comes to survival, this movie has both aspects covered. It's got sequences where people will do absolutely ANYTHING in order to survive. It's also got scenes where people refuse to back down from their code of ethics, even if it means suffering or even dying. I felt like ""Unbroken"" made a conscious effort to show that the good guys and the bad guys weren't just black-and-white caricatures of evil Japanese soldiers and brave American heroes. They were people who had the extremely poor fortune of being born in a time where being yourself wasn't an option because of the war. If anything, the movie argues for compassion and looking past nationalities and roles in a conflict and leaving the past behind in order to move on. I've been blessed because I've never had to experience war, so the best I can do is watch a movie like ""Unbroken"" and wonder how I would react to the atrocities these soldiers had to experience. I enjoyed placing myself in the shoes of Louie. Faced with these kinds of challenges, would I be able to muster up the same kind of courage that he did? This movie got inside my head and I have been thinking about it a lot, so I recommend that you see it. That said, I can't deny that it isn't as moving as it should be. I would have been moved if ANYONE had endured what Louie did, so in this case, the events in the film far supplant the characters. It is an emotional experience, but mostly because anyone would have a hard time seeing a human being mistreated in the way that Louie is. I liked the movie, I was glad I saw it, but I've seen lives that were much less eventful be made into far more moving films. One last note, you're probably wondering how hardcore the scenes of torture are in this film. They're really not that extreme. There are no racks, or thumbscrews or anything like that, it's mostly just people being hit and demoralized through constant mistreatment. No ""Hostel"" business at all. A PG rating is a bit of a stretch, but even pre-teens could watch this film and not be traumatized by it if accompanied by an adult and given a discussion on the themes of the story. I liked ""Unbroken"" a lot, but it's more of a good film than a great one. (Theatrical version on the big screen, January 13, 2015)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unbroken is the best movie I have ever seen.,"Unbroken has me speechless. It lifts the spirit. Intense, violent, real, raw emotion; almost as good as the book, which is saying a a lot. So, I loved the book so much, I love biographies,but this one is a stand-out.and could not imagine a movie coming close to recreating Laura Hillenbrand's wonderful narrative. Honestly,I didn't expect much. But I can say that the film exceeded my expectations,I highly recommends it, I think you should see it. A beautiful film by a beautiful soul. Unbroken is an inspirational film and a decent entry telling a compelling real life story.I'm extremely thankful for everything in my life, forgiveness is key. P.S.Roger Deakins is one of the greatest ever and Jack O'Connell gives a lion-hearted performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is very interesting and absorbing. .everyone around me jumped in their seats at least a few times and also almost turned heads away from certain scenes... That even was entertaining.this movie rates high with all other War movies and for the insight to the extreme injustices all of our soldiers have gone through.

truly inspiring film,"I absolutely loved it. If you ever get down on how things aren't going your way, if you ever get lazy, if you ever complain, this film will change your life. The only thing missing, I would have loved to see what happens to Zampini afterward. Angelina Jolie is super woman, I don't know how she does it. It's so inspiring, I vowed never to complain another day in my life, the perfect film to have seen at the end of the year to inspire and motivate me indefinitely.The bad guy was so captivating, his first acting role, WHAT? I felt like I was going through some of the horrible ordeals with the character. You're in it, feeling it and dealing with it.Don't listen to all the thrashers.Jolie is a beautiful woman and beautiful people are often underestimated and judged harshly, especially when taking a stab at an art-form which is predominantly pursued by men. Her haters are all over this movie but the truth is it's really good, and they can't take that away.",,Anonymous,Biography
Cane and Able,"Greetings again from the darkness. Louis Zamperini was a true American hero and his life story is epic and legendary. The son of Italian immigrants, young Louie easily found trouble, and only the efforts of his older brother and a local police officer allowed him to discover inner strength through his talent for distance running. As a 19 year old, Louie ran in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and later enlisted in the Air Force and served as a bombardier during WWII. After a horrible plane crash, he spent a grueling 47 days adrift at sea in a life raft, until rescued/captured by the Japanese. Zamperini served as a Prisoner of War, where he was subjected to immense physical and psychological torture, until the war finally ended.Zamperini's story has long deserved to be made into a movie, and it has bounced around Hollywood since 1957. However, it wasn't until Laura Hillenbrand's biography on Zamperini became a best seller in 2010 that the film version was given the go-ahead. With screenplay credits for Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson, cinematography from the great Roger Deakins, and a score from Alexandre Desplat, it was a bit surprising when Angelina Jolie was named director. After all, she only had one previous credit as a director, and that film (In the Land of Blood and Honey, 2011) was nowhere near the scope of this project.Given the true life inspirational story and the truly heroic events of its featured character, the film can best be labeled a mild disappointment. It is extremely impressive to look at, but somehow lacking in emotion  despite some excruciatingly uncomfortable moments. The film strives for the level of historic epic, yet its conventional tone and approach leave us wondering what's missing. The single most effective and emotional moment occurs in a short clip of the real Louis Zamperini running as an Olympic torch bearer at age 80 for the 1998 Olympics (in Japan!).Jack O'Connell pours everything he has into capturing the spirit of Zamperini, and he is certainly an actor to keep an eye on. Japanese rock star Miyaki plays ""The Bird"" Watanabe, a sadistic POW camp commander who brutalized Zamperini, but Miyaki lacks the chops to pull off this crucial role – going a bit heavy on the posturing. The film uses the line ""If you can take it, you can make it"" as its rallying cry, but too many gaps are left for the audience to bridge as we watch Louie go from a punk kid to a war hero with almost mystical courage and perseverance. Other supporting work comes from Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund, Jai Courtney and CJ Valleroy (as young Louie).On paper, all the pieces are in place for an Oscar contender, and the film may very well play well with voters. My preference would have been to have the real life Louis Zamperini more involved  through either narration or interviews. He spent the second half of his life as a motivational speaker and story-teller, and would have added an incredible element to the film. Unfortunately, Mr. Zamperini died 4 months prior to the release of the film so he never saw the finished product. It's likely he died knowing that his legacy is part of American history and that he did in fact ""make it"".",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
meow! Review the movie not the actress,"Wow, never seen so many reviews out to attack the director. My guess is with the amount of female negative reviews, it is due to jealousy. I am not a big fan of Jolie's acting career but can only give her thumbs up on a very enjoyable well directed movie. My only thought after seeing the short about the ""real"" Louis is that another movie could have been made about the rest of his life. What a remarkable person. As far as the movie, it was well done in almost every way with flashbacks bringing us up to date while we watch the incredible events take place. It has the classic good guy and bad guy conflict in gritty detail with a satisfying finish. I have to admit I didn't get emotionally committed until watching the above mentioned short especially the comment by Jolie that she showed him the movie in his hospital bed shortly before his death. What a gift to him.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shockingly Stylish Hair Cuts for Prisoners of War,"Very distracting to see how styled and trimmed the prisoners' hair was throughout the film. Also, after all that time in the life raft, beards and mustaches were trim and hair never grew.I thought the film was too long, as Hollywood films ALWAYS are and the story could have been told in less time. It did follow the book but less time on the life raft would have spared everyone. We got it, but did we have to suffer, too?I hope Jolie gets an award but I don't think she will since my feeling is that she's not well liked in Hollywood.I wish I hadn't noticed the stylish haircuts of the prisoners through out the film. Luckily, in the book, my imagination did not include those all- too-perfect styled heads.",,Anonymous,Biography
Lacks investment in character.,"This time last year we thought the Best Picture of 2015 was a done deal, albeit a thoroughly baity one. Unbroken makes no secret that it feels like Chariots of Fire + Life Of Pi + The Bridge on the River Kwai. Plus you got a team of the Coen brothers behind the script, Roger Deakins behind the camera (the aesthetics feel like Changeling 2.0) and director Angelina Jolie hot off an honorary Oscar. Nevertheless, the bait has failed and this will not be the Best Picture of the year. The Academy is wise to go for unconventional films Boyhood and Birdman for a refreshing change. There's nothing bad about Unbroken, it's just incredibly bland without anything new or insightful to say. The problem is that it doesn't once get you in Louis Zamperini's head. This is a very idyllic representation of him, and idyllic representations of characters are hard to latch onto.Sure, you can chuck a barrage of punches on a character, but there needs to be a bigger reason to invest. Any dilemma he's faced with is greeted with contrived courage and sacrifice, as hard as Jack O'Connell tries to bring the character out in rare loud moments. The first 20 minutes of flashbacks are designed to persuade us to chant 'come on Louie' with the side characters, but it fails to give a convincing argument as to why. We know the theme of the film and the fact that he survived and so the film lacks a vital tension to keep it involving. However the film is never explicitly bad, though the episodic structure of the boat scenes needed development, it's simply weak where it could've had potential to be actually inspirational. It just doesn't give us enough beyond the surface when there was plenty of time to do so. Certainly watchable, but it's not a treat.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carried by Suffering,"There is one point in this movie where its figure, Louis Zamperini, is about to give up and decided to surrender himself to God in a middle of a harsh storm. Unbroken claims in the end that this is a journey of discovering true faith, but after that crucial scene, the movie almost forgot (or mostly implied) about that thematic potential until it reprises at the epilogue. Over-sentimentalizing this subject is definitely not everyone's favorite choice, but it is one interesting side that seems important to explore more, especially for acknowledging the person's prime motivation. As a biopic, the movie goes to a typical prestigious mode where it's enough to showcase the nobility of the man, but it skillfully realizes his struggle during war, which alone made it absorbing. Although biographies cut out to be better than this type of standard, it still manages to be compelling.Before all of the unpleasant parts happen, the film kinda rushed Zamperini's days of growing up. He was once a young rebellious kid who was suddenly changed by a new career. This certain flashback seem to been used only as a basic information of where he came from. There wasn't much of a development within those memories. It's intriguing to know more of Louis' relationship with his brother other than his support with his sprinting talent. His issues with his parents is also easily resolved by this case. But that is understandable, though also less engaging, which deserves to be told better. It's better when he is among the lost survivors, interacting to the people he is stuck with. Even though these characters aren't well developed, the script finds ways to make each of their moments worth settling into.The best of the film is when they are suffering. The direction lingers the worst of their experience. It's not the easiest thing to watch, but these are the parts where the movie becomes real effective, and that is thankfully what most of the film is. A stronger sequence is when they are stranded in an ocean, not knowing what exact threat is about to come, while dealing with thirst and starvation. There's also a good speculation of them losing out control if they are isolated in a place by themselves.The next step of the struggle is a survival from slavery in Japanese Navy prison camp. This leads the ordeal into a hate relationship with an abusive prison guard. This segment is interestingly put together, if only the antagonist was played by a much intimidating actor. Though, the Japanese characters are basically depicted as one-noted enemies that doesn't do beyond than torturing their prisoners and making them dishonor their country. But really, this is supposed to be a realm of pain. The acting is pleasantly less showy than a usual prestige drama would ask: Jack O'Connell convincingly shows what this man has been through, with modesty, which is easy enough to join along his survival's cruelty.Unbroken is pretty hard to deal with whether it's supposed to be good or not. At its best, it's actually a compelling survival film; supported by a slick direction and exquisite cinematography. At its worst; it's a character study that lacks the rest of its important human elements. Sure, the pain is easily felt on screen, but the resilience remains to be a conventional picture of inspiration. We can believe a person who can roll with these punches, but we also found out that he is a man who will only leave this struggle with true honor. And the movie doesn't get the chance to get around with that, or at least show a point where his spirit has gone too fragile to keep moving forward. That would have been much powerful. But Unbroken works best as an epic, it may not be as impacting as tries to be, but it sure is one grand experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good True Life Account,"I don't understand all the negative reviews and it seems to be aimed at Miss Jolie. Exactly why is something only they would know but I watched this without even knowing who the director was and thought it was very well made. The story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete captured by the Japanese navy after a plane crash in the Pacific during the second world war is a harrowing tale which left me constantly amazed at the resolve of humans in the face of unbelievable hardship and cruelty. Jack O'Connell acts well and is totally believable as are all of the cast. Miyavi seemed a little too feminine looking to be playing the evil camp overseer Watanabe who seemed to take personal delight in torturing Zamperini. What came across is how Watanabe was jealous of Zamperini and bitter about his own shortcomings. I guess it shows that during war the bullies who are nobody's in civilian life and then have some power become so evil. this has also been shown by accounts in Nazi concentration camps.So over all I rate this as a very good film and about an amazing true life. Violent but not too graphic it is a tale of human resolve and desire to survive that many youths today would do well to study.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well-shot and well-acted, but the film is too much a one-note story of survival against the odds.","Truth is stranger than fiction, so they say, a point fairly well- proved by the life and experiences of Louis Zamperini - a man who competed in the Olympics, survived almost fifty days while lost at sea, and endured untold torture as a prisoner-of-war during WWII. Myths and legends can be constructed around any one of those feats; for them to be combined in one life is pretty darn extraordinary. Angelina Jolie's Unbroken - sporting a charmingly blunt title which pretty much gives away both plot and character trajectory in a single word - pays decent, beautifully-shot tribute to these defining moments in Zamperini's life, but somehow forgets to shine a spotlight on the man himself.""If you can take it, you can make it"" is the motto young Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) inherits from his brother. And so a wayward boy with discipline problems finds himself training to be a track star. He gets so darn good that he impresses the world with a 56-second final lap at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In a few years' time, athlete becomes airman - Louis enlists as a bombardier with the US Army. When seeking a lost aircraft, the defective plane carrying Louis and his crew-mates breaks up over the Pacific Ocean - forcing sole survivors Louis, Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock) to survive shark attacks and starvation on a pair of flimsy life-boats. For 47 days, Louis is cast adrift, but rescue doesn't equate to salvation. Instead, he's captured by the Japanese Navy and forced to spend the rest of the war in a POW camp, the pet target of brutal prison guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara).Watching Unbroken is an odd experience. There's a lot of it that's very good indeed. Jolie certainly knows how to cut a scene together, injecting brutal tension into Louis' encounters with sharks of both the literal and metaphorical variety. It's difficult, and occasionally enlightening, to watch as Louis fends off physical attacks with memories of his mother's delicious gnocchi recipe, or stands his ground as every soldier in his camp is commanded to punch him in the face. Most touching of all is a moment when Louis touches civilisation and real food again in a Japanese commissariat, and must decide whether to turn his back on it for a life far cruder and darker.And yet, the film never quite manages to conjure up much of an emotional impact - which is curious considering that it's so keenly focused on the triumph of the human spirit in the face of untold adversity. The problem here lies in the screenplay, though you wouldn't expect it since it's credited to experienced writers who have crafted considerably more artful and subtle works: Joel and Ethan Coen (Inside Llewyn Davis, No Country For Old Men), Richard LaGravenese (Behind The Candelabra, The Fisher King) and William Nicholson (Gladiator).In effect, Unbroken exists in just one key: a sad but triumphal note of survival, with little else to colour in the complexities of all that Louis has suffered. Without exploring the real-life effects his days at sea or in a POW camp have had on him (including his descent into alcoholism and the recovery of his religious faith), Louis comes across as a stoic superhero: a man with such incredible fortitude that he becomes almost uninteresting in the process.That's through no fault of Jolie's leading man. O'Connell does great work with what he's given, shedding his clean-cut good looks and innocence as the war drives blood, dirt and horror into his very soul. It's a shame, really, that he's not given more to do. Gleeson and Wittrock are quietly devastating as two young men trapped in a traumatic situation, each tested to their absolute limits by the hunger and horror of it all. Ishihara, better known to Asian audiences as rock star Miyavi, has been criticised for playing a comically shallow villain, but there's some depth to be found here - at least if you take the character of Watanabe (in reality one of the most wanted war criminals in Japan) as a metaphor for the trials of his own country and countrymen.As a chronicle of one period in Louis Zamperini's remarkable life, Unbroken fares reasonably well. Every bit of it is vividly realised: from the war he lived through to the days he spent floating on the open ocean. The entire film is handsomely shot in almost painterly style, the cinematography by renowned director of photography Roger Deakins rich with detail and colour. But Unbroken never really asks us to care about its protagonist; we are simply called upon to admire him. That's an easy enough task for any audience to accomplish. The film would have worked far better, however, if it had dared to depart from its title once in a while: to show us a man who became whole again when the world conspired to break him.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good material, bad movie","A true story is no guarantee for a good movie. That's the lesson we can learn from Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. The movie is based on the biography of Louis Zamperini, an American Olympic track champion who joins WW2 and experiences near death on the ocean and almost gets killed in a Japanese concentration camp. When the war is over, he returns home.That's the story, frankly. The end credits roll on the screen after he is reunited with his parents and brother on an American airport. No more scenes about being home in the States. Fade out: this is the end.However, thanks to these end credits we also learn that he later went back to Japan to face and forgive his Japanese camp guards and as an old man sees a dream come true when he carries the torch for the Olympic Games in Japan. Especially the forgiving part is exciting. Why didn't Angelina Jolie show us that? Why didn't she use the Saving Private Ryan structure and tell the story as a flashback, showing Zamperini visiting his Japanese opponents in the present while thinking back of his time during WW2? It would have made the movie much better.Unbroken is a well made drama. The war scenes with the airplanes in the beginning of the movie are very well done. The flashbacks to his youth as a problem child are also impressive. But once the bad times begin, the movie falls flat. Yes, it's impressive what the real Louis Zamperini had to experience to survive World War 2. But shown from the eyes of director Angelina Jolie it soon becomes pretty boring.Unbroken is a great monument but a flawed film.

Unbroken,"This is definitely one of the better historical movies made for this era. Louie and his two buddies were stranded after being shot down on their plane. Zamperini was famous both for being an Olympic athlete as well as his being a prisoner of war in Japan. Even before these struggles, he was bullied for being an Italian immigrant. So not only did he face external problems, he had to deal with the internal battle of not being wanted anywhere. The film was beautiful and the story line was very interesting considering how overplayed World War 2 movies are in Hollywood. However, sometimes I feel like the movie almost got lost in the plot instead of the characters emotions.

An Extraordinary Story Shortchanged,"Imagine a bioflick about George Washington that goes something like this: 95% of screen time depicts the misery of crossing the Delaware to capture the British in mid winter. In the remaining few minutes, these statements flash on the screen: , ""after this, the British were defeated, and the Colonists ultimately won the war. Oh, right, and by the way, George went on to become the country's first President and immortalized as a Founding Father.""""Unbroken"" suffers from the same skewed imbalance and misplaced priorities. Louis Zamperini is a hero, but why? It's an impressive starting place, both in Lauren Hillenbrand's intricately researched biography, and in the corresponding movie, that he overcame budding delinquency by running; that he became the fastest high school sprinter of his day; that he could catch and kill live shark barehanded from a life raft; and that he survived starvation and sadism in Japanese prison camps. But what sets Louis head and shoulders above other war veterans is something almost unbelievably extraordinary: his coming to terms with the cruelest imaginable enemies and actively working to forgive them. Yet, it's that essential fact that's relegated to a few written sentences at the end of Jolie's film. Wrong, wrong, wrong.It's common knowledge that the Hollywood mainstream is uncomfortable with religious conviction--yet we know from Hillenbrand that Zamperini would not have survived and overcome his PTSD without it--and it's the heartbeat of his life story. Unfortunately the only reference to belief within the movie is Louis' spoken promise to God to make something of his life if he is allowed to live--and it's introduced almost as a throw away line. Further, real emotions and character change don't seem to be within Director Jolie's repertoire. The special effects, such as the air bombardments and raft scenes, are fine for the most part, and the details of boyhood are mostly accurate, but when we look for the man within the history lesson, we're given sensationalism instead. Not any statements or acting that might suggest a descent into pathological hatred of the sadistic Japanese camp commander, but instead almost endless scenes of whippings, beatings, broken bones, and head punches (which elicited groans, complaints and mutters from the audience in the showing I saw). Under the circumstances, his survival seems a result of athletic training and luck as much or more than any strength of character or personal belief.A better movie would have started with Zamperini's marriage as it floundered,..the uncovering of the consequences of PTSD as rooted in war, flashbacks of survival on the raft and camps, a look at Zamperini's alcoholism, and finally, his journey towards healing and forgiveness. It would still be a lot to fit into two hours, but it would be coherent and relatable.Want the real Zamperini? The end of the movie shows a glimpse-- a minute of happy footage of him running with the Olympic torch in Tokyo at age 80--fully healed and absolving of the past. But you can save yourself over two hours of dramatic but pointless action on the big screen up to that point by just bypassing the movie and going straight to You Tube.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A very traumatic, unbelievable, and amazing true story of Louis Zamperini's fight to survive","The beginning of this movie is about a young boy, Louis, who is getting into trouble, so his brother convinces him to join the track team.

I had absolutely no idea of what was to come for the remainder of the movie and the horribly, sad, traumatic abuse and pain this man would have to experience during his life. Don't get me wrong, Louis Zamperini is extremely inspiring and his story is one of a kind that everyone should listen to, but the obstacles he had to face are difficult to imagine.

"Tough to get through, but worth it.","Unbroken (2014) -It starts off similarly to the TV Series of 'Catch 22' (2019) and I was lulled in to believing that it would be lighthearted due to the banter that the bomber crew were having, but deep down I knew better and things took a turn pretty soon after.The 47 days at sea were enough of an ordeal for anyone, but what followed was something that even the strongest would find hard to endure.This true story moves well enough, but the events depicted are so harsh that you feel like you are going through it with them. Its genuinely upsetting to watch, which I suppose is the point. The albatross and fish scenes nearly made me vomit too.Like the Ewan McGregor film 'The Impossible' (2012) that depicted the events of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on Boxing Day of 2004, I felt quite worn out by this one. Surely that's a sign that it's done it's job, but it also makes it hard to consider revisiting it, certainly any time soon.The actors all did very well, especially when you consider the content and it was interesting to read in the IMDB Trivia that the lead Japanese actor, Miyavi, was actually physically sickened by one of the scenes that he had to pretend to enforce.Also I really hope that the actors playing the Prisoners Of War didn't have to diet too harshly for their roles and that their malnourished bodies were CGI'd, because they looked awful and I don't think that it's necessary to do that with such amazing technology available now. It can't be healthy either.I liked that they showed at least a small amount of balance with losses on both sides, so that it was a fairer depiction of war too. It does take two to Tango after all.Unfortunately I recorded it on a channel without subtitles, which made it difficult at times, because some of the accents are really strong.It's horrible to think that this is a real story and that people actually went through these things within the last hundred years and it's even more scary to think that there are still governments out there who have the potential and, to some extent, are actively recreating these heinous acts. I would hope that films like these show the world what not to do instead of acting as a how to guide, but I suppose that some people are just evil at their core.It's definitely worth a watch, but keep your hearing aids on have a good stiff drink to hand.760.04/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Longest 2 Hrs. of My Life,"I could not WAIT for this movie to come out.

It missed so many other areas that were just as fascinating. The dialogue was almost non-existent as well. It was almost like watching Castaway but with violence.

"Unbroken may be familiar for war movie fans, but will break the hearts of everyone else","The sound of an air raid and guns going off are the last things WWII survivors want to remember, yet they like to talk about them. I've recanted about post traumatic stress in the military, yet I've recently heard about curing the nightmares by talking about it. Not just in a therapeutic way but also to walk the footsteps they've already taken, therefore retracing their thoughts to see what they learned out of it. It may be simply don't go to war, but it could also be to never give up hope. Becoming a military storyteller just may be what the doctor ordered.I can vouch for my own grandfather who is ninety-four, yet seems to be in good spirits and health. He served as a medic during WWII, a doctor during the Korean War and Vietnam, and was a hospital administrator until sometime in the eighties when he retired. He always likes to talk about his days in the Navy and they are some fantastic tales of courage. Cinema has seen many stories of ones heroic experience during wartime. Last year, we had Lone Survivor during the war on terror. Now we have a WWII story in Unbroken.Louie Zamperini begins as an Italian immigrant who is still a young boy when his family settled in Torrance, California. He's a troublemaker and constantly bullied for being an immigrant, but his brother Peter notices how fast he is. With a new pair of shoes, Louie become a respected runner, even gaining the name ""the Torrance Tornado"", going as far as the 1936 Olympics in Berlin where he places 8th. WWII comes next where Louie immediately joins, looking to serve his country and maybe make it to the next Summer Games.He becomes a bombardier in the Air Force in the South Pacific where he's found a crowd of people he can call his friends. Their called on a search mission in an unstable plane, which the military insists is air-worthy. Both engines fail, crashing into the sea. Three make it out; Zamperini, Mac and Phil. They survive on a raft where they ration the little food they have and attempt to ward the sharks that are swimming around them. They manage to go on living for another forty-seven days (though they lose Mac) when they're finally foundby the Japanese military. Their captured and sent to a P.O.W. camp where Zamperini endures the meanest military officer around, Mutsuhiro ""Bird"" Watanabe, who feels nothing but jealousy for the Olympic athlete.This ""military grunt who goes through the storm to triumph"" seems like something that has been done beforeand I'm not gonna lie when I feel like that it's familiar to me too. But that didn't ruin my experience watching this as Zamperini is a very likable guy here, always showing the will to survive even when the Japanese tell him that he's nothing. Jack O'Connell plays our lead and does really well with this guy, giving him the needed rebellious edge to give him his strength for his darkest moments.Angelina Jolie is behind the camera here as the film looks really well. Much of the news behind Unbroken is her directing this movie. While it's not as groundbreaking as Stanley Kubrick or Oliver Stone, she can paint an impressive side of the war. The movie itself is something that I'm glad I watched, but I don't know if I'd watch it again. It's not the story, but it's just kind of sandwiched between a lot of other war movies. I would understand why people would love this and even understand why it could become a box office hit,I'll give this seven B-24 Liberator planes out of ten. Unbroken manages to pass as something that's interesting to hear about, though once you hear about the hundreds of military triumph stories, it'll be easy to lose track.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who the killer is writing these reviews?,"While not great this was a darn good film. Powerful and emotionally compelling. At times difficult to watch. This movie is like stepping into a WWII reality film. Perhaps it comes from having worked with the Japanese Military and a Watanabe no less! Perhaps it's from having an Uncle who died flying the B-25. Perhaps it was because Zamperini came from a very similar background as my Dad's family. Here is a story of *real* emotional and physical triumph over *real* ethnic and racial hatred. Well acted, I didn't think you could make a film that made me glad we nuked 'em. This film did: and simultaneously made me ashamed of the work I did to help the Japanese. Good acting, costumes and cinematography. Yeah the Director could have left a little more on the cutting room floor. But you're going to rate it a 2 because the Director was a little long winded?

Unbroken is a well wriitten and directed movie.,"Angelina Jolie directed this story with compelling motivation and truthfulness from the story teller Louis Zamperini. It was by far one of the greatest and most inspirational movies of my time. An Olympic athlete who shows his enemies compassion and endurance even as a prisoner of war. Showing that there is hope and light in the darkest of places. The direction and sequence of each scene was perfect; Angelina knew how, where, and when she wanted the movie to be filmed.

Jack O'Connell, who had played the main character as Louis Zamperini, was a very great fit for the role, he was strong, brave and played his part very dramatically and realistically.

Mediocre actress directs mediocre film,"I was very disappointed in what should have been, hands down, an Oscar contender. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone because the direction absolutely ruined this film, which misses the point of the book altogether. Laura Hildebrand's wonderful book immediately reaches the reader's heart as she connects Louie Zamperini's life story of growing up from a kid headed towards a life of crime to becoming a man who not only survived the most unbelievable odds but also how the human spirit can sustain anything, if wanted. Never during the two + hours does the viewer get to know the character, or his friends, family and comrades-in-arms. Maybe Ms. Jolie should have spent more time reading the book and trying to understand the emotional connect the book had with its readers than planning all her promotional interviews and short documentaries which focused only on her and how fortunate she was to have been chosen to direct the film. It's not about you, Angelina, it was about a remarkable life and humanity, and you missed it all.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well, a little broken","Quickie Review:Olympian Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), turned bombardier in WWII survives a plane crash into the ocean. He along with his crew-mates are left stranded on a raft for 47 days. Just when all hope is lost Louis enters another hell when he is captured by the Japanese navy and sent to a detention camp. This is the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie, and unfortunately the lack of directing experience does show when it comes to character development and story pacing. This film certainly has moments where it shines. It is well shot and acted, with the first half showing some potential for greatness. However, the second half feels overstretched without the depth of rest of the movie. In the end it's alright, but it could have been a lot better.Full Review:Coen brothers written WWII movie based on a true story. Sounds like a safe bet right? Well there is one wildcard here, the director is Angelina Jolie. Considering she has never been behind the camera before I had to consider the chance the movie would be rough around the edges. Turns out there is slightly more roughness than I had anticipated.First off this is a impressive looking movie. The opening shot is of a bombing run over an enemy base while trying to survive the anti- air fire. It's intense with great cinematography, and you also see a lot of that even during the smaller intimate moments. The sets and look of the movie add to the tangibility of the horrors of being stranded on the ocean or being held and mistreated as a prisoner of war. Additionally, two of the main cast Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson were great in their roles. Both of them had to carry a significant part of the story, the friendship and comradery they have in the wake of the crash felt genuine. I really enjoyed watching the first half of the movie because it jumped between times before and during the war. So you get to see Louis' past and how it shaped him to handle the hellish circumstances he has been dealt.With such an inspirational story, you would expect to be deeply moved by the film. Instead there are some missteps taken that hinder Unbroken from reaching its potential. I just mentioned how I enjoyed the structure of the first half showing two time-lines, it added the much needed emotional weight. However, that structure is completely abandoned once Louis is captured by the Japanese navy. This would have been fine if the detention camp scenes carried the same weight. The problem is that the sense of consequence is completely non- existent for the rest of the movie. For example, there would be a scene where Louis would be beaten senselessly, to the point he can't stand or loses consciousness, but then next scene is the very next day of him sitting pretty with a nicely combed greased hair and a single scar on his cheek. This happens so often and for so long that I wasn't as invested in him anymore. What's the point if he brushes everything off so easily the next scene? He may be a hero in real life, but he is not a superhero. A good villain could have redeemed this part of the movie, but even that was poorly handled. Takamasa Ishihara, who plays the camp's officer in command comes off as a very shallow and generic villain, being evil just for the sake of it.All the right ingredients are there but somewhere along middle the recipe was meddled with. Overall, Unbroken is a watchable film thanks to its cinematography and decent acting. I wouldn't recommend a full price ticket, but it is worthy of a Netflix stream. Main issue is that too much time and effort is put on the invincibility of the characters rather than their vulnerability. This results in a film that feels somewhat underwhelming and unrelatable at certain moments.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A brutal masterpiece,"""Unbroken"" is a brutal and terrifying story about a man basically getting abused for an extraordinary amount of time. Plane wrecks, stranded at sea for months, being captured by enemy soldiers where he is beaten and abused. It's scary. I couldn't manage going through everything that the protagonist went through. I would probably make it a fifth of the time that he made it through and then either lose my mind or just kill myself. He made it all the way through and still remained strong.The correct thing done with this movie were the amounts of real emotion that they placed throughout the movie. Not really what they showed, but more what the audience felt. I could not stop thinking about how bad I felt for this guy throughout the entire movie. But at the same time, I simply couldn't look away. It kept pulling me in and kept making me upset but interested. I was constantly questioning what I would do in his spot. How I would react and behave to some of these situations what he went through. It was like one of those really sad commercials for the animal shelters. You feel so sad but you can't look away because then you feel like a hypocrite. The sadness and just sheer brutality of this film told the entire story throughout the duration of it.There was only one problem with this movie. And that was the fact that I noticed that it was unnecessarily censoring stuff. Which, I guess, makes sense. But I feel like it hurt the experience just SLIGHTLY. It made slightly tough at times to immerse myself in some of the drama that was happening because I wasn't seeing what was actually happening. Immersion is a big part of the experience for me when it comes to movies, and the censoring made it only a little difficult to do that.""Unbroken"" is a masterpiece of a drama. It has the perfect ability of not making you think ""Oh yeah, this guy is going through crap. I get it at this point."" It constantly keeps you interested and feeling the feels and is definitely worth watchingunless you only like comedy moviesthis movie is nowhere near lightly-toned.

Best Movie I've Seen in Ages,"Unbroken was the best movie I've seen in ages. It is probably difficult to portray the intensity of the camp personnel and the detail but the focus was on LS and not the conditions of the camp. If anything was lost it was in feminizing the Japanese prison camp Corporal Watanabe who was probably more brutal in appearance at the time than Takamasa Ishihara is now, being that Takamasa looks more like a runway model for Japanese clothing than a prison camp guard. That's a casting issue.And those who have never been in any military setting of any kind would also have difficulty understanding that there are always long periods of waiting in the military, so things can get drawn out. In a film, drawn out can get boring.But other than that, this was the best movie I'd seen in ages. Ten Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unwar camp,The movie I'm going to talk about is unbroken and there are three main topics I would like to talk about. The first topics I would like to talk about is how Louie Zamperini didn't have any friends because he was different than other little boys. Louie try to get allow with them but they would just beat him up because he didn't have any back up or anyone for say. After a while he didn't care and started to run. The next topic I'm telling you about is how no matter where Louie is always getting hurt. When he is with the Japan's place he gets hit with a stick and get kicks by the owner of the place. My last topic is when he is in the war camp they go through so much stuff in little time. They don't get much food and they don't get a break at all if they do it is only before they go bed.The movie was understandable when you watch but if you missed a part you will not understand what happen. Some of the flash back scenes I didn't understand what was going on but then it went back and I understand it a lot better. Some of the music you didn't hear a lot unless you were listening for it which we had some. Some of these were help to the story. Unbroken was to short they should have made it a little longer. I really didn't like the movie because it was a lot of mean thing that happen to Louie and when they are at the war camp they get beat up. I think the movie should be seen by PG-13 and I think it is about 2.8 stars.,,Anonymous,Biography
"Amazing film, what Hollywood can be when they are not belittling us","I see some reviews questioning the pacing. Hello, gamers. True, this story is not breakneck paced, nor should it be. The viewer needs to feel the agony of time passing as much as the main character. That is not an accident, rather it is by design. This is not an action film. This is an endurance film. Much like the character's sport, it is not a sprint.

"Angelina Jolie is trying too hard to create an ""oscar winning"" epic WWII tale","Angelina Jolie's directorial debut is far too ambitious. She obviously tried to win an Oscar for that one thinking all Hollywood WWII tales are instant award winning movies. The problem with Unbroken is that Angelina Jolie is a really bad storyteller. The movie drags for the first hour and a half, with the story showing how Zamperini survived in the pacific. While it is necessary to show how he survived the ordeal, the way Angelina told the story is boring and completely uninteresting. The cast is also lacking, and borderline amateurish, lacking any emotional impact on the viewers. Jack O'Connell (Zamperini) is not suited at all for the main role. The final scene in which he carries the heavy wooden log over his head is far fetched and borderline Hollywood fiction. Unbroken is ultimately broken on all parts. This 140 min motion picture is a pain to watch, and ironically the only redeeming parts remotely interesting to me was the final cut of the movie that shows the real Zamperini carrying the Olympic torch in Nagano's 1998 Winter games.

Inspirational and superbly crafted picture,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Unbroken"" (2014) is a superbly crafted movie by a very talented people behind the camera. In script department you have Coen brothers and two other heavyweights - and it feels here - script is believable (yes, i know it's based on true life and adapted from a book), involving and inspiring but not overdone. Cinematography by a legendary Roger Deakins (who was nominated for 12 Oscars in his carrier!) is superb, gorgeous, capturing everything from wide and tight angles and has this classical feel of the movies - ""Unbroken"" has to witnessed on the big screen. The actors, who most are little known did a great job. When you have this kind of material and this caliber of people in front and behind the camera, it's a difficult job to fail, and a second time director Angelina Jolie does a descent job in keeping the pacing so well, that at the running time 2 h 14 min this movie almost never drags and is very good.Overall, ""Unbroken"" is a superbly told magnificent true story.

Unbroken is well...Unfinished,"Some people live extra-ordinary lives but no journey of life can be accurately described as just ordinary but instead referenced for contrasting purposes. All Life remains and stands as the mysterious gift it is. I read the book which is a page turner and one of the best reading values around and it is a thick and rich source of detail material. It must have been challenging to the Director to reduce this to just a measly two hour plus movie. As a business venture, it may pay off. But some things should not be based solely on rate of return but contribution to society as a whole. It may interest you to know that the Japanese people were ruthless and focused as well as formidable when at war and if not for the Emperor's command to stand down would have all died fighting to the last man bar none and taken millions of their enemies with them. Their mandate to fight and win was superior as was the Germans during the world war. It was the Americans who were poorly trained, outfitted and briefed while taken by complete surprise of war and how it respects no one. This cost many American lives. I was not able to fully grasp the individual whose life story this movie was based on as exceptional. Our history is replete with many similar known and unknown stories of this nature. What wasn't documented would over-whelm for its contents...remember, no two life journeys alike either.

Partly Broken: A Film Whose Faults Are Covered Up By Great Directing and Performance,"I missed these journeyed and inspiring World War II films. I thought that the stories had all been dried up, but Louie Zamperini's story surprises us all; how could such a story not have been told before? Angelina Jolie's bold directing surprises us, Joel and Ethan Cohen's script satisfies us, and Jack O'Connell shocks us as 'the next big thing.'Unbroken tells the story of Louie Zamperini, a son to Italian immigrants, who as a kid was a troublemaker and thief. Zamperini's brother pushed him to try out for his school's track team and there we see that Zamperini is a born runner. As the years go by, Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) is recruited for the US Olympic team that would compete the 1936 Berlin games. However, as WWII breaks out, Zamperini is drafted into the army. During a mission in 1943 Zamperini's plane crashes at sea. Zamperini along with the pilot Phil (a great Domhnall Gleeson) and new recruit Mac (Finn Wittrock) are left at sea for 47 days. The three men spend those days being harrowed by sharks and shot at by occasional Japanese planes. The group is finally rescued, but by a Japanese ship. Zamperini is then subjected to the torture and abuse of a prisoner-of-war camp officer, Watanabe ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara).The film is powerful and the performances are noteworthy. Jack O'Connell's charisma not only is reflected in Zamperini's character, but it drives the whole film and keeps the audience glued to their seats. Domhnall Gleeson also surprises us as he defines himself as quick-learning actor. Gleeson started from a miniscule role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but has progressed and moved into more interesting characters in movies like About Time, Frank, and Calvary. Now in Unbroken he might just break into the B-list acting category, it will be only a matter of time before he breaks into the A-list. However, not all the acting was great. There were some serious casting mistakes in Zamperini's brother both as an adult and as a young boy (Alex Russell and John D'Leo respectively). Both actors have very few lines, but they say them in such a way that it makes them sound extremely cheesy and non-credible. It's a shame because it ruins the scenes of Zamperini's childhood. Meanwhile in the prisoner-of-war camp the actor playing The Bird (Takamasa Ishihara) is a little to exaggerated. Ishihara is actually a Japanese pop star, and not a professional actor, and while his acting is more than acceptable, his passion at times is too much and it throws the movie's balance off, creating a character that is unreasonably evil. When researching the actual person I learned that The Bird tortured his prisoners because he was bipolar and jealous of not becoming an officer having come from a wealthy family where he was used to having everything he wanted. Ishihara doesn't give his character depth, The Bird doesn't end up being human, and this lack of background and reasoning for his cruelty makes the relationship between him and Zamperini seem almost comical.Finally, in regards to the film's script, while written by two professionals like the Cohen brothers, it seems a little lazy. The lack of depth for some characters and the wispy dialogue throughout is disappointing. However, the ending for the film is what disappointed me most, not the actual factual ending, but the way that it was ended. The final ten minutes seemed extremely rushed, confusing, and outright slothish, not to mention a little cheesy. However, in the end, Jolie's directing choices keep the film respectable and intriguing, which along with O'Connell's incredible acting is enough to cover up the mistakes. Unbroken ends up being the inspiring story it aspired to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I don't care about war time films like ""Fury"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" that doesn't mean there not good films at all there just not my cup of tea. However Unbroken had a lot of good reception around it, so I decided to go and see it and I am happy I did.The film starts of very slow and even drags its feet in the mud, but when the conflict really starts happening and the characters face many problems that would happen in WWII the film takes a interesting turn and becomes a movie that I really can stand behind and have a bit of enjoyment from.Will it be in my best films of all time... No?? But it is a good film all the same. It talks a lot on the overall endurance that people have to stand up for what they believe in at all times, and it is quite amazing to see all the hardships these characters go through in order to survive in the face of death and never break for even a moment. I do think that this a good movie to watch.Now I can't talk about a movie that takes place in WW2 without talking about how Japanese films on it differ from this one. While watching the film I found myself thinking back to ""Grave of the fireflies"" which is a Japanese orientated anime film on WW2 that talks of the sorrow the japs felt as America came back to throw bombs on them, and all there sorrow on the issue. It kinda makes me think as a look at this film were the pain stops.

A Very Good Tribute to a True American Hero!,"""Unbroken"" is the true story USA Olympian and World War II Prisoner of War Survivor Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, portrayed wonderfully in the movie by Jack O'Connell, based on the 2010 non-fiction book by Laura Hillenbrand ""Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption."" The film also marks the Directorial Debut for Academy Award Winning Actress, and Humanitarian Angelina Jolie. The movie traces the story of Zamperini being bullied in childhood, as a child of Italian immigrants, to his rise as a Track Star in High School, leading to him becoming an Olympian, to his service in the US Air Force in World War II, where he was eventually captured by the Japanese, and was imprisoned in different prisoner of war camps. Zamperini must overcame horrible torture and abuse by his captors to survive until war's end. The movie has been receiving mixed reviews. While I won't say it is a 4-Star Masterpiece, and I could think of what one or two things that could have made it more effective - but I liked it very much. I think the movie is a Very Good Tribute to a True American Hero. Certainly applause should go to all involved with the film for putting Zamperini's story on screen. Considering the subject matter, and the fact that it is her first time Directing, I believe Jolie deserves some praise. I am not saying she deserves a Best Directing Oscar, or the Film deserves a Best Picture Oscar, but I can say this – I was moved at film's end. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars – 8 ½ out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An important story to tell despite some of its core problems,"The film was beautiful and inspirational for what it was but perhaps one of the foundational problems of the film was the story itself. Books are often very hard to turn into films because they are a very different art form. Zamperini's story of struggle and resilience was portrayed magnificently with the direction of Angelina Jolie, but as a viewer, I felt like I was just being brought along chapter by chapter and the flow of the movie never took any big dips or jolts. Although it won't be a film to remember for years to come, it was still important that it be made and it served the purpose it was given, to tell the brave story of a very brave man.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exactly What You'd Expect From Angelina Jolie,"There are some filmmakers/storytellers that carry a very cynical and cold vision when depicting people and their stories—filmmakers that are reluctant to get too close to their subjects so that a cornucopia of biased tenderness doesn't consume them and birth a fully reverential (blandly extoling) tale about this particular subject. Angelina Jolie happens to have a different agenda, on the opposite end of this spectrum, and considering we know quite a bit about her after all these years already, the most accurate adjective I can give to her second directorial entry: ""unsurprising."" Jolie has a very warm, sentimental, and hopeful attitude about her. In this case, I can't confidently criticize her for overreaching on the sentimentality scale; the fact of the matter is that it gets tricky when one readies himself to review a true story. I, myself, can't take that away from the film or Louis Zamperini who is an incredible human being that survived an unbelievably incredible life—from an impeccable runner representing the US in the Olympics to a soldier who's stranded out in the middle of the ocean to a helpless prisoner in a ruthless Japanese internment camp.This all sounds very well like an ""Oscar-bait"" kind of Hollywood motion picture, but again, it actually happens to be an insane true story. However, just because it's true and oh-so-inspiring, it doesn't mean that I can be easily swayed into absolutely admiring it. You can call me cold-hearted or you can just call me objective and hesitant. Admittedly, I don't have the ability to question the exact accuracy of all the miniscule heroic, unrelenting details of Zamperini's journey presented here, but I definitely can scrutinize the quality and appropriateness of its translation to the big screen. After this year's earlier blockbuster, Maleficent, which shamelessly transformed one of Disney's most horrifying villains into a sympathetic, compassionate caretaker, and now this total motivator, I have doubts that Jolie can commit to something that's (much) morally grayer in her artistic pursuits. This film tonally deceives you; while it presents us with truly disturbing scenes of torture and endless suffering (that almost becomes tedious in its uneventful repetition), Unbroken nonetheless sweeps you up from under your feet and tries to fill your heart with that final, last-minute dose of forceful effusiveness.What compelled me to keep my eyes on the screen throughout honestly wasn't the grandeur of the story but Jack O'Connell's magnificently transformative performance as Louis—a performance that exhibits despair, satisfying confidence, mania, optimism, and sometimes even near-defeat. Obviously not on equal ground with the sheer courageous strength of the man he's portraying, O'Connell still possesses his own strong-rooted (thespian) commitment that sees him losing a frightening amount of weight to bare bones less than mid-way into the narrative. The primary villain, Mutsuhiro Watanabe (aka ""The Bird""), is played very eccentrically by Japanese musician Miyavi. Watanabe is the central prison guard with an interestingly feminine appearance along with that deceptive soft voice of his.Of course, you can't deny the utterly monumental nature of this story and its structure as you're taken from one tremendously perilous and insurmountable predicament to another, from famished sharks to the desperate-to-win Japanese. The haplessness never ceases and only worsens. But ""a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" so it seems and only proves to be true once everything is said and done and a legacy has been made out of Zamperini's adventurous lifetime. Some of the scenes here are almost too excessive in their long-winded suffering, seeming to drag on for too long, but it seems to be in the strength of the director to keep the pace and interest afloat. For instance, a scene that shows a group of people filing in a line to punch Louis real hard in the face for his misbehavior might seem like it'd eventually reach monotony, but the scene is edited and shot with impressive diversity (one shot focuses on Louis' failing posture and another on The Bird's fascinating expressions, and so on) to effectively maintain that drama. Another sequence, probably the best of the overall movie, sees an aerial battle as American soldiers, along with Louis, fend off fierce Japanese planes; it's all executed with a staying sense of tension and intrigue despite the occasional slowing of the pace.Now, on the other hand, the weakest link of the movie is surely its screenplay, which is unexpectedly disappointing considering that it was written by the Coen Brothers who, by the way, aren't really known for their affectionate writing—so, a very odd and unrecognizable choice there. Unbroken is littered with saccharine, fortune-cookie inspirational lines (""if you can take it, you can make it,"" guys!) and unrealistic dialogue. If you can make an inspiring movie that feels more natural and convincing than simply emotionally manipulative, or frankly emotionally/psychologically simplistic, then you have some undeniable talent. This film, however, plays it very safe and formulaically; this tale is about forgiveness, religion, idealism— hardly something that sounds like it could be a little more subtle and restrained.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angels With Dirty Faces Mutiny On The River Kwai With Cool Hand Luke,"As my bomber dove into the water, I thought back to my childhood. I was a bad kid, just like Jimmy Cagney in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES. See, here I am outrunning a cop who says I'll end up in reform school! Luckily, my big brother (who would have been Pat O'Brien in the old days) tells me I can do anything. So immediately I'm a track star in the Olympics!Now here I am, stuck on a lifeboat for weeks on end, just like Charles Laughton MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY. Eating seagulls? Catching sharks? When Laughton did it as Captain Bligh he looked so damned cool. Why do I look like a jerk? Must be the character was more interesting. Bligh started mean, and hard, but on the raft he slowly changed. When he shared his food it was a shock. He became human. Interesting. Complex. (""But I am still giving the orders here, Mr. Maggs."") I just sat around talking about mama's spaghetti. (Just like Clemenza in THE GODFATHER. But not cool!)At last! Rescued by the Japanese, I'm thrown in prison camp. I've got nothing, just like Paul Newman in COOL HAND Luke. But sometimes nothing can be a mighty cool hand! So now I'm defiant, I've got attitude. But somehow I'm still a lifeless chump. And yet all anyone does is tell me how wonderful I am all the time! That evil Bird guy keeps beating me up, and stealing scenes one after another. It's not fair! He's actually ACTING and not sitting around looking blank. He reminds me of Brian Donlevy playing the evil Sergeant Markov in the original BEAU GESTE. Discipline in this camp is severe, I promise you! But I'm not fighting to protect my family, or my honor, or even the fabulous Blue Jewel. I'm no Gary Cooper . . . I promise you!Hey, what gives! The war is over, and now I can go home. I ran really fast, I flew airplanes, I got beat up, I got tortured, I floated around in a boat, and I never gave up hope. Hope for what, I don't know.

Excellent movie!,"Once again when I read the reviews on IMDb I come to the conclusion that there are a lot of pathetic wannabe movie directors on here. How the hell can you rate this movie with 4 stars or lesser is beyond my comprehension especially when you see the amount of garbage movies that are rated better. I don't know what's wrong with those people, must be frustration or something like that. And you can't come with that idiotic argument again that the book is better then the movie because that's the case for 99% of the books. If you like the books better then just read it and don't watch the movie. I watch a movie to be entertained and the least you can say about Unbroken is that you are entertained. I thought Angelina Jolie and the Coen brothers did a brilliant job with Unbroken. I liked ""Against the Sun"" which is almost the same movie like the beginning of Unbroken, but Unbroken is even better with the constant battle and humiliation between Zamperini and Watanabe at the end. Both Jack O'Connell and Takamasa Ishihara gave us an excellent performance with their roles. Throughout the whole movie you can only feel sorry for those prisoners and you only hope that Watanabe is going to get what he deserves. Brilliant acting! I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I wonder which movie all those negative reviewers would give a top rating? I can only suggest to all those haters to stop whining all the time and to get a life.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It Really Wasn't That Bad.,"""Unbroken"" is probably one of the best films Angelina Jolie produced and directed. It shows how Louis Zamperini's (Jack O'Connell) strong will to win and survive carries him through the toughest punishments of his military life. I read a lot of negative reviews on this film saying it lacked emotion, feeling, and no character growth, I admit it wasn't a Steven Spielberg kind of World War II film but it wasn't bad. It probably just needed a little more action to make it a better film but I don't think that's what the writers intended. To me the story line and plot came together to make a pretty decent film. The acting wasn't bad either. The characters were pretty convincing. My favorite character was Watanabe (Miyavi). After dealing with the open sea for 47 days Watanabe (Miyavi) was Louis Zamperini's (Jack O'Connell) next hurdle in surviving the war. These two characters' interactions pretty much made the second half of the film. Like I said, I didn't think it was as bad as some reviewers said it was. My wife doesn't even like these kind of films and she ended up liking it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like getting punched in the face by 200 P.O.W.'s,"Every so often a film comes along that inspires me to overcome all challenges and energizes me with an almost divine zest for life. Unbroken is one of those films. It's heroic without being campy, it's tragic without being grotesque, and it's historic without being too detailed. It depicts the worst human suffering through true story; a story so overburdened with pain and trauma that most filmmakers would make it unbearable to watch, but somehow Angelina and the Coen brothers manage to keep it highly engaging the whole time. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who are suffering from the worst illness of all: privilege. It's a punch in the face and a reminder of what matters in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Louis' story needs to be told and this film is well worth watching.,"Good movie and a moving story. I think Louis' story needs to be told and it is a hard story to do honour to on the screen and this is a good attempt at telling that story. I watched the film after reading Laura Hillenbrand's book the movie is based on. I found the movie lacking when compared to the book. Having said that, this is a very broad and deep story and it would be hard to convey all the emotions and feeling contained in the book on the screen. If you enjoyed the film, read the book. I am sure you would find the book very moving.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jolie and Cohens absolutely butchered this,"With complete respect to everyone who positively reviewed this movie, I don't know how you could give a good rating if you read the book. They butchered it, from the lack of a time line to the deafening silence in the second half of the movie. I ask in all sincerity, would a narrator not have made this movie 20 times better?Think about it, someone to tell the story and emotionally attach you (moreso) to the characters would have done wonders for this picture. Unless you read the book I there was no way you really connected to the level that you needed to in order to truly feel the trials and tribulations Louis went through. There was such a deeper connection that needed to be made for this story to really grab hold of your soul, no way this film did it justice.2 examples that I can give (although there are several) would be the failure to dive deeper into the psychological toll that repeated air raids would take on a man (I forget how many he went on but it was probably close to 50. The movie did not even touch on the statistics of how many airmen were lost, killed, or wounded in WWII (into the hundreds of thousands) or how many planes crashed or disappeared (over 50,000). Another example, the failure to more powerfully bond Louis and his family as well as show his struggle after the war. Butchered as I said. Terrible first showing of Angelina Jolie's direction, if this movie wins an Academy Award I will puke.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
a story that continues after the movie,"This movie is an inspiration, the story follows a man who is an athlete through his life as a troubled youth and into his military career. When he is captured by the Japanese during WWII his fame as an athlete haunts him as he is the target of abuse by the prison camp commandant. The story carried you through his journey of faith and comes full circle by the end of the movie. The real life man who lived this movie so many years ago passed away in 2014, before the movie was released. This is a true hero who serves his country well and learns along the way. The movie feels complete, but the man in the movie continued to live his life after returning home. I want to recommend this movie, but also the book ""Louis Zamperini: Captured By Grace"" which tells the story of life after returning home a hero. Through the power of the Gospel—and his experience at the 1949 Billy Graham Crusade in Los Angeles—Zamperini overcame alcoholism, night terrors and a failing marriage to live a full and joyous Christ-centered life until his passing at age 97, inspiring millions along the way. This movie, and this book, obviously this man, are all inspirational. I highly recommend that you catch this film before it gets away!",,Anonymous,Biography
Utmost Respect for Ms. Jolie,"First, I did not read the book, so cannot make any comparison. My wife and I were interested in seeing this movie after seeing an interview with Louie on 'CBS Sunday Morning.' We both enjoyed the movie. Obviously the entire book would not fit into the time allotted for a feature film, but we felt this captured the most significant part of Louie's story, his survival when faced with ridiculous odds. Yes, it might have been interesting to see more of his pre-war days and his post-war days, but the film was more about one man's incredible spirit rather than about the man himself.Some have indicated they thought the movie dragged on, but I never had any sense of how long it was. The action scenes were expertly done and very realistic looking, at least to someone who never experienced similar moments, and I thought the portrayal of the prison camp gave a good sense of the suffering involved.But the most amazing thing to me, and why Ms. Jolie jumped a peg or two in my eyes, is that I don't recall a single vulgarity in the film, and that's unheard of these days, especially a war film. Don't get me wrong, I've cursed plenty and have no problem with cursing in films, but I do think it gets overused and often has no relevance to either the story or characters. It was very refreshing to watch a film where the director (or perhaps writers) felt similarly.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good Movie, but........","This is based upon a true storyWe see Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) as a kid doing petty thief things, becoming a track star in school so he wouldn't be picked on for being Italian, being a member of the 1936 Olympics Team as a runner, being a Bombardier in WWII, and being downed by engine failures in a plane that was used for parts for other aircraft, and finally being a POW in a Japanese Prison Camp.From the title we know he will survive everything and maybe this is why we didn't feel empathy anywhere in his life. We didn't need the Kleenex boxes we thought we might need. The 47-days in the life raft showed the plane survivors as fairly healthy and their skin should have shown more blotches from the sun.It is when Louis gets to the prison camp in Japan that we see him experiencing brutal pain thru beatings. that are administered by the camp commander, Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara). who the prisoners nickname The Bird. Now where did we see him before? Huh?Didn't we see him at the 1936 Olympics when the torch was being carried in to the stadium? Didn't Louis look to his right and saw Watanabe who looked to his left and nodded to Louis? Wasn't that him? I thought Watanabe, in the camp, was jealous and took pleasure berating and beating Louis. If that was not him, then why was that nodding scene at the Olympics included in the movie? Why indeed because there was no mention in the statements at the end of the movie acknowledging their somewhat meeting at the Olympics and of Watanabe being in the Olympics. Why indeed?Oh, you say Louis was remembering that time when he was in the camp. No, he had that memory when he was in the plane and about to crash in to the ocean. This memory was not from the camp, but from the plane. See?This was not a Hogan's Heroes thing in the camp. We saw no interaction between prisoners and guards. We only saw the confrontations between the Bird and Louis. We didn't see much family love from the family except for his brother who helped guide him to a life free of petty crime.Again, we did not feel any compassion for Louis although I am sure, in that real life, beatings and other tortures were the hi-lite of the day for the Bird. Perhaps the Director (Angelina Jolie) should have concentrated more on Louis' suffering so that we could have needed that Kleenex. Didn't happen.Oscar nominations were: Cinematography which was very good; and for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.Over all a good movie that should have shown more real-life suffering by Louis Zamperini as that would have made the title more significant. From all accounts I felt that Louis Zampirini should have been awarded a medal for his endurance and loyalty for not bad mouthing the United States when given the opportunity over Japanese radio.See the statements when the credits run to learn more of what happened to everyone.

A very underrated film with an incredible story line,"I felt i had to write a review on this after seeing so many negative ones. The film was based on the true story of Louis Zamperini, an olympic athlete who fought in WW2. I had been waiting a long to see this movie and it was definitely worth the wait. The story line was incredibly moving and although at times the movie did progress slowly, the overall experience was phenomenal.Angelina Jolie did a remarkable job on putting the film together and the acting couldn't have been better. Takamasa Ishihara who played Watanabe (aka 'the bird') put on an incredible performance and after this movie i think we can all expect to see him offered many more roles in the near future.The movie was touching and it really highlighted Louis' experience from a rebellious child into an incredible athlete. The movie really had you rooting for him and i enjoyed every minute of it. The only negative aspect on the film would have been that Louis lacked chemistry between himself and his family. You didn't really see the bond he shared with his parents. But with that being said, the movie is still a definite must watch!Many people in the reviews section must have thought this was an action film; expecting something big and exciting to happen.

The capture and incarceration was sinister enough without the necessity of brutalizing every move , one thing led to another but not necessarily all that predictable.

Thanks Angelina Jolie,"""Unbroken"" tells quietly one of the most remarkable stories ever. Louis Zamperini was a heroic individual that this film does not pay tribute to. It's forgettable and generic. Angelina Jolie's direction is just awful, I would have taken any other director to do this film than her. The meaning of Zamperini's legacy is brushed over repeatedly, thanks to Jolie's contributions. The film's premise is meant to be inspiring, but strays way far from it. For the positives, though few, it's shot beautifully, and the acting benefits the film. Like ""Free State of Jones"", I'm delighted that the film exists, but it could have been so much better just like the latter film. ""Unbroken"" is damp compared to the ground-breaking book, as it numerously repeats itself hoping that the audience will forget the meaning of the scenes are constantly matched, which qualifies for it to be tedious.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

But the film, covering so many events wonderfully, told only the first half; the tough as nails set-up. As he said in an interview when reading certain parts of the book, Zamperini felt like he was back in war. Just this portion of his journey is rough to witness. The film has many scenes that show his amazing life, with artistic editing and set design. Reading reviews of the film I was prepared to not get the full re-telling of story in the theater.

Falls short of the mark...,"The story of the remarkable life of Louis Zamperini as treated in Helen Hillenbrand's book Unbroken has been adapted to the screen in this film which shares the same name.Lamentably whilst this film has many of the trapping of expensive Hollywood productions, it lacks the most vital ingredient, a soul. We get to know very little about the Louis Zamperini, the man. Instead, what we are offered is a larger than life caricature, that focuses on Zamperini's Olympic achievements and his courage when faced with abuse at the hands of the Japanese as a prisoner of war.What also irritated me about this production, was the attempt to humanize and by extension reform Zamperini's abuser, Mutsuhiro Watanabe. A man occupying US authorities, not unreasonably, classified a war criminal. This film does not show the true extent of Watanabe's abuses (which perhaps is not surprising) but nonetheless showing him in a photo as a boy with his father in no way detracts from or excuses what he did to defenseless, weakened men.All in all, for me, this film falls short of the mark. Its not dreadful but it would have benefited greatly from taking more time to let us get to know the not just Zamperini but the other men who served alongside him.

Inspirational Story,"The film is set mainly during WWII, based on the life of problem child, turned Olympian turned war hero Louis Zamperini. A real life figure who is portrayed by the relatively unknown (in America anyways) Jack O' Connell. The film starts off well enough, putting us right into the action of Zamperini's war days, with flashbacks to his time as a trouble making kid, and back to the war and back to his time as a track star... and back and forth until the two story lines catch up with each other. The trailers left me with the impression that the bulk of the story would be spent in the Japanese internment camps, it actually took close to an hour to get us there. Although at over a 2 hour running time, the argument could be made, that all that preceded the POW camp was back story, or build up. I do commend the filmmakers for trying to stay as close to real events and timeliness as possible. That being said, the film did feel a bit slow to me at times. Maybe after a second screening I won't feel as off by the pacing knowing when the parts of the story I saw in the trailer were coming. This film is only the second feature from superstar turned filmmaker, Angelina Jolie, with a screenplay by none other than the the famed writer/director siblings, Joel and Ethan Coen. I'm not sure if you've figured this out yet, but I am a big supporter of the female filmmaker. However I did find a few problems with Angelina's directing, that I feel the need to comment on. As I said earlier the pacing of the film seemed a little slow for my taste, but that's something I can get past. The physical scenes, like Zamperini getting beat up as a child, or disciplined by his father fell flat. Instead of utilizing close ups to show pain or emotion, these scenes were left mostly as wide shots, or what I call establishing shots, as if we were just watching what was happening and not experiencing it from Louis point of view. The same goes for the more brutal scenes in the camps. However, the argument could be made that this was done on purpose, to show a more human side to Zamperini's tormentors. Maybe I've become too desensitized by modern filmmaking, but I still feel there could have been a few more cuts to close ups and reaction shots to convey more of a sense of urgency or fear. I do appreciate the overall feel of the movie, Angelina Jolie seems to have a very romantic sense of filmmaking, not unlike Sofia Coppola. Which can be wonderful, but I've had the same pacing issue with some of Coppola's films as I had with this film. That being said the nominations that Unbroken was awarded were well deserved, cinematography and sound mixing and sound editing (though you'd be hard pressed to find a decent war movie that was not nominated for a sound achievement). I just hope that miss Jolie (or Mrs. Jolie-Pitt, whatever she goes by) is aware of the talent of her crew, and appreciates their contribution to the film. that being said, I do feel that Angelina Jolie has talent as a director. The cast was absolutely amazing, and their performances were top notch. It is very obvious that Jolie knows how to direct her actors.So, when all is said and done, if you go into Unbroken expecting an inspirational story over a war drama, you will not be disappointed. I am excited to see more of Angelina Jolie in this medium as well as the actors and crew.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest wartime stories,"This film deserves nothing but a top rating. Jolie directed a top notch production with all the realism of what our P.O.W.'s had to endure. The opening bombing run itself is worth an Oscar!!Yes, there was a large production and post-production crew behind the film, but the director has the final control and Angelina Jolie pulled it off perfectly.It is unfortunate so many people rate a film on some preconceived notion of what a film should include and how it should be shown. Those who rate this film poorly should take a crack at producing and directing a large scale motion picture centered around such a complex subject.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good work of Jolie as director, but she forgets a fundamental motivation: to move the viewer and make the project something epic and unforgettable","""Invincible"" portrays the life of Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), who at the peak of his form is called to World War II and compelled to go through objectionable situations that flee from the understanding of physical and emotional human limits. For more than two hours, we are forced to follow incessant torture in the subject's life, which begins even before he is exchanging shots - since he was a child, he suffered abuse inside and outside the house. On the battlefield, Zamperini and the troops accompanying him have their plane hit, forcing pilot and friend Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) to make a forced landing in the middle of the ocean. Only three survive, the two already mentioned and soldier Mac (Finn Wittrock), thus leaving the group shipwrecked for more than a month on top of a boat, surviving who knows how. And when rescue finally appears, it is actually the Japanese navy to capture them.During the first hour, it is already possible to establish a bond with the story presented and start rooting for the protagonist, who, being the son of Italian immigrants, suffers from the abuse of the other boys where he lives and finds in sport an outlet for all his rebelliousness. . With the help of his older brother, Louie becomes a disciplined young man and manages to qualify to go with the American delegation to compete in the 1936 Olympics, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. However, this part of the story is mixed with scenes of a B-24 being targeted by heavy artillery and inside it is Louie himself who ends up joining the United States Air Forces sometime later. With this tactic and competent editing, it is easy to create this empathy and understand the mishaps Louie will go through. However, Jolie repeats that same formula for longer than necessary and it just doesn't end in a total failure, thanks to the performances of a select group of actors, mainly because of the not-so-known Jack O'Connell who was chosen to finger by the director herself.The young Englishman Jack O'Connell convinces as well as the Italian Louis Zamperini, maintaining an austere, noble and secure position most of the time. The physical transformation he undergoes is surprising, and he efficiently fulfills what is proposed to him. The same can be said of other cast members, such as Domhnall Gleeson (who stays next to him in the boat) or Garrett Hedlund (his main ally in the prison camp). The oriental Takamasa Ishihara (a very popular singer in Japan who goes by the stage name of Miyavi) debuts as an actor as the feared Watanabe, the sadistic general who tries at all costs to bend the protagonist. His inexperience is denoted in some passages, such as when he warns of his imminent departure or in the final lack of control, and his weak opposition almost spills over even more. But it is not her fault, as the director assumes this responsibility calmly. After all, she is the one who insists on making it clear that ""even the worst of enemies is also someone's son"".No one would be able to claim that Louis Zamperini's journey was not interesting. The problem, as it turns out, was just the opposite. After all, this is what we see in the second feature directed by Angelina Jolie: Invincible is made up of so many plots, and with such an enraptured approach to them, that it is difficult to achieve the necessary distance to differentiate what was real from Hollywood fantasy. And so, we have a film that sins for being too correct, exaggerated in its praise of the protagonist and excessive in its structure. There are at least four different movies in Unbroken. The first is about a troubled boy, son of Italian emigrants, who ends up having his rebellion tamed by his older brother, who encourages him to become an Olympic runner. The overcoming of physical challenges, intense training and the conquest of glory are continued in the second storyline, about a young air force soldier summoned for combat during the Second World War. In an unsuccessful rescue mission, he and two colleagues end up falling into the middle of the ocean, with few resources and mere two boats to guarantee their survival. There begins a passage that seems more like a reflection of ""Life of Pi (2013)"", in which a lot of time is taken and almost nothing happens. When all hope is almost gone - on both sides of the screen, it must be clear - the fourth plot begins, when the survivors are rescued by Japanese soldiers - the enemies - and taken to Tokyo as prisoners.Each pass is very well scored. The moments of glory in athletics and the humble but respectful childhood are illuminated, clear and colorful. The sun becomes intense during air raids, in which the companionship of colleagues in action plays a decisive role. If these two times alternate between present and past, during the sunset they face on the high seas, almost everything is lost: loneliness is suffocating, despair is silent and is stamped in static eyes. Upon returning to solid ground - unknown and far from welcoming - almost everything is left behind, and this will be the greatest resistance test, both for the protagonist and the spectators: the scenes of physical and psychological torture, exposed in a very explicit way, are more disturbing than that shock. In the absence of any temperance, there remains an almost palpable discomfort present, as if it were necessary to make him suffer the most so that his final comeback would have even greater meaning.Jolie is a traditional director, who makes humanist cinema - her obvious concern is the characters - and with a great need for impact. This had already been made explicit in the Bosnian Romeu & Juliet of ""In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011)"", her first experience as a director. What interests him here is to show a man who had everything to give up - and who still resists. Therefore, the greater her trials, the better. That's why he's the kid who gets up to no good even for no apparent reason; the athlete who, when he seemed to have no more chances, gets an extra boost that surprises everyone; the fellow soldier who never gives up; the survivor who, even when everything indicates the opposite, continues to maintain reason and hope; the prisoner who becomes the oppressor's punching bag; or the defeated man who maintains his sense of honor until the last moment, without giving in to temptations. The unbeatable and unshakable virtue speaks louder, both for the character and for the filmmaker.Jolie's abysmal evolution as a director is undeniable, comparing this to her previous film. The narrative gains more objectivity, there is dramatic control to make the solutions exaggerated and the photography is stunning. With the help of the exceptional Roger Deakins, the director manages to produce beautiful images and shows consistency when determining the color palette, full of pastel tones. However, it is important not to exaggerate Jolie's merits too much and associate them with the feature film as a whole. ""Invincible"" suffers from some notable shortcomings, such as a more fluid editing (by the way, the great Tim Sqyres and William Goldenberg are in charge of this function), less cliché dialogues (the disappointment could not be greater, since the script is adapted by Richard LaGravanese, William Nicholson and the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen) and more forceful performances (O'Connell's effort is more physical than dramatic. If he had all these qualities, the end result could be even more touching and, who knows, lead to the catharsis of crying - something to be expected from the genre of biographies with a miserable trajectory for the protagonist.In an attempt to move the viewer even further, the script written by four people (including the Coen brothers) ends up making the mistake of being too long, creating a kind of ""saga"" that only postpones the feeling of an extraordinary life. ""Invincible"" is not a film about war, but about the resistance and courage of a man who learned, through sport, never to give up. If it had less details of the protagonist's trajectory, and more strength in the issues that make him really strong in the face of adversity, perhaps the feature would be even more intense. Even so, the story of Louis Zamperini needed to reach the cinemas, and it is very good that it was at the hands of Angelina Jolie. True revenge, in war, is ""going through the war and surviving,"" as Fitzgerald (Hedlund) says. But the real victory - on both sides - is forgiveness, and it's great that the film reminds us of that in its final moments.It is nothing new that any production with artistic pretensions manages to sustain itself only by good intentions, which are generally not successfully executed. Contrary to what she had tried previously, Angelina Jolie manages to do a good job in directing a film in ""Unbroken"". Here, in general, she demonstrates competence and is convinced of what she wants to convey to the public. However, it is in this mood that the director gets carried away and forgets her - until then - fundamental motivation: to move the viewer and make the project something epic and unforgettable. And when you notice, already in the final credits, the use of real images of Zamperini shortly before his death, it's almost like a last - and desperate - resource: ""if you haven't cried until now, see if you can resist this"". Emotion, which should be natural, proves to be forced, the victim of narrative tricks that do not resist a more critical look. A feeling, incidentally, that is reinforced on the work as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good  movie,"A very good movie. Angelina passes skillfully messages: 1) How much strength may exist in the soul of hairless metro sexual boys too. There was no middle-aged man among prisoners.2) How the Japanese sadistic villain had so fagot soul: fagots can be sadists too. Remove from your mind the image of a hard macho man. Times have changed. The film goes back to 1940, shows how to be strong, but the men's characters are like now, delicate and feminine. (Somewhere seen the manicure of Japanese commander, so carefully done as if female).3) While the film wants to show the strength of character, doesn't lack feminine behavior: In the new camp, the protagonist when he sees that the commander is the same sadistic Japanese almost faints.

"Not bad, but there are more powerful related movies out there","True or mostly true stories about strong people who survived tough circumstances are often catchy to follow, particularly if a person did not get into trouble ""voluntarily"", but due to a certain force majeure. World War II was such a mayhem when staying alive no matter what was the virtually the main thing, other things like broken families/opportunities/careers seemed secondary, if not lower.Thanks to the Coen Brothers and Angelina Jolie, above all, we are able to follow the childhood and youth of Louie Zamporini, until his return from a Japanese prison camp in 1945. Rough environment and sports made him tough and let him survive so many such events that even 1 one of those could be easily fatal to most of us. But Zamporini landed on his feet and lived 97 years, all in all... The pace is not always dynamic and some scenes are protracted, but the movie in question is generally a smooth narration about the war perceived by single, ""ordinary"" people.The cast is even in a sense that there are no famous persons stealing the slow. True, Jack O'Connell as Zamperini and Takamasa Ishihara as Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe spend more time on screen than others, with the characters more elaborated, but still, there are no pointless supporting characters among them who say something, they have good complementary significance. Thus, Unbroken is a good watch, but it is still no The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Raid, Empire of the Sun, or similar - no such profundity.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unbroken is not as superb as every one expected!,"""Unbroken"", a movie by Angelina Jolie strides the religious controversies. Though, according to the experts the movie could not earn was expected, because of the crossfire Angelina was facing due to the Sony hack scandal. Watching the movie, has made it pretty much clear to me that the movie has brilliant cinematography by the experts of the industry. The story revolves around an Italian- American who belongs to a poor background. The boy shows up competing as a runner in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, later on he spends few years as a prisoner of World War II. The participation in the Olympics gives the young boy, a sense of respect and responsibility along with a purpose to live. This sensibility leads to his participation in the army. The story of the movie shows a major and dramatic turn when the young man has a plane crash and has to spend more than 40 days in the sea. The rest of the story revolves around the struggle for survival in the sea. The story continues how Zamperini is beaten by his captain, but he remains ""UNBROKEN"". However, the bad and the most disappointing part of the movie is that Angelina has not been successful in presenting a bigger perspective of the picture. The movie can be counted highly one dimensional just because of the brilliant performance of O'Connell. The entire story of the movie revolves around the struggle of a single person. Though the direction of Angelina gave the movie a highly oppressive strength, even then, the movie lacks a sense of humor as well as refinement as that could be helpful in presenting other aspects of the character of Zamperini.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Based on the life of Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini,"With the Oscars coming up, I have been catching up on the films that have been honored with nominations from the Academy. Today I viewed ""Unbroken"" starring Jack O'Connell, Takamasa Ishihara, Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund, Matthew Crocker, and Finn Wittrock (most recently seen on American Horror Story: Freak Show).The film is a true story about the life of Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini and his time in the armed forces during WWII. It was directed by Angelina Jolie and written by Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, William Nicholson, and the book the screenplay was based on was written by Laura Hillenbrand.""Unbroken"" was nominated for Oscars in the following categories:Best Achievement in Cinematography Best Achievement in Sound Mixing Best Achievement in Sound Editing The film received the honor of Movie of the Year at the AFI Awards.""Unbroken: also received the following Critics Choice Awards honors:Best Picture Best Director (Jolie) Best Adapted Screenplay Best CinematographyThere was a bit of controversy over the snubbing of Jolie by the Oscars Academy for Jolie as best director and after viewing the film, I can see why. I do understand why the film garnered much acclaim for cinematography, sound, and screenplay. It was beautifully shot and the perspective of the cameras during the period they were stranded on the lifeboats was absolute perfection. I felt so helpless along with the characters, I felt frustrated for them, and even more than a bit panicked.From the beginning I found the writing and delivery of the lines to convey the camaraderie of the soldiers. When they receive a new plane to fly, one officer comments, ""It's like sitting in the living room trying to fly the house"" another counters with ""Well, it's been certified"" and another comments, ""By Hellen Keller"". The playfulness quickly turns serious when the plane goes down and only three are left in a most dire situation.Floating on lifeboats, surrounded by sharks with no food and one injured man is no picnic. The character of Mac (Wittrock) is so negative from the very beginning and I noted that I did agree with him but you have to be practical and try as hard as you can to at least stay positive while trying your best to find a way out. I might feel differently about that if I were in such a situation, to be honest.At one point the men capture a seagull and try to eat it. The FIRST thing that went through my head was, YUCK! seagulls mostly eat garbage and waste so to eat one raw really wouldn't be my ideal solution for starvation.Louis Zamperini was an Olympic runner and even during his capture by the Japanese, he remained true to his roots but the conditions were not exactly conducive to his health nor perfect for his athleticism. Most of the time in captivity was a struggle between the Americans' patriotism and their survival instinct. Again, some of the things that happen to them during the time they were being held by the Japanese was hard to watch and definitely stirred feelings of anger.I don't want to give away too much of the story but I do want to encourage you to see ""Unbroken"" as well as the other Oscar nominated films, before the Oscars if you can. The movie industry has taken lots of criticism in the past few years but there are still high quality projects, involving truly talented and dedicated people that slip past us each year. I find the Oscars can lead us to these projects by following the nominees and paying attention to the films that generate the most buzz or controversy for being overlooked. Use the nominations to find films to watch but also pay attention to what is being said about those films that many feel deserved to be nominated and weren't. Go see as many as you can, good entertainment keeps us happy and gives us lots to talk about! by Teeco71",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The main characters are incredible; the others not as much. 10 stars!,"Because the story focuses on several main characters, and those characters are exceptional and tell this powerful true story in the most engrossing way possible, I give this film 10 stars. Admittedly, the home scenes (which start off the film) are slightly more bland and the characters are flatter but I think that make sense - they serve as a backdrop to Louie as an adult, as a runner, and into the military.The adult Louie is portrayed very well. The drama grips you - it made me cry at times, look away in horror, but mostly, this movie inspires me every day. It is a story of personal strength and a touch of faith, patriotism, family, friendship, and mostly, the triumph of the human spirit - not just as a cliché, but as an incredible reality.This movie can be frightening but if you've got someone to hold onto while you watch, it's worth every second. You won't forget it because it won't leave you. It is powerful, awe-inspiring, and empowering. There is dawn at the end of night, beauty in a black coal mine. Be moved.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It felt more like a documentary than a war drama.,"Such an incredible story that was interpreted to screen in such a mediocre way. The movie had what any movie should have to be great, but it turned out a little loose, some parts took too long than it needed and some other parts that went through unnoticed. Flashback/flash-forward sequences were awkward, acting wasn't on the level, directing wasn't as good as regular war movies but then again let's cut Angelina a break (it's her 1st big movie). All and all, I think this movie lack a definition, as it didn't define itself, it's neither a motivational ""all-in"" type of war movies nor a ""deep thoughts/let's think about life"" type of war drama.. It just failed to hit some nerves. Still it's a fairly good movie, it could've been a little shorter than 137 minutes though.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Loved it,"Unbroken, the harrowing tale of resilience and survival, secures a heartfelt 7/10 in my cinematic journal-a nod to its powerful storytelling and the compelling performance of Jack O'Connell as Louis Zamperini. The film's strength lies in its unwavering portrayal of human endurance, weaving a narrative tapestry that transcends the brutality of war and captivity. While the editing occasionally feels slightly prolonged, it allows for a deep immersion into Zamperini's journey of suffering and triumph. The musical score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, sways between haunting and uplifting melodies, enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. Cinematography captures the vastness of the Pacific and the claustrophobia of the prison camps with a visual poignancy. Unbroken, with its unyielding spirit and indomitable message of hope, stands tall as a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable adversity.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fail,"The movie failed to inspire, motivate, or even entertain. Movie goers should get refunds for hoopla that ended in snoring. Wish them good luck on breaking even to make this waste of time. Jolie wont see funding for another movie after this one, thank goodness. The mediocre writing, that includes work of the Coens and the screenwriter of Gladiator, William Nicholson, repeats this trite line, ""If you can take it, you can make it."" Also this line, ""One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" doesn't sound right, whereas in the book, it does: ""A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain."" The villain, called Bird, should be a ruthless torturer with emotional issues tied to his lack of promotion and homosexual longings. However Jolie has chosen an androgynous Japanese rock star, Takamasa Ishihara, who doesn't click as mean or psychotic, just barking torture orders to fill his time with an occasionally enigmatic sentence or two to entice us into thinking we havedepth. Like the film, Bird promises much but delivers too little.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

If you can't stand the violence...,"There's a lot of complaints about the torture and gore and overall horrible treatment of the main character. But, how can you be disgusted with the film when the story is true?If you are going to give this movie a bad rating simply because Jolie (Director) wanted to make sure to emphasize what horrors Louis went through, you've got a bad case of apathy. And if we didn't see everything he went through, how are we to truly grasp what an amazing hero he was?How strong his spirit was?The whole point is to show as much real pain as possible so that we, the viewers, can have a true understanding and perspective of what Louis went through and the horrible atrocities of Japanese POW camps.People leaving bad reviews simply because it was ""too violent"" are the same kind of people who turn away from the homeless, turn off the news when footage of disasters happen and drive away when they see a bad car accident.They are the same exact people who want to deny or ignore what's really happening in the Middle East and Ukraine. Head-in-the-sand type people.It is part of our duty as human beings to have an understanding of other's pain. It is our moral obligation to not look away and instead face the truth of war, homelessness, pain, hunger, etc.You can't just get angry at a film because it spoke the truth...
because it forces you to see things as they really were.This was a remarkable film. Jolie could only fit so much of the book in two hours. I truly think she wanted to give society a deeper look into the true horrors of Japanese camps because not that many people know what really happened over there.WWII films are almost always based in Europe with very little credit ever given to WWII POW's in Japan.Jolie wanted to speak out for those soldiers and the violence comes with the truth, whether you like it or not.Beautiful heart-wrenching film and wonderful acting.

A Powerful True Story of Resilience and Survival in WWII,"It tells the true story of Olympian Louis Zamperini's harrowing experiences during WWII after a near-fatal plane crash. While the movie has some tried and true formulas, the direction, photography, and performances are all first-rate. However, the movie lacks some quality of surprise or depth to rise above ordinary narrative storytelling. The aerial sequences and reconstitution of the period are excellent, but the film is missing the spiritual and emotional side. Some may find the film lacking in emotional involvement, but it showcases the war in all its aspects without inflaming the audience.

"Fine Cinematography, big, and safe. Little else to recommend it","While this movie purported to tell the story of Mr. Zamperini, who doubtless was a Great American Hero, his character was left undeveloped in the movie. Sadly the only person we got to know in this movie was Wantabe, his nemesis.We identify with characters in movies who are described in detail as the plot progresses. Sadly we get to know Louie as a punching bag, not as a protagonist.Contrast this with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", another movie of 2014 that also was a film set during wartime. It would be hard for anyone to accuse that film of failing to develop its characters. It cost much less to make, but left much more of an impression. Also contrast this with ""The Book Thief"". That movie made me cry! Why didn't this one?Kudos to the Coen Brothers for attempting to save a drab script and helping the audience get through this movie.I am happy to see that hundreds if not thousands got extras work in this film.

Worth the Watch,"So I was sceptical within the first 30 minutes of watching the film, as it seemed like it was going to be another 'drag it out as long as possible' type. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out not to be that kind of movie at all!The first hour can be a bit 'slow' for most viewers, however, I believe this first hour sets the scene wonderfully for the 'main body' of the movie, the POW camp.
The camaraderie that is encapsulated in this film is done brilliantly! You get a real sense that these POW truly are on the same team and they're all fighting for their own survival, but as a group.
The way that the movie reached the ending could have done with a bit more explaining to it.I am by no means, an expert at writing reviews and nor will I ever be.

A Survival Story That Falls Short of Greatness,"The life of Louis Zamperini had all the ingredients for a great film. Before the war, he was an Olympic athlete with a promising future. Later, fate put him to the test during World War II, radically changing his life. Angelina Jolie brings his story to the big screen with meticulous direction and a traditional approach, though it doesn't always achieve the emotional depth it aims for.Technically, the film delivers. The cinematography is well-executed, the combat scenes are striking, and Alexandre Desplat's score fits perfectly. However, despite its impressive visuals, connecting with the protagonist isn't easy. Jack O'Connell does a solid job, but the script barely allows him to showcase any dimension beyond that of an unbreakable hero. Instead of a nuanced character, he comes across as an overly idealized figure.The film's most intense moments, such as surviving at sea or enduring captivity in a prisoner-of-war camp, successfully build tension and keep the audience engaged. Still, Unbroken seems more focused on glorifying Zamperini's resilience than on exploring his vulnerabilities. Everything feels meticulously designed to inspire, leaving little room to portray the raw humanity of his journey.In the end, Unbroken is an uplifting survival drama that works well enough but lacks something to make it truly unforgettable. It's the kind of film that captivates while you watch it but fades from memory over time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent rendering of one man's refusal to give up on life,"Unbroken is an excellent movie. Well made, moving and very realistic. I loved the mantra ""If you can take it - you can make it"" - and what this man goes through to survive the Pacific Theater during World War II - and to beat his main adversary, a cowardly Japanese prison camp official who does everything in his power to break him - is an inspiration. I highly recommend the film. Kudos to Angelina Jolie for a finely directed film. This quality of film is rare for Hollywood - as it's strength was based on characters and human qualities - not green screens and CGI. And one last thing - having flown planes before, the aerial scenes are great - very compelling, very realistic. Just see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Highly Competent Direction and Focus,"Realistic, and churned with the right mix of fear, desperation, spirit and light heartedness, 'Unbroken' is a thorough venture into survival against harrowing odds.Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson were competent choices whom bring a professional and dignified approach to their characters.Miyavi is menacing and slightly over the top, but the direction keeps him grounded and believable.What helps the film tremendously is the huge variation of sets and locations, all sumptuous yet dirty and unforgiving. However the pace can be too slow, and exposition often repeats itself.It must be said that it is rare to have female directors and it's a pleasure to have a film made to such a high standard by one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An amazing film!,An amazing film. Very emotional and intense. One of my favourites and well worth the watch. It's beautifully shot and has an brilliant cast.

Astonishing true story told in enjoyable fashion,"'Unbroken' is a great film, helped immensely by the fact it's based on an almost-unbelievable true story. Laura Hillenbrand's novel was one of the best I've read in the last three years and while the movie isn't quite as great (they never are!), the story of Louis Zamperini (O'Connell)'s extremely eventful life from 1936-1945 truly needs to be seen to be believed. Quick synopsis: he learns to run, goes to the Olympics, joins the U.S. Air Force during WWII, is shot down, stranded at sea (for seven weeks!), eventually captured by the Japanese and spends over two years in a POW camp. Sounds impossible, but what's more astonishing is that he then went on to live for another 70 years!Jolie's directing debut is solid, with some nice transitions from the current to his past and the narrative moving along at a good pace for the first 90min. my one issue with the film is that the final 45min or so drag a little, as although there's plenty going on during his time in the POW camps (i.e. mostly inhumane torture), the film seems to lose a bit of it's spark. Brisbane/Moreton Bay does a good job of standing in for the South Pacific too!This is not so much a film about war, as about survival, courage and hope. There's so many times when he could have just given in and let all the terrible things happening to him defeat him, but he doesn't. It's truly amazing to know it actually happened! The ending is handled well and the actors - particularly Ishihara as the psychopathic 'Bird' - are solid.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Moment of Pain is Worth a Lifetime of Glory,"Unbroken was one of the most anticipated films of 2014, not only because it's the first major film directed by Angelina Jolie, but that it's one of the most incredible true stories of triumph survival. I think if I would have seen this film in theaters when it came out and was surrounded with the buzz, I may not have liked it as much as I did. In fact, I think one of the reasons I thought Unbroken was a solid film was because my expectations were significantly lowered after everyone said it wasn't as good as everyone thought. I still don't think it turned out to be as good as everyone thought it would be around this time last year, but it still can be enjoyed.It tells the story of Louie Zamperini, a former Olympian who is stranded at sea for nearly 50 days, before being captured by the Japanese. The story is absolutely incredible. These are the types of stories that should be legends. Humans aren't supposed to go through this much pain and come out on the other side, but somehow and someway, some people do. Zamperini, who only just passed this past year, has inspired so many people with his will and determination to make it to the finish line (no pun intended). The film honors that, and just about every other extraordinary thing he did during his life. But I think the problem was just the organization of the presentation of those events was the issue in the film. I was enamored with the opening shots of the aircraft and the battle. But then the film immediately calms down and flashes to his childhood. I really liked those scenes, but I don't know that the placement of them in between intense battle scenes and the ensuing crash was the best idea. It slowed the pace down unnecessarily. With that said, the rest of the film doesn't do that and has a consistent pacing from then on out so that was nice to see.The several (and I mean several) defining moments that Zamperini has throughout the film were cool and shot very well by the legend cinematographer Roger Deakins, but they didn't hit as much as I would have wanted them to. When I think of survival movies, or just movies with unbelievable stories I always think of their defining moments and memorable shots from the film. Braveheart, Gladiator, and Gravity all have those iconic moments, and I just didn't feel that from Unbroken. It's not always a necessity, but the trailers made it seem like their would be. It's a beautiful film with a terrific story that surrounds it, but the execution could have been better. With that said, Jack O'Connell gives a wonderful performance as the lead and is surrounded by a surprisingly gifted cast. There isn't a lot of well known talent, but Gleeson, Hedlund, Courtney, and Ishihara give the film credibility that I thought it would have been lacking. The film is also complimented with a magnetic score by the brilliant Alexandre Desplat who chooses only the right moments to make the music noticeable, and it's really effective.Zamperini's time in the concentration camp is defined by his relationship with 'The Bird' played by Ishihara, and I really liked that dynamic. I'm not sure how much the film followed the actual events and book, but there's something that happened with that dynamic that felt rushed and too forced. It was something that I didn't think needed to happen, even if it was straight out of the book. So I really enjoyed Unbroken. It has some flaws in screenplay and direction but I don't think the fault lies anywhere in particular, it just wasn't as good as everyone had hoped.+Magnetic score+O'Connell+Incredible story+Cinematography-Pacing issues towards the beginning-Big moments didn't really hit7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not so broken,"The movie Unbroken is about a young man, Louis Zamperni (Jack O'Connell) who starts out as an Olympic athlete turned soldier. This is about his struggle through pain and suffering, through years of torture and living in fear. Director Angelina Jolie takes charge in the making of this fascinating true story. The actors portrayed their given characters very well. Jack O'Connell portrayed his character in a very believable way. As well as Jack O'Connell playing his character well, Japanese actor and singer Miyavi portrayed his character Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a Japanese war Army sergeant, very well. The story flowed in a pretty understandable way. The scenery-music fit in with the story very well. It was played when appropriate. The music helped in telling the story by certain songs were placed at the perfect times and it all flowed nice and smooth. The music added to the mood by using dramatic music when appropriate. As well as the music fitting in, the background scenery fit in as well. It really helped make the story look more realistic. The costumes and hairstyles also helped in making the story believable. I think that this was a great film seeing as I am a WWII buff. I love everything about WWII. At times though, the story seemed very not believable, but most of the time it all flowed nicely. I feel this film was the right length, maybe even a few more minutes could have been added on. I would recommend this movie to all adults and older children or anyone interested in WWII. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a solid 4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A well made film, with some broken parts in it","If I Can Take It, I Can Make It. True words of wisdom right they.Unbroken is a true story about a Olympian and war hero Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini played by (Jack O'Connell) who, along with two other crewmen, survived in a raft for 47 days after a near-fatal plane crash in WWII-only to be caught by the Japanese Navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp.Unbroken is directed by the Oscar wining actress Angelina Jolie, and this isn't the first she directed a film, yeah she directed one Documentary I think and she also did a film called ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"", and what I heard these two films she did (Even the Documentary) was slammed and hated by everyone. I haven't really seen those two films (And I never will) but now she directs Unbroken and I can safely say that this movie was... okay. Not amazing. Not bad, just a simple okay. I know it's not very inspiring words ""it's Okay"", but I being really honest here. If you ask me in person what I thought of this movie, I will say ""It's okay"".The Good: 2014 was the year for amazing cinematography and this movie has some gorgeous Cinematography. It's the same guy who did the Cinematography for Skyfall and this guy knows he to make my eyes melt every time I watch a film and his doing the Cinematography. There was many times where I said to myself ""How the hell did there get that shot"", I know they used CG for some parts but for the parts that they didn't was CG was truly Oscar worthy Cinematography.Jack O'Connell is a true rising star so far in his career. In this movie he deliverers a fantastic and heart hitting performance and I like the fact that he showed all the pain, sadness and tiredness in his eyes in this movie, that made me feel sorry for this guy. Jack O'Connell played Louis Zamperinin so terrifically well that I wonder what else he's doing next after this because I what to see this guy in other films.Now let's talk about Angelina Jolie taking the directors chair. I know for a fact that Jolie had full respect for Louis. I sawed it photos and interviews, how she looked up to this man has her inspiration, and she directed this movie pretty good if I must say. She didn't directed this movie in a way that it feels to much like a Hollywood cash grab, no I can look at this movie and call it a war film and that's that. Unbroken to me might be a step up from Jolie directing career. I would love to see more from her directing skills and I bet she got a lot of hate and that must be really hard for her, but Louis Zamperinin once said ""Never give up. No matter what"".Now for the problems: Louis Zamperinin is a inspiring person who has been through hell most of his life and the fact that this guy kept going is truly remarkable, but in this movie he was just came off as a tough son of a b*tch and not really inspiring in a way that Louis was. The Prison camp in this movie wasn't really all that effective at all. Japanese prison in real life back then was a lot brutal and effectively shocking, but in this it wasn't and it would be more powerful if Louis stood out from the rest and became a leader to those jailed soldiers.Overall Unbroken may have a lot of problems with it's pasting and slow scenes, but the movie has good directing, terrific performance from Jack O'Connell and beautifully Cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic War Movie,"I'm not sure how this movie doesn't have higher ratings than 7.2 stars out of 10. This was honestly one of the best movies I've watched in quite some time.I love how the movie starts off when Lou was a child as it showed his life from the start, displaying that he had his troubles as a juvenile. It then goes to show his success as a runner as he was an official Olympic athlete that represented his country. Then comes the war...The movie done an excellent job at shooting a lot of the film at sea where Lou and the other two men are trapped. It shows their struggle for survival as they have basically no food as they lay in the life boat. I like how it wasn't just a quick scene as it really focused on the struggles that Lou and the other guys went through while at sea for forty-something days.This movie was really in-depth from start to finish. I felt like it covered everything. Along with that, the acting was spectacular and you could feel the emotion the movie displayed. This one will definitely go down as my new favourite war movie up to date. If you're interested in war movies you definitely need to give this a watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Being Something Through Competition and Survival,"3 January 2015. There is likely a balance to be struck between reality of a relatively famous person's life and the dramatization of it onto the big screen. Assuredly there might be even more amazing life stories out there and there might be even more captivating ways to selectively develop movie appeal. Yet as a director and executive producer, Angelina Jolie, has produced a film that appears to encompass a balance between real and interest in this movie. The audience is introduced to brief scenes of a young boy who doesn't believe in himself as an Italian in America outcast, to a big brother prodded athletic competitor, to a fearsome World War II experience over the skies of Japan, to lost at sea, and then prisoner of war.This movie fuses a sports and war theme into a biographical display of endurance and survival. Unbroken brings the intensity of competition as displayed by Francis Osmet's 1913 U.S. Golf Open in The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005), the physical and mental torture of Michael Caine in the espionage classic and BAFTA Best Film The Ipcress Files (1965), the struggle of survival of The Life of Pi (2012), Mel Gibson's Golden Globe Best Foreign Picture nominee Apocalypto (2006) or Steven Spielberg's Best Oscar picture Schindler's List (1993). The difficulty faced by Jolie was sustaining the momentum and power of the movie with the different pacing elements without an action-thriller-adventure theme. Instead Jolie faced the difficulty of a biographical sports, sustained survival theme like that faced by Tom Hanks' Golden Globe winner in Cast Away (2000). With what Jolie faced, Unbroken appears almost unscathed in its ability to bring forth this true life, heroic story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great story but execution is flawed,The story of Louis Zamperini is incredible and deserving of a heavyweight spectacle. Somehow this movie just doesn't live up to it. I enjoyed some of it and it was entirely watchable. Louis's life is inspirational. I felt like a lot of the important development parts in the movie were rushed. It was very formulaic throughout and really lacked creativity in certain areas of the story. Jack O'Connell was good and is a good actor but there was a distinct lack of development with any of the other characters and no real chemistry. What we have here is a great true story. All the pieces have been put together that should make it a heavyweight movie. But something just doesn't fit. It's missing that skillful and creative direction which makes a memorable movie. For me this is a one time watch only.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Life of Pi but Vietnam War,Unbroken is a very unique story about the Vietnam War. The Vietnam war was something that I have never had much interest in and it was something that I had always overlooked. But Unbroken is a story I would have probably not have pictured to take place during the Vietnam War. The acting from Jack O'Connel who played Louis Zamparini heavily impacted the quality of the movie. Without the emotion that he brought to the film it definitely wouldn't have been the same if it were someone else starring in the movie. I think for this to be a wart movie it was really well done and interesting. Knowing that Angelina Jolie was the director really shocked me. I didn't know how talented she was as a director and for her to do a movie like this truly shows her versatility as someone in show business.

"One third raft, two thirds POW, three thirds waste of time","It is a shame that the exceptional story of Louis Zamperini ended up on screen as such a mediocre film. The plot is roughly divided in two parts: the film starts during WWII, when Louis is a bombardier based in the Pacific. A few flashbacks show Louis as a difficult child, who started training as a runner to keep out of trouble and ended up competing at the Berlin Olympic games.Within some minutes from the beginning, Louis plane crashes and one third of the movie is spent with him and surviving crew members adrift in the ocean for 47 days. Watching young people die of starvation is not particularly amusing. However, it can be assumed that this part drags on for what seems an eternity to give an idea of how those 47 days felt.The remaining two thirds of the movie are about Louis being fished out by the Japanese and spending the rest of the war as POW, being constantly abused by Watanabe, the sadistic camp's commander. This part seems to drag on even longer and it is developed without any subtlety. Scene after scene Louis is beaten up by Watanabe but manages to retain some dignity. Unfortunately, witnessing the horrific conditions of POW is even less fun than castaways dying of starvation and the whole movie feels like an overlong torture, despite the final five minutes left for the - sort of - upbeat ending",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

The endurance and resistance of one man,"Unbroken, based off the book of the same name, tells the incredible true life story of Louie Zamperini, a man whose determination and strong fiber helped cement him among historic Americans. In only her second directorial effort, Angelina Jolie presents us with her vision of this man's struggle, as the movie will mainly focus on his time during the war, with some initial flashbacks showcasing his trajectory to the Olympics (another important aspect of his life). Overall I felt the dramatic effect of the movie delivered. Jolie's direction highlights feats of inner strenght and resistance as Louis takes everything that is thrown at him. Whilst familiar, the script does adapt well to this individual and personal journey. It features some of the clichés used in this type of film, yet with some solid acting, it just about pulls it off. I guess I would say that this movie was acceptable in filmmaking terms. With nothing particularly innovative about it, Unbroken succeeds in connecting you with the protagonist, someone who you root for right from the very start, something that the lead actor has a hand in as well. I personally would have liked a more linear plot, but in the end it doesn't take anything away from the movie. It's quite clear that the film's most redeemable quality is its incredible accessible character and if you wanna find out how he survived the ordeal, then I believe you'll enjoy this movie.Rating: 7,5-8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
St. Louis,"This film is recommended. (Rating: ☆☆☆)In this year of biographies, Unbroken breaks no new ground. It's a familiar tale of an American hero battling inhumane obstacles that would kill the normal man. In this case, it is the true life story of Louis Zamperini and his horrific days as a prisoner-of-war.The film follows the winning formula of most biopics beginning with a troublesome adolescence, traumatic circumstances that lead to international glory, and an inspirational upbeat ending complete with actual photographs of the real person in the end credits. However, the story being told, with a screenplay contributed to four major talents (the Coen brothers, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson), is riveting drama and presented with much style and restraint.Solidly at the helm is Angelina Jolie, making an impressive directing debut. The film is a huge undertaking and the actress wisely surrounds herself with an A-team of artisans that deliver superb production values. The gifted Alexandre Desplat gives the film a haunting quality that never overpowers the story. Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography transports the film to a high level of artistry with his stunning use of stark shadows and silhouettes. Unbroken may be convention storytelling, but it is a beautifully crafted filmgoing experience.Most of the time, Jolie tends to play it safe, never straying out of the box. She keeps to the true-and-true formula similar to most WII tales: show the heroism and suffering but stress the inner strength, grit, and that all-inclusive American spirit. She lets her admiration of the man cloud her judgment, showing more saint than needed. This skews the film's emotion balance of the story and makes it seem forced and manipulative.Jolie sets up the story into three distinct sections (using direct links of some classic films serving as her inspiration): the early years leading to Olympic fame (with a Chariots of Fire vibe, slow-motion intact) and the standard war saga, complete with sea survival tale(ala Jaws), and a prisoner-of-war epic story (saluting The Bridge of the River Kwai).Jack O'Connell is very good as Mr Zamperini. He gives a heartfelt performance that spans nearly 20 years. Most of the other roles, except for Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Wittrock, are incidental and walking stereotypes. Especially so, is Takamasa Ishihara as the sadistic prison captain, Watanabe. As written, the role seems far too evil and one-note (although the actual war criminal was even more brutal than depicted here). The actor tries to overcome the cliché with varying success.Unbroken is a solid war film that celebrates one man's remarkable life while elevating him to sainthood. It carries gung-ho patriotism under its sleeve and undercuts reality along the way, making the man into a myth and the film into a grand testament of courage and valor. GRADE: B",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing to rave about.,"There is nothing original about this movie. It merely takes scenes from other movies to extremes. I saw bits and pieces of Bridge Over the River Kwai, Cast Away and of course American Graffiti -- the standard way to end a so-so movie in Hollywood is to have a 1 minute summary of their characters lives. It might have been unique and satisfying at one time -- but it's not in this case.Standing on its own as a movie - apart from the book -- it is an OK movie but nothing great. But if you compare the movie with the book, it sadly missed the mark. The book is inspirational -- and the most fascinating part of the book was the post-war years. Instead, the movies focuses (perhaps over-focuses) on the WW II aspects of the book. Perhaps Ms. Jolie-Pitt will decide to make a sequel that really gets to the meat of the story.In the meantime -- save your money -- this is truly a rental.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strong story. Solid war movie.,"I'm a bit late for the ""debate"" of Jolie becoming a director, I know. This movie is after all 6 years old by now. But, I don't understand why Jolie got so much hate for trying to direct. I asume it has to be about ""know your place"" kind of thing.No, this is not a masterpiece of a movie and the best movie ever made. And Jolie doesn't deserve to be praised to the heavens, win an Oscar and later perhaps become the first female president of the USA, I mean, who knows, might happen. Perhaps starting a whole new age with a nation of female superpower. Where the feminine is ruling over the masculine. Up is down, black is white. And males are slaves to the females, cheap workforce and nothing else, building the women's world and empire, for them. And the males with best genes, are kept in stock, in certain constructed confined settlements just made for them, to be taken out and used only as sex slaves and their ""special juice"" for reproduction, when needed. The new world order. Where females rules as a superior class and males are just to be used for their bodies. I don't think we actually have to really fear this happening. Even though how likely it might sound.Yes, Jolie is a women. Yes, she's a famous, successful, rich, actress. And all of a sudden she wants to direct. Who does she think she is? For starters, does she not know how privledge she already is? She should just be happy and contempt with her successful acting career. Not wanting to direct. Why should we, the viewers, be forced to watch her attempt to be a creator of the vision for an whole movie?Well, while valid points. I have to review this movie for what it is in its final form, besides all that other stuff. And... it's actually pretty good. Strong story, very much worth telling, since it's based on reality. I'm glad someone made a movie about it. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Is it the best war movie ever made? No. But, I have to say, that personally, it really moved me. And it was well shot and well acted. It's a solid 7 for me. A movie that is good to watch when you need some inspiration going trough hard times perhaps. Which is not a bad thing at all. I can't actually see anything horrible wrong with it. The scope of the movie is actually pretty big and executed very well. People involved, that Jolie brought together, knew what they were doing and manged to do something (while not the greatest piece of cinema ever made) something worth seeing, to the least. So, why should Jolie not direct? I really don't get it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Book is so much better,"I encourage everyone to read the book. It is well written, and provides all the heart and soul of Louie Zamparini. The movie only captures that essence at the end when actual footage of Louie is shown as he carries the Olympic torch in Japan. The cinematography is beautiful, yet too many scenes spend an exaggerated amount of time on anguished faces, and gross out scenes. Those scenes could have been just as well alluded to, and the movie would have been better. Likewise with the torture scenes, how long are you able to endure watching a man get beaten?

the great unbroken,"Catchy title: the great unbroken Synopsis: the film was about a war veteran who was beaten to death at this Japanese camp and he does work for them and he stays at that camp when the war ends they are free and gets to go back home. Director: Angelina Jolie The actors were chosen very well. Jack O'Connell was Louie zaperhini, takamasa ishihara was the Japanese soldier The story of unbroken was understandable during the whole movie. The flash back scenes was good and made since and followed along with the movie. Scenery-music: yes the background seem realistic but the sharks didn't really look real. The costumes and everything else like hairstyles could be shorter but the cars and houses and stuff were the time and place. When it was war it was like loud bangs and when they were getting abused and it was like sad music or whatever. The music helped when something was going to be bad or other things. My review: the movie was a great movie and the scenes were awesome and I love watching war movies and other things but there isn't really and negatives about the movie except and kind of have more action in it. It was the right of amount of time with the right amount of time for the movie. My recommendation: I would recommend my parents or older teenagers to watch it because it's a great movie and that if they like war movies it be perfect for them. Rating: my rating is 5 because it a great war movie I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Certainly not a great film.,"'UNBROKEN': Four Stars (Out of Five)World War II flick directed by Angelina Jolie and co-written by the Coen brothers. It's based on the book 'Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption', by Laura Hillenbrand, and tells the story of USA Olympian Louis Zamperini. The film details how he survived 47 days on a raft, after his bomber crashed in the ocean, and many more days of torture and harassment at multiple POW camps, during the war. It stars Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson, Miyavi, Garrett Hedlund, Finn Wittrock and Jai Courtney. It was adapted for the screen by Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and it's Jolie's third directorial effort (to date). The film has done well at the Box Office (thus far) but it's also gotten mostly negative reviews from critics. So it's possible upcoming award recognition has become uncertain. I enjoyed the movie but it's certainly not a great film and it's definitely not one of the best of the year, either.O'Connell stars as Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete who also served as a bomber pilot during World War II. His plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean, where he (and two other crew members) lived on a raft for 47 days. Zamperini was then caught by the Japanese navy and sent to multiple prisoner-of-war camps. He went on to survive years of grueling physical, and mental, torture while being abused by a sadistic Japanese corporal (Miyavi), who was jealous of his athletic accomplishments. The film shows how Zamperini used his athletic abilities, and Olympic training, to push on and survive.The film is well made, from a technical standpoint, and Jolie definitely shows some skill, and talent, as a director. The acting is all decent enough and the story is interesting and somewhat inspiring. It just seems like it should have been more involving (and moving). I definitely never felt that emotionally interested, in anything going on in the movie. While it is entertaining, it also doesn't leave the viewer with much to think about (or even look back on and admire) after it's over. It's a good war film, especially for those who love the genre, but it's certainly not a great one; or an Oscar worthy film by any means.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/XBTsoCDCJpU",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Louie is a very hard working guy that will never give up because ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"".

The new worst movie on my list :),"This is a completely pointless, sadistic and uninspiring movie. It is nothing close to the uplifting celebration of the human spirit, strength and persistence that the trailer promises. I have never written a review before but I just felt the need to share my awful experience. The story could have been told in much better and more inspiring way, bringing the emotional depth of the experiences, as oppose to portraying solely perpetual torture and suffering of the main character. I have seen more than 20 movies with ""lost at sea"" scenes, but this one had by far the worse. The highlight of the ridiculousness was when the people who were holding barely to life, caught a 200lbs shark with bare hands from their infallible raft. I also don't understand the need of the director to show one full hour of torture of the main character, without giving it any perspective build through dialogue or maybe self-refection. This movie replaces ""Thinner"" (1996) as the worst movie I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

We know that the Coen brothers help to make this craft and I think the Coen brothers are not the right people to do this stuff we know that the Coen's are really at good making dark comedy, crime thriller stuffs.But all in all I am no critic to say that this movie is a disappointment but I am only saying that this film could have been a great film",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Amazing Story,"This film is based on the true story of Olympian Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, who survived in a raft for 47 days after his bomber was downed in WWII, and he was sent to a series of prisoner of war camps. The story itself is amazing, and it really makes you wonder if you would have it in you to be as strong as the characters were in this movie or just pray for death instead.However, the script for Unbroken was very weak, especially if you read the book beforehand. None of the characters grew, transformed, changed or learned anything by the end. Everything was so matter-of-fact. Lots of room for intense dramatic moments, character climaxes and transformations that were left on the editing room floor. A dramatic moment would start to happen, but then it would smash-cut to the next scene or day. Hmmm....Still, a good effort by director Angelina Jolie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angelina Jolie Has Created A Masterful Film,"This was a hard movie for me to watch as I'm not comfortable with cruelty either in person or in a picture. And this film was all about the harshness, the brutality, the enormous cruelty of the Japanese toward the American prisoners of war. It was also a movie about triumph – and not triumph of any one side in a war because I don't think there ever is a triumphant side, only destroyed and dead people left behind an outdated, barbaric way to solve issues – but about personal strength and triumph in the face enormous adversity, of beyond believe pain and misery, and the ability to go above and beyond all of it. Jolie pulled no punches in showing it all. The casting was spot on, the dialog was believable, the pace of the movie was right...in essence, there was nothing about this movie that wasn't exactly right. If there is any fairness in the world, this film and the people involved in it, both in front of and behind the camera, should be in for a whole lot of awards. Bottom line, if you're looking for a good movie, one you won't soon forget – especially in the knowledge that this is a true story – here is your opportunity.

The rescue from the raft skipped entirely and was tantamount to explaining their survival. 
This movie left me feeling empty, wondering if anyone involved actually read the lifechanging book from whence it was born. 
Characters you should hate and have nightmares about, left you feeling nothing. These were REAL MEN. HEROES. The team that did band of brothers could have made this into something that changed history of cinema, instead we got a hollow outline, that left me tired and a little bored. What a waste.

"Hold on to your seats folks, this is a good one.","This film tells the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete who served in the American Air Force during the second World War. After a malfunction with their plane, causing them to crash in the middle of the ocean, Louis and his crewmates are stranded on an emergency raft for 47 days before being captured by the Japanese and sent to a work-camp meant for war prisoners.I have always been fascinated by this war. The endless heroic stories are truly inspiring. Some stories are filled with heroic sacrifices and acts of courage, others are just due to bad luck. This story is filled with unfortunate events, and the triumph of Louis overcoming them, thus leading to the title ''Unbroken''.The performances in this film are outstanding. Jack O'Connell plays Louis Zamperini with such delicacy and complexity, giving us a raw and emotional ride. That's another thing I loved about this film, all of the intense moments are subtle and realistic. Every punch feels real, and every excruciating torture is painful to watch, both physical and mental.The film is visually beautiful, having the stunning Japanese scenery mixed with the rubble of the war. Every piece of scenery adds another color to this film that by the end of it, it's almost as if a puzzle has been connected to create us the full picture that is Louis's story.Pacing in this film was a bit of an issue for me, with the beginning dragging out for a good while versus the rest of the film having a much faster turn of events. At first it threw me off, but the later acts of the film made the viewing worth it. It runs at under two and a half hours and to me it could've been shorter and still hit the mark.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie succeeds in showing us what Mr. Zamperini went through. No exaggerations, no gratuitous action scenes, no unnecessary side plots. Ms. Jolie knows how to best present human emotions, her actors do not waste time with melodramatic antics. I found myself drawn into the unfolding of a story of suffering and endurance, a story written by real life. Some deplore the fact that the cast was ""too pretty"" and the colours ""too drab"".

Well Crafted Storytelling of A True Hero,"Unbroken perfectly portrays how powerful the will to survive is. Louis Zamperini's resilience marks his story as one of true courage. I for one, am deeply moved and inspired by Angelina Jolie's picture as it successfully tells the amazing feats of this true hero. Yes there are areas for improvement like the script and score however, the way the story is presented, more than makes up for it. Once again, Jack O Connell delivers an exemplary performance and is further complemented by the chilling and straight up evil character of ""The Bird"" Watanabe played by Miyavi. As a fan of WW2 films, I highly recommend Unbroken as a film to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointing a wasted story,Jack o Connell is the one shining light from what is otherwise a very disappointing film.

Makes Bridge Over the River Kwai Look Like a Trip to Disneyland - Unbroken,"I have seen virtually every WW2 film associated with Allied POWs under the Japanese, including the vaunted ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"", which was outstanding. Also ""Empire of the Sun"" was another gut-wrenching film about a Japanese prisoner of war camp. This film blows both of those away.Angelina Jolie shows as much talent behind the camera as she did in front of it. Her direction is impeccable. I look forward to several other successes in that area.Jack O'Connell gives the performance of a lifetime as Louis Zamperini, a man who by all rights, should have been dead half a dozen different times in the film. His crash, his 45 day ordeal in the sea (I loved the shark scenes), his internment in an island prison camp of horrors, his transfer to another prison camp worse than the first one, and I will not go on to spoil the rest of the film.Suffice it to say that ""The Bird"" got away with war crimes, and Louis was a better man.

It was brutal being a POW under the Japanese.,"The story is about two men: an American prisoner of war, Louis Zamperini, and a Japanese prison guard, Mutihiro Watanabe, who torments him. The movie devotes a lot of time telling the audience about Zamperini but provides almost nothing about Watanabe, thus transforming the latter into a stereotype. Watanabe's violence comes off as gratuitous; why he targets Zamperini in particular is never fully explained, and in order for the story to make sense, an explanation is required. Yet on one point the movie is utterly clear: the brutality of the Japanese in their treatment of the prisoners of war. The sheer mindlessness of the brutality is depicted with candor and frankness. There is no question that in this movie the Japanese are brutal as a matter of policy. It was brutality motivated by sheer hatred. Watanabe hates his prisoners; he hates Zamperini. His hatred is so intense that he cannot put it into words. He can only act on it. That any Americans at all survived incarceration under these circumstances is a miracle. True, Japan and the United States were engaged in a vicious war but still, there was no valid excuse to them to forgo even the pretensions of legality in the treatment of the prisoners. For the Japanese, the prisoners were not only the enemy but were still combatants who just happned to be prisoners. The movie is crammed with violence; everything in this story is violent. Watanabe vents his rage on Zamperini. After he is ""rescued"" by the Japanese, Zamperini becomes a punching bag for the disgruntled Watanabe. What is disturbing is that such scenes are not merely gratuitous depictions of violence meant to intensify the story but are based on historical incidents that actually occurred. Zamperini did not deserve to be mistreated. Why the Japanese chose to take the low road of brutality is never fully answered.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

He was to the point of giving up, but he never did. There were so many moments of near-hopelessness, but through luck and determination the guy makes it through!The movie seems tame, by comparison. A lot of the gruesome passages were not put in the movie. It also doesn't really captivate the emotional complexity one feels from the book.If there could've been some narration going over the movie, we could maybe gleam some insight into how the guy was feeling and what he was thinking.

It's so finely, touchingly played, you can see into the depths of their sufferance also through some other techniques ( lights, the silence that replaces all words, the great make-up, Louie's fainting when he meets his torturer again), the main character's evolution from an optimistic light-hearted young man to a wordless, lustreless shadow , a nearly walking-dead and, of course, the powerful, tearing scene ( nearly close to the Passion of the Christ) of the final confrontation between victim and torturer which stays not in the muscles and physical abilities as it may seem ( and usually is in all the villain- hero confrontations) but in the duel of their looks.

Good,"Unbroken is a movie directed by Angelina Jolie. It's based on the novel Unbroken, written by Laura Hillenbrand. This novel is about the trials, and adversity in the life of Louis Zamperini, a POW during World War II. The movie as well focuses on Louis Zamperini's journey, what he went through, and his story. The movie begins with Louis in a plane with a few other men. While in the plane there are periodic flashbacks giving the viewer insight into Louis life before the war. These scenes are helpful, giving the viewer a taste of the overall picture. However they can be quite confusing, switching back and forth from past to present. Once the plane has landed the movie goes onto explain Louis' childhood, his relationship with his family, and his childhood struggles. After learning about Louis life and family the movie goes into the overall story of his experience during World War II. As a whole, the movie reflected the book quite well. The characters and structure were pretty much identical. One of the differences between the two, is that the book begins with Louis' childhood and works its way up to the war, while the movie jumps between past and present, before getting into the larger part of the story. Another difference in the book is that when the story is coming to an end, there is much more talk of his family, and what happens in his life after the war. The movie did not cover this as well. The movie ends with a few pictures of Louis family and friends but nothing is really mentioned in detail about his life after the story. This movie is a very inspirational, true story of survival under the worst conditions imaginable. Louis' story really makes the viewers, and readers realize that life for us is not all that hard. This movie is very well executed and is very engaging to anyone who views it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic (true) story of survival and endurance,"Epic (true) story of survival and endurance.The true story of Louis Zamperini. A long-distance runner, he represented the US in the 1936 Olympics. In World War 2 he became a bombardier in a B-24 Liberator in the Pacific. One day, however, his plane is forced to crash land in the ocean and he and the pilot spend over 40 days adrift at sea before the Japanese capture them and send them to a Prisoner of War camp. The camp has a particularly sadistic commander and Zamperini comes in for some particularly vicious treatment, putting his perseverance and endurance to the ultimate test...Very engaging and compelling movie. Yes, it has been done before (in various forms) - Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, The Railway Man, Paradise Road, Bridge on the River Kwai - but this does not make this movie any less original or unpredictable. Despite its fairly long running time - over 2 1/4 hours - I was engrossed the entire time.Good special effects and solid direction from Angelina Jolie on her directorial debut.Good performance from Jack O'Connell in the lead role with solid support from Domnhall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Miyavi.Don't believe all the negative publicity (which seems mostly driven by sexism) - this movie is well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very disappointing,"I am truly sorry to have to say this but I have come to realize that this film has actually been treated very KINDLY by the critics... and NOT harshly as many fans (including myself had hoped). The film is very conventional and though that is not necessarily a bad thing, it should at least then follow the conventional rules; beginning, middle, end; tension, climax, resolution. Have an arc, which is a curved line and not a flat one... running from beginning to end which a film that just shows unrelenting episodes of misery, is. Now I understand what the critics were getting on about with Angie not talking or showing Louis' struggle with his inner demons and or how he dealt with them after the war. She did have that option. Lauren Hildebrand's book was very large and very comprehensive. In other words Angie had a wealth of material from which to make her choices from.. The choices she made here were unfortunate and call into question her artistic eye, as painful as that is for me to admit. She seems to be too much about the darkness to the point of being fetishistic about it. And now... I wished this film wasn't doing well. Now.... I wished this film had been shown in just a few theaters, failed and then silently faded from everyone's memory. Why? Because I fear its success (so far anyway) is going draw more and more focus and derision on both it and Angie, (she get's way too much of that already) and I can't say it won't be deserved. I could go on about other things but it would be just piling on. The ONLY positive thing I can say about this film and Angie is that she has essentially made Jack O'Connell into a star. I can only hope that since her next film is small and very different the experience will be a much happier one for me. But I will go into it with my guard up...",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unbroken Review,"Unbroken(2014) Starring: Jack O' Connel, Domhall Gleeson, Garrett Hudland, Miyavi, jai courtney, Finn Wittrock, Luke Treadaway, John Magaro, Alex Russell, Jordan Smith, Maddalena Ischiale, and Yutaka Izumihara Directed By: Angelina Jolie Review ""If I can take it I can Make it"" ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of happiness"" For someone who exudes such edgy unpredictability in front of the camera, Angelina Jolie is a bit square behind it. With Unbroken her second feature as a director(her first being In The Land of Blood and Honey)she turns the undeniable inspiring true story of Louie Zamperini into an old-fashioned survival drama. The story is based on a novel adapted by A-list writers(Richard LaGravenese, William Nicholson, and Joel and Ethan Coen), kicks off with a dazzling sense of immediacy. We're thrown into the belly of a bomber as Zamperni(Jack O'Connel) and his crew take fire from Japanese fighters. It's a hell of an opening sequence. It's gorgeously shot and beautifully acted, and it has it's moments of heartbreaking poignancy. I will admit I did cry during this picture on several occasions especially when Louie was in prison camp. He was punched by his inmates at least once. This is a special film that talks about spirit and forgiveness. Louie when he was young was the most hated in his town. But he became an inspiration to everyone in his hometown by the help of his brother. He believed that if his brother believed he could do it that he can take whatever life throws at him so he could make it. I've had a rough year I was lied to by a girl I desired, I met two girls fell in love with them but now they're gone and I'm going to an alternative school because I'm failing. However I still talk to both those girls and if they love and believe in me then I can take it and I will make it. I give Unbroken a five out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Affecting war drama in the tradition of great war dramas,"I just finished watching ""Unbroken"" on DVD, moved and shaken by the film, primarily due to the captivating performance of Miyavi who comes across as the epitome of evil. Miyavi's performance as ""The Bird"" is restrained but reeks of loathing due to jealousy and there is also the presence of fanatical nationalism contrasted with O'Connell's nationalism. Hey, they were both soldiers, right? Miyavi's ""The Bird"", however, takes it to a personal level and couples it with emotion.O'Connell is believable and, as he should be, one-sidedly heroic. Further, as is frequently the case with heroes and villains, the latter is the more interesting, complicated role. Maybe that's why actors like to play villains and not heroes! So, the latter just may be more challenging by that standard, but that's a whole other story. What I was amazed by was when I came to IMDb and saw the preponderance of negative reviews. I don't like to compare films to their sources. I try to view films independently as films, but I do make the comparisons when I know the source (which in this case I did not) and let it go at that. But what got me was how people reacted to the lack of character development, for example, in this movie. I immediately thought back to all of the WWII films I've seen out of Hollywood, and I think this one is *just like the rest*. Main characters are heroes, and villains are villains. We get very little character development in the WWII classics out of Hollywood that were made throughout the 40s and 50s. Perhaps the only exceptions to this rule, as I see it, are ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and *maybe* ""From Here to Eternity"". There are probably others, but these immediately come to mind. So, as far as ""Unbroken"" is concerned, I thought it was an interesting and entertaining film with a vivid performance by Miyavi and a presentable one by O'Connell.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Want Half My Money Back,"The only people who will like this movie are those who haven't read the book. Those who have read the book will leave the theatre wondering why the movie stopped when the war ended (although it was plenty long). Why didn't it follow Zamperini through his plunge into depression and alcoholism? But deep inside, the viewer will know why. Zamperini was saved from his post-war self destruction by turning to God to Whom he was reintroduced by none other than evangelist Billy Graham. The film makers must have thought that part of Zamperini's biography would be too cornball for movie goers so they told only the story of his physical survival and, sadly, not the many times more important story of the survival of his soul.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant Movie,"A brilliant movie by Angelina Jolie. Extremely well acting by Jack O'Connell. Really enjoyed this movie. i always like movies on true story and Unbroken has become one of the my favorite. I have seen Jack's few English movies but the way he acted in this American movie, you cant even imagine that he is an English actor. Dialogue delivery, Face expressions and most prominent physically change in the body as story moves along that this something you can only expect from a dedicated actor. i highly reckon this movie if you like movies on true story. i think its Angelina's first movie as a director but the way she presents the story i must say outclass.

Truly Made Me Feel,"I like how this was a war movie without being a ""war"" movie. It did not just show fighting and death, but the hope held by those affected, and the connections between human beings. The acting was pretty good but felt very stiff at times. The cinematography was beautiful with sunset motifs throughout. The fear and suspense was felt throughout the film, either through disturbing scenery or shocking dialogue, and that kept me immersed in the story and feelings that the characters were feeling. I wish they had shown more of the civilian Japanese to further encase the effect war has on everyone, and how no one truly wants for the pain and suffering caused by poverty, bombings, and gunfire.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Could have been much better! 5/10,"Review: Man, this film is long and it felt like it was never going to end. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is touching and it's amazing what these war veterans had to go through, but Angelina Jolie could have jazzed it up a little. A whole hour is spent with them at sea and then you've got another hour with them stuck in prison camps. I would have liked to have seen the aftermath of what the soldiers had to go through because it dragged after a while and I struggled to stay awake. The inspiring Olympic athlete, Louis, was played well by Jack O'Connell and some of the scenes were extremely emotional. The actions scenes at the beginning of the film, seemed quite real and the whole look and feel of the movie was great but I just couldn't take the length of the whole thing. The scenes when they were eating the fish on the dingy and when Louis was constantly getting picked on by the prison warden, we're touching and it's hard to believe that they ended up in such a predicament because the plane was faulty. Anyway, I personally was expecting a better film from Angelina Jolie who had a great concept to work with so it has to go down as a disappointment from me.Round-Up: Although I didn't real connect with this film, it made a healthy profit at the box office so there must have been people out there who enjoyed it. Jack O'Connell, who shot to fame after his great performance in Starred Up, really gave this movie his all with the different weight changes and the reactions to the impossible situations that he found himself in. The bravery that was shown when he turned down to read the message on the radio which made him return to the horrible prison camp, was amazing but the tempo of the film is quite slow. It is worth a watch, just to see what these soldiers had to endeavour and the scene at the end when the real Louis is running was great but for entertainment, it did let me down.Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $162millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their epic war movies about an inspiring Olympic athlete who goes to war and ends up stranded at sea for over a month and then he gets captured by the enemy. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A wonderful and memorable story with its implementations. Hooked right away.,"I didn't know anything about the movie when by chance I started watching it in the middle. Of course, it wasn't like a maximum of 15 minutes, basically immediately hooked.And then I finished looking at it quite impressed. The surprise was great when I realized Angelina Jolie was the director. Of the actors, only Jai Courtney knew in advance, but not necessarily well-known stars make the film good, here it was noticed.Great movie until the end and still remained in the thoughts afterwards. Nevertheless, only 8 stars when not 9 or 10 can be too hefty to give. Sure, I had to think about 8-9 for a while.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Slightly underrated,"Unbroken tells the story of the war in the Pacific from the eyes of an American PoW, who must endure the torture his Japanese captors and survive his ordeal. It's a truly remarkable story from start to finish, and it a true testament to the human spirit and the desire to survive.I thought the acting was great, particularly from O'Connell in the lead role. He gave a terrific physical performance, capturing the feeling of a man who was sometimes physically but never mentally broken. There were some solid supporting performances too across the whole cast.Jolie's direction was really nice. There were some great shots and a terrific feel to the whole film. I thought she found the balance between making this film brutal and violent enough to deliver its impact, but not enough to make it jarring and gratuitous. My only real criticism is with the structure. I don't mind non linear story at all but thought it could have been done better in this film. Saying this I don't think the structure impacted on the emotional journey of the film at all, and it was still a rewarding and engaging experience.Overall a very solid film. Its unlikely to blow you away in its technical aspects, but the story speaks for itself and is powerful and engaging from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Good Film,"As one reviewer put it, this is a ""safe"" version of the real story. A quality production by all standards and an enjoyable viewing experience, the film came up a little short on story and character development. We see a boy from a good and loving family...he has a drinking issue at a young age, but no explanation of the reason why or if he suffered any consequences for it.We see a lot of film time devoted to the 47-day ordeal on the life raft, but only get a glimpse of how they survived that long.In the Japanese prison camp we see them stealing rice in one brief scene, but are never shown their desperation for food.All in all an okay movie that took a complex story but never reached the intensity levels of the book. It needed a little more ""show"" and a little less ""tell"".",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Some films you can end up quite bored or looking at your watch half way through but no need for this oneNow it could be improved on little areas like the post war years, the ptsd, the Japanese commander not wanting to see him again, his forgiveness but apart from those aspects it's decent.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

From the beginning of plane crash to surviving in war camps is gods plan for him. Phil also played crucial, it would have been more good if they could have included what happens to phil after separation from Luis. They have missed this part to cover.

Absence of Danger with Angelina Jolie Cribbing Eastwood,"Kind of Fragmented Film about an American Survivor of a Japanese POW Camp that made it through Brutal Captivity but not before He was a High School Olympian in Hitler's Games.

Multiple Punches to the Face and a Caning Upside the Head are as Nasty as it gets.There are a couple of Inspired Scenes like Jack O'Connell Showing Up His Captor and Tormentor with a Display of UN-Brokenness, but Not Enough to make this Compelling Cinema. A lengthy Opening of Flashbacks try to Flesh Out the Man. Louis Zamperini, is a Rebellious Youth and a Bombardier, and these Scenes do Intrigue.But once the Crew is Lost at Sea Things Turn rather Mundane despite the occasional Jump Back to More Glorious Times.

A fitting tribute,"Unbroken is the story of Louis Zamperini an Olympian who spends a harrowing 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp.

Do not watch if you have read the book,"I know that it is hopeless to think that a movie can possibly live up to that of the original book, but come on Angelina? Really? This was a terrible terrible TERRIBLE adaptation of the story. There is absolutely no character development. You learn a total of two names the whole movie! I can't possibly imagine Zemperini himself would have given this ""movie"" more than 1 star. There is an obscene amount of development and crucial events left out of this film. All the heart and gut wrenching sections of the book are turned into a sloppy two second portrayal of entire chapters. I honestly think Angelina was sitting there thumbing through the book and thought ""oh, we better put this CRUCIAL event into the movie, um. Louie, go stand over there and look dazed, perfect, got it."" COME ON! It made me so sad to have read the book and then see this pathetic attempt to relay even a fraction of the story. SO SO SO SO much is left out. If I hadn't read the book I would have been completely lost. The Bird was a complete sociopath, absolute lunatic that I sincerely hope is somewhere very hot right now. This movie showed him as a disgruntled guard that was a little power hungry. COME ON, ANGELINA!!!!!!! At least try to put some depth to him. Did you even read the book?????? At the end of the movie I was so surprised that it was over. I thought this can't possibly be it. There is so much left out.

Good Character Development and Story!,"Unbroken (2014) is one of the best war movies I've watched so far this year. The story follows a soldier that was imprisoned after surviving a few weeks at sea. The plot of the movie was a really interesting one and the characters added to the charm. One of the things that stuck with me is the character development of Louie Zamperini, the main character who is portrayed by Jack O'Connell. He goes from a troubled teen to a team player in the military, where he's willing to get punched to save another prisoner of the camp from being beaten. Some of the scenes are beautifully shot which allow them to portray the exact feelings the characters are feeling in them.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
unbroken cant be broken,"The movie is about a guy named Louie. He is a running athlete. Louie is in the military. Louie fly's in an airplane with his friends/crew. He gets stranded in the ocean for a month and gets little food and water. Louie and his friend got captured by the JAPs. He gets tortured by the leader. They make him do their work, at the camps. Louie stays strong and never gave up no matter what happened.I think that the actors were chosen very well. Louie showed his feelings very well. The leader of japan showed discipline and order very well. All the characters in the movie were great actors they all played their parts great.The background seemed very realistic. The props were used appropriate, like when they used the sharks, the bullets and the explosions. When things got sad the played sad music and when something was going to happen they played suspenseful sounds/music.I would recommend this to young adults not children under the age 13 years old. There are some intense parts for children. Some kids would be afraid or can learn bad words and bad habits from this movie they could learn to abuse people.For me the movie was really good I liked a lot. It was very intense and exciting.

Engrossing and heart rendering story of triumph,"Unbroken is the incredible true story of Louis Zamperini, directed by Angelina Jolie, from the book by Laura Hillenbrand. If you ever think you are enduring something, watch this movie, and your troubles will feel lighter.Zamperini was an Italian immigrant who grew up in California. He was not a perfect kid - he stole things, didn't follow the rules. But he learned toughness. He learned he had a special skill - running. He used that to excel in life and build strength.The video box tells you the whole story. He goes to the Olympics. He goes to war. He goes to a prison camp in Japan. But this guy, he had an inner strength that few of us on the planet have. He was like a superman. My favorite takeaway from that kitche movie Alaska was 'never give up' and boy does that apply here.Zamperini was brutalized mentally and physically during his imprisonment. But he stood tall. But to be able to endure that on top of his war experience, it's just amazing. He's an amazing person.Jolie does a fine job of weaving the key plots without hitting you over the head too much. I'm most impressed that the movie was only 2 hrs 18 mins. when less talented directors would have surely made this 3 hrs. Not that there wasn't plenty to tell. But she skillfully used flashbacks at the right times, all woven into a beautiful piece of film work.I now want to read the book, which apparently details yet more suffering he endured. See Unbroken. It's a must-see film. enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A brutal watch,"'Unbroken' is a tough film to sit through. I've seen characters have a rough time in films before (Donnie Wahlberg's character in the 'Saw' series had an immensely tough time of things), but when you know the film is based on a true story, and if anything is telling the light version of what actually happened, it's pretty tough to think about. I wasn't sure what to expect from Angelina Jolie as an only second time director, but was pleased to find she did a fine job. It was an unexpectedly hard-hitting film for a female to have to direct. There are very few female characters in the story and those that there are get very little screen time. It's a man's film with a woman at the helm and the results are impressive.Joel and Ethan Coen wrote the screenplay and it shows. It's a very finely written film. The pacing is terrific (the 137 minutes fly by), the dialogue perfect and the tension in almost every scene captured perfectly. Add to that great acting performances by the entire cast and there really isn't a lot to criticise this film for. War films are never going to be to the liking of every viewer, but if you are planning to sit through one anytime soon 'Unbroken' would be fine choice.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I will probably be thinking about this movie and Louie and his story a lot now. I just can't believe how someone can treat a human being the way Watanabe treated Louie.

Wasted opportunity,"Knowing the story they had, the material they had at their disposal, this movie is a disappointment. The book is a punch in your face, powerful, visceral. The movie, on the other hand, is bland, is common place, it is cliché. And to see the main characters keeping their hair intact throughout the entire movie made me very upset. It is offensive to those that had to endure the real conditions of a Japanese prison. After reading the book one can't avoid the feeling of amazement. Even doubt. How can someone survive in situations like these? How can they endure out in the sea for so many days? The movie does not give you the same feelings, not as strong anyways.

"Powerful and Uplifting,","Unbroken is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. The films title sums up the movie perfectly, following the story of a real man, a hero, an inspiration, Louis Zamperini had been through a lot over his lifetime, but he never lost his spirit, his courage, his hopes, his aspirations and dreams, this is a very powerful drama that some people, like myself, may find shocking to believe that it is all a true story, it is beautifully directed by Angelina Jolie, and after watching this I'm up for any other films she plans on directing in the future. The only major problem I had with this movie is that it didn't have a lot to offer at an original standpoint, besides the beautiful cinematography and terrific performances, it isn't very unique as a war film, the story is straight forward and it dosen't have any scene that perfectly sums up the characters struggles, this is normally evident in most war films, I just felt like it was a bit too safe and formulaic and because of that I'm giving it an eight instead of the nine it easily could have received. The performances are outstanding and certainly the highlight of the movie, Jack O'Connell's performance is breathtaking, the studio was taking a huge risk with him in the lead role, but thankfully he did a terrific job and was able to hold the whole film on his own and clearly studied his role inside and out, and he is also joined by a terrific supporting cast, such as Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Miyavi, there isn't a single performance that isn't inspired and dedicated. It may be very formulaic, but Unbroken makes up for this with top class acting and a powerful true story, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or war film.An Olympic champion joins the army during Workd War II, only to spend 47 days in a raft and the rest of the war at a prisoner camp in Japan.Best Performance: Jack O'Connell Worst Performance: Jai Courtney",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I felt a range of emotion watching this film that I haven't felt in a long time. I was actually yelling at the screen at Takamasa Ishihara who plays Col. Watanabe, the antagonist of the film, because he felt genuinely evil. I wanted to reach through the screen and punch him in the face. This is such a powerful film, and it's a shame it wasn't nominated. I was so amazed at the hardships Louis had to endure, and genuinely felt for him. Everything about this film is amazing. The acting, the writing, even the score. There's something very unusual about this film that was a pleasant surprise to see. Religion is a key factor to the films plot, and it isn't mocked. That's something we need in more films. It's a shame that the real Louis Zamperini passed away before this film was released. I'm sure he'd be proud.

An Intriguing War Story with Some Great Performances,"Unbroken follows a young Olympic runner who signs up to fight in World War II and ends up spending much of it in one place, where he isn't fighting much.For starters, the story itself is pretty interesting. I don't want to spoil much, but the events of the war that are focused on are pretty interesting and more or less unique. By unique I mean that these weren't events or stories that have really been focused on in war movies, or at least I haven't seen many like this.The performances are all good, but two in particular stand out: Jack O'Connell and Miyavi. Miyavi in particular as a Japanese leader in a prisoner of war camp. He's evil, he's abusive, but he's human, and especially towards the end he brings just that to his character.Something that particularly stood out was the make-up and physical appearance of many of the characters. When the soldiers were starved, they looked starved, when they were injured, they looked injured. Every one of them looked the part all the time, and that was just another awesome visual aspect of the film.Overall Unbroken is a great movie. The story is interesting, the acting is great, and the make-up/circumstantial appearances of the characters is very authentic. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A war movie with a great message,Unbroken seen on Netflix tonight is a true story during the last Second World War. The main character was the Olympic athlete Louie Zenparini played by the British actor Jack O'Connell. Zemparini gave an example never to give up. Even under hard circumstances and tortures by the Japanese commander he didn't broke his hope. Angelina Jolie directed this movie emotionally and put depth in this prisoner camp on Japanese territory or when they tried to survive on the escape boat after the US bomber crashed on sea. There are other survival films for example Cast Away with Tom Hanks or All is Lost with Robert Redford. Another important one is Buried that I highly recommend to see.Superb cinematography picture and top job of main actor Jack O'Connell.8/10 includes one star for hope and that you must believe in yourself.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography

There I was sitting in the theater watching this guy go through absolute hell and I found that I didn't care that much (no disrespect to the real life guy). That, and the direction was lazy and just plain awful. The entire time I felt like Angelina Jolie had a checklist of things she needed to show and she was just checking them off as she went. It made the whole film feel very predictable and cliché. The ending was pretty bad too. No spoilers, but it just kind of stopped. All I thought of was Angelina Jolie checking off the last on her list and saying "" alright, that's everything, now how are we going to end this thing? Any ideas? No? Okay, lets just cut to the Americans winning and having a cliché tell the audience what happened to the real life characters after the events of the movie via pictures and text ending."" It isn't all terrible though. My biggest fear going into this was that it was going to be a one sided America is awesome movie. Thankfully it wasn't and I give them credit for that. Besides that, I can say it wasn't boring, but certainly not worth going to see in theaters.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
amazed,I'll start off by saying how much I hate war movies. I can't stand them. Jack O'Connell is my all time favorite actor so I thought of watching this movie but was still unsure. I didn't want to spend hours watching a war movie. We ended up watching the movie in my history class. I loved it. The acting was incredible (Which I knew would be) and the story was touching. I felt many emotions during this movie. I even watched it twice. Keep in mind that this is a true story when you watch it. People actually lived all of this. That's all that went through my mind the second time that I watched it. It made me see it a whole different way.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best man I have ever known,"Let me start by saying that Angelina Jolie is truly a genius! I can't imagine a female directing a heavy movie like Unbroken. it's mind-boggling! She actually manage to show all the important details of Louis's life in just 2 hours. For some film makers it's not enough. I salute you Angie!The film takes me back to the most tragic events in the history where a lot of people suffered and died. Louis Zamperini was one of them, BUT he survived. Being part of the war was already a painful experience, seeing people fought and died, suffered from agony, it will definitely traumatized a person. But that's only one of his deadly experience. He also stayed floating at the center of the pacific ocean for 47 days and then captured by the Japanese forces. He was punished almost everyday by Lucifer's assistant, Watanabe. I can't imagine a person survived such tragedies, but he is the only exception. He didn't loose HOPE. He didn't quit. There's no doubt that he is a FIGHTER. It brought me to tears when I saw him suffer. But still he stood up on his feet and carry the world with both of his tired hands. I wish I could've met him before he died. I want to hug him and thank him for being an inspiration and for being my HERO.I want to thank Angelina Jolie for bringing this movie to us. I didn't heard of the name Louis Zamperini before but thanks to her, now I know that there was once a man who survived the cruelty of the past and that this man never loose hope. He is the perfect definition of UNBROKEN.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest stories ruined by Hollywood,"Louis Zamperini is someone truly amazing. He was the gladiator of WW2. The life of Louis is a Hollywood story. Unfortunately Angelina Jolie destroy it. This should have been the next Forrest Gump or Saving Private Ryan, but instead it turn into a churned out war movie with no flow. I felt so rushed through the movie that I could even follow who anyone was. I read the book, so was very familiar with the men the surrounded Louis, but I couldn't even name most that were in the movie. There were points when I wasn't even sure who Louis Zamperini was in the movie. A story like this should have never been put into an amateur's hands to create. I won't even take my WW2 veteran grandfather to see it, because I don't want to see the disappointment on his face. You can't capture this man's life in a 2 hour movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Worst Movie since The Grinch,"This movie is about a guy who gets caught by Japanese during war. The story is boring, very bad developed, the script left a lot to imagination and does't make justice to the real story. If you are expecting a mind blowing movie or an inspirational one, this is not that kind of movie. It took me three days to finish it and at the end it did not pay at all. I just kept waiting for a finale or something that would never come. I think this was just a product of advertisement and definitely not worth of any price or a seven star rating, I am not sure that it is even worth the ticket price, I definitely can't understand people who gave this film more than 3 stars.

The last four or five movies I've seen on Netflix have been very thin gruel and this one doesn't thicken it up at all.The Terracotta Warriors could have done a better job than the entire cast, who admittedly have to handle a story that's been done a million times, 999,999 of which were better than this one.Jolie obviously doesn't have a clue when it comes to directing and this movie has all the hallmarks of the boss being surrounded by yes men who are scared to call out lousy work.OK , so the hero is an Olympian and knows how to suffer.. so do riders in the Tour-de- France, so did Arctic explorers (although they're volunteers)
His story is no different than all of the other POW's who had to endure those sadistic Japanese camps so why him?This stinks of somebody waking up in the morning and saying to themselves "" I want to make a movie.. doesn't matter what it's about, I just want to do it""There's absolutely no plot or message, so it wanders aimlessly to an ending that looks like a New Year's review on the TVI don't want to denigrate the terrible experiences that prisoners of the Japanese went through but this isn't the vehicle to show what incredible hardships these men suffered.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good idea, but cheap plastic screenplay","Despite of my deep respect to real heroues behind the real story, and good intentions of many involved, this movie is one of worst plastic, cheap screenplays ever. It is empty, lacks that bitter taste in your mouth, just before you squeze a tear, as this movie simply has no soul. Sorry.
Most of action scenes are polished, men have grease in their hair even after 45 days in small boat. Thir facial hair does not grow, their faces are fresh and shiny shaven every day, and after a month in a boat in the middle of the ocean their tan is lightly red, just as they were attending 8 hours shift on field, not a 30 days struggling battle for life.
Through all the film actors faces are unreal, plastic, they show no emotions, you simply do not simpathize with them, so you do not feel the pain, which was intent to be shown. Bad acting, not skilled actors.
I do not miss known actors here, but rather some involvment in the movie. I miss the crew convincing me they are really in life denger, or when flying that fortress, it looks more like a cheap video game than a real thing. I do not feel being with them there in the sky, becasue they did not create such feelings for me.

Uninspired,"Angelina Jolie aims to direct a prestige film with a stirring score and a screenplay that involved the Coen Brothers.Unfortunately you get a film that has seen it all before written all over it, a film that lacks depth and some of its pure hokum The scene where Zamperini's fellow POWs are forced to line up and beat him up is just so laughably bad and Jolie makes sure the final scene is bathed in sunset colours and never realised it was all utter tosh.Jack O'Connell gives a spirited performance as Louis Zamperini, a former Olympic athlete turned bomber pilot who crashes, he and his crew survive for days in the sea before being captured and sent to a Japanese POW camp.We have little idea why the camp commander takes a dislike to Zamperini and why he shows such brutality towards him but Zamperini stoically and defiantly takes it all.

Quite long, boring, uninspiring movie that only makes you have great feelings in the last scene-that is not even directed but is real!, feelings you should be having during the whole movie - you don't! After the trailer, you wanna see the movie like right away, movie that should bring out the pride,inspiration and admiration. Instead it just brings a lot of questions, a lot of disappointment and thinking of how it could have been and should have been much better. I gave it a 3 only for those few moments, don't even Know which moments, but I did feel something for this movie occasionally. That's about it.

Unforgivably bad direction and screenplay,An unusually amazing true story of a second world war veteran -- who credited his faith for his triumph over unbelievable cruel torture at the hands of Japanese as a prisoner of war -- has been royally bungled by a team that seems sadistic as the character Watanabe and puts the viewer to almost a similar kind of torture that the prisoner underwent while failing to highlight the indomitable spirit of the prisoner(s). Wonder why she decided to show less blood (unlike Steven Spielberg). Thanks for that! May be Angelina Jolie should take lessons from Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) on how to adapt real life incidents into a mesmerizing film.

Mediocre at best,"I do not know the book. And I do not care about heros. I care about good story telling and exciting cinematography when I watch a movie. ""Unbroken"" begins promising but turns out to be rather boring and not very commited to its characters. Angelina Jolie does not know how to dig into other people´s souls, that´s for sure. None of the characters becomes of any interest, I don´t know anything about their whereabouts, their goals and what they do to survive the horrible Japanese camp where they meet the nasties villain which is played by an eye-rolling actor who only knows one dimension of his complicated character. This movie reminds of one of many war movies from the 60´s, it´s not brave enough to tell the truth about a gay torturer and tries to be more hard-boiled then it finally is. The result is not satisfying at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unbroken Is Really Broken,"Louie always got in trouble but his brother helped him and he started running track then Louie qualified for the 1936 Olympics. When WWII started Louie enlisted in the military. His plane crashed in the Pacific he survived 47 days in a raft until the Japanese navy captured him and his crew. They put him in a POW camp but he was a big target for the Japanese commander.When they were on the raft they would kill fish and sharks to eat. They spotted a plane and the plane started shooting them so they jumped in the water. The Japanese commander made all the prisoners punch Louie in the face but when they wouldn't want to punch him Louie would scream and them to do it so the Japanese wouldn't beat them.Towards the end, Louie picked up the board and the commander started hitting him. Then they said since he did that they could wash up in the river. When they looked up the planes flew over them and they said the war is over. The U.S. dropped care packages to them so they could eat and read when they were still in Japan.Angelina Jolie was the director, yes the actors were good and well chosen, Jack O'Connell this movie was really tied in to everything all the transitions through each thought was good. I liked and disliked a lot of things about it but I think the director did very well.Was a great actor so was Finn Wittrock, yes the story flowed well it went in order, the flash backs were smooth and went well. I think they acted very well for this kind of movie. They played the part very well also.The film background seemed real but when they caught the fish and sharks it seems fake because you can just grab a shark out of the water. All of the costumes, hairstyles, cars and houses fit perfectly in the movie. The music was good it tied everything in together to make it run smooth.Some of the positives of the movie is that it talked about his Olympic life and how he always got in trouble but turned his life around and started running track. Then he joined the military and started working on that and did better with his life. Another positive is that he survived a long time just him and his buddy's. He also didn't let anyone BREAK him so he is UNBROKEN.Some of the negatives is that how he got beaten by the Japanese people. The movie didn't go in depth on his track life it just showed a little about it and I think it should have showed more. I didn't get how they grabbed the sharks out of the water and killed them to eat them I don't think people can just grab a shark and not get hurt from it.I would recommend this movie to people older than 12 because it can teach you not to give up and keep striving to do well. It also shows you can turn your life around from being bad to being good. But this movie can teach a lot of life lessons to kids so that's why I recommend it. It's a really decent movie. Kids can really learn from this movie.I rate this movie a 3.5 because it taught me some good things and also some bad things. I learned that you should never give up on life that if you set a goal that you can achieve this goal. That he risked his life for a lot of people and saved a lot of people and even did some things he didn't want to do. But I think it's a little bit too short. I think it should be longer. That's just my opinion.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a fun film,"Absolute respect to Louis Zamperini who by all accounts has a story so ridiculously packed with misfortune, luck and mountains to climb that many have speculated if it's really possible to create a film about this man, who died at the grand age of 97 in the same year of this film's release. I'm going to exercise all of my self restraint and not make the obvious joke about him dying of boredom watching this film.The first issue is the run-time, at 2 and a half hours of Prisoner of War Camp with no letting up is a real slog. Seriously, The Deer Hunter is less of a slog than this and that's similar material, and for over 3 hours. I was going to deep dive on my issues but after such a long film, I'm just gonna save us both time and talk more generally on the film as a whole.There's just a lot to take in when you're depicting inhuman events that really happened. These events you expect to see shown in a human way, ramped up to 11 at just the right time, but instead 'Unbroken' looks like a fever dream that is populated by actors who seem unclear on what they're doing.I say this for two reasons. The Fever Dream - I'm not sure how to put this but - there is seemingly no weather in this film (it only rains when it impacts the plot, the rest is glowing sunshine), which gives the very real events depicted an unsuited uncanny valley/Truman Show vibe.As for the supporting cast, I didn't get a solid sense of characterisation from anyone other than Louis Zamperini, and I found some of the acting to be misdirected, which left me wondering if nuances in the script were at times, lost.This was a Christmas movie, and I think I know why. Jolie approaches the material with all the bible-thumping zeal of an Evangelist. ""Repent!"" she cries, ""Repent!"" as she lays yet another misdeed onto the laundry list of misdeeds visited upon Zamperini.Compare this to films like 127 Hours, which while not the same scale of misery, it interspersed its more gruelling scenes of horror and fear amongst the beautiful ones of a life that lead up to those awful moments - pacing. It was effective because it highlighted parallels between ""then"" and ""now"" in the film that were poignant, it gave you a break and it heightened the emotion via contrasting it. That process is non-existent in this film.I hate to say it but I think the problem with this film is one related to class. This movie was not made to entertain, it smacks of that sombre Puritan vibe of American Thankgiving, ""sorry for the killing but thanks for this turkey which we killed because we killed all of you"". Jolie may feel the need to repent at Christmas time, being a highly monied individual, from a highly monied family, but Mrs. Gary Nobody who works six days a week in Tesco or Walmart and only has Christmas Day off to spend with the kids, doesn't need such a self-flaggelating experience as the one delivered by Unbroken.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing dramatisation of epic true life tale,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs the Second World War looms on the horizon, Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connoll) is an Olympic athlete, destined for greatness at the 1936 games in Berlin. On the outbreak of the war, he is serving in the Air Force when his plane is shot down, and he and his two co-pilots are forced to survive, alone and stranded in the sea in a dinghy for forty five days. But this is just the beginning of their nightmare, before they are captured and held as prisoners of war, by the vicious Watanabe (Miyavi) and his army. Against incredible odds, Louis finds the strength to persevere and emerge triumphant against Watanabe's cruelty.If something is going to get a glossy, big screen Hollywood showboating, then far better that it's an inspirational, true life tale than just another loud, mindless 'popcorn' flick, with everything to offer the eye but nothing to offer the mind. And in the tale of Louis Zamperini, Angelina Jolie has certainly found a lot of interesting source material to derive from, charting not only his Olympic victory before the war, but also his drawn out struggles in the yacht, and then his trials and tribulations in the POW camp. Sadly, the execution is more Hallmark TV special than big screen epic.Quite how Jolie has taken so much interesting, potential laden story fodder and made it all so unaffecting is just baffling. Everything just plays out so mundanely, with the most flat, stilted dialogue that makes it feel more suited to a smaller scale TV production than the big screen. Performances wise, it's pretty much all resting on O'Connoll, who carries everything (literally, at the end) and serves as the driving force of the film. He doesn't do a bad job, but you're always on eggshells waiting to see when his American accent falters and his native Derby comes piping back to the surface. That said, Miyavi also has presence as the cold, cruel commander.Overall, though, this is just an unfortunate let down. **",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

I was massively disappointed then to see his talent squandered on such a mediocre production. Couldn't Angela Jolie find an American Latino actor? The black hair and olive complexion didn't suit O'Connell. This film is vastly over-romanticised with an irritating score. All credit to the lead though - he did his best with it.

"While the real story is very compelling, the film adaptation is not.","Survival of the human spirit over unspeakable hardship and brutality could be very uplifting and inspiring. Unfortunately the viewer is not really given much to understand the thoughts that take Louie through his horrific journey. From his young days when he is heading for a life of crime until his older brother encourages him on the path of an Olympic runner we are not really given any insight into his thinking and motivation. We get glimpses of his determination but it is disconnected from his inner struggles. Patriotism is prominent on both sides but almost as a caricature, it does not feel real.The movie spends inordinate time depicting the sadistic treatment in the prisoners of war camp and not enough on developing any of the relationships, either between the prisoners or with the guards, no view of how the prisoners help each other to keep their resolve. I found a couple of things quite distracting: throughout his ordeal one thing stays constant - Louie's shiny hair and a stylish haircut. And there are many cheesy moments, like when the whole camp comes to a long standstill watching Louie lift the log or when Louie rises to complete the race around the camp.A pointless show of cruelty without character development.

Interesting History Doesn't Always Make Good Dramatic Entertainment,"Unbroken is undoubtedly an attempt to pay tribute to a man who underwent overwhelming struggles and suffered terrible abuse during WWII in the Pacific. In paying that tribute, the writers decided to stick very closely to both the character of the man and the events as he recalled them.This might have made a compelling documentary and certainly an excellent biography, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good piece of dramatic narrative filmmaking without some dramatic embellishment.Unbroken doesn't offer anything but a quotidian and rather superficial examination of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini as a person. Similarly, the lack of anything approximating revealing dialog or interpersonal relationships contributes to something very close to a pornographization of suffering.Fully half of the movie consists of showing his appalling suffering - first during his 47 days of starvation and thirst on a life raft at sea, and then during his time in a Japanese prisoner of war camp where he is specifically targeted as a permanent punching bag.History doesn't make good drama without good writing to bring out what reality only reveals in retrospect. This is the central problem with 'Unbroken'.I found it both brutal and boring. And that combination is a rather obscene one. Considering the Coen brother's skills, I am quite sure they were aware of what they were creating, and to me, that makes the intentions behind the film inhumane and banally obscene.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

After the first twenty minutes of the movie they no longer make any attempts to have meaningful conversations between the characters you are supposed to care about.It seemed like the director became completely focused on trying to make us feel uncomfortable and tortured and without hope, like the main character, but along the way she lost the real value in the story.

The fast and brave American solider,"Unbroken took place in World War 11. It was about a boy named Louis who beat the world's fastest running record for track. He was racing the rest of the men on the track and fell way behind all the other men. Louis ended up in front of all the track men being at fifty-six seconds top of the record and won. Louis and five other men were in a plane crash which was fatal. The plane crashed into the ocean only leaving Louis and two other men alive. Louis and two other men were able to get a raft to stay on so they would not drown. The two men and Louis ate anything that they could grab with their bare hands in the ocean. One of the men died who were on the raft. The men survived on the raft for forty five days. Louis and the other man got captured off the raft by Japanese men who were in the prisoners of war camp. The director's name of Unbroken is Angelina Jolie. Yes the actors were chosen well they all played important parts and know how to play them well. The actors both portrayed their characters realistically. Louis acted like he was part of the prisoner war camp and listened to every command. The other main character acted like he was only at the prisoner war camp to get beaten on. Unbroken did flow in an understandable way because Japanese hate Americans and that is what would happen if an American ever got captured by a Japanese and taken to a prisoner war camp. The flash back scenes did make sense. The flash back scenes were placed correctly throughout the movie. One example of a flash back scene in the movie was when Louis was at the prisoner camp and had a flash back about how his life was before he got captured. They added the music to the movie so that the movie could switch from different emotions. The movie had a lot of different emotions that made the movie even better. The story switched from being sad to scary and then to happy. The film backgrounds seemed realistic because some places in the world could look like that for example Iraq. It also could really happen in the world. Yes the costumes, hairstyles, planes, and the cabins were all appropriate for the time/place of the story. The movie played sad music when one of the men died on the raft. Also the movie played sad music when Louis got told that the Japanese were going to kill him. The movie played scary music when Louis got captured and put into a prison cell. The type of music that was being played when the guys were warming up in the prisoner of war camp was scary. You could hear happy music being played when the war was over. The music helped in the movie by telling the person what type of scene it was going to be by the tone of the music. The music in the movie made the movie more intense. One of the negatives in the movie was when Louis got beat in the camp because Louis raced a guy in the camp and lost. Another negative was when the men on the raft got trapped and had no help. Last was when he talked to his family on Christmas over a microphone but was not allowed to see or be with them. One of the positives in the movie was when Louis ran the race and bet the world's fastest running record. The length of the movie was just right. All the details were shown perfect or not better in the movie because the movie was a just right length. I would recommend middle aged or older people to watch this movie. The movie had a lot of violence in it that is why I would recommend this movie to middle aged or older people. Also I would recommend this movie to people who served in the military or interested in the war. Unbroken is a war movie so if you're interested or served in the military you may definitely like this movie. I would rate the movie Unbroken a three star movie. I would rate it a three star movie because some of the movie had harsh and violent parts. I don't think anyone should be put through so many beatings like Louis did and the other man at the prisoner of war camp.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Hallmark movie,"Impressive in a way to take a true story like this and make it kind of dull. The biggest surprise was that Roger Deakins was the cinematographer, because a lot of the daylight scenes were very flatly and amateurishly lit, and his cinematography is generally amazing.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inconsistent Movie,"Unbroken is a movie that is very inconsistent. First off, the first twenty-thirty minutes of the movie includes flashbacks of the main character to his old life and his Olympic days. However, at a certain point, these flashbacks are abruptly taken from the movie, and no development of the past story is made. There is not even a scene in which the main character decides to join the military... he is running a race, then all of a sudden he is just in the plane in the war. This is a very fragmented story structure that remains inconsistent with continuity errors such as these throughout the movie. The acting is nothing special, but if I had to say the best performance was by the main character's army mate who was captured with him. The leader of the prison camp gave one of the worst performances of the year, and I often found myself laughing at his facial expressions. The soundtrack is the one thing in the movie that I can actually say had the power to blow me away. The movie would be much lesser if it did not have such a suitable score.The thing about this movie that I have been trying to say is that it is not awful and it is not perfect. It is just so inconsistent in every sense of the word that eventually it is just nothing special and pretty forgettable. This film could have been much shorter if it did not show the same exact scene of characters being beaten to a pulp for half of the movie. As I said, there is little room for development, which makes us not really care for the characters and makes it hard for us to feel what Jolie wanted us to feel towards certain topics. For example, when we are supposed to almost sympathize with the Japanese near the end, I felt no reason to do so because nothing in the movie made me want to; it was just shoehorned in to add something to make the movie longer.Overall, I'd say this movie was entertaining, but it is by no means perfect. I would say you can wait for it to be on Netflix to watch. GRADE: C+",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Could have been better, but still watchable.","For her first try as a director, Angelina Jolie choose a topic that could not fail. An American Hero overcoming insurmountable obstacles. With the Coen brothers writing it, whats not to love? There are a few major problems with the film. There is no character development, the pacing of the film keeps your attention at some points and puts you to sleep in others. Unfortunately, I could not get emotionally attached to any of the main characters, I wanted to empathize with them in their trials, but I just could not.Now all of that being said, there was some good that came out of it, The dog fights were awesome, and the sets were beautiful. Would this movie have been better in the hands of an experienced director? Yes it probably would, but that is true for most first time directors. Was this a bad movie? No, It had its moments.The bottom line is this: The type of film that it is will get different responses, if you were thinking about seeing the movie, go see it, it may affect you differently than it did for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Impressed,"When I first saw the trailers for Unbroken, I had high hopes. It is unfortunate that these hopes were dashed within the starting minutes of the film. While the plot, and acting, is very strong, the rest fell flat. The actors stand out in their roles, making them their own, and the plot felt intense yet inspirational. This should make a great movie about survival, but it doesn't. Everything was there for this movie, it should have been great. The problem with the film is poor direction, poor effects, and, well to put it simply, lack of character development. While the acting was great, it couldn't make me care at all about the characters. I watched knowing the names of almost none of the supporting characters, including that of the family of the main character, and it made me lose interest. Even the main character's development is rushed, and by the end of the movie I didn't care if he lived or died (fully being aware he lives by the way). While the film does attempt to honor the late Louie Zamperini, it simply doesn't convey his story well at all. The movie feels rushed, never allows the audience to care about the characters, is cliché in almost every way, and even relies on a jump scare to keep the audience interested. The film itself should be able to maintain my interest without the use of cheap tricks such as that. If the movie was poorly acted, it would be garbage, but the acting does take it up a notch, but still can't carry this movie to greatness.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unbalanced Vision with Questionable cross cutting,"First, while we all must stand in admiration of the extraordinary courage and perseverance of Louis Zamperini, the extent of the portrayal of torture in this film far exceeds what would be required to comprehend his experience. In some respects torture is like sex: if there is too much of it we have pornography. In that respect, though I am hardly a prude, one must wonder how this film ever got a PG-13 rating. For an adolescent moviegoer this movie could be overwhelming and a source of nightmares.Second, the way the cross cutting is handled - with extensive use of flashbacks - the narrative sometimes suffers from what one might call ""bottom spin"". That would be the reverse of ""top spin"" where (just before a short TV commercial, for example) you are held in suspense for a brief period then brought back to the main action. Here, the suspense that might have been present is demolished by rather long flashback sequences.The cinematography and the acting, on the other hand, are commendable, which is the only reason I can give this movie as much as a 5/10. For movies in this genre the Railwayman is far better.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hoping for a lot more...,"Unbroken: I could not have higher hopes coming into this film. After seeing one of the most inspiring trailers I have have ever seen, I was expecting one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. Sadly, the film came up short. Some moments are inspirational, but a lot of the times the film just stayed on the surface- played it safe. It never really got to the level I was hoping to see. Yes, I know there is no more inspiring real-life story in the world than this one, but that is not the movie, that is what the real Louis Zamperini did. The movie cannot take credit for it. Unbroken is a film that will leave most satisfied enough but with poor directing and screen writing, this film is not a worthy enough picture to be made about the life of Louis Zamperini.When I asked most people what they love about the movie, most just say ""Oh, I thought it was really good, I loved the story."" The story is what makes the movie appealing but that is just what the movie is based upon. Its like saying ""I loved the movie because I loved the book."" If they actually thought about it strictly as a film, they will realize that the movie is not half as good as they have it in their mind. Why do I say this? Mainly because in the moments when the audience is suppose to get that feeling of courage and perseverance, I did not. I did not feel inspired. The first time director, Angelina Jolie, did not fully capture the moment in the film and I kind of fell like she just hoped we would feel inspired because of the story and of some patriotic duty. To make it worse she added in these stupid Hollywood scenes that never even really happened. Why would a the head of a prisoner of war camp ask you to hold a really big piece of wood and if you drop it you die? They don't. That never really happened. Yes, there is a special spot in hell reserved for that man known as ""The Bird"", but even he would say it would just seem moronic to do that. It was just a cheap trick that the director tried to use in hopes of making the movie stand out amongst other war films.Alright, alright, enough of that stuff. I still did enjoy a few things about Unbroken. The main being the acting. Jack O'Connell, who plays Louis Zamperini, was the only one in the film throughout the whole thing, and he did a great job at what he had laid out in front of him. I believe he was a little misacted because he looks a little to Irish to play an Italian guy but that is not his fault. What he did with the role was very impressive. If directed better, his performance would have gotten more notice, but still I believe O'Connell shows much promise with this role and I think he might hit it big if he gets the right director. The rest of the cast all did well with the screen time they were given.Another thing I liked was the parts of the movie that focused on Louis Zamperini's youth. The flashback scenes of him as a kid and during high school were the scenes I feel were directed the best. They really conveyed his early upbringing well with the short amount of time they had to do it. If that kind of directing was continuous throughout the film, it would have been much better. I also liked the relationship between Zamperini and his fellow soldiers. In war, a relationship with your fellow soldiers is what keeps you alive and it is the main reason why you keep fighting. If they added in a few more scenes with this is mind, it would have served the film well.As you may know, this film takes place largely in a prisoner of war camp and has numerous scenes where the main character is getting tortured. As such, it is definitely not suitable for children and anyone who can't handle that kind of stuff. I recommend you see this film in theaters or on DVD, but you will probably enjoy watching it more at home.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Failed movie,"Starting from a good story, this movie is a failure as far as I am concerned as I didn't feel involved in the future of the raft survivors and then the camp prisonners.
The way it was told and shown just wasn't it for me.On the odd side, I felt it strange that Angelina Jolie, a female director, decided to shoot an movie, with almost exclusive actors and no actresses.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unbroken? Angelina, you did succeed in breaking me in half in 30 min!","Incredible story but poorly managed. I felt absolutely nothing for the poor guy, nor at sea or at the prison camp. The ""chemistry"" between the ""bird"" and Louis Zamperini was existent to some degree, but not enough.When talking about chemistry, I imagine the conflict between the 2 men, one a brutal prison guard and the other, trying to survive the horror of the camp and challenging him at the same time.The movie is a 2 hours non stop sadistic journey and that is too much. No real emotion, no character development. Boring.After reading a bit more about Louis Zamperini on Wiki and Google, you realize that more is to come when returning home. Post stress syndrome, alcohol abuse, and religion and forgiving the guards of the camp, even ""the Bird"". Much was to tell yet!Angelina Jolie was way over her head to be producing this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good story,"What I really liked about the movie was that this was the first American movie ever to show a glimpse of how truly cruel the Japanese were during WWII. Not to hatch the past or to hold a grudge, but it is important to know the accurate history. I applaud the producers for making this movie. Yet, this seemingly wonderful and moving story of perseverance and triumph did not come through clearly through the somewhat spotty story-telling and raw acting jobs. The characters did not fully develop, and obviously some important portions of the story were left out. Finally, the ending was...what should I say...very uninteresting and flat. Sorry to say, wished it was directed better, Angelina.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Completely missed the point,The whole point of the story is that Louie want from being a tearaway to being an Olympic athlete. Then when he joined the army air corps and was captured by the Japanese that prowess turned against him and he was berated for it. Following that there was a whole 'man's inhumanity to man' issue with 'The Bird' which is neither fully explained or really portrayed. The whole film skimps on the important parts of the book and tries to portray a sanitised story. It misses out so many characters both Japanese and allied.Angelina Jolie should be ashamedA very poor attempt at a fantastic book.,3.0,Anonymous,Biography
'The Passion of the Christ'   ---   the Angelina Jolie version,"Maybe Angie should hook up with Mel? They both seem attracted to depicting deep human suffering on the screen. I can say, she didn't got the message from the critics of 'The Passion of the Christ'. Please allow me reiterate this message: no matter how hard the moments in someone's life have been, what is the reason to bring this violence on the screen? What does it help to prove/understand? Is public display of real life violence needed? The fact that someone went trough hell, is it a reason to publish it? Is it beneficial in any way? There, of course, might be other explanations for this movie. Someone wants to show us how to be resilient, or even how far the human nature can survive. Or even that no matter what, we have to forgive.I believe a personal story of horror must remain personal in its intimate dimension of what an individual/group of individuals have suffered. Because such suffering has no meaning and no logic. The fact people went through and survived is all in their honor. But not a reason of publishing it.Finally, I hope, just hope, Angelina is not trying to show us here how we should be resilient in life. Because if this was her intention, she must be one individual that is measuring things in an extreme way. Despite the fact the story of the movie is real, by no means this should be taken as an example of how to get through life. The story behind the movie is just too extreme.On the other side, why doesn't the movie show that Louis went into alcohol and depression after the war, yet recovered and started preaching God and forgiveness while being able to completely and sincerely forgive the sadistic commandant? Now that's a human achievement Angelina should have presented in more detail in it's movie.The same movie could have been made in a much softer way, without the atrocity in all of it's details. And could have had perhaps a better impact on the public.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Slow and Bad Script,Unbroken was just okay. I gave it one star lower than mid-range because I fell asleep for a portion and have no desire to see any part of it again to catch up. The film is about a WWII soldier held prisoner by the Japanese and was based on a very long book who many say was excellent. I read that Jolie successfully convinced the studio to let her bring the picture to the screen by selling them on how she capture the heart of the story. She failed. The script spent waaaay too much of the film depicting the character's suffering while floating around the ocean in a raft after their plane crashed. It seemed to take up the entire first half of the film. That time would have been better spent telling the story of how the main character dealt with his trauma after the war. The credits at the end refer to it. Apparently he struggled but finally found some solace through his faith and traveled to Japan to meet his captors who he forgave. Now I'd rather have seen some of that story than watching three men barfing after they tried to eat a seagull.,4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointing,"I was mesmerized by Laura Hillenbrand's book long before the movie came out. Indeed, Unbroken and Seabiscuit are two of the best books I've ever read. It's hard to put my finger on it, but I found the movie rather dull, lifeless, and uninspiring. Indeed the movie Seabiscuit, also based on a Hillenbrand book, is much superior to the movie version of Unbroken. Seabiscuit has real heart and terrific acting. Angelina Jolie just doesn't have the directing chops to produce a tight, moving, well-acted film.Few times have I anticipated a movie more than Unbroken, but I was left sorely disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
