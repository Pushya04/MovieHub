It's just a great action film,"I mean. This literally is what is says on the tin. It's jam packed with action and I love it.The plot is easy to understand and the action shots are brilliant. So much bloodshed, guns, fighting, killing and more guns. Did I mention guns?
It's just a nice, easy and fun watch. I recommend watching the first if you haven't already, but yeah I'm impressed by the sequel.Usually with action sequels it can be a bit dull and repetitive, but this ramps up the action from the first film.But yeah, 8/10 from me today. Enjoyed my time watching this, I'm going to jump into the third one now.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Professional Courtesy,"A film with more head-shots than words spoken, John Wick: Chapter 2 is just about the most violent film I've seen in quite some time. But it knows exactly what it wants to do, and succeeds immensely.Keanu Reeves isn't one of the best actors working today, and I don't think he would disagree with that statement. But he's no doubt one of the most committed actors out there. There's no more than a few pages of total spoken dialogue throughout 'Chapter 2', and Reeves has probably a maximum of 30 lines, all of which aren't necessarily delivered as well as they should be. But it doesn't ultimately matter. Sure, John Wick could be a better franchise if the scripts were of the same caliber as say a Bond or a Bourne movie, but that's not really why you go see one of these movies. You go to see Keanu Reeves kick some butt amidst some of the best choreographed action in cinema.Chapter 2 picks up not too long after the first film ends as Wick is somewhat enjoying his life as a ""retired"" assassin. If the first film was about him coming back to seek revenge, this film is Wick reluctantly coming back because he owes a debt to another assassin. I don't think the filmmakers truly could have imagined this would be a franchise off the bat, but it's sure shaping up to be quite the intriguing universe. The one thing that has always struck me as appealing in this series is the way they portray the world Wick lives in. Yes, it's present day, but the world that surrounds Wick is heightened to make for more exciting action (it's essentially a world full of super assassins). But at the same time, the films are incredibly grounded with reality. It's that balance that so few films can accomplish to this particular level.Taking the famous Liam Neeson line ""I will kill you"" to a whole new level, Wick claims ""I will kill them all"". And that's pretty much your movie. Wick doesn't want to come back, he owes a debt and is forced to return for one more kill, and then the bounty on his head reaches just about everyone linked to The Continental's database. The rest of the movie is Wick delivering killing blows to just about anyone who stands in his way in the most creative ways possible. Isn't it about time people leave this guy alone? Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 promised visceral action (all impressively in camera- yeah, I'm looking at you Resident Evil) and we got just that. Even if the dialogue can be clunky and the performances are over the top, it doesn't really matter. What matters is this series continues to be a pleasant surprise in an age where great action movies are too few and far between.+Insanely well-done action+Tops the first film's scope+The universe Derek Kolstad has built-Some dialogue is bland and even lazy8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The rare sequel that is better than the original movie,"""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (2017 release; 122 min.) continues the 'adventures' of former (?) hit man John Wick. As the movie opens, we are immediately thrown in the middle of a car vs. bike chase, and next thing we know, we find our man retrieving his beloved Mustang from a chop shop in NYC, but not without cars flying about, and dozens of dead or wounded bodies. And that's all in the pre-opening credits! As the story unfolds, Wick, who wants ""out, is nevertheless forced back ""in"" when an Italian baddie calls in a favor and Wick has no choice but to accept. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: director (and former stunt man) Chad Stahelski returns at the helm following the surprise success of the first John Wick movie, and once again delivers a highly stylish and ultra- violent action movie. When you watch the opening car chases (yes, in plural), it's like watching a synchronized ballet performance. I would not go as far to say that the story line doesn't matter, it does to a degree, but let's be honest: the reason we are there is to watch the car chases and the shoot-outs and the almost cartoonish level of violence that is so over the top, you can't help but laugh at it. Stahelski's thinking must have been: ""when in doubt, (i) throw more bodies at it, and (ii) keep the focus on Keanu Reeves"". Reeves is cold as ice in the best possible way, and it suits him perfectly in the film. Laurence Fishburn plays a small role (as another baddie) and the scenes where Reeves and Fishburn appear together are their first joint scenes ever since the Matrix Trilogy, if you can believe it. I couldn't believe how quickly these 2 hours flew by and I'm not spoiling anything when I tell you that the movie's ending sets it up nicely for a Chapter 3 in a couple of years. Count me in!The movie opened wide this past weekend, and the Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was absolutely jam-packed, somewhat to my surprise. Did I mention this movie is ultra-violent? And that it's rated R for good reason? I was outright dismayed to see how many small kids were in the theater. In the very row in front of me, there was a couple with three small girls, I'm guessing ages 5 to 7. What are these people thinking?!? Meanwhile, for us grown-ups, if you liked the first John Wick, you are more than going to like this sequel, you are going to LOVE it, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu- ray. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a WINNER.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Slick, but I was detached in a way I wasn't in the first film","The first John Wick film took me by surprise; it was a cartoonish action film that was surprisingly brutal in its content, cruel in its delivery, and had a real punch to it. All of it existed inside a world that convinced in its own logic, even if it was clearly fantasy. John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.The second chapter of what at least looks like being a trilogy, is slick and very well put together. The locations are brilliant (whether a roof garden or a larger location), the fight scenes have great choreography, and after a slow first 20 minutes it does have a great pace. But yet I found myself watching it much more passively than I had with the first film. This sense of being detached came from a couple of places. The first was that the plot did not seem as organic as the first – the violence that draws Wick deeper seems to occur just for the sake of making the film happen (which is of course true, but it doesn't try to hide it). This reduces the investment and stakes, so rather than being drawn in, I just sort of accepted it because I know where it was going.The second thing that kept me out of it was related to this lack of investment – which is that the film's lack of realism is all the stark. I do not mean that the film needed to be a kitchen-sink drama, but rather that the film cannot sell this world to the viewer. In the first I could go with this shadowy world on the edges of ours, with the idea that it developed its own rules and norms; here though it seems everyone is a hired killer, and those in charge have total power and huge organizational skills. The use of this doesn't seem worth the cost of doing such things – for instance suggesting everyone in a massive crowd is in the employment of one person and can act with the slightest nod just seemed silly and not to add value. This excess infects the action – it is overblown but could have been strong enough to engage had it not been that the majority of the film is so silly in how it works. I read Theo Robertson's user comment on this one and I think he nailed it when he said that the film could easily be in the Matrix universe – at least this would make the nonsense here ring true.This limits the film, but doesn't stop it being enjoyable. The action is slick and consistent, the style and gloss of all the moments are enjoyable, and the starry cast are mostly pretty good. Reeves is good value and does great physical work, and the supporting cast has plenty of famous faces – although some of them are distracted by their volume, or by virtue of not being well used (Fishburne is probably the one that we could have done without). So JW2 is a slick action flick, but not as good as the first film, nor as good as everyone tells you it is. The ending suggests the third film will be on an even bigger scale, with Wick literally taking on the whole world, which will probably only serve to remind me how good the first one was when it was one man seeking revenge on another for the death of his dog.",,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick: Chapter 2 Is A Decent Flawed Forgettable Sequel,"More stylists and more colourful, also more feels like a real Hollywood action film compare to the first one which still have that B-movie vibe in it and guess what, the first one is still the better one, yes, John Wick: Chapter 2 got lot's of upgrade in terms of a look, all the performance was great, but story wise is my problem, i feel like the story of John Wick: Chapter 2 doesn't have the heart like the first one do, the villain and the characters are not as convincing as before except of course John Wick, though again the performance are good, Laurence Fishburne make an appearance in this film and he is horrible, lot's more action in here but it is not as exciting as the previous one, i'm still fine with it, though there is still one whole sequence where John Wick is chase by literally everybody because of an open 7 Million contract to whoever can kill him and it is the best scene in the movie because it's incredible and probably the only exciting action in the entire film, it's 20 minutes longer but i must say that i did feel more faster than the first one, the first 30 minutes of the film was boring, and yeah that's about it, overall John Wick: Chapter 2 was a super flawed sequel for me, i think the performance are mostly great, it is more colourful and stylists, but story wise and action wise not so great and not so exciting, it's not horrible, it's not like the plot are stupid and bad it just not an interesting and an convincing one, it feels like a build up for something even bigger, it is basically a build up, a decent build up, overall John Wick: Chapter 2 is a decent flawed forgettable sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"John Wick: Chapter 2 continues it's faced paced, neo-noir story of our assassin","In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.I've always liked Keanu Reeves as an actor whether he's a metelhead from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, a SWAT officer in Speed, or ""a chosen one"" from The Matrix franchise. He has a more reserved, yet intriguing way of adapting that to his characters. Under a good direction, this can create a strong character. This has worked for John Wick, which reminds me of an older James Bond-type if the movie was more of a noir. I was happy to sit and watch John Wick: Chapter 2.After a great opening where he finishes his mission from the first movie to collect his stolen car, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) returns home with his new dog to try and find peace with his retirement and death of his wife from before. Like a lot of typical spy movies, John gets visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio)who asks him to come out of retirement. Santino asks to have his sister assassinated so that her brother can have her seat at a table of mafia heads. When John refuses despite making a blood oath years ago, Santino has the assassins home destroyed.John accepts the job knowing that saying no would only put his life in danger. In Rome, he finds the sister Gianna at a party, but she commits suicide rather then allowing an assassin to get her. On his way out, John finds himself double-crossed by Santino who has sent some of his weaponed goons lead by the mute Ares (played by Ruby Rose). Though John escapes and makes it back to New York, Santino has put out a seven million dollar contract on our hero to cover all the tracks.John Wick: Chapter 2 manages to pull off a really good sequel. Not only does it expand the John Wick universe more, but the stakes feel bigger and the villains seem more threatening. Now that I have seen the first movie, I can see how tough it would be to follow up on a pretty good action movie. Unlike the Taken sequels which simply repeated the formula over and over again, John Wick: Chapter 2 still feels fresh thanks to it's plot which honestly kept me guessing on how things were going to move forward.Do I think it's a higher rated movie then before? No, simply because if it does have any faults, it's that it feels a bit long. Not the segment in Rome, but when John returns to New York. It's quick pace suddenly halts when he visits a friend. Though the scene is okay, I feel like they could have cut it in favor have keeping up with John's mysterious background.Keanu Reeves is still the perfect choice as John Wick. You can tell this man wants to be happy, but understand that with his connection to the crime world, is unlikely to happen. This is enough to keep me hyped for another John Wick movie.I'll give this eight grey pitbulls out of ten. If you liked the first movie, you'll definitely like the sequel. John Wick has plenty of action waiting to burst, so I can only say love your dog and go see this sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rating: B-,"When someone spells the word ""sequel"" my body starts shaking. I have so many problems with this type of movies that only exist to make money and not to actually be a good movie. Even if John Wick: Chapter 2 started as one of these films, it's able to break the curse and become a fairly good sequel.There's twice the action of the first one and it's twice as good. The hand-to-hand combat is amazing and if you've seen the behind- the-scenes videos that went viral, then you know how happy I was watching those one-take masterpieces. Keanu Reeves might be the best actor alive to actually do his own stunts. Even the cheesy script works for him because ... Well, he's f*cking Keanu Reeves!I also loved the exploration of the assassin's institution. Throughout the second act, it's shown several ""safe houses"" and rules by which the killers live by. The pacing drops down, which is a problem, but it's mostly fine since the story is interesting enough for us to be captivated. Just not enough for a whole second act about it.However, the first film is far better than this one. John Wick was a big surprise in 2014, no one thought it would be any good, so a lot of the scenes were great because we're not expecting them. John Wick: Chapter 2 has those same scenes and it doesn't have the same impact (it made me yawn at some points).The motivation for John Wick to go back to business is forced and not emotional (as it was in the first film), which I can accept ... Until the end. The ending doesn't make any sense to me, it's only done this way in order to have a trilogy. Keanu Reeves' character changes his personality and his whole attachment to emotions because ... Well, because the studio wants three movies.The script is super cheesy and it could have ruined the movie if not for Keanu Reeves' brilliant acting. The work that he puts into this character shows up on the screen and I felt it. He carried this whole thing. The rest of the cast did their job pretty well, with major praise to Laurence Fishburne, he's just great.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a good movie. It has those brutal, man-to-man one-take action scenes that blow my mind every single time. The story around the institution is interesting to some point, but the slow pacing throughout it took me off a little. The script is cheesy, but Keanu Reeves' makes it work. I don't buy the ending, it's only that way in order to have a trilogy and John Wick's motivations to come back are too forced and not as emotional as the first time, which contradicts the character's personality.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
He's Bloody Back,"This review of John Wick: Chapter 2 is spoiler free**** (4/5)THERE HAVE BEEN a lot of roles that Keanu Reeves has played since hanging up his sunglasses, long leather coat and his boots after 2003s The Matrix: Revolutions. Many of which were promisingly good, some were quite bad and others in-between were mediocre to say the least. But out of all these characters he's been in none that have fit him more like a glove than the title character in 2014s John Wick, the hirsute assassin who was enjoying life in retirement with his new puppy, until he had to get revenge etc. The film spawned a whole new genre of action: the geriaction thriller (cheekily, Reeves was just about to turn 50 at the time he couldn't be considered as a geriatric) because at the time there were a few other films with older protagonists sharing the multiplex, such as Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill and the granddaddy of them all Liam Neeson in Taken 3.Even though he was a lot older than he was in the first Matrix he did a bloody (emphasis high on bloody) good job at ass-kicking, or sharp shooting criminals out of his home. He ended up killing a lot of people, there was a lot of action to enjoy. At this point you may be asking yourself what's on offer the second time-round? From the start of John Wick: Chapter 2 there is a lot to take in we are immediately transferred into a car chase it's indeed the main improvement over its predecessor which didn't have much of a story, there was just a lot of action a huge body count and a lot of blood a simple dog revenge thriller. For a while through this it riffs the same thing, there is a lot of action, a lot of blood and a huge body count – there are, however, two differences, an entirely new plot which riffs on an entirely new revenge story this time it's Wick's life on the line after he entered in a wager with a ruthless killer (Riccardo Scamarcio) and the dog (a Staffie with no name).The title Chapter 2, also indicates there will be a larger series to behold here seemingly perhaps he may come back for the third movie (if it happens) we'll see. Director Chad Stahelski's material here is - in one word spectacular there is plenty here to enjoy, it's one of those movies that if it's done well then you'll enjoy it, now on the second-time-round the message is certainly correct. The action throughout is cool, the car chases are ruthlessly fun, and finally it's completely on edge from start to finish and with Reeves on top form what's not to like for this second time? Kicking off just a few hours after the ending of John Wick our protagonist (Reeves) is bruised, bloodied and quite frankly fatigued after fighting for hours on end.He's tied in with another plot for revenge with a killer and his duo of assassins (Common, Ruby Rose); he receives info from his trusted hotel manager (McShane) that he is under attack. He must end a wager, to do this he has to fight for his life in a bullet ballet rampage; he must kill someone to somewhat end it, Wick here uses his skills and his wits through this barrage of bullets in the catacombs. Here there is an entertaining montage when he gears up for – perhaps his biggest battle, containing a brilliant cameo from Peter Serafinowicz who helps gear up Wick with an arsenal of weapons, along with his bullet-proof suit. There is also a knife fight on train slightly hinting at The Raid 2. Perhaps this is the message Stahelski is sending to us that he can make a bloody action thriller with a lot of enjoyable moments.Wick then joins forces with the homeless network run by Laurence Fishburne's Bowery King, though instead of showing down to a Matrix-fu brawl, Bowery gives him a favour for saving his life many years before there is even a chance to his maniacal laugh, and for him to prove he's smarter again by riffing famous lines. This is when the film becomes slightly rubbery it loses its footing slightly, as it drags out a bit more. But when the action unfolds again it's immediately back to its home.Stahelski's style isn't limited or indeed of short-supply because there is plenty here to enjoy it's completely ruthless from the opening moments to the stunning Hall of Mirrors set-piece there is a lot of action for any action movie buff to enjoy. Reeves may not be the greatest actor of our generation, nor, indeed is he the worst but he hits every mark with clarity throughout he's brilliant when it comes to the action. Despite the elasticised third act, as the story takes a while to step in. John Wick: Chapter 2 is slightly better than its predecessor it's an adrenaline-fuelled, action-packed ride with a lot of bodies, blood, plenty of material and is downright good fun from start to finish, it's an absolute blast.VERDICT: A bruisingly, brilliant action-packed bullet ballet of a sequel. This is an absolute bloody blast and with Reeves on top form, what's not to love?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Stab, kick, shoot, repeat. Stab, kick, shoot, repeat. Stab, kick shoot, repeat.","Well, I committed to watching the first three ""John Wick"" movies consecutively, and in case I totally worship them - like apparently the rest of the world does - I would hurry myself to the theater and watch the fourth installment on the big screen. After the first one already, I knew this wasn't going to be my thing. Not that ""John Wick"" is a bad film, it's just a very monotonous 'shoot-em-all-up' actioner that rapidly makes you go like ""yeah, whatever"".The first film doesn't have much of a plot, but it does make one thing crystal clear. You cannot kill John Wick, but he sure as hell can kill you without barely even lifting a finger. The plot of chapter two is identical, give or take a few minor details. And if you thought, after the 500+ body count of part I, there wouldn't be any more bad guys left to shoot to pieces, you thought wrong. Another couple of cargo containers full of disposable thugs literally stand in line to get executed by Keanu. This is ironically also where the film gets rather tedious. During some of the never-ending shootout, like in the Roman catacombs, it felt like I was gazing at the ultra-violent video games that my 13-year-old son plays fanatically. And I hate those.I'll still watch number 3 as planned but the fourth isn't not worth the expensive price of a cinema ticket nowadays.

So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film.

Mythology Continued,"I felt the brilliance of the first film was found in the under lying mythology of the Continental Hotel, the coins, the laws/culture between the Reeves and some of the smaller parts (police official / bartender etc). As such I hoped that in the second film this would be continued; I wasn't disappointed.The film continues from the first film with a great level of balance. Respecting the first film and allowing a 2-hour film to have its own identity without dragging was a challenge that was met well. The Laurence Fishburne element and the subsequent ending allow a great opening for another film.Another strength of the movie is that the John Wicks character (like Neo i) is so well suited to Keanu Reeves. He is the strong-silent type and it feels Chad Stahelski, the Director, glorifies this and uses it to move the story forward. He gives you the same in an enhanced but similar format.Loved : Lance Reddick as the Hotel Manager / Ruby Rose and the signing stuff Note: If you don't like people being shot in films – this is not the film for you!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The movie shows more about assassins life and about their rules and that was awesome to see I am glad that director listened to the fans. Because of this deeper insight in assassins, better visual looking, awesome action sequences its safe to say that this was better than the first one of course the first one was good also I gave it 7 and this one gets 8.After all I really recommend you to watch this is one of the better movies this year so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Love letter for action genre written by bold bloody hallmark, and a pencil.","If there's an equivalent of classical orchestra for untamed unapologetically brutal carnage, there's no doubt it'd be John Wick. Dancing through hail of bullets, horde of assassins straight from video game, oozing noir style from each drop of blood, John Wick: Chapter 2 is nothing short of an artistic spectacle.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns to the killing business begrudgingly as one of his old acquaintances asks for a morbid favor. The cloak-and-dagger scheme soon flies into multiple directions, partially towards the back of few characters and the rest goes straight to the chest. There's an air of familiarity as the movie visits previous characters while introducing an array of new ludicrous ones.It keeps the formula nearly identical, adding more to its melee and shootout fun. There's everything one loved from the first, now pouring abundantly. Combat is arguably the best action choreography one could possibly ask for. Punches, kicks, submission holds, and even dirty pokes are delivered with sheer primal vexation and the finesse of ballet performance.Both the anti-hero and his rivals press forward in locomotive of mayhem, any fans of action movies and combat sports will be gleefully entertained. In fact, such simple concept of ""one versus many"" is ageless and universal, it worked since Bruce Lee's time and now told by razor-sharp spectacular visual, John Wick is the finest action of modern time.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Missed the mark,"I really loved the first movie, although I feel that this one missed the mark slightly.Firstly, the storyline was less clear this time round, so I wasn't fully on board with John's motive and what was driving him. I felt less invested in him going out and beating everyone up (Whereas in the first movie I was really rooting for him).There were also a lot of parts that were illogical, and I often found myself questioning why someone did X when it would have been easier for them to do Y. It happened enough times for it to ruin the storyline for me.I think it was an okay movie, with some great scenes. But as a whole, it didn't come together for me and I was pretty bored.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Action Movie!,"Wow, this is one of the best action movies that I have seen in quite some time. It is really what I was hoping for in a good old fashion action movie that was done entirely on hand to hand combat and gun shootings. This is a wonderful kick-ass movie where the killings were done so brutally with lots of bloody scenes. It also kind of remind me of the various one man army movies in the 80s played by Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. If you have seen John Wick the original (which I hope you have seen it before you see this one), then you will be amazed with this sequel. It was bloodier, more fighting, more assassins trying to kill John and longer running time. What I can say is this is an even better version than the original movie. Although in term of story, there is a bit of a more complexity in the sequel as opposed to the simplicity of the original movie.All the fighting scenes were choreographed wonderfully according to my opinion. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I loved all of them and there were no fighting scenes that took too long to finish. Keanu Reeves' portrayal of a retired hit-man who had no choice but to come back was really spot on. There were also some minor characters from the original movie who appeared in this sequel and also new character played by Laurence Fishburne whom I believed would play a large part in chapter 3. Yes, there would definitely be another sequel based on the ending of this movie, which really made me so excited and cannot wait for it to be released.Aside from the very cool amazing action sequence, the sound effects of this movie was very good such as the sound of cars screeching, guns blazing and the voices of John and Cassian's heavy fight which I thought sounded very original. My recommendation if you want to watch this movie, it should be watched in a theater with good sound system.Since there were many bloody brutal killing scenes (including 1 suicide scene), the Indonesian censorship body had given 21 years above rating. So yeah, this movie is definitely not for kids. For those of you who want to enjoy a pure action movie with Keanu Reeves as the main star, this one should not be missed. Don't forget to watch the original movie first so you would understand the story line. But for those who do not really enjoy this kind of movie (or cannot stand the bloody fight scenes), then this might not be suitable for you.This is one heck of a movie and I for one truly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie.for my complete review, pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good action in an increasingly absurd setting,"Just as the previous movie in what appears to becoming a franchise, this movie delivers solid action sequences that are a blast to watch, and probably just as much fun to make. The action in this film makes it feel like a video game come to life, and in a good way. I'm sure people will look to this the next time they try to make a movie like Max Payne.Like the previous film, this is not much beyond an action film - but it does seem like they're intent on establishing a quite unique world. Just how far they are willing to go with it, time will tell, but right now it seems like half the population of this world is involved in an assassin underground, while the other half is utterly clueless. The fact that Laurence Fishborne and Keanu Reeves appear together is no the only parallel to the Matrix.It's also a movie that doesn't shy away from having a little fun instead of keeping to any sort of realism. And because the world the movie is set in is kind of silly, it works well enough. I think it went a bit too far when the characters seemed willing to shoot passersby (like in the fountain scene), but mostly they try to keep them within the strange moral universe they have established.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worthy sequel,"I'm not going to spoil the plot or any of the most memorable action scenes from the movie, I'll just write this:John Wick: Chapter 2 is a worthy successor of the first movie, it expands the universe, giving you insight into the interior of the world of assassins and maintains the insanity of action sequences from the first movie.Memorable scenes, unexpected humorous tone of some dialogues and shootouts, really interesting world and Keanu Reeves who, as usual, commits 100% to the action sequences (just watch his training videos on youtube, mad respect for this guy!)I believe that true efforts to entertain you should be rewarded. In a world of shitty, worthless, cashgrab sequels (like, say, Fifty Shades Darker, released the same day as John Wick 2), sequels like JW:C2 deserve to be praised.

"Stylish, yet empty","John Wick is back, and once again he's the person others constantly sing praises to. Limping more than ever, and looking as if he's about to turn into wood any second, he's still inexplicably unkillable and wondrously fatal. So fatal that sometimes his victims prefer to kill themselves, simply to grant themselves the luxury of dying their own way.This movie upped the stakes style- and execution-wise, that's for certain. And even though the plot is ridiculously thin and the action as repetitive as an FPS game, one could not deny John Wick: Chapter 2 a certain charm. However, just like Mr Wick's magical ability to withstand death, that charm is an artificially crafted gizmo delivered by the hands of many unnamed (or not so much) characters put everywhere for the entourage. The entourage that gets viciously exploited by Keanu Reeves wearing the same single face everywhere and saying his wooden lines like an animated corpse. Without Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Lawrence Fushburne, Common, that equally hot and deadly mute girl, even without Riccardo Scamarcio and his character, John Wick is just a bogeyman: a ghost of a scary story which can only frighten little kids but loses its potency once they grow up a bit.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The killings are logical, even though at some points the bad guys became generic henchmen who can't shoot straight.

Huh?,"Where to start... Apparently everyone is an Assassin, yet cannot shoot to save their lives. Only John Wick can shoot people like that. In the head. At will. The movie also gives off this weird James Bond vibe with all the different guns and suits John Wick can have just for asking for them.

A blast with pitch perfect action and scenery,"Stunning! I liked it more than the first one. Loved the Italy setting and the way it expanded the world. The scenes in the museums and art galleries are a feast to the eye with all the rich colors and amazing scenery. This movie looks beautiful.I have a lot of respect for Keanu Reeves. I remember watching ""The Matrix"" when I was young and that was something that I took inspiration from whenever I tried to film my own action movies. The way Reeves handled all of that choreography and stunt-work in those movies was inspiring. He is perfect as John Wick, there's nobody else for that role. What he does with the action here in this one is extraordinary. Hats off to everyone involved with the stunts because I can tell how much hard work went into it. The rest of the cast is great. Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Franco Nero, Peter Stormare etc. Lots of respect to them all. Everyone has a very welcomed presence.The calmer scenes are nice too. I could actually watch an entire movie about just a normal calm day with Keanu and the dog. Their friendship is touching to me. I don't know, there's something very humble and beautiful whenever we see them living a quiet life before all the action starts. This movie is not completely serious either, it has many funny moments as well. Especially at a part involving a walk to the subway. Oh, and there's this moment with a water fountain which I really liked. The locations they used here are pitch perfect by the way. I mean, I'd like to visit many of them now.This movie is an experience. I had a blast. Hats off again to the filmmakers. If you have a hard time watching films with a lot of violence or action, then you should probably not watch it. But, to any fan of the genre: it's a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Where everybody knows your name...,"Hello Mr. Wick. The usual Mr. Wick? - Oh good to see you again Mr. Wick! - Long time no see Mr. Wick! - Troubles John? - Ah Johnny, we missed you!Cheers! Where everybody knows your name! Despite the fact that you are ...the bogeyman! A mysterious ghost! The man who lurks in the shadows! The man who killed 3 men and 2 dogs with a paper clip (or was it a pen?). A lethal weapon out of this world!I have nothing against Keanu Reeves. Likable actor, good in the matrix, and a modest person in real life as I'm reading. Yet ...he doesn't look like the ...bogeyman. I can accept a middle-age Steven Segal as the glimmer man, but I just don't see Keanu like that.And in the (two) movies his skills aren't so great. Doesn't seem like a meticulous professional. And what a waste of bullets, shooting every goon's head 3-4 times. And pressing the trigger of an ...empty gun in numerous occasions. Can't he tell his gun is empty? I thought counting bullets was a must skill for professional killers...As a movie is full of clichés. Another ""secret"" society of killers, with ""rules"" (meant to be broken) and pseudo-wise characters willing to share their ridiculous wisdom with others. Not to mention the ancient movie tradition where the evil guy doesn't kill the hero when he has the chance, but instead ties him in ...a chair ...in an old warehouse making it so easy for him to escape, while explaining his evil plans.Yet it seems that the movie has a small but loyal audience. The stuntman director tries to capture some brutal violent moves up close. Long sequences of Reeves shooting foes at point blank is somehow a new trend.Overall: The otherwise sympathetic Keanu Reeves seems miscasted here. His old pal from the Matrix days Chad Stahelski serves as the director of this typical in premise yet somehow original in the shooting sequences action movie. Not much substance, just stylized action scenes.",,Anonymous,Crime

"When the bullets fly, John Wick 2 is as good as it gets","If we're being honest, we all thought 2014's John Wick was going to be nothing more than a crumby direct to DVD like actioner, with a slumming it Keanu ""can't be bothered"" Reeves getting emotional and angry over his murdered pet.That Chad Stahelski's original film ended up being one of recent year's best Hollywood action flicks was a genuine surprise, as John Wick's first outing of hardcore revenge served with a double helping of headshots and karate chops, rose above its simplistic set-up to be a genuinely memorable shoot-em-up that was perfect for a weekend night in with a pizza and bunch of mates ready to ride every hit and miss of Wick's path of vengeance.So on the back of the first films unexpected success, John Wick has once more shunned retirement plans to get reluctantly back into the game of whopping bad guys and not bothering to take names in returning director Stahelski's bigger budgeted and more highly promoted follow-up.Fans of the first Wick experience will be pleased to know the films formula has barely been messed with here as Wick finds himself on ""one last job"" that will see him venture overseas and kill a lifetimes supply of generic goons in 1 night, only to then find himself battling what seems to be every person on the earth whose looking to get themselves some sweet bounty money as Wick's head is put up for contract.As with the first film, Wick operates in some bizarre and almost comical world where every man, woman, probably child and pet is an assassin and where hotels serve guns not wine, trained killers get murdered by a pencil and tailors make specially made suits that seemingly make all the bad guys bullets miss John Wick's head, while he in turn nails every single headshot like a trained brain removal surgeon.It's this bizarre kind of universe that makes John Wick 2 tolerable, as when Reeve's opens his mouth or the action dries up, you start to realise this second adventure into this bullet invested property isn't really anything to write home about.No more evident than the films particularly slow middle section, after an impressive opening stanza in which some of the first films story strands are tied up neatly, when the bullets aren't flying and the bodies pilling up, Wick can get rather boring.With a tiresome villain in the form of Riccardo Scamarcio's Santino D'Antonio and with Reeves doing his best work while showing off his considerable fighting and stunt capabilities, beside the impressive carnage, the only other notable moments of the film stem from Ian McShane's return as the big assassin boss Winston and an unexpected cameo like appearance from an old friend of Neo's.Final Say –If John Wick 2 took itself more seriously it would show itself up as a rather by-the-numbers experience, but within this world, in which the impossible seems possible, everyone's a highly trained hit-man and gun battles rattle the senses, this second experience in the John Wick universe is an entertaining action thriller that lacks the surprise of the first film but not the bullet fuelled energy, which makes John Wick Chapter 3 a high value target.3 Matrix reunions out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Yeah, I'm thinking' I'm back.","John Wick is back for another all out action go around. If you enjoyed the first movie as most people did, this is without a doubt a must see right away. Very few sequels in general can get close to the original, but John Wick Chapter 2 may even exceed the first movie in my opinion. The following is my review of John Wick: Chapter 2.Chad Stahelski is once again back to director this action packed sequel to his 2014 surprise hit both critically and box office wise. Stahelski really came out of nowhere with the success of the first film, as before that movie he was really only known for stunt work, even working with the star of these two films, Keanu Reeves on the Matrix films. The best parts of the first film are Stahelski's vision to make a true classic action film that not only featured amazing gun scenes, but also featured hand to hand combat scenes that were mind blowing. This sequel ramps up both of those areas in this film. The goal of an action sequel is to even more action packed, and surprisingly this film does that. The action is real, and very little CG is noticeable in the film. It is corny to say a film is packed with action from start to finish, but this film literally is. Stahelski proved three years ago he was capable of directing an all out action film, and now he has proved he can continue that great success with a sequel that delivers even more so than the original in many regards.Derek Kolstad is back to write the John Wick sequel. Similar to director Chad Stahelski, Kolstad is pretty much an unknown, having only wrote low budget films starring Dolph Lundgren, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Steven Austin. The story however for the John Wick series is pretty easy to write, but there are some good one liners that needed to be placed perfectly in the film, and Kolstad does another excellent job there. So even though the plot is thin, the great acting and action take center stage of the thin plot.Tyler Bates(John Wick, 300, and Guardians of the Galaxy) and Joel J. Richard(John Wick and The Bourne Identity) are back to compose the score for this action film. Both composers have an excellent track record, more so for Bates, but both of these guys already delivered a fantastic score in the film movie, and the score is just as memorable this time around. If you are someone like myself who appreciates a good score in the heated moments of the fight scenes, you will truly enjoy this.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a must see action film, and a must see for those who really enjoyed the first film. The action is even more intense, and the scenes don't look fake like many films in this genre tend to these days. The cast is truly magnificent, and even though the downtime in the film seems like it drags a bit too much, the acting makes it worth the wait.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Did I Take The Red Pill Or The Blue One ?,"Having no money , no job , no beautiful woman to keep me company and no one on the horizon and basically no future I decided I was needing cheering up and nothing cheers me up more than a visit to Leith to see my friends Danny and Sarah whose cordiality makes the legendary hospitality of the Pashtuns of Afghanistan look Thatcherite in comparison. While I was there Danny knowing I'm a cinema addict recommended a film he'd seen JOHN WICK CHAPTER 2""You should watch it Theo. It's brilliant . John Wick kills a couple of guys with a pencil . It's brilliant , especially the fights""I did reply that I'd seen the previous film which featured an over the top fight sequence in a nightclub""It's just like that Theo , except it's like that all the way through. The whole film""Sarah interceded and said it was a good film and I should watch it first chance I get. It is somewhat dubious recommending a movie to someone due to the high body count including a couple of deaths via pencil but Scorsese can get away with it and anything is better than the recent Iranian New Wave cinema I've been watching recently. On top of that the first thing I did when I got home was collapse on to the couch for a couple hours . When people show you such hospitality the least you can do is catch up on movie recommendations!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!!This sequel builds up the backstory hinted at in the first film . Apparently there's a criminal Illuminati and these people don't take no for an answer . They also don't take ""I've retired"" when an oath is given so when John Wick says ""No thank you I've retired"" that leads to a cashflow problem amongst other thingsAs was described to me this is a very violent OTT thriller. Everything is magnified and the nightclub shoot-out in the first film is a pillow fight compared to this one and Keanu Reeves is in full blown THE MATRIX mode. It's all good clean fun because the Illuminati are keeping it to themselves and the action is so overdone that despite it being fairly graphic with headshots etc there is little reality to thisDespite this there's scenes that don't make the slightest bit of sense from a logical point of view. Pitched gunbattles take place with bodies piling up yet no police appear and people walk nonchalantly by a few yards away. This is summed up by a scene in a tube station where two characters surreptitously fire pistols with silencers amongst a crowd and no one notices what is going onThe story builds up in such away that it's difficult to believe that the illogical mechanics of the plot turns aren't deliberate . Then when the film reaches its climax involving a dialogue scene between Wick and Winston there's a scene that will have you gasping ""How would that happen in real life ?"" That's because I find it impossible to believe it is taking place in the real world and the third film in the trilogy will reveal itself to be either a meta-fictional movie commentating on cinema violence or it's set in a virtual world similar to THE MATRIX. In fact there's so many references to THE MATRIX it might actually be a reboot/remake and the studio have delayed announcing this until after JW3 is released. That's my prediction",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Action Movie in years,"John Wick surpassed expectations in 2014 with a simple plot. Revenge. It left many doors open for a sequel, and wow did Chapter 2 really impress. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and he was surrounded by an excellent supporting cast (Ian Mcshane, Ruby Rose, Common, Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishbourne).Chad Stahelski knows how to make an action movie matter. Every scene was meaningful. Every character was understood. I could almost feel every punch, and take every shot. Stahelski used a perfect combination of lighting and a great score for his downright brutal action scenes.Chapter 2 was almost exclusively focused on the 'underground assassins' world and it did not disappoint. It was amazing to watch how these larger than life super killers can blend into society so easily. I like how this society has two very important and non negotiable rules that seem to always keep things in order. Which is hard to do.I feel like I could write for hours about this movie, but I do not want to give any spoilers. Please go and enjoy. Several times.

Exemplary Sequel - Enjoyable Low-maintenance Action,"Keanu Reeves's tragedy-stricken, stoic, ruthless ex-hit-man John Wick returns after decimating the world of organised Russian crime in 2014's 'John Wick' with a sequel that takes everything that made the first film such a surprise hit and expands upon it in gleeful fashion. The film follows the precise expert as he navigates through various reactions to his exploits in the first film, and retains the realistic-feeling, expertly-choreographed action that so benefited the first.The film is essentially the definition of 'turn your brain off' entertainment, and is sure to be the standard for low-maintenance action films that people can turn on and enjoy without engaging themselves too much. This is of course what made the original film so good, and the proposed sequels now have a good formula to build upon, combined with an interesting world of hit men and a reliable main character.Overall there is nothing incredibly special about John Wick 2, and nor would there ever be. It's fun to watch and good for action film fans, whilst you'd be hard-pressed not to enjoy the zippy plot and dynamic structure of the piece.

With the experience I've had with other action movie sequels, i believed that this would not be nearly as good as the first john wick movie but it surprisingly was! in fact, this is the first action movie sequel I've seen which is better than the original movie! now that's a big deal to be honest. I love how they didn't reveal the plot of the movie whatsoever and actually experiencing the plot unveil little by little was pretty mesmerizing. another thing that they achieved in the movie which was awesome was the world building. Oh and the action sequences were just exquisite! you could look at keanu reeves in the eye and tell that he's doing 90% of the action and stunts. The camera was still and you could see who's getting hit and who's getting killed unlike other action movies (cough taken cough) where the cameras are all shaky and they try to hide the stunt doubles in between the shots. personally, i wanted to know more about the secret assassins world they have and learn more about it and that was EXACTLY what they did in this movie.

Wick goes off again and even more explosively!,"John Wick: Chapter 2The first one grabbed the audiences by throat. It was in your face on how to innovate and capture the dance of Gun-fu. But what made the first one captivating was its presentation of the crime and assassins' world, their code of conduct, their hangouts, the hotels they stay- in, etc. It seems that Chad Stahelski knew what made the first one so fascinating and did a commendable effort in creating a further depth in this world. John Wick seems like a book cover only versus the Chapter 2, which comes across like a whole dossier on this underworld's crime kingpins and how the hired killers operate across the globe. I am still wondering who is the managing the accounts opening department. Guess this is another point very successfully developed in the movie and by the end of it, you want to know more about the operations of this underworld. And this need for knowing further left you wanting more Chapters.Chapter 2 start with a usual chase scene. Its robust, skillful, too long but ends unexpectedly. It reminded me of another movie, Blade II. which was 2nd in series, had exactly same way starting with a chase in continuation from the first movie. But as the movie progressed, you realized that how amazing the story line and much bigger and bolder are the action scenes. Chapter 2 is audacious and has enough action to fulfill Adrenalin and video game junkies. It doesn't have any character that are there just there for the need of the scene. I will look forward to return of that henchman in Chapter 3 that was left on the train with a blade in his heart.Having discussed the greatness of this movie, I still find bit difficult to believe that smart man as John Wick agrees to do one last job to free himself from the oath. The kind of a job which is self- explanatory that there will be consequences after this hit. So why even accept it and not kill the one who burned your house. However, by the end, the movie is bit heavy handed in dealing with the psychological pressure that John Wick faces as he sits with his nameless dog in his burned house and mourns the loss of his life, his beloved wife and the emptiness of his heart. Its takes a rare risk to show how this undefeatable anti-hero will face the same fate as anyone who breaks the rules of the house. I love when movie makers are willing to take chances to show that even the mighty ones have a limit and powerless of their fate. Above all like us they are extremely flawed driven by their primitive need to fulfill their immediate hunger.John Wick Chapter 2, like its predecessor is one the best action movies in its specific category. It works like a video game during the shootout scenes but from time to time it slows down for hand to hand combat and giving you a glimpse of grit and resolve the characters have. It always a pleasure to see that besides the main protagonist, other players are also as skill full, intelligent and as fierce as John Wick.This time also, the wick goes off and creates an explosive experience. In the memory of my favorite movie citric Roger Ebert, I would like to say that this movie is two thumbs up and way up. 4 out of 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Less character development, same results","As a whole, the movie played out the same as the original, although lacking some of the dry humor and things that would make you root more for Wick that the original had. What I fail to understand was the unneeded femme fatale character like in the first Wick movie that has no character build-up or back story. Who is she? All I could gauge was she's a smartass with the intimidating physical attributes of a 13- year old child and yet we wait through her hiding behind every other bad guy he could possibly fight/kill to die first for the ending and for her to be taken out as easily as well...fighting a child should take.At least they didn't make it as painful as it could have been and had her actually give him a real scare for his life like everyone with clue knew would be more fantasy than him killing a guy with a pencil through the back of the head. Why is it these movie always have to have a character like this who after dealing with real imposing and capable bad asses the whole time, being giving either a chauffeured villain who's been pampered his whole life and who's blood is half crème fraîche, or a 85 lb sexy hot (but with attitude of course) woman who even if her ninja like, cat quick reflexes were all that, couldn't kill a fly with a round house kick to it's cranium, to fight?I mean; I realize all of it is fantasy and Wick realistically should have died 5 minutes into the first movie, and having a tough gal with a great ass is somehow mandatory now for flicks like this anymore, but my intelligence would have been less insulted if the movie was about a dwarf woman who wanted to play Inside LB for the Bears and got the start after she proved she could get to the QB and chew on his calf with her wicked smarts and hard to catch elusiveness that her pet ferret taught her. Enough already. If they simply must (new SAG law) have to employ a woman in the role of ""tougher than 99% of the men"" in flicks like this, can they at least make her somewhat believable physically?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mindless entertainment,"It starts out with a pointless premise about his car. Both John and the gangsters making stupid decisions.
It gets better and much more entertaining with moderately acceptable purpose to people's choices.
There are some cool long hand combat scenes.

"I was entertained by this movie, not as much as the first, but still entertained.","I'm watching through all the John Wick movies again before I see Chapter 4. John Wick: Chapter 2 begins just after the ending of Chapter 1. This movie is longer and has less action in it, but the action itself is a bit more stylish than the first film. We finally got to see the Pencil Kung Fu, which was awesome. It also has a bit more of a comedic element. The conversation in the bar between John Wick and Cassian was really funny to watch. The story was better and made a bigger impact on me in the first film.The gunfights are still very stylish and innovative, even a bit more than the first film. His gun really feels like an extension of his arm. He is so confident with his gun. One would almost like to have a rating displayed and upgraded after every kill he makes. Like in the video game franchise Devil May Cry! The action is so smooth and stylish. I was entertained by this movie, not as much as the first, but still entertained. I feel that John Wick has the potential to be even more stylish and entertaining, so I'm hoping he will deliver more style and get an even higer stylish rank in Chapter 3!Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 got a higher stylish rank than Chapter 1, but Chapter 1 was a bit better movie when you tie everything together.Final stylish rating: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Man! I didn't think Chapter 2 could out do the original, but man! This was Fantastic!","No electric boogaloo here, This is one of the best Sequels ever made!Keanu Reeves gets that Mojo working again with the next chapter of the life of John Wick, known as the Boogieman to those in organize crime, he gave up his life as a hit-man (THE hit-man) for the woman he loves just to loose her to cancer. He was going to stay out until they killed...His dog! Granted, it was the dog his dead wife gave him postmortem but man, he went berserk on the idiots that did it.Unfortunately, his actions put him on the radar of a man who wished to cash in a marker John gave him as a way to leave the game forcing the Boogeyman to get back to work.It's a bigger action flick than the last John Wick. More fighting, more gunplay and more violence. A very unique action film in the fighting style they chose to do. Not as fancy as you'd expect it's a little more real and rugged.And very violent. You get to see the things that they only talked about in John Wick. It's kinda like they wanted to show you what John Wick could do in the first movie but did not have the money so they just told you, and now that they have the money they'll show you, and they do a beautiful job of it. The cinematography and the art direction perfectly contradict the graphic details of the killing business Wick is so good at.And Keanu man! What is this like his forth comeback? John Wick is literally catered to this man's style of acting. Not much in the words, says a lot with very little and says even more with his action. It's like a John Wayne Clint Eastwood deal with John Wick being this seasoned outlaw who wants to be left alone but comes from a world where that's impossible because he's so great in this element.Herd somewhere that the production team for John Wick is made out of the Stunt team for the Matrix, and they most likely have been talking about producing this on camera stunt extravaganza for years, and they made it perfect. It's fun and exciting and filled with those moments that make you scream out ""oh snap!"" every few minutesIt's rare when a sequel is able to take the exact magic that made the first movie worth seeing and create something much bigger and turn it into something better.

What's the story?,"This film tells the story of a criminal, who is particularly good at killing. One day, he displeases someone in a pact, and is forced out of retirement.

Wick 2: burning the candle at both ends,"Although seeing John Wick #1 isn't essential, it'll probably be helpful to the viewer. Wick, a retired hitman, is called back to service to exact revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his new puppy. In the sequel, he finds that a bounty has been placed on his head and that he owes a Bad Guy for assistance rendered in the past. This leads Mr. Wick into another flurry of murderous rage. As with its predecessor, the plot is pretty easy to follow, and some familiar characters appear. As usual, it's the fight choreography that's the main draw, with a lot of terrific action sequences involving not just gunplay but plenty of hand-to-hand combat. John Wick #2 might not pack the emotional punch of the original, but it makes up for it with some fine supporting performances by Laurence Fishburne, Common, and Ian McShane.

A bit disappointing,"I was excited for John Wick: Chapter 2. The first 2014 film was a action film for people who don't like action films, or at least what they've turned into in recent years. The story was reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood western: A man has something taken from him by some bad men, and now it's time for him to take something from them (probably their lives). It was stripped down and minimalistic, while also managing to pull off some epic, bone-crunching action scenes that were, mercifully, spared of the shaky cam treatment. John Wick: Chapter 2 has many of these things. The action scenes are arguably better. Keanu Reeves brings the same energy and force that made him the perfect protagonist in the first film. The stylistic influences range from the films of Jean Pierre Melville to Westerns to Enter the Dragon and even Buster Keaton (a couple of frames into the film you'll understand what I mean). All of this and yet it's so much more disjointed. The first film knew what it was. It was a lean, mean, stylish, gritty action thriller. The world building wasn't heaped on. It didn't feel necessary to the plot but instead it felt like the icing on an already tasty cake. Chapter 2 takes the world of John Wick and makes expanding on it one of the key issues of the film. Admittedly, the world is pretty interesting (but do I really need to know where John Wick gets his suits tailored, though?), but the story is lacking because of it. In the first film, no spoilers here, but anybody who saw that movie knows that John had a clear motivation for doing what he was doing. In Chapter 2, the motivation feels lackluster. Therefore, even if the action sequences are the reason why the word ""epic"" was invented, you feel less involved in his revenge. One of the first things a revenge film has to do is get you on the side of the avenger. With the added problem of a weak villain, John Wick: Chapter 2 has a rough time doing that. The film's other major problem is a lack of character drive. Wick seems to be stumbling through the scenarios, figuratively of course (he could eat a bowl of Fruit Loops and make it look slick), but we never see a clear vision of what he wants and what inside of him he's fighting against to get there. We see the external problems: he's being roped into something he doesn't want to do under threat of death, Common is gunning for him, he needs to convince Laurence Fishburne and his hobo-assassin league to help him. But we don't have that same drive from the first movie. He doesn't want to get out of retirement, but he has to have his revenge, and in the end, does he really want to be retired? In a way, Chapter 2, as over-bloated as it is, is more stripped down the the first film, as Wick barely grapples with any of the internal dilemmas that were the undercurrent to his character in the first film. In the end, Chapter 2 is a stylish and entertaining film, and comparatively with most sequels, it's more than we could have possibly wished for. Just be aware, it works almost entirely on the surface level. Imagine Bret Easton Ellis and John Woo teamed up to make a James Bond film and somehow it turned out to be a sequel to John Wick. Fun, but no so much fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Disappointing sequel, but its alright","This one tries to keep a connection with the first installment, but it kind of fails. Truth to tell, the first one should have been a stand alone. The whole secret society thing got old, midway through the picture. The elaborate weirdness seriously tests your suspension of disbelief. Especially near the end. Two thirds through, the plot begins to meander as well. Did this need two hours? It could have been edited to cut 15 minutes to a half hour, and not lost anything of value to the film. Reeves seems to improve as an actor with every film. He's almost shed the valley boy accent. I say almost. But I give him credit, even at age 52, for it taking so long. Laurence Fishburne was waaaay over the top, and needed better directing, as well as Claudia Gerini for being well, too wooden. You get the feeling she is a native Italian language actress, and had trouble translating feeling into English. Is it worth the watch? Yeah, I guess so.

Getting Wicky with it,"The Boogeyman has had a lot of different forms over the years from grotesque features, grossly deformed into the vision of nightmares to a man with slicked back hair and a depressed look on his face? No, I'm not delirious my friends, but the reference I made is to the codename of John Wick, the legendary assassin of 2014. After a thrilling, and complete conclusion, one may have thought Wick's journey ended there. Obviously, Hollywood did not think so and thus comes Chapter 2 of the action adventure and whatever, random target that is assigned. Robbie K here, and today we take a look at John Wick: Chapter 2. Let's get started!Likes:  Dry sense of humor  Visuals and special effects  Stable camera work  Lots of action and excitementSummary: There isn't much in regards to John Wick, so finding a like outside of action, but one component is the dry sense of humor this film has. Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a man of few words, but the few he speaks are worth a good laugh. The writers win points for a dialogue that is both pun filled and classy, timing them at key points to maximize laughs while sticking to the stoic nature of our players.Yet the humor is just an added bonus to what is John Wick's strongest feature, the action. All the reviews are in agreement that Wick is back with more action than ever imagined, as this one-man army unleashes a storm of well-placed bullets, knife slashing (and sometimes pencil) stand offs, and Marshal Arts punches. Wick's skills with a pistol (among other weaponry) are intense displays of choreography, proving that you can coordinate extras dying to imaginary wounds in an exciting way. The hand-to-hand combat also gets points, not quite as developed as the 70s and 80s movies, but still an enjoyable element to mix things up. Helping support all the action is impressive special effects, which adds the extra flare and touch that gets our hearts pumping (e.g. explosions, crashes, and comic book bashing sounds). You can guess there is plenty of blood to go around too (for you gore seeking fans), which adds more to the chaos and violence at hand that somehow adds a bit of satisfaction to the mix. But even better, is the entire film has stable camera work that keeps you scoped on the action without making you vomit due to vertigo. Overall, this exciting package gets two thumbs up in its etiquette, design, and impressive work on the action.Dislikes:  Keanu's acting (at times)  Simplistic story  Overstepping boundaries at times  Some fights a bit blocky  Unorthodox presentation  Slower parts a bittoo slowSummary: While we never expected an academy for this performance, there are times where Keanu's acting is a bit too lax. His lines are meant to be serious, but come out awkward, effortless, and sometimes bored at the unoriginal dialogue. While this certainly isn't a big weakness, there are moments where this acting took away Wick's awesome factor, or made me chuckle unintentionally.Acting aside, the story is another limiting factor that Wick really needs some fine tuning on. Yes, I know story isn't the main theme of this series (hence why I make a genre rating people), but movie overall this film's plot is a little less put together than its predecessor. A random guy shows up, tells a vague back story to establish a weak connection, and then becomes another revengeful chase across two cities. All the convoluted (shallowly explained) relationships and teases did nothing but make more targets for Wick and did nothing to add to the story for me.Finally, while the action is indeed awesome and well done, there are still a few limitations that hit this quality. First, those who aren't fans of repetitive gun play and headshots, need to skip this filmbecause that is a majority of the action. But outside of repetition, the action sometimes oversteps the boundaries of realism. A car mercilessly being smashed (and smashing) yet still running, a number of injuries that magically heal, and the inaccuracy of other assassins are just some of the eye-rolling moments of this film. In addition, some of the fist fights get very blocky, have awkward pauses, or lack the edge (music and sound effects) that make the fighting less exciting and more we just extending screen time. Another component I didn't like was how they reduced Wick's fighting of other assassins to a messy set of montages that seemed out of place and were lackluster compared to Wick fighting off nameless extras. Such missed potential for memorable rivalries, and more diverse fights. And even more missed potential, was the slower parts not taking time to advance a story, or establish better character dynamics, which made for some dragged out moments.The Verdict:Wick's journey of revenge and killing is certainly more exciting than his last ordeal. The emphasis is on the action, with a majority of the film geared towards the stunts, effects, and violence, so adrenaline junkies strap up and hit the theater. However, if you are looking for the complete package of story, dynamics, and balance, then this film isn't the right one for you. Wick still lacks a lot of other qualities in the movie overall category. Worth a trip to theater? Yes, as the special effects and excitement are made for the theater. But if you can't handle extreme violence then skip!My scores: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8 (for the action) Movie Overall: 5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hitman on steroids,"John Wick: Chapter 2 is both one of the few action movies that actually has a reason to exist and that can compete with its predecessor. The former is confirmed since the titular main character has killed so many criminals in the predecessor that he has become public enemy number one which is the central plot element of this film. The latter is underlined by this film's similarly straight pace, pitiless action sequences and cool acting performances which make the transition between the two films very smooth. I would actually recommend watching the entire trilogy back to back since the films take place over a few days in the life of professional assassin John Wick.Just like its predecessor, this movie obviously doesn't feature an intriguing plot. However, it expands the universe of John Wick as well as his associates and competitors. It gives us more details about the lead character's impressive reputation and explores his life before his initial retirement. The film adds a few new characters such as a shady crime lord played by Riccardo Scamarcio and an enigmatic underground cult figure who controls a large network of homeless gangsters incarnated by Laurence Fishburne. The film also introduces new spectacular locations such as a stealthy infiltration sequence to assassinate a powerful woman at the heart of Rome.To keep it short, this sequel is as good as its predecessor and offers a whopping two hours of passionate action with spectacular locations, cool characters and some interesting background stories. This approach makes me think of a fast-paced video game like Hitman on steroids. The John Wick franchise doesn't reinvent its genre but offers unpretentious fun for fans of gritty action films for adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great sequel that is action-packed and just as fruitful as the first chapter,"John Wick: Chapter 2 brings the hard-boiled character back as the notorious 'boogeyman' and is done so with utmost precision.Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, a bereaved hitman with a Russian mafia related past who struggles to find the little pleasures in life after his wife's death. When his continuity of life is disrupted by the people he has tried to get away from, Wick easily adapts to his ruthless past and begins his rampage.There is so much someone can grab and discuss from this film; it is set in John Wicks world, as opposed to the world we know; it is a reinvention, an exploration and indeed a study of what we thought was a normal place to live and roam. The secret societies are an obvious catch to discuss with plenty more other themes to find out.I would say, however, is that Reeves portrayal as a sort of monstrous assassin is let down with the sweetness of his voice in delivering powerful dialogue. He lacks the punch of conventional 'hard' characters like Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone, but perhaps this is what makes his character so great?Nevertheless, this is outweighed by a brilliantly crafted story line that delivers more while retaining Chapter One's excellent style.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an enjoyable, stylish and action-packed thrill ride.","In Hawaiian, the native language of Keanu Reeves' biological father, his first name means ""cool breeze over the mountains"". Sounds peaceful, right? Well, early in his career, Reeves played pretty peaceful characters in 1988's ""Dangerous Liaisons"", 1989's ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and, in 1991, ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"", ""Parenthood"" and as an FBI agent pretending to be a surfer in ""Point Break"". That last role also marked the beginning of Reeves' transition to more intense and even tormented characters, like in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), ""Speed"" (1994) and ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997). Although the man with the peaceful-sounding first name still sprinkled in some sweet and peaceful roles (e.g., ""Sweet November"", ""A Walk in the Clouds"", ""The Lake House"" and a voice-over as a kitten named after him in 2016's ""Keanu""), most of the parts Reeves played in the late 1990s and early 2000s have been decidedly un-peaceful – in movies like ""Johnny Mnemonic"", ""The Matrix"" (and its two sequels), ""Constantine"", ""Street Kings"", ""Man of Tai Chi"" (which he also directed), ""47 Ronin"" – plus ""John Wick"" and its sequel ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (R, 2:02). Peaceful? Not hardly! Entertaining? You betcha! ""Chapter 2"" is a very appropriate phrase to include in this movie's title, for a couple of reasons. The action picks up right after the events of 2014's ""John Wick"". Having come out of hit-man retirement to avenge the murder of his puppy and defend his own life by dispatching scores of bad guys, he now comes for his stolen car, knocking off a few more thugs in the process, and then calls it even with the boss (Peter Stormare) of what's left of the crime family which John has decimated. He calls a mechanic friend (John Leguizamo) to repair what's left of his souped-up Mustang, reburies his weaponry in the floor of his house (under concrete which he lays down himself), looks wistfully at a picture of his late wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), takes care of his new dog (which he has not yet named) and, to quote the 1980's singer known as Rockwell, John might say, ""All I want is to be left alone in my average home, but I always feel like someone's watching me."" He has good reasons for thinking and feeling all of that.Since Wick (aka ""The Boogeyman"") came out of retirement (albeit for very good and personal reasons), the international organization of assassins of which he was a part now considers him un-retired. (After all, John himself said in the previous film, ""People keep asking if I'm back. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back."") Italian assassin Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), a member of one of the families represented at ""The High Table"" of assassins shows up to hand his old friend an amulet with John's bloody thumb print inside, a token of what Santino says is a blood oath which was reinstated when John came out of retirement. John is now obligated to fulfill a ""request"" by Santino or he himself will be killed.Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of New York's Continental Hotel (a kind of safe house and DMZ for international assassins), reaffirms to John that those are the rules and there is no other way, so John heads to Rome to do his job. John proceeds with his trademark classiness as he plans to execute his responsibility. Of course, nothing will be easy, even for John Wick, and he'll eventually have to defend himself against a number of deadly agents, including one played by Common, and another by Ruby Rose, but he also gets help from ""The Sommelier"" (Peter Sarafinowicz), who deals in a lot more than wine, Charon (Lance Reddick), the classy and extraordinarily helpful concierge at The Continental Hotel – and a blast from Keanu Reeves' own cinematic past (a cool cameo which I don't want to spoil).""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an enjoyable, stylish and action-packed thrill ride. As good as the original film was, this one keeps what worked so well the first time, takes the plot deeper into the main character's world and adds several interesting new characters. It's an intense action shoot-'em-up, but it's not just the guys who get to have all the fun. (Beware of mute female henchmen, lady violinists on the subway and women who would rather slit their own wrists than become a hit-man's victim.) Besides its many colorful characters, this sequel keeps audiences engaged with its general air of sophistication, its stylized action sequences and visually sumptuous set pieces that are to die for. If you don't mind a high body count and a few vagaries in its plot points, this is everything an action sequel should be – including setting the stage very well for ""Chapter 3"". For now, I'll close this ""John Wick"" chapter with an ""A-"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Chapter 2: The Inferno,"There's something delightfully askew about this movie. For one, the not-so-subtle allusions to Dante. In an action movie. Man, that's just precious.While ""John Wick 2"" doesn't have the suspenseful revenge buildup of its predecessor, it doubles down on the mystique of the underworld's internal workings; which makes sense as that was the allure of the original.But one of the things I really like about this movie is that, even with the beautifully gruesome violence, there's a fair bit of humor mixed in; some of it even taking the action to bizarre levels. Like, say, Reeves and Common continuing their fistfight during a fall down the stairs, or even co-opting New York's homeless as part of the assassin network (and Morpheus as their King . . . I just thought that that was very funny).It's all part of the surreal magic.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Borrrring,"I just don't get reviews anymore. I used to agree with many and my taste was kind of in the mainstream. Movies like this though that have an 8 rating and really, are pretty terrible in every way, I just don't get.The action is okay if you are into impossible fight scenes where the hero seems more like terminator than human. The ridiculous ways in which the hero survives each attack are way over the top. To add insult to injury each scene is dragged the f out until it seems like forever, including the scenes where he should just walk in and pop someone. Nooooooooo. He holds an 8 minute dialogue with them. How is that good, especially when it is Keanu and some other no talent actor or actress on screen with bad lines thrown in to boot? It's frickin torture. The acting is excruciatingly horrific. Not one of the actors made it seem real. The lines are just laughable but not in a good way. The only thing positive is the dog.The movie honestly felt like it had been written by a ten year old or as if someone came through and dumbed it down, way down for its target audience (which judging from most of the reviews, it seems to have reached). Picture this (and no, it doesn't count as a spoiler because I'm paraphrasing): you have guy 1 talking to Wick and asking: ""You're going after Santino Gregorio Mariano D'Antonio?"" *overly shocked face*. Santino D'Antonio? Really? His sister by the way is G'ianna D'Antonio. Ridiculous names which someone thought would sound badass and cool. I bring it up, because that's the entire premise of the movie. A bunch of scenes taken from your favorite movies in the past, tweaked a little and thrown back in, in a comicy, hokey fashion. The only person who acted a little more naturally and seemed to deliver their lines (or maybe just had better lines) with some reality was Laurence Fishburne. He just seemed to be having fun with the whole thing as in WTH am I doing and aw, just go with it.Again, the only thing that was worth seeing was the dog, oh, and Lance Reddick's toned down performance.

Ferocious Fun,"""The man. The myth. The legend. John Wick. You are not very good at retiring.""Thank god John Wick is not good at retiring. He is back, and obliterates every action movie made in the last 10 years, out of the park. Hollywood history has proved bigger is not necessarily better, but John Wick is one of the few exceptions. 2X bigger budget, but 4X the fun as compared to the original.Speaking of which, the movie starts 5 days after the first movie ended, with Wick tracking down his trusty Mustang at yet another Tarasov's. A brutal fight follows that seems pointless as it ends in a peace offering, but it is not quite pointless- it sets up John Wick's character for the uninitiated. That he is focused, commitment, has sheer fu***ng will, and all the stories about him are watered down versions of actual events. And that is the excellent thing about the characters in John Wick 2. They help grow the mystery around the main character, keep adding to his legend. Because as far as the plot goes, it can be summed up in one line- handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, pencils, knives or hands- Wick will kill lots of people in the most inventive ways possible.""You stabbed the devil in the back. To him this isn't vengeance, this is justice""While director Chad Stahelski might have been a stuntman, but John Wick 2 is not all action. It is funny too, like horror movie funny. Incredible action pieces are followed up by tense, yet funny moments. Think Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 rolled in one. Keanu Reeves is again perfect as the unkillable assassin, dispatching 128 people in the movie, in elaborately choreographed style, yet seeming lovable and hopeless romantic at the same time. Apparently ex-Special Forces folks trained him and that shows in his physical performance. In current form, close quarter armed or unarmed, he might even take on Bond, Reacher, Hunt and Bourne, all together, and make it out alive. All the while looking way better than those guys.""Tailor: Is this a formal event or a social affair? John Wick: Social. Tailor: How many buttons? John Wick: Two. Tailor: And what style? John Wick: Tactical...""While Wick is stylish, his style has both art and purpose. His impeccably tailored suit serves as his body armor. His moves have a dance like feel. The criminal world he belongs to has the same kind of resources that Bond has access to, yet crazily, has a code of honor. By the time the movie is over, you might be left wondering if there is a thing called ""too much.""Spoiler- The climax doffs its hat to another cult classic action flick- Enter the Dragon.

John Wick 2,"With the plethora of terrible and unnecessary sequels these days, recently ""Inferno"", ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"", and ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", ""John Wick 2"" is a welcome and refreshing surprise.Right off the bat, the film starts with a chase, and it rarely lets up. After this opening chase, which concludes with John getting his car back, he is confronted by Santino, a man that he made a sacred oath with in order to escape the underworld of hit men was involved in. Since he came back to that world in the first film (and the beginning of this one), he has broken this oath. He is now brought back in to (supposedly) do one last favor for the man that he owes.The character of John Wick himself is actually quite a troubled one. As you know if you've seen the first one (which you should watch if you plan to watch this one), John Wick had a wife that died, and now all he has left from that time in his life is his dog and his car. He is first forcefully brought back into the hit-man lifestyle, but it is possible that he enjoys his rampages and fits of vengeance, because without a wife or a home, it is all he has. At the same time, he clearly feels guilt and regret for much of what he's done, and what he's lost because of his actions. John is lonely, and his loneliness twists him throughout the story.While John Wick may be surprisingly layered for an action hero, the film is also incredibly efficient in the information we are given and how it is given to us. John Wick is the strong, silent type, and most of what we know about him is shown through the editing and the acting, which bluntly conveys exactly what it should, with a very physical performance from Keanu Reeves. The many other performances in the film are fantastic as well, especially Ian Mcshane and the short cameo by Laurence Fishburn. The world building is also impressively done, with most of it just being shown to us, and only what needs to be explained being explained to us, such as the two rules of this business. Sometimes, character and world building is woven into the action. Oh, and what incredible action. This has - hands down - some of the best action scenes in this decade, and probably even in subsequent decades before it. Chases, hand to hand combat, shootouts, you name it; it's all here, and it is all fantastically shot and edited, perfectly choreographed, and consistently creative and intense. The frame is wide and the shots each last long enough to have a clear view of the brutal and precisely choreographed action, unlike many action scenes in modern Hollywood. There were several moments where my jaw was literally dropping at how intense and consistently original all of the action was. Even though John takes out hundreds of people, there is always a genuine sense of struggle in each fight, and each encounter is unpredictable, with a constant sense that a fight could break out at almost any moment.The constantly vibrant color palette, the stylized subtitles, and the sense of humor throughout the film also all show that the film isn't taking itself too seriously. It knows that it is over the top, and it realizes the absurdity of the situations, and often makes comedy out of it. It is self aware about the crazy 80's-style action shclockiness; it knows exactly what it is, which is a non-stop, full force, fun action film, with just enough time in between to give context, characters, and motivations that you understand. It is the rare sequel that surpasses its predecessor, and one of the best action films I've seen in ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Come on, it's not a real action movie. It's a first person shooter video game really.","Like the first one, a lot of action but the fight sequence was just OK. Nothing makes sense and it didn't plan to. It's a movie that planned to win you over with style, a comic/graphical novel/video game type of style. Sadly that doesn't work for me. I can see fans of such genre loving it, which explains the high rating.BTW it's slightly better than first one, with a somewhat better story.",,Anonymous,Crime
"All style, no substance, no brains, yet watchable","The fact that this movie has hit the IMDb's Top 250 shows what a joke film ratings have become. Let's be honest as to what this is - it's a wet dream for those into comic book like murder and violence. The story doesn't have to make sense. All that is required is a high body count, enough fast car chases and plenty of over the top weaponry.The plot is pretty simple. Reeves is a former hit man who is retired. The man who is a ghost, unseen when he wants and has a will to survive that surpasses all. No one can stop him. In enters someone powerful who requires him to come out of retirement to make a hit. The problem is that he's dead if he says no and he's dead if he does the hit as he'll become a revenge target.Problem that is not really a spoiler: Now if John Wick can be the Mechanic (Jason Statham) then no one need know Wick did the killing. And even if Wick does assassinate the victim, there is no need to leave a calling card. But this movie wouldn't continue in its plot unless a stupid twist is entered so that a massive shootout can occur and carry the movie to its next set of scenes.I will admit that the film is completely watchable and far better than it could have been. But most of the lines are comic book stupid, the action is so over the top that it's clearly comic book fantasy and the body count goes into ludicrous mode - as does Wick's ability to nurse injuries that would have felled lesser Greek gods.There is zero repeat value for this film. The actors all play their parts well. The sets are all that there are in this film, with very detailed choreographed fights, a stunning end set piece, eye popping saturated colors and imagery during the film and some style points. But this is a brain dead film. Don't say you weren't prepared going in.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great disappointment of a sequel,"Like most of the sequels, this one falls short on almost everything, except violence and body count.I really enjoyed the first movie and honestly didn't expect any sequel at all until I saw its advertising on Facebook. Ever since I saw it I was excited and worried at the same time, since there is literally nothing to tell about in the sequel. I know how modern movie industry likes making money out of thin air and unfortunately I was right.Just like with two Matrix sequels, this one is nothing like a moneymaker, thanks to its successful original movie. I went to watch because of that. No story, no characters, no sense in anything happening on the screen, except happy producers looking to feed us another junk in John Wick: Chapter three, where John will nuke the world.First movie had a very simple story, which made sense. Despite the violence, it gave that weird satisfaction when bad guys were punished for thinking that they are untouchable and can take whatever they want, whenever they want. Similar to the first ""kick ass"" scene in ""Equalizer"" with Denzel Washington. John Wick just had to give them a lesson.The second movie is nothing like it. Story just doesn't hold, Wick's refusal to fulfill his blood oath just doesn't make sense, like the rest of the movie. Too badAction scenes look great, but far from being real. I would say that orcs are more real than John Wick's super suites that reflect EVERYTHING. There is no spoon Neo, it is all Matrix As I understand, there will be a third movie and I will watch it, just to see what they will come up with to make more money.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Blood, Blood And More Blood","I was planned to watch the FDFS from the day they announced the sequel coz i was totally addicted to the Introduction movie of John Wick. I went to the movie with sky high expectations. This time the story revolves around John Wick, who wanted to clear his debt from the past ending that to become a fugitive in the underworld. He had to survive at any cost where the whole assassins are looking for him to claim the bounty.The movie is bloody, gore, violent and absolute treat for the action loving cinema-goers. The story was pretty good, filled with adrenaline pumped action sequences but most of the moves are repeating and was tiring for me. But couple of action scenes were top notch and you can see the brilliance of action choreo turned director Chad Stahelski. The background score added the toppings. The dialogues were good. The camera-work was exceptional and convincing. The VFX did a good part in the action scenes especially with the car chase and action in the beginning. But movie has got the lag in between which will ruin your appetite. Some of the action scenes were illogical, making the hero as immortal and fatigue free.. Keanu Reeves was totally amazing in the movie with his ice cold mannerisms, dialogue delivery and of course, action. Lawrence Fishburne did a cameo and am expecting him in a full role for the next installment. Rest of the crew including the cast from the First installment were there and did a good job.From my point of view, this didn't meet my expectations and falls just behind the first installment.

a feature length fight scene occasionally interrupted by brief dialogue and pigeons,"Lots of great fighting. Not much else. Except there is a dog in it. See it if you want to watch a feature length fight scene occasionally interrupted by brief dialogue and pigeons.So, kind of like Matrix 2. Except with pigeons instead of a sex scene. There's even a bit of reflection on the nature of reality. Sort of. Or else it's a comment on how modern art is a funhouse mirror to real art. And makes a nice sparkly tinkly sound when you shoot it.Also, we get to see the pencil thing. There's really quite a lot of good fighting, with guns, with fists, with knives, and yes, even with a pencil. And did I mention there is great fighting?The plot is very basic and straightforward, but since it's easy to follow and does what it needs to do to move the fighting-- er, I mean to move the story forwards-- that's fine for this kind of movie.It's an almost perfect example of its genre. I took a point off for AGAIN mispronouncing Baba Yaga. Filmmakers, you have had 3 years to think about it, are you sure you don't want to go with saying it how it's spelled? How it's spelled in Cyrillic letters, I mean. You know written Russian is phonetic, right? One letter, one sound, one kill.

Best action-movie in a long time!,"Finally John Wick is back, and it did not disappoint, on the contrary, it impressed me to the point of a standing ovation. The cast and the creators, do the almost impossible. Chapter 2 takes the story, action- choreography, the dialogue and the whole world around John Wick to a new and higher level. I love the etiquette between the people involved, even when they despise each other they still act courteous to each other. The cast is brilliant, and I love the fact that they speak the different dialogues which contain foreign tongues like they should, which is in that particular language and present it subbed. It makes the atmosphere even better and it adds to the production-value and the credibility of the situation at hand. I didn't think it was possible, but they made a masterpiece of a movie. It continues where the first one left off and soars. It's a roller-coaster like no other and it's glorious! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick - Sorry I lost the plot......was there one??????,"We sat and watched an eagerly awaited sequel to a movie that we had both surprisingly enjoyed. It seemed to start well with a predictable car chase. The outcome we guessed otherwise there would have been no point to the movie......and then we realised that there was really no point. And it just went down hill from there. The story seemed to be made up as it went along. There was no dialogue, so not sure why they needed a dialogue coach in the credits, the action reminded me of a video game.....a bad one. And the saving grace of the entire film was the poor dog. And Ian McShane, of course, who just is. We both got very confused as to where all the baddies were coming from. Were they been cloned or replicated. He is John Wick. He is supposed to be the feared Boogeyman and The Ghost aren't they supposed to be scared witless. Which sort of summed up the film really. Witless. I wouldn't give away the ending as to be honest there wasn't one but if they are going to make a Chapter Three they need to keep in mind that he is supposed to be this feared and relentless assassin. And make it two hours shorter.",,Anonymous,Crime
more of the good stuff,"What can you say about John Wick2? Well Wow. I really enjoyed it. Chapter 2 is still slick, dark and gritty. Keanu is still gorgeous, ovviamente, beaten up and the deadliest thing both sides of the Atlantic (this time) and whilst he is bullet proof he's still barely standing; as it's apparently just a few days after the first one finishes. The story is still simple; people want to kill him, he wants to retire and be maudlin over his wife, and pet his new dog, and so he has to stop them by killing them first. Thing is, in JW2, more people need killing – someone from his past calls in a marker (a promised favour).I had been itching to see JW2 since the first one left the cinema, and saw it on a Valentine's Day preview and wasn't disappointed. As sequels go, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the first, but it exceeded expectations by a long way. I loved it. Entertaining and exciting, some amazing kills by Reeves and his physicality again proved to be awesome; but whilst it's as good as the first one it doesn't have the emotional element or the more intimate settings and direct threats to his life. I say direct, I should say the whole film is a direct threat to his life but it's not so personal. Somehow.The body count is like a first person shooter video game. If wall to wall violence isn't your thing, this film isn't for you. Reeves says more, and the scene is changed from NYC to Rome, and there's more story in terms of the ""high table"" underground royalty and the wider net of the Continental Hotel world; the Sommelier (awesome scene with Peter Serafinowitcz) and the Jewish bank vaults, the tailoring service etc as he prepares for his mission, but something of the original's slick noir, graphic novel feel and look is lost. Ian McShane is still wonderful as the Continental NYC ""King"" and Lance Reddick as the Concierge, Charon providing some very dry comic relief, and John Leguizamo puts in a reprise of his actual mechanic character – as opposed to a ""Mechanic"" like John himself. It's less subversive, and whilst watching the first one was like an entrée into a dark world, a clandestine peep, this one feels like it's all in the open and everyone knows about it.The Italian bit is wonderfully showy and reminded me of the Vampire genre, but you have to contemplate how many hit men/women there are in the world that you can have a monarchy, a seeming government and entire community that large – and the Vatican is in on it – and it would appear that the whole population of NYC are trained assassins. It's more of the spectacle than the first and that was a negative for me. It is John Wick on a bigger scale sequels don't usually manage that (Terminator 2 is clearly the stand out exception) but this really does, but as I've said, it's bigger at a cost. It lost something in translation.As said, it's bloodier than the first. Some of the splatter in close up kills in the first were shocking, but in Chapter 2 almost unnoticed in the carnage left in John's wake. At one point in the catacombs of Rome I wondered whether it wasn't all CGI as there were so many bodies being dispatched and you barely saw them and I got a bit bored – the scene went on too long and I started thinking it was all getting a bit silly. But then there are a few kills and scenes which were brilliant – and made audience members exclaim – the pencil scene (yes, he does it again with a pencil), the sumo Japanese guy, and the scene on the NYC metro with Common and the ""professional courtesy"" were very good to watch. Actually all Common and Reeves' fight scenes were very good, and the stunt men used were fantastic (I know Reeves does most of his stunts but I'm sure not for the stair falls).I really enjoyed it. Easily as good as the first but different. Not as good overall, in the same way, but along the same lines. Some may think it better but either way it is very good cinema viewing – it can fill a big screen – and a must see if you like this sort of thing. Direction was good, clever, and trying to capture the artiness of the first, and doing a pretty good job but for me, it was a little too fantastical – stepping over the border from thriller/action to dark-fantasy. As with the first, it doesn't explain anything, you are dropped into the world of Wick and you have to find your own way. It still doesn't explain who he is but there is another shower scene where you see the tattoo hinting at his past. There are even hints to Reeves' career past as well; Laurence Fishburne on set with Reeves for the first time since the Matrix and they exchange a quote from the franchise. I am trying to think whether Reeves and Common (previously in Street Kings) have the same thing ""exigent circumstance"" or something.I will see it again before it leaves the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"As with most things when it comes to modern (unoriginal in plot) films, it's all in the (ahem, straightens tie) execution.","This movie takes a little while to really get started - by this I mean the first half of the movie is going through the motions as far as story goes, with the set-up being that Wick owes one of those 'blood oaths' to a criminal scumbag and, after the guy sets his house on fire (as if he expects a smile to come from Wick with this task), he has him go kill his sister in Italy, who sits on some worldwide-criminal-council thing - but once it does, and it really does about 35/40 minutes in (and even more-so once Wick comes back from Rome to NYC), it's a violent pot of fun.There's not much to intellectualize with this kind of filmmaking - like in the first movie, you get what it advertises, as Reeves kills a lot of people. I think what carries it over from being potentially boring or dreadful is that the execution is excellent. Chad Stahelski, who co-directed the first bone-crunching/guns-firing-knives-stabbing extravaganza, returns as solo director working from what must have been a thin script from Derek Kolstad. By this I mean not just in dialog, though Wick is a decidedly 'talk-less-action-and-looking-listening-more' kind of action anti-hero, but also that the director, who was a stunt-man for years, set out to craft this film completely during the shooting, with some minimal editing. What sets it apart from other action drek is Reeves as a formidable presence (the less he does, too, the better for us all), and how the director and his DP choose to shoot it, favoring comparatively to today long(er) takes and a flow to the action that is kinetic without being overly so.In other words, if you somehow dragged yourself out to Jason Bourne last summer and left with a migraine headache, then this is the opposite of that. Once the action gets to New York, and the villain character fully puts his set-up of Wick into motion (how Wick didn't see it coming is a flaw, but I'll let that go for now on this viewing), everyone is out to get Wick and the intensity comes from all of the staging. I can't stress enough that if you love action direction that has clarity and UMPH to it, this is your kind of movie. Not to mention there's the added bonus of having Laurence Fishburne as some pigeon-cooper type who also has his own underground homeless(!) criminal element going on. I wished there was more of him, as he plays this character with a perverse joy to everything (even how he wears a robe), but hopefully there's more to see in part 3 - and yes, there will be a part 3, I can assure you.The highlight I must mention before I wrap this up: a sequence involving mirrors at a museum. Oh goodness is this spectacular work! Again, there's not exactly ""story"" here, but there is a progression of events and how the characters move in this environment feels less like a rip-off of a, I dunno, Enter the Dragon style climax than a part homage and then partly doing something else (at times the way the director uses color is absorbing too, like out of the best parts of Skyfall). I could watch this sequence over and over for how assured the staging is, how we always know where the characters are or, if we don't, it's not for too long, and how visceral the action is maintained in this setting. I could recommend the movie on this scene alone - that there are other set pieces that come close to its virtuosity makes it almost a must see.To close, I don't want to rate this TOO highly; at the end of the day, John Wick Chapter Two is action junk, a comic book with little on its mind but to get its guns-and-punches audience frothing at the mouth. But it keeps being an intriguing comic-book for adults, and it builds just enough from the first movie's quasi-mythology (once again Ian McShane is the ""manager"" of this hotel that is exclusively for hit men and criminals it would seem). This is a world that is not entirely meant to be in a reality, but creating its own, and that kept me interested despite the familiar beats.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A much better movie than the boycotted ratings gave it as this is not nearly the movie the ratings are giving it since it is nearly a repeat of the first movie. That is too bad. Anyways, it was a good sequel but not as good as the original John Wick. More of an extension and in many ways a repeat of the first some.

"Not quite as good as the first, but still a pleasure to watch.","John Wick was not the kind of film that needed a sequel. He's a retired hit-man, his wife dies, she leaves him a dog, the dog gets killed, he wants revenge. Cool. Simple. Easy.John Wick: Chapter Two begins what feels like maybe a week after the end of the first movie. John is called back into service by a ""marker"" from an old acquaintance, which compels him to do one final job under penalty of death. Reluctantly, he returns to the business once more.Something that is pretty interesting is the world that gets explored a little more than it did in the first. We learn more about this mysterious organisation which accepts and distributes assassination contracts to its members. The markers didn't appear in the first film, and neither did specialist shopkeepers who appear to exist only to equip and cater to these professionals. It also seems to be an almost-socialist operation, as they exchange gold coins for services, regardless of what that service may be. A single coin can get you two drinks or a suite at a hotel. In the first film it buys a man a hotel room and a body-cleanup. It appears that everyone scratches each other's back, and a token is given in exchange for a service. The coins themselves seem to be worth ""one favour"", rather than carrying any intrinsic value.Keanu Reeves does a great job playing Wick, who is a man of few words. He appears to do many of his own stunts and fight- choreography, too, and that was great. Riccardo Scamarcio is believable and enjoyable as Santino D'Antonio (the old friend that calls in Wick's favour), though of course doesn't quite fill the shoes of the last film's Michael Nyqvist (who could?).As action films go, it's also very good. It's more of the same, but in the best possible way, and you have a great time watching the filmmakers come up with lots of exciting new ways to shoot bad guys at close range. There are a couple of regrettable moments where the bad guys decide to attack Wick one at a time, while the others watch and twiddle their thumbs before taking their turn, which felt a little artificial, but for the most part it really is incredible how unrelenting the violence is. It goes on for so long while remaining exciting. After five or six minutes of nonstop action without a break, you still just do not get bored, which I find incredible.Part of this obviously lies in the editing, which is fantastic. At one point Wick is attacked by three assassins in a row, but we watch all three attacks at the same time, cutting between them. It's very well done. What did annoy me (and the first film did this, too) are the film's obnoxious subtitles. Often, one word in a sentence will be a different colour for no good reason. It's pretentious and distracting, and it takes away from the scene.It's a fun film. It's not quite as good as the first, but it was still a pleasure to watch. I would think they'll do at least one more film to bring it to a trilogy, and while I look forward to that, I can't see it improving in quality. The first John Wick didn't need a sequel, and this movie needs one even less.But I do wish we would've seen a wrap-up or pay-off to Cassian's storyline.http://alexfalzon.com/ - for other reviews",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best sequels and most action packed movies I've ever seen,"The first John Wick film was a great surprise. The story was simple and pure, the action and choreography were top notch and the hint at world building was very intriguing. When I heard that a second movie was in the works, I was worried that it would fail to live up to the original (as most movie lovers are). All I can say is that John Wick Chapter 2 is sensational. I watched the first film 3 days before watching the second, and my god was the action in Chapter 2 better than the first. Seeing the actual actor do most of these scenes really makes you believe that this character is real and that he's a force to be reckoned with. I loved the shootout scenes but my favorite are the hand to hand combat he does with higher level assassins like himself. The story isn't as simple as the first, but it really fleshes out the underground world of assassins in this universe. It introduces us to new characters, places and systems to really give us the sense that these are things that go on in secret all over the world. I like to give movies ratings based off what they're trying to achieve. This is an action movie, and as action movies go, John Wick Chapter 2 is one of the best action movies I've ever experienced and a truly worthy sequel to the first.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick is not very good at retiring...,"I was more than surprised and entertained with the 2014 ""John Wick"" movie, and was definitely looking forward to the follow-up.It was a good thing that ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" starts out as a direct continuation of the first movie, and it did serve the movie quite well that director Chad Stahelski opted for that approach.While ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" initially starts out in a fast pace and with lots of action, it does feel to deflate a bit towards the middle of the movie. But it does regain momentum and get back up in a high gear again.The story was good, easy to keep up with and packed with action. Very much similar in those aspects as to the storyline presented in the first movie. Actually, one might raise a question at if the storyline was in fact too simplistic, as it was essentially just about John Wick being forced to kill someone in order to not be killed himself, and when the deed is done he goes on a revenge rampage.The characters in ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" were good enough, however you shouldn't expect a lot of character development or growth, because this is an action movie, pure and simple.It is primarily the action and the fast pace of the movie that keeps the movie afloat and keeps it watchable.

John Wick: Chapter 2,Best Action Film The End Very Exciting Part Three Excited to see New York against John Wick,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The first movie was better,"The first John Wick was a flourishing, surprisingly well done and solid action film which was even better than people'd expected. The main character were cool thanks to great Keanu Reeves. The story was mysterious, asking questions. The film was stylistic in a natural manner and had lots of action, a real gem of a film! This second John Wick tries to explain everything like what is what and who is who? A big mistake! The director tries to deepen the story and enriches his universe by adding some new characters and their stories, but it slows the story down. In other words, it makes the story heavier. The first movie was all about questions, this movie is about intrigues like an episode of a serial TV action. The first film was a sincere letter to action genre, but this second installment feels like a pseudo artistic work. The flashy climactic scene frankly proves that. This movie tries to look ""elegant"", but it falls too short. The action is great at times, but even if it is also an action packed film, it feels like boring if we think about the pace of the first movie. I believe that the best scene of the movie is when John Wick (Keanu Reeves) meets Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and you start to cry! Maybe, John Wick 2 is a more dignified film than the other in some ways, but all those explanations and narrative make it a less entertaining experience, probably because this is an intermediate chapter between the first and the probable third film. By the way, it is sad that Ruby Rose is wasted here. We can never see that expected breaking point happening. We love Keanu Reeves and he is great here again and the action scenes are professional and classy, but the movie is somehow dreary. I hope, in the next chapter, the director can work things out.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Reasons Why John Wick: Chapter 2 is a Rare Kind of Sequel,"The opening to this movie is completely bonkers, brutal, and bash*t crazy. From the opening scene, I can tell you that this is one of the best action scenes of the year already. Everything from the stunts, style, and editing are tremendously well done. If you are an action movie fanboy or fangirl, get out your tissues, baby wipes, or whatever and get ready to clean up, because this action packed opening scene is orgasmic to anyone who is a fan of action films.You can really tell the director Chad Stahelski is truly someone who knows about action films. I actually heard that he was a stunt double on the Keanu Reeves The Matrix film. Therefore, he is someone who knows the art of action. One of my personal biggest problems with action movies today are the stunts and editing. In John Wick: Chapter 2, Reeves looks like he is doing a majority of the stunts. Also, the fight scenes aren't annoying, trendy, and lazy shaky camera work. You can tell what is happening, who is being hit, the location, and how well everything is choreographed. I have not seen action scenes filmed this well since one of my favorite action films, 2014s The Raid 2.Accordingly, the people who are a part of this crime organization are very cool, stylish, and at times I thought would be a cool world to be a part of. These criminals, and assassins, stay hidden in this deep dark crime filled society. So the film does a fantastic job at expanding on this universe. It really is the rule of narrative, where it is showing us and not telling us, which is a key factor in storytelling. Everything in this world unfolds in action, dialogue, and scenes throughout the film.Common (Luv, Barbershop: The Next Cut) and Reeves have the best fight scene in the movie. It looks like it was all done in one take. Amazing scene, and once again Common plays a terrific bad guy.In addition, Ruby Rose (xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter) is slowing starting to become one of my favorite female action stars. I believe she can actually make a career in cinema as a female action star.I know we are talking about a world of death, assassins, and criminals. But one thing I have to discuss is how this is a very diverse movie. We get men, women, different races of people, different cultures, Ruby Rose has proudly come out as a lesbian, and this is the type of cast be should be seeing in 2017 and beyond.Action movie fans will love it. Common and Reeves have the best fight in the movie. In addition, Rose and Reeves have a fight in a hall of mirrors. That reminded me of the movie Enter the Dragon, so there is a lot of throwback sequences to older action films. This world they created is stylish, fun, has mind blowing stunt work, unlike the first film no animals were harmed in the making of the movie, and is everything a sequel should be. Is it better than the first film? I believe they are both equally brilliant. I believe John Wick: Chapter 2 earns a8 out of 10!Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, I hope you all have an amazing day as always, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. :)Review written by - Nile Fortner",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Kick-ass, entertaining and relentless throughout. This is what every sequel should aspire to be.","John Wick Chapter 2 pits Keanu Reeves' titular character against the mean and nefarious of the criminal underworld. Once again, Reeves proves that he is a force to be reckoned with in this ridiculous, over-the-top sequel that is every bit as fun as the original. These types of films are rarely known for their artistic value but John Wick: Chapter 2 sets the bar pretty high, not only in its action, but in it's set design and camera work. This is pure escapist entertainment and couldn't have come at a better time. Those wanting to take a break from watching the Oscar nominees, this film is exactly what you're looking for.The look and feel of the film is very much in line with the first. It is nice, vibrant colors that compliment the violence and chaos. The sound is absolutely amazing with each gun sounding the way they should instead of using the stock machine gun or pistol sound which is something the original was guilty of at times. The performances are awesome, even if Common is rehashing his Run All Night character even down to his wardrobe. And the direction of the action sequences is beyond impressive. This is a bigger John Wick and one that does a nice job at expanding on this guy's world. It really becomes a pulpy and interesting world that I'm sure we'll all enjoy a third time around. The only issue that the film may have depends on your taste in action films. This is considerably longer than the original (almost by 20 minutes) but it moves so fluidly and so frenetic that it barely feels like it.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is one hell of a sequel. It has everything a sequel should have and definitely doesn't disappoint. If you loved the first one then you're probably going to love this one. It is a straight up, balls to the wall thrill ride that is more than worth the price of admission.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
It was a lot of style but,"not much substance. Mind you, it was really well done, but, that doesn't make for a classic. It was like watching one of those video games movies play out in entirety.This kind of action flick was far better done by Michael Mann in Collateral. But, of course, you can't have two Collaterals, another Mendes/Craig James Bond. or Matrix trilogy, for that matter.And, IMO, John Wick is just under those. Almost all action and not much dialogue. At least, Matrix trilogy had some plot twists and a much better soundtrack. And, Wick 2 was far better than Mad Max Fury Road, by the way.Maybe if I were in my teens, I'd be calling this a masterpiece but, in late 40s, I am not anxiously awaiting a sequel which should be even more action and less dialogue, Shrug.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Visually impressive and very well constructed,"I would say I was a moderate fan of the original John Wick film before seeing this one. However, Chapter 2 really took things to the next level. The film is written well enough to set up all of the pieces in play for the action sequences that take place. Fortunately, the film is unpretentious in what it is aiming to do. The biggest strength it has is its director and cinematographer, both capturing so many great visual details and elements that make the film come to life. From a technical standpoint, the film is dazzling and it's just such a huge joy to watch. Highly recommended for action fans.",,Anonymous,Crime
Almost as Good as Its Predecessor,"This film essentially begins where its predecessor ended with the Russian assassin ""John Wick"" (Keanu Reeves) in the process of locating his stolen Ford Mustang which has been transported to a local garage for resell. As it so happens, the owner of this illegal garage is the brother of the crime lord who John killed in the first film. Not realizing the intense sentimental value John has for this car ""Abram Tarasov"" (Peter Stormare) decides to defend his territory rather than simply giving John his car back. Sure enough, John kills everyone who gets in his way and soon enters Abram's office. To Abram's surprise, rather than just killing him then and there, John offers peace. Naturally, Abram accepts immediately and breathes a sigh of relief as John takes his damaged car and leaves. Unfortunately for John, he soon finds out that he cannot retire and live in peace as another crime lord named ""Santino D'Antonio"" (Riccardo Scamarcio) comes to his house and demands that he honor a marker which John previously swore to uphold whenever it was presented. When John refuses Santino has his house destroyed along with several other valuable keepsakes that John treasured. With no other place to stay John goes to the Continental Hotel and once there the owner named ""Winston"" (Ian McShane) reminds John that he cannot turn down Santino's marker. Although he is extremely reluctant, John finally decides to accept the marker and fulfill the job Santino demands of him. However, as Winston later tells Santino, the decision to force John back into the world he truly wants to quit is going to have severe consequences for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fine sequel which managed to combine an interesting plot with a great amount of action. Having said that, even though I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I don't believe it was quite as good as the first movie. Almost-but not quite. Another thing I would like to mention is that while this film certainly set the stage for another installment, I fear that--like so many movies made during this current time--the third film might degenerate into mindless action completely lacking any realism or imagination whatsoever. I suppose time will tell. In any case, I thought this was a pretty good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing Movie,"An ardent fan of Keanu Reeves, I can only say that it is another amazing and a very watchable movie. It contains very few glitches and cliché. I wish I could give all stars!, alas! Here goes the habit. Chad Stahelski and all, not revealing the story line until my friends see this. Watch this in movie theatres for the action scenes to take full effect. Mesmerizing, villainous acts and dialogues, the new movie meets the expectations. To score well in a sequel takes quite courage, skill and experience and the director has shown them all. I would say the first movie was even better, but this one is also good.A must see for action fans, just as well shot and choreographed as the first one.The plot is equally intriguing and frustrating. We get to see more into the underground crime world that exists in this universe, but a lot of rules and character's actions are vague and hard to encrypt.Still if you want to see a lot of people shot, you'll be satisfied.The movie breaks new ground with its stunt team going bigger and better with its action sequences. The world expands well with the help of sleek shots and score. Moreover, it is a good story telling with a cliffhanger ending. If you the man/woman of action film this movie is for you. Just go to theatre and enjoy it- a rush of Adrenalin from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A great continuation for a great character...,"Keanu Reeves returns once again as everyone's favourite out of retirement assassin. The part was made for him and he wears it like a well-tailored suit. Like all good heroes Reeves portrays Wick with equal parts intrepidness and vulnerability . John Wick is a force to be reckoned with but he's not invincible , he can be hurt , and he is often.The gunplay and fight choreography are as good and fresh as they were in the original and continues to set the bar very high for gunplay and fight choreography throughout the movie industry.The 8 instead of 10 star rating rests on one unfortunate element in the film- Ruby Rose.Miss Rose has the acting range of a can of asparagus.

Pimp my franchise...,"Reeves at 52 is the undisputed king of the modern ""man's thriller"" and deservedly so.I recall before the release of Wick 2 catching an interview with Reeves where he assured his many fans that Wick 2 would be even better than Wick 1 because so much time and energy (and money) had gone into the script.And he was sincere.Just as sincere as the many mainstream critics who panned Wick 1 but astonishingly have fallen in love with Wick 2...???????? Because at the end of the day, our society is an upside down society and most everything today from geopolitics to finance to film works backwards.Wick 1 was a great film, the rarest of all things, an unexpected hit. It was a hit because it was pure and simple and the idea of man pining for his lost wife going to war over a car and a dog seemed ... right.Wick 2 is one of the most contrived and over-written scripts I have ever seen. And Reeves was being completely honest when he said that a great deal of effort had gone into this production. Because, once they had a surprise hit on their hands, the producers moved into ""franchise"" mode and set about building an income stream, a brand, on the corpse of the first film -- which had nothing going for it except sincerity, good intentions, and outright class.A film reviewer is supposed to help viewers refine their own tastes and see beyond the obvious.I promise you that in years to come, more people will watch and cherish the first film than this loud and brassy pyrotechnic clone.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I think I would pass on the chance to take out John Wick...,"I did not see the first John Wick until well after it had come out. The trailer just did not do it justice and I was unable to discern what it was about as it almost seemed a sequel to something. However, I would get around to seeing it when quite a number of people told me it was a really good action/revenge film. So, this time around, I was not going to miss my chance to go see the film on the big screen and I am happy to report it is a very cool action film and almost as good as the first. Not quite, mind you, as I do think a lot of the emotional impact from the first is gone, but on the plus side here, you get to delve deeper into this world of crime bosses and assassins that was established in the first film. So as I said it is almost as good as the first, just not quite there. More characters are introduced and there are a number from the first film that make their return to this one as well. The action is frequent and often as you get thrust right into the chaos of Wick's world and through you get to see a number of shootouts, fist fights, knife fights and pencil fights! So yeah, you could say that John Wick is back!The story has John Wick picking up his car to finish up the business he had in the first film. Afterwards, he has officially retired and seems like he will be content living alone with his dog. Unfortunately, peace does not seem to be in his cards as a crime boss named Santino needs Wick to do a job for him. Wick wants to refuse; however, Santino did Wick a favor and now Wick owes him a marker. If he refuses he is dead, if kills Santino he is dead and if he runs he is dead. So he takes on the job after Santino destroys Wick's home to motivate him and Wick is on the job which is to kill Santino's sister! Things kick complicated and soon a lot of assassins are out to kill John Wick and there seems to be little he can do to get out of the predicament other than kill everyone!I like Keanu Reeves, I find him to be an enjoyable actor. I know a lot of people do not care for him, but I like his work. I, myself, cannot stomach Mark Wahlberg so each person has their own tastes. I like that they brought back Ian McShane as his character is very interesting and I like the whole world that they set up in these films. It almost seems like these characters are part of some established world, like a series of graphic novels or something they way that the two films have played out. There is definitely an opening for a third film and I hope it gets made as if it does not, we fans of the two films will really be kept hanging!So, yes, this film was very enjoyable. I think the first one had the more emotional impact as we got to see a terrible thing done to him and him returning to his deadly past, but this one kind of shows you how his job probably was before he decide to settle down and get married. Almost an equal trade off. The movie is definitely a sequel and feels like it is in the flow of the first film. There have been a few sequels in the past that have kind of felt off. A couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head is the two Ghost Rider films, though the second film did not feel off so much as it was like a completely different world all together and the two Thor films. This one had plenty of action and featured a lot of bloodshed. It did do some computer blood, which I wish they did not do as practical effects as far as blood goes looks a lot better. Did not look bad, but you can tell it was computer generated. Overall, though, my complaints are few and far between while my praise is early and often. I also know that if I was an assassin in this world and I saw John Wick as the hit, I would text back, ""No amount of money is enough!""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Why none of these assassins decide to just camp out in a high rise with a high powered rifle is beyond me. The action is still as slick as ever though, and I will give special props to the score of this one over the first.

Sequels Mostly Forgettable,"John Wick (2014) was a very good film, amazingly written story with a direct plot. The sequel on the other hand was generic, dull, and seemed rushed. The body count was extremely high but the fight scenes appeared to be to mechanical. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the role and (Reeves) really polarizes it but this film was really vengeance based. The action points were very strong but extremely repetitious. The hand to hand fight scenes were solid but to much ground work in form of judo.I was solidly impressed with Ruby Rose as the silent assassin working for the antagonist Di San Antonio.

A great movie for those of us frustrated with the political scene,"This movie has pretty much perfected the cinematic kill shot. Keanu goes on a killing spree and every shot seems like it was worked out in detail. You look closely and you would swear he was aiming his weapon exactly as needed to produce the blood and brain splatter so skillfully and repeatedly displayed. It's almost a solo dance he does and he has to be given credit for doing it with the grace and precision of a Fred Astaire.In contrast the first Wick movie seemed a bit tentative though you could see what was intended and feel it was worth attempting. This movie is more complete and fun, and there's no hesitation in execution at all. There's a dreamy sensibility in full bloom aided by Keanu's peculiarly emotionless approach.There's no confusing all this with real violence though it's believable enough. I think those decrying its violence are way off base. All men have at some point wished they could make some certain people be permanently gone. But what would that even look like? Here's the answer produced skillfully and rather uniquely in a style others will have trouble trying to duplicate. But as a prelude to real violence it's about as useful Animal House was to going to college.If, on the other hand, you just want to vent your frustrations, this movie can work better than a punching bag.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Without choice the legendary assassin is forced to embark on one last mission to free his soul, but when he realizes that he will not be left alone he decides to take matters into his own hands.""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a solid, action packed sequel which lives up to the original's potential and builds on it with even more world building and assassin lore. Whilst lacking some of the crazy fun that made the first entry so charming, it still holds to incredible the standards of action and improves on them with an even stronger stylistic voice.What the film has to be praised the most for is the unity of vision that director Chad Stahelski brings to every frame of the film. Be it the lively colors and neon lights or the the breathtaking kinetic pace, it is so wonderful to see an action film stamped with a style that en-chances the story and livens the world. So many times we are treated to generic tropes and flashy visuals that are there for the sake of it. But Stahelski knows his stuff and paints a world that is there for the viewer to be carried away with, making every action beat more relevant because of the inherent interest and fascination this film gives the audience into its underground.There is a lot of montaging and simultaneous cutting going on in the picture and it was one of the most pleasant aspects not to be turned off by it. Sequence after sequence the stakes are always ramping up, the filmmakers here clearly know how to manipulate an audience and take them through a constantly engaging journey. Of course it helps that the action is almost impeccable, every stunt is both perfectly carried out and seamless with the flow. There might be a couple of times in which it bleeds over into overkill, but they are very rare. For the majority the set pieces are highly original, they are flashy in the best way possible and contribute in making the action more alive, by always setting it in a new, surprising environment.One aspect that has to be mentioned is just how beautiful the film looks, the cinematography is just jaw dropping. At one point there is a long take that keeps going and going and it was a joy. The frames are so smartly composed, the use of color in this feature is off the charts, some might call it a little too on the nose, but I found it masterful, the craft that must have gone into making this images look as they do is truly remarkable, even more so when you consider that it is rarely ever unwarranted. It supports the story, it makes it more relevant and gives this sense of rawness and liveliness to the world of crime.I have to admit that this sequel does not quite reach the level of its predecessor. Be it because of a weak finale with revelations right and left that were completely unnecessary and void of any relevance to characters or story. Furthermore, this one does not quite reach the standard of fun and catharsis that was present in the first one, it decides to ramp up the seriousness a little and I think it partially suffers because of it, there isn't the sense of ridiculousness that made the first one so incredibly entertaining.Yet, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" remains a masterful action film that elevates itself above the average and gives us a picture full of suspenseful and savage sequences, with great characters and even better world building.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It contained good comedy and amazing shots (both camera and John Wick's accuracy) that most action movies in the past five years haven't really done. The story this time was captivating and brought a lot of tension throughout. I watched it with almost a full seating capacity at the movies and it bad the movie ten times better. Also, the cameo from Laurence Fishburne worked perfectly as he brought comedy and a little pressure on John Wick. I recommend going with friends to make the movie better, but going by yourself would not change a thing of how great the movie is. I would purchase the trilogy in the future and watch it again in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Silly video game rubbish,"Shoots so many people it becomes ridiculous. It's like a video game where you can't get hurt because you're using cheat codes. Keanu is using God-mode in this movie, and it's boring.I don't get the high rating. The script is terrible, like some teenager wrote it, but struggled to think of lines because the focus is on shooting people point blank.The stunts and fights are just minor variations of the same judo move he does every time. Roll, shoot, roll, shoot. Pours drink.Even the story is bland. There's no capable bad guy, no nothing, just empty pointless rubbish.Keanu has so little to say it's like he's a mute.

"Methodical gun-play, dystopian assassin society, bold colors...Great flick","To kill so many people, if you think about it, is a logistics nightmare. The amount of guns and ammo needed, the skills and timing required, the machine-like efficiency, the sheer luck...John Wick 2 lets us relish in these finer points of killing. Wick picks apart his enemies with such an optimized precision, that you cannot help but applaud the mastery of his ""work."" There are shades of ""Equilibrium"" here, and gun kata, with the optimization of gun fighting being taken to a whole new level, almost as an art. Every move made must be one to put his enemies in position to be shot, preferably in the head. The close quarters combat scenes avoid the standard Hollywood gimmicks such as guns being conveniently kicked out of hands, or fights devolving into two men taking turns punching each other. Wick uses a variety of Judo grappling techniques, and Jiu-Jitsu ground work, to create brief separation from his enemy -- just enough to shoot them in the head. And boy is he good at that...The plot is vaguely about Wick trying to start a new life, but itself is not as interesting as the surreal world that Wick lives in. This is a dystopian society where the tendrils of a high-powered underground community reach into the far sectors of every day life. Janitors, musicians, clerks, even hobos...Just about anyone could be on-call with the secret society. There is a growing implied influence of this Illumanti-esque group which is a pleasure to discover. And at the grand hotel, where the players and assassins spend their nights, there is an odd calm and serenity.Wick's very name strikes morbid fear in everyone who hears it. One of the movie's treats is seeing the reactions of people as they realize they have John Wick coming after them. It's a gift that keeps on giving. It is simply understood, in this world, that John Wick is a death sentence...""Death's very emissary"" one sad soul points out (correctly).I really enjoyed this movie, mainly for the detailed and clinical killing scenes, and for the atmosphere of a fleshed out assassin universe. Wick 2 has a flare of style throughout as well, back dropping operatic violence with eerie music and bold colors. Many striking set- pieces, which by themselves could be contrived, but together pull the whole movie in the art-house direction (a la Drive), which I welcomed gladly.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) A superior continuation,"The first film was full of action, scenes with beautiful choreography and incredible direction, but this one managed to surpass what was already good. The number of deaths is much higher and they are even better. Most of the shooting and fighting scenes are good and exciting. The script remains very simple, but it still works because it doesn't strive to be more than an action movie. This film certainly surpasses the previous one in all aspects and that is very good. Something very good about this film is that it has its own style and you can recognize all the scenes, since the film has its own identity. Just like the previous one, the second film is also just an action movie to pass the time and be impressed with the death scenes and that's why it's so good.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Equally good with the first...,"""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an Action - Thriller movie and the sequel of ""John Wick"", in which we watch him trying to survive after discovering that a large bounty has been put on his life following the events of the first movie.I have to admit that I enjoyed this sequel as much as the first movie, something that I did not expect. The plot was simple but interesting enough to keep you alert through its whole duration, while action and mystery did all the rest. The interpretation of Keanu Reeves who played for one more time as John Wick was exceptional and he made the difference again. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Ian McShane's who played as Winston, Lance Reddick's who played as Charon and Riccardo Scamarcio's who played as Santino D'Antonio.

One hell of a ride,"The original 'John Wick' was such a giant success that it was always going to get a sequel, whether it was pre-planned or not. In fact before 'John Wick: Chapter 2' was even made this was planned to be a trilogy with each movie following on almost immediately from the previous one. So what makes the 'John Wick' movies so great? For me, it's that they've found a very unique and effective style. In a world of very little originality, it's actually very hard to pinpoint a film that is like 'John Wick'. So many actions films today are just trying to be imitations of other successful franchises. 'John Wick' feels like it is very much going in its own direction. I like that fact a lot.'John Wick: Chapter 2' is one hell of an action packed film. It's almost overwhelming at times. In fact it nearly gets to the point where it is a downfall of the movie. You can only shoot so many people before it becomes a little tedious to watch. The action sequences are at their best when they are being creative. There is a lot of that, but it can get a little lost amongst all the constant chaos and killing.The story is very simple when you stop and think about it, however that's probably a strength of the film in a way. It's impossible to get confused because there really is nothing to be confused about. All that leaves is for the audience to sit back and have a good time. And a good time they will have with this film I suspect. As far as straight up action films go, this is about as good as they come today.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I have always liked Keanu Reeves, he has made many of my favorite movies, and I respect the work, effort, and training that he and the other actors, put into the movie. It really shows. Ian McShane in my honest opinion, is one of the finest actors of our age. I always look forward to any part he plays.

John Wicked some A$$,"Keanu Reeves returns in this anticipated sequel. Does it deliver everything that audiences loved about the original but bigger and better? I'd say that's a definite yes. If you're looking for story and depth then this isn't your movie. If you're looking for non stop action and where the body count is too high to keep count, then this is your movie. It was a lot of fun. The movie is gritty but it also knows how to keep things light. Reeves shows no signs of slowing down as he unleashes his arsenal of weaponry and hand to hand combat on anyone who gets in his way. It was also cool to see him and Fishburne share the screen together again. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmsS_UV3TIE",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another success,"John Wick: Chapter Two (2017) -I stand by my statement from the previous film, that Keanu is better when he doesn't speak, and those bits are fantastic. The character actually shines in those moments, because when he does speak, he sounds really dumb. Fortunately he says very little, which is why this one is equally as good as it's predecessor.It is very similar to the first, but I suppose that if it isn't broken, don't try to fix it, but actually it manages to be different enough from the original, without going too far away from the concept and in a clever way that still keeps it interesting and fun too I think.I like the use of the deaf girl, no fuss is made, she just is. That's how diversity should be approached. They don't even have communication problems, because John speaks sign language.The pencil thing is worse than the Joker in '(Batman) The Dark Knight' (2008) and perhaps so much cooler because of the build up to it.Like 'John Wick' (2014) it is really easy to watch this one and it's full of the same high octane action that we enjoyed before. I'm not usually in to violence and abhor boxing, but a well choreographed fight sequence is actually a beautiful thing to watch, like a ballet. This film is full of these cleverly constructed fisticuffs and the simple story that accompanies them makes the whole thing a pleasure to watch.It does score slightly less than the first, because it is a sequel and the concept is no longer as fresh.I hope that we will see more of Ian McShane's character in the next one.

A satisfying 2nd Chapter,"When I saw the first JOHN WICK film, I thought, ""I want take another trip into this Universe and unlock some more of it's secrets"".I am pleased to report that JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 opens up that world in a welcome way, building on the previous film whilst simultaneously refreshing the audience about what in the first film delighted us so much.If you don't know what the charm of the JOHN WICK films are, let me help you - action, interesting settings, Action, good characters, Action, interesting plot developments and Action, ACTION, ACTION!JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 delivers on all these fronts.Let's start with the interesting settings.  While the film brings you back into the secret assassins underworld (through the Commodore Hotel and the wonderfully mysterious and always interesting Lance Reddick as the Concierge), this film opens up the world to bring us into the Italian version of this place.  While the great Ian McShane is the proprietor of the NYC version of the Commodore, Director Chad Stahelski trots out good ol' Franco Nero as the proprietor of the Italian Commodore and the underworld lying beneath.  The audience also gets a hint that there are many of these ""hotels"" throughout the world and the assassins utilizing these services are bound by a code that is harsh to those that break it.As far as interesting characters, any movie would be happy with the interesting characters that the aforementioned McShane, Nero and Reddick bring to the screen, but they are accompanied by John Leguizamo (repeating - albeit briefly - his auto repair maestro from the first film), Peter Stormare (as - what else - a mob boss), Giannia D'Antonio (as the leader of the Italian underground) and Lawrence Fishburne as ""the Bowery King"" (need I say more).I haven't even mentioned the strong turns both Common and the up- and-coming Ruby Rose put forth as fellow assassins gunning (quite literally) for John Wick.And, of course, there is good ol' Keanu Reeves as the titular character.  Stoic, silent, short on words and long on action.  This character fits him like a glove and Keanu flexes this glove over and over again in an enjoyable and winning performance that has the audience rooting for the underdog, anti-hero of this film.But, make no mistake, the real star of this film is the many, many action scenes.  Starting with an assault on a NYC ""chop-shop"" to a fight in the catacombs under Italy to the extremely interesting final battle set in an Art Museum that is showing an exhibit on mirrors (it's as trippy as it sounds), the action comes at you quickly and decisively and so very satisfyingly.  There is so much of it, that there is a danger of becoming numb to it, but Director Stahelski (who also helmed the first JOHN WICK film) smartly pulls back in time to give the action time to settle in before revving it back up again.This film, clearly, is the 2nd film of a trilogy.  The opening scene starts right after the previous film ends and the film finishes with an ending that is greatly open-ended pointing to what one can expect from JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 3.  It will be interesting to revisit this film once the ""trilogy"" concludes to see if the events in this film are enhanced (or forgotten).Go for the action, stay for the stunts, the characters, the settings, the costumes.  It is a feast for the eyes and ears.  It is VERY violent, so not for everyone, but that's okay with me, I was expecting it and was greatly rewarded.Letter Grade A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie,Ruby Rose were the worst actor in this movie!! She dropped 2 stars,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great action and beautifully shot,"There are a couple crazy things about this movie, not the least of which is the fact that Keanu Reeves is FIFTY-TWO! Can I please look that good in a suit when I'm his age? The other thing on my mind is what my top three favorite elements ended up being: lighting, sound, and score. I definitely did not expect any of those to even be on my radar after seeing an action film sequel. Now, you can take that as a slight against the rest of the movie, but I certainly don't. Each scene is beautifully and creatively lit, no matter the location. The sound design is probably the best I've experienced in the genre. And the score is diverse and perfectly paired with the tone of each scene.This follow up expands on the hierarchy and rules set up by the original, with some occasional retread. Laurence Fishburne shares the screen with Keanu once more, but wasn't utilized very well. In his introductory scene he ends up explaining a past encounter that is far more intriguing than anything we see him do. In addition, he's explaining that scenario to the very person that was present at the time, making for some heavy-handed exposition. While I'm not usually a fan of the practice, I think a flashback would have been the better route to go.I'm not usually a fan of Common, but he did better than I expected. I'm still trying to figure out if he was supposed to have an accent, though. There was a deaf and/or mute character that brought something new to the table. It also added to the Rosetta Stone-like ability of John Wick to understand not just multiple spoken languages, but sign-language as well.Overall it was a worthy sequel. It's always a tall order to surpass the original, but this one comes close.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't f$&k with John Wick,"John Wick: Chapter 2 improves over the first one by not having an as ridiculous plot -- instead of killing a bunch of people over his dog, John Wick kills a bunch of people to settle a score.

However, it shat out more of the same video game plot, stormtrooper aim, repetitive action, absurd assassin world building and emo haircuts.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than the first film,"Picking up shortly after the events of the first movie, we see John retrieving his beloved car from Russian mob boss Peter Stormare in an opening sequence that gives James Bond a run for his money. Using nothing but his car and his Kung-Fu, he beats through a countless barrage of thugs. He uses his gun once on a big guy (Raiders of the Lost Ark style!) John seeks to stay retired now he's found his car but he's then forced to take a job by sleazy Italian gangster Santino, which involves him going to Italy. Once Wick suits up and gets he's arsenal of weapons he checks into the Rome branch of The Continental, run by original Django actor Franco Nero.While in Rome, he bumps into old acquaintances, some of them friendly some.. not so friendly. This time around his foes are less generic and feel more different to one another, one of them being a violin player another being played by Ruby Rose (who is deaf and mute in this) He also finally meets his match with a hit man played by rapper turned actor, Common. All of their scenes together are fun; one amusing scene where they take silenced shots at each other in a crowded train station gets a good laugh, and that's just one of many confrontations between the two.The bass has been raised literally since the last film in one sequence that includes a Techno-Rave where John butchers countless henchmen. This is easily the best sequence that tops the nightclub scene from the last film. Like the last film he also takes some nasty hits throughout, he gets stabbed, shot, body slammed the lot! It makes you wonder if he will survive to the end. But just as you think he'll throw in the towel, he pulls off more inventive kill streaks each one more deadlier than the last.Overall it balances it's comedic elements and dark elements very well. However it does get a little goofy at times, one scene involving a Sumo Wrestler is hit and miss and another scene including Lawrence Fishbourne and his crew feels completely unnecessary. Nitpicking aside, if you enjoyed the first film, then chances are you will enjoy Chapter 2 a lot more as it's more of the same but with a bigger budget and more action set pieces. Its very well directed in terms of action and never short on thrills. Keanu is on top form and you can easily see his commitment to the role. From his Matrix days and the last Wick movie. He certainly knows Kung-Fu or in this case Gun-Fu/Car-Fu. He won't be in an Expendables film any time soon as I sense he will be busy making more original action movies and of course more exciting John Wick chapters.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stahelski leaned away from the emotional side, and packed this sequel with even more eye catching, gritty, high intensity action scenes. Some of the action scenes did seem a tad recycled, but it was still done exceptionally well by Keanu Reeves, and the amazing stunt team.Overall, this film may not have been quite the breath of fresh air that the first film was, but it was still a very good sequel, setting up for a great third film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I guess that's why John Wick's name is known by all and feared by most of them.Other than that, I loved the film and can't wait to see what they do with Chapter 3.

John Wick: Chapter 2 review,"I always get nervous for action sequels. They have the tough task of building on top of existing lore without undermining any previous installments. Everything has to be bigger and better, lest the fans become disappointed with the end result. And although expectations were high, I didn't believe Chapter 2 could outdo its predecessor.John Wick: Chapter 2 kicks off as John (Keanu Reeves) is, once again, forced out of retirement because of a blood oath he took with Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio). John must go to Rome and kill Santino's sister, Gianna (Claudia Gerini), so that Santino may claim her seat at the High Table, a group that consists of the criminal elite.For better or worse, Chapter 2 does more world-building than the first John Wick movie. We get more shadowy organizations, underworld factions and powerful figures. The sequel basically doubles down on the neo-noir pulpiness of the first movie. The fact that everyone has a side gig as an assassin tickles my brain in a way that only genre films can.That doesn't cheapen the experience though. Like the first movie, Chapter 2 takes a self-aware approach to its storytelling. There are references to mythology, art and other movies. The film opens with a Buster Keaton film being projected onto the side of a building, almost as though the film is telling us: ""You and I both know this is a movie, so just sit back and enjoy the ride, okay?""With an increase in complexity comes a new roster of characters. Outside of Santino and Gianna, there are three new key characters, including Ares (Ruby Rose), Santino's mute assassin; Cassian (Common), Gianna's bodyguard; and The Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the crime boss with a network of hired goons posing as the homeless.Of the three, Cassian is arguably the most interesting. When he first crosses paths with John, the two have a tense stare down, emulating spaghetti Westerns with their Mexican standoff. The two also encounter each other in the subway, and share the most delightful not-so-hidden shootout I've ever seen.The best part about this movie is the way characters are illustrated through action. Each character is physically embodied through their fight choreography. For instance, Cassian and John are both tall and lean, and they reflect each other's grapple-based combat. Ares is quite a bit shorter than John, and personifies this by being a scrappy fighter. A nameless Japanese assassin, with his chubby frame and massive height, fights John using brute strength, only going down after taking several bullets to the head.Simply put, the action in John Wick: Chapter 2 greatly surpasses the first movie. I didn't think it was possible, but they actually managed to improve the fight scenes. Part of it is in its execution, but part of it is also in the buildup. Director Chad Stahelski lets the tension linger by playing with our anticipation.But the added depth has the unfortunate effect of creating new plot issues. Ambiguous motivations plague Chapter 2 from beginning to end, since many character choices are contingent on the actions of other characters. For instance, the Bowery King chooses to help John simply because he's afraid Santino will start a turf war.There's a question I always ask myself while watching a movie-what do the main characters want? Most movies follow a simple, logical structure. Whether it's a call to adventure or a quest for love, clear character motives are necessary for a coherent story.But in John Wick: Chapter 2, character motives feel like an afterthought to the action, introducing betrayals and plot twists whenever it is convenient for the plot. If you don't believe me, let me ask you this: what is John fighting for?In the first John Wick, John's motive was brain-dead simple. John wants to avenge his dog. Duh. But the sequel loads John's motives with so many vague addendums that it's hard to keep track. He kills people because he owes Santino a favour. Because he's trying to survive. Because he wants revenge. Because of reasons.It's difficult to believe that John, someone Viggo described as a man of sheer willpower, now goes through this movie with such foggy convictions. If anything, the movie shouldn't have bothered letting John return to his old life in the first act. They should've just stepped on the gas from the opening car chase and refuse to stop.For all my minor nitpicks, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a triumph in execution. The setup is a bit long and arduous, but it pays off in spades as we watch the action unfold throughout the rest of the movie. The film is a rollicking rollercoaster ride that is chock full of surprises.Like John's murder-by-pencil, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a movie you have to see to believe.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Yeah, I'm thinking he's back!","""John Wick"" was one of my favorite films of 2014 - a simple revenge movie with no pretensions, expertly directed and choreographed, perfectly cast, and creatively designed (from its seemingly dated and yet entirely appropriate Marilyn Manson soundtrack to its very unique usage of captions during foreign-language dialogue). It was at once a throwback to revenge-based action thrillers of the '70s and a kind of neo-noir genre piece. I loved it.The film didn't do crazy business at the box office, but it had strong weekly holds which indicated positive word of mouth, and it was Lionsgate's third best-selling title of all time on home video (directly behind a Hunger Games movie). The growing reaction was palpable enough to inspire faith in a sequel.And this is where it gets tricky, because ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" looked like a sure-fire dud on paper. Often times movies of this ilk have trouble replicating the successes of their predecessors - opting for a rushed ""been there, done that"" routine - but director Chad Stahelski and co. have wisely built upon some of the mythology inherent in the original film and found a way to make it work, expanding the universe in a way that feels organic. The movie's budget is twice as much as the original's, and yet it's still a fraction of most Marvel blockbusters ($40 mil as per trade reports), and so in tone it feels more grand and sleek without necessarily feeling bloated or carefree. (You'll notice there's very, very little CGI employed in the film.) This is one of those rare, beloved action films - much like the original - where you can see every punch thrown, every kick delivered, without the camera cutting so incessantly that it's unintelligible mayhem. There's a fluidity and art to the carnage here that is quite impressive.A few qualms: I think the story of the first film, as a revenge picture, works much better. It also put us more firmly on John Wick's side, justifying his murders. This man is, after all, a legendary hit-man -- but the first movie showed Wick post-transformation, as we are led to believe that his departed wife helped rescue him from a sinister lifestyle and brought him resolution. The reason he goes on a killing rampage is because a few thugs beat him and kill his dog. The original movie was a revenge flick, and audiences love revenge - enough so that we're willing to ignore the fact that Wick killed fairly innocent henchmen in the process of exacting his retribution.The only serious problem I had with ""Chapter 2"" is that Wick is brought back to the hit-man game (albeit reluctantly) and ends up quite brutally murdering well over 100 people in the process. Yes, these scenes are beautifully choreographed and at times darkly funny. I enjoyed them -- and yet it disturbed me a bit at times to think that these nameless henchmen being massacred by Wick are essentially just doing their jobs, and the scenes are framed in such a way as to suggest they deserve their brutal slaughters. Does it say more about me, as a person, that I'm OK with Wick killing people as revenge for his dog? Perhaps. But it was a bit of an issue I had with the movie, which is that it's much easier to root for the hero's killing when he's on a revenge mission versus just fulfilling a job requirement.The other issue I had is that the film lost a bit of the original's idiosyncratic flair (e.g. the aforementioned Marilyn Manson tunes, and the kind of grungy Gothic vibe -- all that kind of early 2000s throwback stuff is gone, and the movie feels more modern and polished).These are fairly minor qualms. Whatever the movie lost in terms of its soundtrack or tone, or its questionable murder scenes, it certainly made up for in its expansion of the Wickiverse (can we call it that?), with the Continental - briefly glimpsed in the first film - really evolving and becoming a main point of the sequel. They are doing very interesting things with this aspect of the storyline, and the movie ends in such a way as to suggest that Wick's story is far from finished.Count me in for opening day of ""John Wick: Chapter 3.""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ehhh, what the f... happened?","I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering ""What the f... happened?"".Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.One thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one, that it was a no BS, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden ""shops"" for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.In this movie he is forced onto a job by a real a--hole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said a--hole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same sh-t no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more ""permanent"" setback than the other).Worse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some stupid drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.There are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a'la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood's entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is  unbelievable.I did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.Having said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.Overall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Excellently Choreographed, Well Filmed","I don't think I'm saying anything revelatory when I say that the John Wick series isn't about plot. Sure, the universe is compelling and interesting - a pervasive, underground crime community with strict rules and mortal punishment for breaking them - but these movies don't bring a lot to the table in terms of pithy story-line or stunning character portrayal. John Wick is about seeing Keanu Reeves effortlessly walk through one bad guy after another, coming out limping on the other side, bloodied, but ready to keep fighting.I'm happy to say that this movie delivers on that front. The choreography was fantastic, and the relatively wide camera angles and long shots do an excellent job of showing it off.There did come a point for me where the level of violence started to feel excessive. Whether I had reached my personal limit or whether the violence really was over the top, I'll leave up to you.One thing I particularly liked about this movie was the sense that the rest of the world didn't exist. Where other movies get bogged down trying to explain how action heroes manage to exist within the rest of society and avoid the law, John Wick simply ignores the rest of society. It embraces its purpose, and excludes any elements that don't serve the goal of creating really gnarly action sequences. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, and I appreciate that.I didn't like it as much as the first movie, but I highly recommend it. I will happily watch it again when it's available to watch at home, and it wouldn't take much convincing to get me to see it again in theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"For those who expect more than bloody killing, I do not recommend this movie.","Keanu is as wooden as he always is, in addition to his stiff acting there is plenty of chases, plenty of bloody death scenes and ...
well, there is no more.
It can be watched but when you get bored with another bloody death (number 123 or 124) you can easily go to the kitchen and wash the dishes because when you come back after fifteen minutes the action will be in the same place i.e. - another bloody scene.
Summarising the movie is about the band of continuous bloody murders and it becomes boring, terribly boring very soon.
Besides, no one knows exactly why these murders are taking place.
I like brutal movies, but they must have sens, in this movie, there is no sense and logic.
Instead, there is a lot of shooting, killing and cutting off various body parts.
If one is passionate about such things, let's watch.
For those who expect more than this, I do not recommend this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Super Action-packed sequel that succeeds in surpassing the awesomeness of the first movie,"Ever since I watched the first movie, I was totally hooked to the whole concept of an underground assassin world and a legendary assassin(John Wick) who manages to get out but eventually gets drawn back in. The action scenes were something that I had never witnessed before in any movie. I mean they seemed so real. The protagonist would get hurt plenty of times so it wasn't always the bad guys taking the hits. I just couldn't wait for the second installment of the movie.I don't want to give out any spoilers for the second movie. John wick managed to wrap up his problems in the first one and now wants to say bye-bye to the assassin business for good. But his past, which happens even before the first movie, revisits him and he is again forced to come back. What follows is some serious ass-kicking. Car chases, gun fights, close quarter martial combat...you name it. The fight scenes have been given incredible attention to detail. Hats off to the director and stunt coordinators. Apart from the action, the overall charisma of the movie, especially the way John dresses up in lean black suits, the music and the sound, the actors and the dialogues are all a treat.Overall, this movie entertained me like no other and has totally surpassed my expectations. It is a fitting sequel and I can't wait for the third chapter and I know for sure that the third would be better than the second. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a go. 10/10 no question about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ehh,"I loved the first film. Was excited to see the second, and just like i suspected there is a bit too much action again...or should i say even more!??...i like to call over the top and over done movies ""walmart movies""....they only please the people who like to watch the most action packed thing imaginable..with little attention to actual acting or using their brain to watch the movie. Don't get me wrong, great filmaking, great colors..screenshots..stunts..and some good quirky lines...but anything with too much of ANYTHING can ruin the simplest thing. Take a sandwich for instance. Too much meat? Throws it off. Too much lettuce? Hard to keep the thing together. Too much bread or cheese? Things damn dry to eat and you got stuff stuck up in your teeth. Keep all the ingredients minimal with one or two things a little extra and BAM you got a dope sandwich.. What im trying to say is, i love keanu reeves, and the filmmakers did a fantastic job....but please please please make movies like they are suppose to be. Art. Simply put, a classic. These movies could easily be classics, but the over the top neck breaking action that lasts the entire movie is a little too much..it needs some damn suspense!! We need to know if the actor might not make it..not sitting there going oh wait some more dudes half way into the movie hes definitely going to just kill them all.........im not really looking forward to the next one unfortunately. Sorry dudes who made thus film, i couldn't imagine how hard it is to make...but take a little action out and its a new die hard for sure...add more to it and its just going to be too hard of a sandwich to hold onto ;)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Classic badass action hero!,"'JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2014 action hit 'JOHN WICK', starring Keanu Reeves (once again) as the title character. The story revolves around Wick, a retired hit-man, who's once again forced to go back into his former world of violence, when a bounty is placed on his head. The movie is also once again directed by Chad Stahelski, and it's once again written by Derek Kolstad as well. Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Lance Reddick and Bridget Moynahan (briefly) also all reprise their roles from the first film; while Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, Common and Laurence Fishburne (Reeves' former 'MATRIX' trilogy costar) also play supporting roles in this sequel. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and fans alike, and it's also a hit at the Box Office too. I also really enjoyed it (just like I did the first film).The movie begins right where the first one left off, with John Wick (Reeves) tracking down his stolen car, at a chop shop, and getting revenge on those that stole it. He's then approached, at his home, by a crime lord named Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio). The crime boss wants him to assassinate his sister (Claudia Gerini), so he can take her place at a council for crime lords. Wick initially rejects the assignment, but he soon learns that the bloody crime world, which he so desperately wants to leave, won't let him retire.The film is once again nonstop action, and very bloody (and excessively violent) action as well. If you're a fan of the first movie, I'm sure you'll love it; especially if you're a fan of Keanu Reeves. I'm a big fan of Reeves as a person, and I like him as an actor, in certain roles too; but he sucks in a lot of roles as well. John Wick is definitely one of his best parts. The character is becoming a classic badass action hero, and the series is now becoming a classic action movie franchise. I can't wait to see what the third movie brings!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pulse-pounding non-stop action. Exactly what I wanted.,"I have heard many criticisms on 'John Wick: Chapter 2' in the time that it has been out. Most very positive, very few negative. Some criticism I heard was that this is the best action sequel that was seen in all time, that the action in this is unrivaled, or that this is some of the smartest gun-play presented in an action film, ever. Well that was other people, forget them, what about Oberrated? 'John Wick: Chapter 2' brought insane energy and picked up exactly where it left off from the first one. High-octane action, hilariously and purposefully short dialogue, and a plot that is simply fueled off of revenge and survival... The highlight of this film is without a doubt the action choreography that lasts almost quite literally, the entire duration of the film. My friend said himself and put quite well, ""Normally I sit and wait for action scenes to begin but with this, I am sitting here waiting for a dialogue piece to begin."" Yes my friends, there is that much action in this movie and I loved every moment of it... Honestly, there was very little I found a problem with in this film for the sheer fact I knew what I was getting into. It was an entertaining piece of action to be remembered just like the first one.There is nothing much else to say about it. This is a pulse-pounding action film for the ages. I am excited to see how this John Wick series is revered in the future but as for now, check this one out if you love non-stop violent action.-- Oberrated.com --",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Chick Flick for Guys,"This is a love letter to the fans who love action movies done right. Your prayers have been answered. Both John Wick1&2 is equivalent to a chick flick for guys. Beautiful scenery,locations, great action scenes that you can follow along and are not all shaky camera and choppy. The world of John Wick is breathtaking and amazing. You're dragged right back in the opening shot of the first scene. I love the fact that he actually takes time to reload the gun and he gets his butt kicks a lot and still fights. He's not a superhuman like Tom Cruise in MI movies or the Fast and Furious franchise. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The climax of course was seeing Morpheus and Neo reuniting on screen for the first time in nearly 20 years on the rooftop scene. I feel so bad for John wanting a simple life and being forced back into this world. There's one scene in the movie where John shouts that you wanted be back and now I'm back. And I wondered was that John talking to the antagonist or 50 something year old Keanu breaking the fourth wall and talking to us, the audience, for wanting this sequel so bad. And my goodness, Keanu, the writers, the directors, and the studio heard our prayers and created a movie that lived up to the hype of the original and complemented it perfectly. It wasn't too big or too small. It was just right and I think that a lot of times that successful movies sometimes forget the magic formula that made the original so special and overdo it in the second movie.The directors of JW2 did it exactly right. Can't wait until John Wick Chapter 3 is released so that we can give this man some peace. Definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Can't Wait to See Chapter 3,"John Wick is back for more revenge carnage in Chapter 2; no sooner then he finds and firestorms the garage\warehouse\den of thieves holding his prized automobile, another villain and another war breaks out. We find out more about the strange kill or be killed world he (reluctantly) inhabits. This time his dog lives, but about 110-120 bad guys don't. Gun enthusiasts enjoy the skillful way Mr.Reeves handles his gun hardware, and the realistic way his character is forced to change magazines frequently. It was cool to see Mr. Fishburne and Mr.Reeves back together again. I am thinking we'll see more of his character in Chapter 3. I will be looking forward to seeing the final installment of this very exciting movie trilogy.",,Anonymous,Crime
Simultaneously Satisfying and Disappointing,"I find myself simultaneously satisfied and disappointed with Chapter 2. What really stuck out to me, beyond the exquisite fight scenes, of the first movie was it's emotional core. It's unfair to expect Chapter 2 to hold quite as much emotional level, and it didn't, but it didn't really substitute it with anything nearly as good. The film opens with Wick tying up the last loose end from the first movie and returning home, only to be served a mandatory IOU that leads him deeper into the mysterious underworld of assassins and hit men. We see how far this world extends, including a Continental in Rome, and the influence of assassins extending from rich higher-ups all the way down to buskers on the street. It did get to the point where I wondered if there was actually anyone in this fictional universe who wasn't an assassin. But at least they didn't just resort to a re-hash of the first movie (even though that's where I thought it was heading initially).But while the plot was a little unsatisfactory, choosing instead to embrace it's cheesier mythology, the action sequences remain as tight and gritty as ever. One might argue that they're actually a step-up from the first film, that was mired in a limited budget. Chapter 2 having more money to play around with allowed the filmmakers more creativity in their stuntwork. There's a few stand-out moments, including a covert shoot-out across a bridge that passer's-by don't notice, knife fights in what amounts to a hall of mirrors, and even using cars as weapons (although I did wonder how anyone could stand up and fight after the amount of times Wick got run-over). We even get to see how John Wick managed to kill three men in a bar with a pencil.That said, the sheer creativity used in the fight sequences are balanced out by a lot of more mundane stuntwork that drags on a little too long. Pretty much any time Wick and Cassian come head-to-head, their fights go on too long and the admittedly impressive choreography just becomes a blur. Likewise, Wick finds himself battling through endless swathes of goons on multiple occasions. Why all these goons are so stupid and/or inaccurate is beyond me, and they just keep coming and feeding the machine that is whatever weapon Wick is wielding at the time. Even fellow assassins on the street fall victim to just being headshot fodder. Longer and bigger is not always better.Visually though, Chapter 2 is a massive step-up from it's predecessor. The increase in budget also allowed for some simply fantastic cinematography and creative uses of backdrop and setting. Almost every scene is complimented by interesting lighting that gives it an artistic-looking edge, and even composition and framing are used to good effect to create the most visually pleasing imagery. For example, there's a shot of Santino in an art gallery dead centre, with statues either side of him literally framing him in the shot. Mirrors and windows are also used to great effect, with a bright and vibrant array of colours splashed on to them, creating interesting visual effects not too dissimilar to those in Blade Runner and Skyfall. This is the cinematographer of Crimson Peak and Silent Hill at his best.Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard return to score the movie, with the same kind of frantic electro-rock. Every scene is driven by a drum beat, either natural drums or electronic, with dance basslines and the odd distorted guitar providing the musical backbone. Marylin Manson's Killing Strangers, which acted as the first movie's main theme, is absent entirely (much to my disappointment), but Nostalghia provide a good substitute with their odd brand of atmospheric techno, and Le Castle Vania provides another typically clubhouse tune for Chapter 2's own version of the club shootout. Finally a note for the sound department; Chapter 2 is very, very loud, with sharp difference between action volume and dialogue volume. Not sure if it was just my cinema screening, but they had it turned up so loud that the action sequences (most noticeably with the opening car chase) just became a distorted mess. I was starting to think I should've brought earplugs.Even after having written all of that out, I'm still torn on what I actually thought of it. It absolutely did not live up to the sheer excellence and creativity of the first film, but I never really expected it would any way. The fight scenes are exceptionally well choreographed, balancing style with practicality in a way rarely seen before, show signs of originality in how they're presented, and are filmed with such a fantastic eye for photography that every scene is wall-mountable. However a lot of the gunfights and knifefights go on too long, fall back on filler, and the deeper dive into the assassin mythology is more cheesy and OTT than engaging and interesting. I give John Wick: Chapter 2 a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick returns for another ride of visceral action sequences with higher stakes,"If John Wick proved anything upon its release in the fall of 2014, it is not only that the action genre is still far from its deathbed but also that Keanu Reeves still holds his action adrenaline muscle he boasted during his years in the 'Matrix' trilogy. To say the least, it was a hyper-kinetic thrill ride that truly delivered. With Chad Stahelski returning to the director's seat, this film continues this story of the title character with a solid blend of frenetic action sequences and visual style. Similarly to the first film, this one delivers a heavy load of brooding action set pieces that mostly play roles in propelling the plot but nonetheless vend the thrills moviegoers deserve. However, it is Keanu Reeves that stands as the driving force for this action-packed vehicle. While the improvement upon the predecessor is rather thin to spot out, this film nevertheless gets the job done. Reeves reprises the role of John Wick who has shed away his gun, hoping to fully retire from his life as an assassin. However, when he is paid a visit by an Italian mobster Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio) who forcibly extorts him into doing one last mission, Wick is suddenly pulled into a crime underworld where he must travel to Rome to take out crime syndicate D'Antonio's sister (played by Claudia Gerini). He is appointed by the orders of a Continental Hotel owner and crime boss Winston (played by Ian McShane).This film doesn't quite improve upon the previous film beyond its action sequences and maybe a slightly more constructed plot. Overall, director Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves still successfully breath life into this continuation of the predecessor. The stakes are higher, the gunfights are bloodier, and the plot is perhaps on a bigger scale. The film opens with the title character already on the streets mowing down the bad guys, and the scene progresses into an intense car chase sequence punctuated with brutal hand-to-hand combat and countless gunshots to the head. This scene however, only marks the beginning of the lead character's gun-blazing rampage -- and there is quite a lot of it here. The plot takes on a globe-trotting journey to Rome where a good portion of the action sets stone, and from there John Wick comes face-to-face with some ruthless villains. Before too long, what evolves from a wild ""trust no one"" mission turns into a violent, bloody showdown where gunfire fills the screen almost non-stop and tensions are sky high. And shall I mention the amazing cinematography done by Dan Laustsen who captures the striking visual beauty of both the action and the light-soaked environment of the downtown areas. As for the performances, Keanu Reeves is still strong and pulse-pounding as ever in the titular role; especially when showing off his action-charged testosterone. Riccardo Scamarcio does quite well and breaths plenty of life into the antagonist. As for Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, and John Leguizamo who are stranded in more minor roles, they each certainly do their part for better or worse.John Wick: Chapter 2 is an entertaining action thrill ride packed with a hodgepodge of exhilarating action sequences, and striking thrills, and at best makes a worthy sequel for the 2014 surprise hit. It doesn't quite blow the first film out of the water as it stands rather neck-and-neck in terms of quality. But still, there is plenty of entertainment to be handed here. Among the films release in this early (and predictably lackluster) quarter of the year, this one stands out quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

How to Make an Action Movie 101,"John Wick: Chapter 2 follows John Wick after the events of the first movie as he is pulled yet again into the criminal underworld for one last job, held to it by an old debt.This movie is almost non-stop action. It features some of the greatest, most intense fighting scenes I've ever seen, and I had an absolute blast. And yet, the reason why it's such a perfect action movie is because the story and the characters are compelling enough to keep the audience invested in what's happening, thus creating better tension and excitement during these exquisite action scenes. And even more, the movie builds upon the world that the original set up, making it just that much deeper and more interesting.Overall John Wick: Chapter 2 is everything an action movie should be. This is a short review, I know, but there isn't much to talk about in all honesty. It's an action movie where the action really is the best part. It's not a deep, plot-driven drama, nor is it an intelligent science fiction story. It's an action movie, which tends to be judged on a scale all it's own.

John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017),"The highly anticipated sequel to a very popular action film has arrived. John Wick as sort of a sleeper hit that came out of nowhere and really blew a lot of peoples minds. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film but it was a solid action film that was very sleek and really established Keanu Reeves as an action hero. If you have any doubts about his credibility as an action star, you should probably see John Wick: Chapter 2.This time, no one kills John Wick's dog. Thank god. Wick is visited by a gangster who wants Wick to serve him because of a blood oath taken years ago. When Wick refuses, his house gets blown up. Wick then goes out for revenge and must face bounty hunters and a bunch of trained assassins. I'd say the sequel has more going on storywise as it involves much more involving a crime lord and the underside of what it entails. The sequel does a good job of maintaining fantastic, frenetic action with a balanced story and dialogue (or lack of it in Ruby Rose's characters instance).The film doesn't always flow strongly as characters sort of appear without question but this is an action film and you shouldn't worry too much about what makes sense and what doesn't. As you'd expect, the film is very sleek and has eye catching action. The scenes are shot with flashing neon lights and plenty of sick shooting with blood. If this is your sort of thing you will absolutely love it. The car chases and hand to hand combat scenes were fantastic. The whole exchange between Common and Reeves in the subway was just hilarious.My main complaint is that the film is longer this time and sometimes feels its length. Its not such a bad thing. This film is a really solid sequel, I may just prefer the original but its close. The action, blood, and style is really turned up in this edition and you just know we have an action star and franchise in our hands.

"They went with more, not better","John Wick was nice, it was full over board action with a certain style. I have met few people that didn't like it and those who didn't mentioned their indifference to the style and the lack of reality in the plot. So for the sequel, the creators could have gone with making it all more believable, the legend more powerful because of real situations where action validated it. But no, they went with more action, more blood, more stylistic bullcrap and a complete ignorance of the laws of men, physics or biology.Don't get me wrong, it was still entertaining, but it has lost all novelty, the movie's only value remaining the individual fight scenes. And in this one the close up camera that showed Wick killing people that somehow failed to do anything at a distance destroyed that value.Bottom line: John Wick chapter 2 left me with the feeling that there are more assassins in New York than normal people and that somehow Rome is one of its little suburbs.

If you did not really like the first one, trust me just watch john wick 2 because it is just insane. I thought it would be the same as the first one but they really expanded everything and made it a lot deeper. You understand John Wick and why he does what he does. You no longer think he is just a screwed up person who kills for no reason. He actually feels like a normal person. Trust me, this is a great movie because it is so intense and you just feel so much more involved than a normal action movie.

Please use words, graphs, colored charts and anything else at your disposal because I really am a little blindsided by the success of this series. I mean, we are all aware John Wick (2014) and this new sequel are, by and large okay action movies, right? They're the kind of action movies that, more or less, gives genre fans what they expect and is sort of stingy about the rest. This movie is good but is it Die Hard (1988) good? Is it Enter the Dragon (1973) good, is it 91% on Rotten Tomatoes good? I would argue no. The John Wick series is arguably no better than early nineties Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles no matter how many architectural wonders they foist behind Keanu Reeves. The only real difference here is director Chad Stahelski brings a scintilla of visual flare to the party while the plot lugs around suitcases full of world-building ornamentation. If John Wick had one thing going for it, it's that came absolutely out of nowhere. John Wick 2: It Gets Wickier, doesn't have that benefit.And what exactly is John Wick (Reeves) avenging this time? Well, everyone has moved past the dog; especially and including criminal big-wig Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio). Since the assassin has signaled he's no longer retired, D'Antonio calls upon Wick to make good on a blood oath that is enforced by the same nefarious international crime syndicate that also happens to operate the luxury hotel chain from the first flick. Wick is, of course double-crossed, things escalate and the entire criminal underground, only hinted at in the first film are suddenly all out hunting for him.Much like the first film, John Wick 2 is visually impressive and includes some pretty arduous fight sequences, at least from the perspective of the stuntmen. Yet the movie lacks any tension and fails to establish any real stakes. Wick, hereto described as the biggest swinging d**k in all of murderdom, has an incredible reputation as an unstoppable boogeyman. So much so that point blank shots to the gut, stabs to the leg and tumbles out of his car barely faze him. Keanu Reeves is not just portraying a character with uncommon physical abilities; he's basically playing a superhero.He's a superhero that's up against regular, Joe-Shmoe villains, who are put down with a simple double tap to the head. With the exception of Common's loyal guardian and Ruby Rose's deaf henchman, there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot standing in Wick's way. Unless of course you include the inner workings of The Continental whose two rules (honor the blood oath and no killing on company grounds) aren't exactly an advantage. Ian McShane's posh hotel manager Winston returns to give the audience enough insight into The Continental's inner workings; a function that often feels more like a pacing siphon.As said before, the fight sequences are quite impressive and Stahelski does an exquisite job showcasing their physicality. Additionally, Keanu Reeves as a close quarter's brawler does find a handful of moments that force onlookers to erupt in coliseum level cheer. Yet the film lacks any real action set pieces that aren't callbacks to other, better action films, or a remix of the same ingredients used in the first movie. In John Wick, the obvious low budget was enough to overlook the lack of a big blowout finale but here it's obvious they purposely eschewed such a choice. The results are a repetitive sequence of fight, rest, fight, rest, exposition, fight, rest.At a pivotal point, our cocksure villain stands triumphant amid a room full of Grecian statues. This in a nut shell is the kind of almighty status John Wick 2: No Rest for the Wicked is looking to attain. It's knocking on the door of greatness and is asking to join the pantheon of truly awesome high-octane action movies. Some people are inclined to open the gates on this one but I say we should all just turn out the lights and pretend no one is home.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Keanu finds a Franchise,"I was a little amazed at the number of people attending the matinée showing of this film. My excuse for being there was that Hollywood has been releasing garbage this time of year, and this was the first film that showed some interest. Curiosity was the main attraction for me. How would they expand this code of honor among thieves mythology? How would the film expand it's world with a larger budget? Would the film meet it's higher expectations? To some degree this film has a bit of repetition from the first film, revisiting locations from the first film, with characters reiterating events that happened. I got to hand it to Keanu Reeves, his dark persona makes you think he was created from a graphic novel that is larger than life. Yet there are a few quirky moments that makes you think this guy is nuts. There are certain moments of offbeat humour, but I wish there were more. The story itself is a simple revenge story that has no real twists. You know John Wick will do what he says.The action beats are top notch. A fair mix of car chase, martial arts, but primarily a tsunami of bullets. The film seems to take pride in keeping count of how many shots Wick fires per cartridge, as we witness the meticulous routine of changing cartridges throughout each orgy of gunfire. With a visit to Italy, production design has a chance to find new backdrops for our storybook characters. One could believe Nicolas Refn directed this film, with the heavy use of colored lights and lush architecture to enhance the look of our characters. There is not a great deal of subtlety in the story or dialogue, perhaps trying to feel like an old western, where one didn't need more than a few words to spell out their revenge.I applaud what looks like a new franchise for Keanu. It's fun to just let the large set pieces play out, giving the filmmakers an opportunity to show their creativity, as well as competency in pulling off Bond/Bourne level of action sequences. I liked the quirkiness of the first film that is less apparent in the sequel. I like the locations and new characters featured in this film. One might wonder though how much of the fearless barrages against busloads of bad guys Wick can sustain before it gets old. For now, I once again will give the filmmakers kudos for clocking the film in at 2 hours, no over- complicated subplots, no extra twists.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Even worse than the first movie,"Picking up where the first movie left off, John Wick still wants his car back. Also, he now discovers that there is a bounty on his head. Rejoining his former profession, he heads to Rome to complete an assassination assignment.The first John Wick was quite disappointing. It started well, with a good build up and backstory. After a while, however, it lost any pretence of character-development, plot- development or intrigue and just becomes a simple action movie. This was unfortunate, as it had some potential in the crime-drama stakes.Even worse, it was action of the perfectly choreographed, first person shooter, high body count, explosions-for-the-sake-of-explosions variety. It got rather monotonous and predictable after a while. I gave it a 5/10.John Wick Chapter 2 dispenses with the luxury of character depth or a plot, or even pretending to have them, and gets straight to the action scenes. They just come in waves. If three minutes have gone by and nothing has exploded, or shots have been fired, or cars chased or someone performed a martial arts move, you know a scene involving at least one of the aforementioned one is due, and it's going to go on and on.Quite mindless, unoriginal, monotonous and boring.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Of course Reeves can't act, but he sure can kick butt.","""John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will.""Viggo TarasovYou might say so because infamous hit man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) must have sheer will to splatter the screen with more bodies than can be counted in one sitting of John Wick: Chapter 2. The quick editing and scene design are focused, alright, on pleasing the eye while titillating that part of the brain that ferrets out the unreal. Surreal it is; substantial it is not.Director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad are committed to entertaining and not overtaxing the brain with anything resembling reality. What's real is that Wick is back from retirement to honor a marker, and that puts everyone on edge while some of them delight to think of the mayhem he will unleash.Because Reeves cannot possibly save a film with even adequate acting, the filmmakers have rightly chosen a gaggle of good character actors such as Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and Franco Nero to name only a few. Additionally, Kolstadt has some witty setups and lines, alas too often centering on Reeves, whose acting chops don't exist. In other words, he kills lines along with lives.Now and then an actor and lines save the film, not often enough: ""Have you thought this through? I mean, chewed down to the bone? You got out once. You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond... you may well find something reaches out... and drags you back into its depths."" Winston (Ian McShane)For pure action fans, John Wick: Chapter 2 is not a boring sitting, and as my fellow critic and I watched, we laughed heartily at the absurdity of violence and deadening of nuance. There is a good time for all whether laughing at the outrageous plot or the ineptitude of acting.""I'd like to make a dinner reservation for 12."" John Wick",,Anonymous,Crime
"Lots of Action, Not Much Substance","I really enjoyed the first John Wick. It was stylish, lots of action, and had an anti-hero you could root for. The character was depressed, heart sick over the loss of his wife, and just not interested in being an assassin any longer. Then thugs mess with him and he goes on a rampage.Chapter 2 takes up right from the end of the first movie. He wants his car back. Then he tries to retire again, but fate won't let him. So, again he goes on a killing rampage. Its the same as the first movie, just less plot development and a lot more bad guys to kill repetitively. The main villain was lame and the mute bodyguard was underdeveloped. The inclusion of Laurence Fishbourne was a bit of a stunt, I guess to give a wink to the Matrix movies. His character is pointless and doesn't have much to do.Still, Chapter 2, has its moments. The fight scenes are well staged. The car chases were kind of lame, but some of the stunts within those chases were exhilarating. Common as a fellow assassin is a nice counterpoint to Wick. Their scenes crackled with charisma. Hopefully he returns for Chapter 3. Likewise, Iam McShane as the Continental Manager is fun to watch as he directs traffic at his establishment. The fights and stunts, as I said, are fantastic and well choreographed.The first movie was long on action, so this one should have dialed it back a bit and set up character development for the last movie in the trilogy. Unfortunately, it was just a lot of people getting shot in the head.I still enjoyed the movie and its running time, while a bit long at 125 minutes, didn't feel too long. Hopefully, in Chapter 3 the stunts will be used to enhance the plot rather than cover up for the lack of one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stahelski took the style of the first one and boosted it up to 100%,"John Wick:Chapter 2 is a sequel to a 2014 movie John Wick which stars Keanu Reeves as a titular assassin who tries to live a normal life, but his past comes back to haunt him.The first one was a big surprise for me, I loved it. The plot was simple, but it worked. But the style is what made the movie. It was the most comic-booky movie that year that wasn't even based on a comic book. It's the same case here. The plot isn't much, actually it was even better in the first one, but the style is what makes this movie stand out. I tend to be very forgiving on style over substance, but it's not like there's no substance at all. The story is in it's place (except for one surprise cameo of a certain actor I'm not gonna mention since it's a bit spoilerish, but it feels kinda shoehorned in) and it gives us more. It shows us more of this world in a more detailed way. Something every sequel should do. But again this movie isn't so praised for its substance. It's praised for its style. And it has every right to be. What you saw in the first one (especially the club scene from the first one) was just a taste of what you will see in this one.This is a perfect example of what a great sequel should be.

The reason that I've found both enjoyable is because they are very similar. In fact, I would say that everything the first movie got right, this movie also got right, just to a slightly lesser extent because the ""wow"" factor that came with the first one has worn off a bit. The narrative in the first was more compelling than the sequel but this story was still interesting. I really like how the odds against John keep multiplying but he could not care less (as is perfectly portrayed by the monotonous Keanu Reeves).

John Wick: Chapter 2 Movie Review,"The beautiful thing in this movie is the concept of an organization that exists in a world and John Wick was once a part of that world and organization and now he is no more a part of this world. But some bad events forced him to join that world again & he is back now in Chapter 2.It's a Modern-Day Mobster movie. You have to see the Continental hotel, laws, coins, politics black business, and John Wick's relationship with this world. That concept of underworld business is created beautifully in this movie.John Wick's movie has 2 hours of run time where most of the background politics has been shown which gives an individual uniqueness and identity to this movie. John Wick Chapter 2 movie is a Modern-Day Western movie. The locations and guitar music shown belongs to Western culture.Cast:Mostly you would see the old cast of John Wick's first movie including Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and John Leguizamo they all beautifully performed their characters.John Wick's Motivation:Talking about John Wick's Motivation. In the first John Wick movie, his motivation was very clear and streamlined. It was an emotional motivation that brought him back into action.In chapter 2 movie he is being forced to come back in action which gives a purpose to this story. John Wick is inside fighting a conflict with himself. He doesn't want to do what he does best but he is being forced to come back to his world. He is shown as a strong and silent kind of person. That's the motivation of his character which is written in a best way.Action Sequence:The Action Sequence of this movie was amazing. Action scenes, Stunts, Filming of every action scene, the Choreography of Fight scenes, and when you get to know that 95% of stunts are done by John Wick himself so you will become a fan of this movie. All over action is on another level.John Wick's Action Style:When Keanu Reeves fights it feels like he is creating a dance consisting of punches and gun-fu. The modern action star who is brutal and beautiful at the same time it's only Keanu Reeves and no one else.Best Fight Scenes:All over action scenes are best, especially the one that was created in a mirror hall. It was beautifully choreographed and the other best scene is in the open hall of John Wick. The way he fights & uses a gun it's a professional way of fighting and obviously, he did a lot of training for this movie & hard work always works.John Wick Famous Flip:One beautiful thing that I noticed in this movie is the famous flip of John Wick. During the fight he locked an opponent between legs & he repeated that flip so many times. It reminds me of Black Widow from Captain America: Winter Soldier. She did it a lot and it shows how Keanu Reeves uniquely blends both the masculine and feminine traits.In John Wick all movies nobody is hanging from a helicopter, no one is jumping from one rooftop onto another rooftop, nobody is flying through the air at full speed. You would see the pure camera work and pure ground stunts in John Wick Movies. There is the best hand to hand and gun-fu combat and all the ground fight you would see on a very low budget. That's the thing I like the most in his movies.John Wick Chapter 2 Ending:The ending of the John Wick Chapter 2 movie was amazing giving us a close hint for the John Wick Chapter 3 movie. The black business & the way of sending message about John Wick to the whole world was a best concept.I would suggest you watch that movie. It's the best action movie ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fast and violent fun,"'John Wick: Chapter 2' is a sequel I didn't think they were going to make, but it is actually better than the first, if only because they now know what to do more and less of. It starts directly after the first film, but Wick (Reeves) now has a new dog. The initial car chase scene in New York is a pretty great way to start the film. Wick's still the same - brooding, wearing a suit, saying maybe 100 words in the whole 2 hours and killing people left, right and centre.The plot, as much as there is one, is that Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio) - some Italian mafia guy - wants Wick to kill his sister, so he's off to Rome to mess stuff up. This starts a long-running battle with fellow hitman Cassian (Common), which has some funny moments and some good fights.I liked that there's a sort of 'Kingsman'-like global hitmen underground, but it does seem a little far-fetched most of the time, especially since there's apparently hundreds of them! The film definitely needed to use Fishburne, McShane and Leguizamo more. But Reeves carries it, running around and killing at least 50 bad guys. The scene at the end in the museum is really well done too. Nothing new or exceptional, but well-made.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

John Wick was no different. I thoroughly enjoyed the first one so of course I wanted to see the second yet was prepared for a massive letdown as well.John Wick Chapter 2 did not disappoint. Keanu Reeves still can't act (I mean he really can't act) but even he couldn't kill John Wick. We got the same dynamic gun play, skillful knife fights and plenty of UFC style groundwork. But, what I particularly enjoyed about John Wick was the method in which they brought him back into the game.The writers were very creative and clever with the story, which was a huge relief. Sometimes, in effort to get to the action, we get a rushed and poorly thought out plot just to get to what the production team thinks we want to see anyway--the action. Yes, it's true that we want to see the shooting, fighting and other mayhem, but some of us would rather there be a viable (or at least plausible) reason for the action. JW Chapter 2 gave us a more than acceptable reason for bringing John Wick back into the world of assassinations and vengeance.Along with the exciting gun play we were treated to more exposure to the well developed and sophisticated machinations of the criminal underworld.

Very unlikely! Exception: There is one neighborhood cop who shows up once in each movie (""Officer Jimmy""), but he must be on loan from the Mayberry Police Department, because he just greets John Wick, then goes on his way.Second, sure, Wick is a super tough guy, but no human being can get hit by cars, smacked over the head with a pipe, stabbed, shot, beat up... and then run a mile or more non-stop. It pushes the believability meter a bit too far.A third issue is the lack of a personal relationship. Yes, there is the dead wife, who appeared on his smartphone in a video in the first couple of films, and then in a snapshot photo in Parabellum (3). And, Wick is known by a lot of people, from the auto repair guy to the manager of The Continental. But there is no relationship, no romance, no buddies, Wick is a total loner. Oh, except for the dog with no name.And my fourth and final gripe is, how many hit men are there in the world? Wick encounters them two dozen at a time, no matter where he goes. The body count between all of the films must be 100 or more. Too many!Now to the good parts. The Mustang! Not since Bullitt has a Mustang been more featured in an action movie. Yes, there was ""Eleanor"" the Mustang in Gone in 60 seconds, but meh to that movie. Wick's car is the classic 69 Boss Mustang (it is claimed to be a Mach 1, but take a closer look, it is a Boss).Another plus - you would think that by Part 3, the writers would be running out of material. Nope... let's have two motorcycles chasing Wick, as he gallops away on a horse in downtown NYC traffic.As I said at the beginning of my review, if you want action, car chases, gunfire, lots of dead bad guys, high-class establishments and unique characters, ""John Wick"" is hard to beat!* * * * * * 6 Stars for John Wick Chapter 2 * * * * * *Florida Fred..",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
What's the point of this movie?,"The first John Wick came out of nowhere and i quite enjoyed it for what it was. It had a pretty great neon style and a unique way of portraying the world of a community of assassins. So i didn't have high expectations for the second part, but was nevertheless curious where they would take the story next.Sadly there isn't much of a story and the self-aware, ironic tone of the first one is also absent. Only in the first few scenes it's shining through. From there on it's pretty much John Wick shooting it's way among Rome and New York. Some Plotpoints are even ridiculous (Watch out for the doves and microchips).Okay, i hear many of you saying, it's an action movie, what are you expecting. So to my next point. The only action you get in this movie is Keanu Reeves shooting guys in the head and sometimes into the foot. After the sixth or seventh dude sneaking around a corner and getting a head shot, everything kinda blurred out for me.Although, there are two positive things to mention about this movie. Firstly, Keanu Reeves is really enjoying himself in this role and you can see that he put some effort into it. And secondly, the neon style of the first movie was translated into this movie and there were some cool settings.Overall, this movie is fine for a boring Sunday afternoon and some time to kill. But if you like something special or even a kind of story, keep away from this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Maybe my favorite movie EVER.,"I'm 47. (at the time when writing this review)
And I'm a film/series buff - BUT a picky one.
If something (be it movies/shows/books) doesn't grab me straight off - I just move on to something else. Life is too short to be bothered with slow/boring stuff in my opinion although there ARE good slow stuff too, like incredibly enough I quite like the bbc show Vera (u may disagree) and the excellent Shetland and also Hinterland all of which I love. But I think there are loads of bad AND boring but also STUPID stuff being made today in 2019. Slow/boring/stupid is different for everyone I imagine. Anyhoo.
I have watched John Wick 2 like 4 times since it came out. And it just blows me away every time I see it. OF COURSE its cheesy and exaggerated and BLISSFULLY unrealistic. But its beautifully made. And the action is pumping, AND - INTERESTING - dont know why - it just is. The people making this movie just knows their stuff. Keanu is PERFECT in the role. MANY times have I thaught in recent films that THAT guy/gal is wrongly cast for a role.. example: Miss Peregrine & her home for peculiar children. Samuel L Jackson as the villain ?? That just almost killed that film for me (not to mention him as Nick Fury ?? - I have read marvel comics since I was a toddler....fyi - Nick Fury was a white guy) - oh that and the music when they fight the pirates... omg. Apart from these two flaws that movie was magical and awesome. Love almost all Tim Burton films.
Anyway - I,m getting sidetracked. sorry. John Wick2 is like a really cool adventure - just a guy - getting into stuff and killing people. And the assassin-hotel thing is just COOL. The ending of the movie ?? In my humble opinion the most perfect ending EVER. A film I will enjoy from time to time - and thats AWESOME, because this IS a film one can watch over and over again, and THAT is a cool thing indeed. Love it !",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Epic cinema and gorgeous cinematography,"One of the most epic scene choreographies I've seen. Everything is so on point in the direction. This is elevated by the beautiful cinematography and the scene direction that's telling a story through thrilling visuals. I haven't seen cinematic battles with such great choreography before. I was at the edge of my seat. Keanu Reeves' ""John Wick"" is now forever an iconic conematic character! I really can't wait to see where his story goes. There's something very satisfying when a character is build up through dialogue from other characters, where they describe his badassery and his achievements, and then finally you get to see that in action. That's cinema! ""John Wick - Chapter 2"" is ages away from the first installment and I'm not really sure they can achieve greatness at this level with their next entry in the franchise.

WITH A PENCIL...,"Theres an undeniable charm with John Wick. It could be the slick action, dialogue surrounding the character or the futuristic world in which it is set. And so, despite being disappointed with the first movie I couldn't resist watching the 2nd. Fortunately the 2nd movie delivers on the action with a semi interesting plot which makes the viewing overall enjoyable.
Despite this there are some lazy action scenes and strange elements to the plot. However I'm game for more John Wick. Awesome action. It also made me appreciate why shaky cam exists",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is a classic,"Okay this is not your regular kind of action flick with a thick plot and so on.
This is a flashy noir over the top bloody action movie. It's escapism centered in the mob world. I have to admit I was very irritated at first and I did fast forward through some action scenes. But I think this franchise reminds me of Ghost in the Shell in the sense that they are not trying to be like any movie out there, they are their own.
Don't compare this to other movies and just go with the flow and you will appreciate what the movie is aiming at. Love Keeanu always!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One man army.,"Absolute phenomenal sequel to the first John Wick, I really enjoyed the action in this movie although there is a story to these movies, I do believe that the action takes the front of these movies and is incredible. The movie continues from the first one and Keanu Reeves really takes control of lead the same as the first one and really shows how much of a badass he is and seems like this unstoppable force who will not quit when he sets his sights on his target. It feels like John Wick is a one man army and has endurance to take on and defeat anything that's in his path. This movie was an incredible sequel and would definitely recommend to anyone who hasn't started this franchise yet to start it you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stupid movie,"I always like the main actor but the spelling of his escapes me. I have never seen such bad editing,such bad directing and such a bad script. Script? There is no script it is just flash scenes staring with the 1970's chase scenes with a mustang and then then killing scenes which have nothing to do with any plot. Speaking of plot what is the plot in this movie? I could only watch one hour of this movie as it is just a fast scene after another fast scene with no dialogue and no plot just fake action. How others rated it so high is beyond my understanding. If you have no brain and just get high from watching changing scenes and people being killed you will like this movie, If you actually have a brain and want content forget this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
The squel that we all wanted,"I didn't know what to expect from its second part but it still amazed me a lot and Keanu Reeves as John Wick has done a fantastic job to deliver great performance . Supporting charchers has also done a great job too.I need to say that this squel has better story than the last one with some nice twist and turns . This time they have given lot more play ground to prove what John Wick is capable of doing.Two major improvements has done over its prequel that no animals were harmed during the making of this film and the number of body counts is tremendous than the last one.Again the one thing i like the most about the film is its style and action sequences that looks brtual , intense and realistic involving mostly gun fights .
The fighting choreography is done very well becoz it is not very choppy like in other films it is shown in a continuous tone.
And i think this movie has one of the best fight sequences of hollywood at its best becoz the whole movie is packed with fight sequences.Overall a great movie to watch with lot of popcorns",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017),"Keanu Reeves delivers another electrifying portrayal
in his second outing as the legendary hitman, John Wick. Opening with a bombastic driving sequence that is bound to please fans of the action genre. John Wick seeks to reclaim a cherished possession and then put his former life to rest as he was merely visiting the underworld to accomplish everything he needed to do to avenge his loved ones. But actions do not come without repercussions as he is once again forced out of retirement into the life that he desperately seeks to put to rest due to the re-emergence of a blood debt that must be paid. This has to be my favorite chapter out of the trilogy since the world-building is vastly larger and expanded upon with Continentals existing in other countries outside of New York. John Wick receives an upgrade with new body army and an arsenal of weaponry from his associates. Providing the viewer with insight on how members of the fold protect themselves at all times. The stunt choreography with expertly guided action sequences by stunt coordinator J. J. Perry and director Chad Stahelski is simply eye-opening and the best that I have seen in a franchise. Especially when the assassin's world famous pencil trick is finally revealed to the audience. The reunion between Reeves
and Fishburne, who are common enemies in this feature are accompanied with a back-and-forth exchange that is both amusing and entertaining as the duo last worked with each other on the Matrix trilogy. The stakes in the sequel have increased tremendously with our titular character being double-crossed and hunted by various hitmen on the streets of New York City. The venture concludes with an unforgettable sequence of iconic dialogue spewed
from Mr. Wick. Declaring himself as a one man army
who will tear anyone down that stumbles his path. With an unforeseen future that leads right to the next film. Audiences garner much anticipation for what is to come.IG: thecinephilereviews.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick:Chapter 2 Review,"I honestly think I am the only person who thinks this one is not as good as the first one. But I am not saying that it is a bad movie. And I will tell you why that is. Let's get to it.Synopsis: After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life. Starring: Keanu Reeves Director: Chad StahelskiThe thing is the reason the first one was so good is because the directors didn't use the modern tropes that action movies have become synonymous with. This time around that changed. There were close up shots and shaky cams during a few of the hand to hand combat scenes. And that hurt the movie. Quite a bit in my opinion.The story is a good one, just like the first movie. John came out of retirement for vengeance only for someone to say that John still owes him a favor. When John refuses he is attacked and has no choice but to take up arms again.Keanu proves once again that he can still do action with the younger crowd. The two fight scenes he had with Common were good (see my previous statement as to why I don't think they were great). And the way he moved with the weapons, any military man/woman will tell you that it was flawless. It really seemed he put his heart into this movie.The last complaint I have about this movie, and it's just a bit of nitpicking on my part, is that the movie could have ended about ten minutes earlier than it did. They could have saved the end of the movie for the beginning of the third movie. It seemed like they did that with the first one and this one. And honestly, I think that would have helped both movies in the long run.The last thing of note, and I'm not complaining about this part, it's just really funny. The henchmen in this movie must get their training at the Stormtrooper Military Basic or James Bond Villain Henchmen Academy because they couldn't shoot. The only time John Wick missed was when he was facing Common, any other time he was right on. He was the only one in the entire movie who was.Still though, the movie is a good movie. The two things I mentioned that I didn't like are miniscule to the bigger picture of the movie. The acting, the writing, the dialog, the action, the lighting, even the music all played well together.So, I ask: Why haven't you seen this yet? Shame on you.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not bad,"""John Wick: Chapter 2"" kicks into high gear with its relentless action sequences and Keanu Reeves's charismatic performance, creating an adrenaline-fueled experience. The film editing maintains a brisk pace, ensuring that the audience is constantly immersed in the world of intense gunfights and stylish choreography. While the music amplifies the film's energy, it may not linger in memory. The film's strength lies in its unapologetic commitment to action, offering a visceral spectacle for fans of the genre. However, the weakness emerges in a somewhat convoluted plot that struggles to match the intensity of its action scenes. The cinematography captures the gritty and visually striking landscapes, providing a dynamic backdrop for the unfolding chaos. With a 6/10 rating, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" delivers on its promise of thrilling action, even if the narrative occasionally gets lost in the crossfire.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stiff old man slaughter-fest,"A non existing story line, Bad acting, stiff fighting scenes for two hours. Yes this movie got it all. I saw the original John Wick and thought it was pretty brain-dead but this takes it up a notch, your intelligence needs to be below 80 to truly enjoy this movie. This is for dumb teenagers who needs bad cgi to like a movie. This movie is for people who had a hard time understanding Fast and the Furious movies. People who thought that story line was too hard to follow. Hollywood has actually managed to dumb down a movie to a new record low. If it's violence you want why don't you just surf clips on YouTube instead? John Wick 2 has a a story line that remind me of a porno without the nudity. It' just people flying in the air in different positions.Keanu Reaves is one of Hollywood's worst actors, he had some success with Speed and The Matrix movies but the guy is really one of the worst actors of our time and it is all on display here, the dry dumbed down one liners and people flying and being shot in the face one after another.Why should one care about this movie? It's total brain dead and highly meaningless action. This might be the worst movie I've seen in years, despite having an insanely high rating here on IMDb.The highlight of the movie is actually John Wick's dog, the best actor in the whole movie unfortunately. The acting is terrible and there is no progression of the characters. They are all dumb murderers and even if John Wick faces tons of hired killers in this movie, he kills them one after another while the viewer tries not to fall asleep.The worst movie I've seen since Godzilla.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

The fight scenes are insanely great choreographed, brilliant script and dialogue, and great acting skills from Keanu Reeves and Ian McShane. This sequel showed many assassins from the shadow organization John Wick used to work for; they blend in among the citizens, living in our world.

"Very enjoyable, but in slight danger of becoming stale","John Wick: Chapter 2 continues on the strengths of it's predecessor: interesting cast of characters, visuals, intricate action/fight choreography & blasting soundtrack.This time around although most of the cast give good performances, Keanu Reeves was a bit wooden this time around. No idea if it's the direction, Keanu's approach to the role or the script's dialog, just something that struck me slightly & maybe a detail that needs to be looked into.Staleness is also on the edge of flowing into this new world of assassins as seeing John Wick go through hordes of disposable bad guys starts to feel tired already. Surprising as the action started out quite inventive, but seemed to run out of steam by the final act.

The second episode, for the most part, does not depart from those features.One welcome difference is that the story moves to Rome, upping the architectural beauty.But the second film mostly feels like a setup for the third. And Wick actually violates some of the codes that made the first film so interesting. Now we cannot see Wick as a moral agent with uncompromising values. It takes some of the shine off our hero's armor. Hopefully, there is some redemption in chapter 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Sequel That Stands Up To The Original,"John Wick Chapter 2 follows directly on from the first film and finds John Wick being dragged back into the criminal underworld to repay a blood debt. Again starring Keanu Reeves, Ian McShane and now being joined by Laurence Fishburne John Wick Chapter 2 delivers as much action as the first film. The running time on John Wick 2 is longer at 2 hours and this actually allows the film to expand on backstory and characterisation allowing the audience to find out more about this secret underworld. Reeves is as good as he was in the first film and McShane once again shines. The music is still as bad as the first film but this doesn't distract too much from the fight scenes.

More brutal!,"The second part of the John Wick series picks up just a few days after the first part, in which John Wick took revenge for his wife and his dog.This time, however, it's not about revenge, but about redeeming a debt he still owes to mobster Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio).Keanu Reeves is supposed to kill his sister because he envies her seat in the high chamber.After a few unexpected twists and turns, John Wick has to take on many contract killers again and the bloody battle against all of them begins once more.John Wick: Chapter 2 goes one better than its predecessor in terms of creativity and the depiction of violence.The action scenes are once again impressively well choreographed, which is of course due to the immense preparation of Keanu Reeves and Common, for example.The duel between the two particularly impressed me and left a positive impression.The sequel is around 20 minutes longer, which is particularly noticeable in the second third, where the movie loses a bit of its intensity.The writing can also be overlooked, as the subdued atmosphere and the fictional, stylistically interesting world of the Continental Hotel exude an aura that is second to none.Michael Nyqvist's performance in the predecessor made him a solid villain.This can only be repeated to a limited extent by Riccardo Scamarcio and Common in the sequel.Ruby Rose, who appears as the female counterpart, is also largely only convincing in choreography.The 2017 action film can be celebrated as a successful sequel, in which intense, sometimes truly brutal moments crown the film.7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Keanu kills everyone. Again.,"I love me a bit of the old ultra-violence, but I also like a plot of some kind to go with all of the gunfire, blood and broken bones. Failing that, the gory mayhem had better be something special - something that breaks new ground in terms of action cinema. John Wick Chapter 2 is relentlessly violent, Keanu Reeves' eponymous hitman laying waste to almost everyone he crosses paths with, once again finishing most victims with a shot to the head, but the action is simply more of the same, director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table.This sequel sees Wick being forced out of retirement to honour a 'marker', criminal Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) calling upon the quasi-mythical hitman to repay his debt by assassinating his sister Gianna D'Antonio. Wick refuses, which results in his house being burnt down and his life being put on the line. Realising that he will only ever have peace if he agrees to Santino's request, Wick kills Gianna, and massacres her henchmen; however, in order to tie up any loose ends, Santino double-crosses John, putting out a contract on him. Now Wick has to battle lots of other hitmen and women. Luckily for him, they're all rubbish and easily killed. Miffed at being betrayed, John goes after Santino, meaning that he has to fight even more gunmen, but they're all a bit rubbish too. Wick gets shot in the gut and stabbed in the leg in the process, but is able to shrug off the pain, continuing to cut a bloody swathe through the bad guys to get to his target.If kick, punch, blam, blam, blam is all you want for 2 hours, with very little variation in style, lots of CGI blood, and nothing to tax the brain, then have at it - it's not unwatchable, just unremarkable. To his credit, Stahelski ends the film well by nicely setting up things for a third film. I just hope he doesn't give us the same thing all over again (Chapter 2 even repeats the novelty subtitles that I found so irritating in the first film).",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

The adrenaline pumping soundtrack does is job in enhancing the action further.But, the most enjoying thing about John Wicks 2nd instalment is the story. The filmmakers have managed to open up the world of John Wick and given us enough to paint a very vivid picture of the underworld of a society where killers and assassins thrive. You'll be routing for John from the start to finish.The 2 hours spent watching this film at my local movieplex were by far the finest time there in recent memory.A must watch for action fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Welcome Back, Mr. Wick!","I've been waiting for this one for I don't even remember how long. Since I watched its John Wick in 2014, I became a fan of this character. John Wick, living a dull life, keeping it to himself and far away from the world. But when you mess with him, he will end you.First of all, I would like to say that I loved the first movie. I watched it, then I rewind it and watched all the action scenes again. It was classy, smooth, had great background score and most importantly, all the action scenes were so well choreographed that it looked like as if they were dancing.So naturally, my expectations were too high when I went today to watch Chapter 2 and I must say, it was every bit as awesome as the first movie. It was all there! The attributes of the chapter 1 which made me love it so much. The style, the class, sexy action sequences, the fear that the name 'John Wick' brings upon the faces of the bad guys, the slight humor about his retirement, his (another) dog etc. made it an apt sequel. Chapter 2 is similar to its predecessor on so many levels but still offers so much more. For example, a jaw-dropping ending which left the audience wanting more.The cinematography is definitely better. As far as the performance goes, Keanu Reeves never disappoints me. I like all of his performances but now I think I will always remember him in this avatar, as John Wick. The supporting cast did their part pretty well. There were some old faces, mostly new. Special credit should be given to Riccardo Scamarcio, who played Santino D'Antonio. Along with that, I liked Ruby Rose as well. She played a silent sexy killer. She was mute, but even she had some kick-ass dialogues, shown translated on screen!I loved the experience I had watching this movie. The deafening sound of the guns, the flashing lights, the flying bad guys and (a small spoiler :)) the bloody pencils! That is why I suggest you go and watch it in theaters as soon as possible. If you like the first movie, I am sure you will definitely like this one too.I don't know how long will they take to bring out its third installment but it better be quick.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

He's back - obviously!,"I know I'm kinda late to the game, so I won't possibly write anything that hasn't been said before - except for this maybe:I enjoyed the first installment immensely, and I also did enjoy the second one a lot. However, I can't help but notice some little things. First of all, the directing seemed somewhat stiff at moments, which led to some rather noticeable editing issues, especially in the first 20 minutes of the film. Second - and I hate to say that, knowing how much Keanu Reeves trained his ass off for the movie - John Wick's moves aren't that precise and popping anymore. Of course Keanu Reeves is over 50 now, so that's pretty much natural, but still it kinda showed. That being said, I absolutely take my hat off to the balls to show most of the action in nice and calm wide shots with Keanu Reeves clearly being the one performing. And to be honest, this authenticity more than makes up for some slurred executions.I absolutely love this underworld of killers with all its coins, markers and what not, and I feel like this should be like some kind of Harry Potter world of its own.The cinematography was beautiful, the choreographies absolutely fine, the acting quite good and the score totally fitting. I would have loved if Tyler Bates had ventured more into that Classical/Modern mash-up style, though, since I found the one sequence in Rome absolutely fantastic.All in all a very satisfying sequel, which is more than you can say about most sequels. It opens up even more of this bizarre and fantastic world and leaves us with one promising cliffhanger in the end. I can't wait to see ""John Wick 3: The Final Chapter""! 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absoute value for your time and money,"If you liked the first one, you would definitely love this one as well...fights are more violent..you get to see him use the pencil as well!!!!!! And the dialogues......don't over think..just watch the man perform and get entertained.. Rest of the lines are just to fill this damn pages All the fighting scenes were choreographed wonderfully according to my opinion. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I loved all of them and there were no fighting scenes that took too long to finish. Keanu Reeves' portrayal of a retired hit-man who had no choice but to come back was really spot on. There were also some minor characters from the original movie who appeared in this sequel and also new character played by Laurence Fishburne whom I believed would play a large part in chapter 3. Yes, there would definitely be another sequel based on the ending of this movie, which really made me so excited and cannot wait for it to be released.Aside from the very cool amazing action sequence, the sound effects of this movie was very good such as the sound of cars screeching, guns blazing and the voices of John and Cassian's heavy fight which I thought sounded very original. My recommendation if you want to watch this movie, it should be watched in a theater with good sound system.this movie is definitely not for kids. For those of you who want to enjoy a pure action movie with Keanu Reeves as the main star, this one should not be missed. Don't forget to watch the original movie first so you would understand the story line. But for those who do not really enjoy this kind of movie (or cannot stand the bloody fight scenes), then this might not be suitable for you.This is one heck of a movie and I for one truly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"All Show, No Substance","This movie aspires to be a video game. It shows a man trying to get from point A to point B while killing any person who stands in his way. In this regard, it mimics the features of an assassin video game very well. If that's your thing, you'll probably enjoy this movie. You'll enjoy the photography, the props, the sets, the lighting and the action sequences.But as a narrative film, the Wick films are some of the worst drivel to ever make it through the production process. The scenarios are cartoonishly detached from any social logic, characters are one-dimensional puppets, and almost every line of dialogue is cringe-worthy nonsense. The word ""preposterous"" doesn't quite capture just how absurd these films are.The success of these films is a puzzle fit for an oracle.

John Wick: Chapter 2 A,"John Wick: Chapter 2 is the sequel to the incredibly surprising (in a good way) John Wick. It takes place 5 days after the original, and it never slows down.

I have heard arguments saying that the story of the movie is sub par, but I don't think that the main focus is on the story. I don't think the story is bad for that matter. I do think that an argument can be made that some of the character motivations are flawed, and the action can definitely be in bad taste.

Non Stop,"How and even more important who is supposed to stop John Wick? The character and the subsequent movie franchise. Maybe Denzel Washingtons Equalizer would be the correct answer. Maybe that is the mash up that would be amazing. On the other hand I've never heard any person throwing those two characters in one hat, so don't hold your breath.Back to Mr. Wick (and if you have time search the fake trailer for the Dog Wick, hilarious, though full of spoilers I reckon concerning the first Wick movie) and his new problems. You know when you just want to lay back, lift your feet up and do nothing? Wick thought he'd try that out for a change. After a fast paced action riddled opening sequence that is of course. But also of course: it ain't going to happen. And you know that wouldn't be the movie you'd sign up for. Mr. Wick doing nothing other than talk with his foes. The action is choreographed really well, some stunts may seem similar, but overall the gun play is amazing.People of the UK be aware of minor cuts that have been made to the version you are getting (30 seconds I think, but you can find out about that).

"Somehow, it matches the quality of the first; beautifully brutal.","'John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)' is one of the rare sequels that matches the quality of the first. I don't think it's better, but it's at the same level and that alone is an achievement. It is a highly entertaining film with amazing fast-paced action that's perfectly choreographed and beautifully brutal. It manages to raise the stakes in a natural, if predictably and unavoidably slightly contrived, way while maintaining a unique narrative and story structure. The action set-pieces find new ways to keep fresh even when they don't need to and its ability to open the world while also deepening it is impressive. The character is at the heart of the piece still and it is also notable that they manage to keep him feeling suitably 'legendary' while being markedly human. There are some crowd-pleasing moments, too, and some slightly outlandish segments that shouldn't work but just do. Lawrence Fishburne is especially charismatic in his slightly smaller role and keeps things delightfully fresh just when they threaten to perhaps become not so. Plus, the piece keeps you on your toes with a few fairly genuine surprises. It keeps you smiling just like the first and also promises a third entry that has the potential to truly excel, whilst also standing on its own feet as a staple of modern action cinema. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
the sequel,"Spoiler alert. Keanu's new dog lives to the end of this movie. No tragic deaths worth mentioning here.What I liked most about this sequel is that it expanded on the Assassin's Creed concept. Not only did we learn a bit more about laws and customs, but it also laid down the path for consequences further down the road.Pacing was better in Jock Wick 2 than the first, though that's not to say the first was bad. I just felt that things were moving quicker and a lot was going on. I just remember seeing that I was 2/3 through the film but felt like I was less than half. Time was zooming.

"Yeah, I'm thinking he's back...again","Only 2 films in, the ""Wick"" franchise is already a better version of what the Fast / Furious movies aim to be: over-the-top, silly action extravaganzas. Highly stylized, committed and just-self-aware-enough, it walks its bloody-tightrope between parody and sincerity with nearly as much skill as Wick has for killing baddies. While not as qualitatively surprising as its predecessor, Chapter 2 is still a brutally exciting and smartly hilarious romp. We open with Wick tying up some loose-ends from his last vengeance-fueled rampage. A 15-minute barrage of blood and high-stakes bumper cars, it took everything within me not to fist-pump a dozen times right away. As long as he's not trying to emotionally connect with his costars, Reeves is great. He and director Stahelski give us fights and chases that are just so much better than much of what America produces. From the humorous use of random weapons to the quiet nonchalance of a mall shoot-out to the climactic combat in a house-of-mirrors, it won't leave you wanting. From there, we're given a relatively contained narrative about John being dragged back in to this wonderfully mysterious world of suit-cladded, manners-following, rule-abiding assassins. It's a cliché, but the world-building really is great, getting into the minutiae and aftermath of the movie violence we're often immune to. All this made me wonder: maybe THIS is the American answer to Bond. Not Bourne, not Hunt, not Reacher; Wick. He fights with efficiency, he broods with purpose, he's appropriately lauded and feared, and Reeves (while great) doesn't ""own"" the character. And as long as these films stay this insanely fun, I welcome a future spending multiple hours in John Wick's gleefully violent world.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The action sequences were very clumsy where people comes out in open to just die. The way they got shot it looked very pathetic. Another thing when Keanu Reeves reloads his weapon there was nobody but as soon as he finished reloading somebody resumes attack.And the story line was another let down, barren of any logic in the story at all. They tried to put some comedy in but failed horribly. There was no well thought plan or clever steps to awe the audience, it was only full of killings.

The Wick Burns Brighter,"If you saw the first John Wick, then buckle up, because you are about to be in for a ride. This movie improves on the first in almost every way and was a visual spectacle.Chapter 2 picks up right after the first movie ended with John having to deal with the unfinished business of his car. There is an unnecessary exposition about who John Wick is by the leader of the Russian gang that would only benefit those who are walking into this sequel blind but it is given by a man who was perfectly fit to be a Russian mob boss and who my brother actually thought should have played the boss in the first movie.After that the movie goes completely into high gear with action around every corner, insane kills, lots of blood, and great cinematography. John and the viewer are thrust into the underworld we so briefly glimpsed in the first movie as he has to deal with some skeletons from his past and create a swath of skeletons in his wake. This movie will make you reconsider Mr. Wick on your totem pole of bad ass hit men and assassins. Every kill is so beautiful and insane and we are even treated to how the legend of him killing multiple people with a pencil came to be. As well as that, the kills are very realistic and blood. Many times I found myself laughing and clapping because of how insane and real they were.Keanu Reeves is fantastic as the main character with is very slim dialogue but each word has power. You know John Wick is a kick ass guy when he can just say ""Sure"" in sign language and make it look cool. Common and Ruby Rose both stood out as great assassins to go up against John. As usual, the background and depth put into this underworld and society of assassins with their coins and hotels was flesh out and so interesting. There is a particular scene in Rome where John is sampling wine, er guns, and also getting a suit tailored that is priceless.Despite a few missteps in dialogue and a gratuitous if arguably unnecessary cameo from Laurence Fishburne who is there mainly to give some winks and comedy to the camera, this movie is fantastic and heart pumping. Without a doubt one of the best action movies we will see this year and by the time you are finished you will want a Chapter 3, which is saying a lot in this day and age of unwanted and unneeded sequels.The Wick burns brightly in this beautiful and well made sequel. I highly recommend this movie, especially to those who saw the first movie or who are looking for a great action movie. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, because they don't deserve to see it. I also would not recommend this movie to my mom cause there is a lot of blood.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

But ultimately it is a straight up action film........my thoughts below.Keanu Reeves again does a great job of playing the John Wick character, it is a perfect role for him , where there is not all that much dialogue & just him kicking serious ass. I also enjoyed the brief appearance of Lawerence Fishburne.The action & fighting scenes are again done very well much like in the original film & with Keanu Reeves doing most of the stunts & fighting scenes himself made it look even better & more realistic. Also thoroughly enjoyed the two fight scenes that he had with Common in the movie.The only minor gripe I had with the movie, is that the stakes didn't feel very high as you basically knew John Wick was going to beat up everybody & come out on top, so I guess you never really felt that he was in danger even when all these different hit men were after him.If you enjoyed the first John Wick movie then you will certainly enjoy this one as well, both highly entertaining action films, a 7/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Same magic less nuance.,"John Wick 2 captures much of the magic of the original film and loses just a bit of the nuance. Stahelski and Leitch again create some of the most interesting and eye catching fight scenes with an overall aesthetic that creates a perfect mood. Reeves gives a solid performance, but the mystery that made John Wick so appealing begins to fade and you are left with a very good action film as opposed to the greatness that was the first.

It's just dull! Well produced, yes. Good looking - yes. Stylish - yes. Sadly, though - the repetitive nature of the action scenes and the wafer thin plot leaves no jeopardy whatsoever and it's so obvious that there are more of these to come that it doesn't matter how precarious his predicament, you just know he will survive - even if the beating he takes would kill a rhino!

John Wick 2 is one of the best action movies I've seen. Best action movie is John Wick chapter 2.In the movie, John is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio. D'Antonio presents the medallion to demand services from John, but John refuses, claiming that he is ""retired"". In retaliation, D'Antonio destroys John's house with a grenade launcher.Winston, the owner of the Continental hotel in New York City, reminds John that if he rejects the Marker, he will be violating one of the two unbreakable rules of the underworld: no killing on Continental grounds, and Markers must be honored. John accepts his commitment and meets with D'Antonio, who tasks him with assassinating his sister Gianna D'Antonio so he can claim her seat on the ""High Table"", a council of high-level crime lords. D'Antonio sends Ares, his personal bodyguard, to follow and keep an eye on John.In Rome, John infiltrates Gianna's celebratory party and confronts her. After Gianna know about John come to kill her, Gianna chooses to commit suicide. While retreating, John is ambushed by D'Antonio's men, who intend to kill John for destroy the killing order of Santino D'Antonio. After killing most of them, John is pursued by Gianna's bodyguard Cassian. Their brutal fight is halted when they crash into the reception area of the Rome Continental. As the two reluctantly share a drink, Cassian vows revenge for Gianna's death.After John returns to New York City, D'Antonio opens a $7 million contract for John's death under the guise of avenging his sister, leading numerous assassins to attack him (unsuccessfully). Cassian confronts John once again in the subway. John wins the ensuing fight, but spares Cassian's life out of professional respect. Injured and desperate, John seeks help from the underground crime lord The Bowery King, whose subordinates treat his injuries and guide him to D'Antonio's location. John kills D'Antonio's men and brutally stabs Ares after an intense fight, leaving her immobilized, but D'Antonio is able to escape to the Continental. D'Antonio makes it clear that he intends to seek indefinite refuge there, and John, despite Winston's warning, shoots and kills D'Antonio.The next day, Winston tells John that, per the High Table, the contract on John has been doubled and offered globally. John is ""excommunicado"" and loses all access and privileges to underworld resources. Winston delays announcing John's excommunication and post of the bounty on him globally by one hour to give him a head start, and provides him with a Marker for future use.

"Mr Anderson, Welcome back. We missed you.","If there is one genre of film that has stood the test of time, it is the ""Action Flick"". There seems to be an unquenchable thirst for these things which the big Hollywood studios have been quick to capitalise on. Back in the 80's and some of the 90's the Action film was literally ""One Guy takes on many people"" and that's it. The studios knew what people wanted. They didn't want character development or a complex story line. They wanted Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone to kill people in imaginative ways. The audience loved it and the hence their menagerie of films have stood the test of time. Since then much has changed. Films like Fast and Furious attempt to put in a pointless story line about ""family"", ""Friends"" and a pathetic endeavour at on screen romance. But John Wick Chapter 2, does what its predecessor did so wonderfully. It takes guidance from the action greats of the past and instead spends most of its time to show you what you have paid to see An orgy of on screen deaths. While on the subject of death, John Wick 2 offers some of the best gun fight sequences ever. Keanu Reeves spent 8 hours every day for 4 months training for his role. This shows throughout the entire film as there are almost no stunt doubles. His efficiency with the weapons and the perfectly executed kills are a visual feast for anyone who loves a good action sequence. And that's exactly what we have come to watch. We don't want a complex story so the film makers don't try to give us one. The atheistic and visceral brutality is the reason why John Wick 2 triumphs over its lacklustre counterparts. The film does well to expand the lore that the first film started. It reveals why John Wick is so feared by almost everyone who knows him. But make no mistake, there is hardly a cohesive story here. The film takes places in a surreal world built upon our very own. There are a few bits of black comedy here and there but the tone is very much noire. One of my issues is that John Wick's character doesn't want to do this but when he is killing people with pencils and disembowels a man from the groin upwards that whole idea goes out of the window. Reeves who plays the character very well doesn't say much throughout the film. But as mentioned before, this isn't a film if you want a story. That aside, John Wick should be enjoyed as it was intended. It is a brutal ballet which is choreographed and filmed to perfection. Keanu Reeves it seems is back and is now the new darling of action purists.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The first John Wick was thoroughly enjoyable, but I didn't expect the sequel to be even better. Mind you, the starting is a bit lopsided, trying to connect you to what happened in the first chapter. But this movie really starts after the titles and shoots off from there. One thinks one might get tired of all the shooting and killing and dead bodies in this film, but one doesn't. The length of the action sequences is just right. And like in Chapter One, Keanu Reeves plays John Will as an assassin on auto pilot, with no time to think, only to act.

Not bad. Not bad at all.,"Since watching the first John Wick, I have learned that: (a) the genre can best be described as ""gun fu"", (b) a college classmate of mine wrote these films.

It lacks the heart/backstory of the origin tale, but still feels like pure (and disciplined) adrenaline 90% of the time. The world is claustrophobic and well rendered, unlike similar films in the comic book category. I'll take that: simple, contained, and brutal.

John Wick: Chapter 2 is one of those instances. Things aligned and the result was a sequel that was more satisfying more brutal and greatly expands the world of John Wick so that he can continue killing people and all because a guy didn't know who John Wick was and killed his puppy. Go watch it, the movie is everything an assassin's world movie should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Horrible.. Walked out after enduring about 60 minutes,"I have never seen anything so dumb in my life.. It starts with a preposterous disjointed chase scene in which the motorcycle being chased (far faster than the car in the first place) somehow runs into the car chasing him.. and then the title of the film and then it gets worse.. Even Keanu Reeves, the ultimate bad guy, is not bulked up.. just a scrawny beard and a scowl.. If you want to see a film where everyone Keanu meets, he kills, this is for you.. The reverberation in the theater that makes the gun shots sound real is about all that is good.. but with people mowing each other down in real life, I can't for the life of me imagine why someone would make this type of film or glorify killing. That people liked this film is even worse.. Stupid dumb movie.. And for those who think I should have seen the whole film before commenting.. yea right.. The movie never even remotely got better.. and the acting and directing and editing.. Everyone must have been on something.. I saw it the Fri night it came out because of the 9.0 rating!

Not as good as the first part.,"One of the problems with great stories is the expansion of the dramatic arc for the appearance of new films with the obvious desire to make money at the expense of originality. Here the story is based on the premises of the first great film and despite being very well told, it shows the first signs of fatigue. The warning is given that the secondary characters are not interesting and the irony occurs that if we take the film seriously, half of humanity would be made up of hitmen, which in itself is inconceivable. There are great action sequences, good humor, a basting of the first story and the secondary ones that is well planned but with the stink of exhaustion of ideas. The third film will show that all fears were well founded.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sit Back, relax and enjoy the action","If you like action movie with ""one man army"" this John Wick sequel is a good choice. I remember how 80-90 action movie such as Die Hard or Rambo became great entertainment in that moment. There's some new element in this movie that quite new for action genre. John Wick happen in a dystopia realm (this thing is not explained in previous movie). But there is some major problem, maybe because in post 2010 one man army action genre being dominated by notorious The Raid series. John Wick is not the only action movie affect of this phenomenon, Dredd is another example. When we watch this movie, willing or not we are going to compare with story,plot, characters or any other thing presented by The Raid astute director, Gareth Evans.

So that was a gripe I had from the beginning that was quickly settled. In the same sense that this is the second chapter, it feels like you never left the theater after the first one. While the story does change and new characters are introduced, the aesthetics of Chapter Two are pretty much identical to the original. The color palette, the action choreography, the costume design, the music-- it all feels exactly the same. That kind of continuity is something I look for and appreciate in sequels.

"Although, I still liked it! It is still the least favorite out of all the John Wick movies so far","(2017) John Wick: Chapter 2
ACTIONContinued where the first one left off with Keanu Reeves as John Wick continuing his warpath against the Russian gangsters who went after him after Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) only adult son, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) killed his dog given by his wife before she had died, before he took the liberty to steal his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. Apparently, before Wick killed Viggo at the end from the first movie, he just happens to have a brother and that he has his car. And in order for him to retrieve his mustang, he needs to grab the access card from the motorcyclist he's been chasing. When he does, the first thing he does is use it, and as it turns out, it happens to be a yellow cab comp. And after smashing his mustang up some more, he would then go up to see Viggo's brother to signify him no more. He agrees. It is not long before he hands his mustang to car mechanic, Aurelio (John Leguizamo) to have him get it repaired. And then sometime during the night, he gets another visit from another familiar face, Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) passing him a marker that is shaped like an amulet inside with his fingerprint on it. And when Wick refuses, he would then blow up his house blowing him through the window. And upon him going to the The Continental to speak with it's manager, Winston (Ian McShane) he let him convince him to accept the assignment whatever it was supposed to be. And Wick does see Santino, to honor whatever person he wanted eliminated, it turns out to be his older sister, Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini) so that he himself would be in charge of their criminal organization. Long story short, as soon as he completes the deed, he would then double cross him by placing a 7 million bounty on him since according to him, it would not seem like he cared about his sister's demise unless he exact revenge on the person who killed her.After watching all four John Wick movies, this is perhaps the only one I like the least, or better yet the least favorite as it kind of makes Wick appear to look like a chump...only for him to be double crossed again from someone who asked him to honor the marker. After watching it again, the second time around motivated me to use the fast forward button to the part where Wick had to confront Santino sister's right hand man, Cassian (Common) as I thought executing Santino's sister and her goons was a little grey, for the only ones who deserved their comeuppance are Santino himself and whoever was protecting him.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

John is bound by a blood oath to assist him and reluctantly travels to Rome the capital of Italy or Roma as Italians call Rome to fulfil this obligation. Matters are complicated by the fact that someone has 'opened an account' on John himself, which means that every badass on the planet is now closing in! It's not long before the bullets start flying in this explosive sequel to the 2014 hit that reignited Keanu Reeves' action career with the biggest bang imaginable.

I won't spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it, but I highly recommend it to anyone. It was sleek, eloquent and down right enjoyable. It had a few funny one liners, but the action is 100% faultless. After I'd seen the film I actually googled 'Keanu Reeves training for John Wick 2', if you haven't.. Do it, do it now!

Balletic and bombastic,"John Wick was the sleeper hit of 2014, elegantly combining kinetic fist and gun fights, fluid camera-work, and an effective, stoic performance from its lead, Keanu Reeves. There was a beauty in its simplicity: a former assassin grieving over the recent death of his wife gets done over by a small gang of scumbag Russian mobsters, who proceed to beat him to a pulp and kill his dog, and who are soon running for their lives as the slick-suited killing machine routinely takes them out one by one. Animal lovers can breathe easy as no dogs die in this sequel, although the anti-hero has found himself a new four-legged sidekick. The film's surprising success, as well as the shady underground universe it only hinted at, had action fans salivating at the thought of a follow-up.Fans will be pleased that stuntman-turned-director Chad Stahelski is back at the helm, as is writer Derek Kolstad, who, although obeying the expected rule of sequels by making everything bigger and louder, both ensure that everything that set our pulses racing the first time around is present and suitably breathtaking. Opening with what can only be described as a ballet of fisticuffs and impressive stunt driving, we are instantly on familiar grounds. Having done everything but retrieve his 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 as he took his vengeance on anybody stupid enough to stand in his way, Wick lays siege to a dingy chop shop ran by Russian Abram Tarasov (Peter Storemare), the brother of Viggo from the first film. With pal Aurelio (John Leguizamo) restoring the classic vehicle, Wick can finally move on with his life. Only clearly somebody hasn't informed him that he's in a sequel. Soon enough, old colleague Santino (Riccardo Scamarcio) is at his door insisting on a favour.Wick politely refuses, but Santino lays down a marker which symbolises an unbreakable oath. Although they kill mercilessly for a living, these contract killers have a code and a set of rules they must obey under penalty of death. Having left the game, Wick isn't having any of it, but the quick destruction of his home soon has him jetting off to Rome to carry out the job. His target: Santino's sister Gianna (Claudia Gerini), who was chosen by their father to take his place at the high seat of international crime bosses. The organisation of the underground assassins only hinted at previously really opens up in Rome. Met by the boss Julius (Franco Nero), Wick is soon getting fitted for expensive suits and choosing his arsenal with the assistance of Sommerlier (Peter Serafinowicz) for his so- called 'impossible task'. A smooth operation wouldn't make for a particularly exciting time, so Wick quickly finds himself under threat from bodyguard and colleague Cassian (Common), and Santino himself, who wants to leave no loose ends.John Wick: Chapter 2 could have easily gotten ahead of itself. By opening up what was such a personal and emotional revenge mission last time into a continent-hopping world of hotel safe-houses and spies masquerading as the homeless, this could have become very silly very quickly. Instead, the film hypnotises you by making the action even more bombastic, and infinitely more violent (if you liked The Joker's death-by-pencil in The Dark Knight, just wait for this one). Even when events take strain credibility to the max by introducing the 'Bowery King' (Laurence Fishburne, in a nice reunion with Reeves), a man in charge of a huge network of tramp hit men, and revealing that a startling number of the general public are in fact one text away from slitting your throat, you'll be too busy admiring the balletic carnage to roll your eyes. The bad guy may be even less interesting than the already-bland big boss from the previous movie and it's lost that element of surprise, but I was ready for part 3 the second the credits started to roll.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Refined Chaos, At Its Finest.","With its exhilarating brand of toe-to-toe action & expanded lore that never ceases to peak interest, John Wick Chapter 2 is a bona fide entertainment gem, cementing John Wick as a must see franchise.This second chapter in the Boogeyman spectacle, builds upon its predecessor through its action extravaganza & storyline that features new underground, criminal world gimmicks. The former alone renders this picture worthy, through improved choreography and eye popping backdrops that adds bonus points in style. Happily, Chadel Stahelski & screenwriter Derek Kolstad treats us further, through novel discoveries around the dark, polished society of gangsters & assassins the 2014 original touched on. Here, underworld concepts, governing rules & codes amongst un-gentlemen, reveal rich, investing tenets of the John Wick universe that boasts of mystery, intrigue and refined chaos.As for this picture's weak points, its storyline was a step down from its predecessor, as it bids farewell from its intimate & sincere character motivations. This sequel as well features decorative antagonists, such as Ruby Rose & Common's personas, whose quirks & angst were mere facades to their underwhelming showdowns.Overall, John Wick Chapter 2's offerings of gobsmacking action & lore, guarantees an entertaining time at the movies.

A ballet of bullets that leaves me thirsty for more,"Three years after we were first introduced to the character of John Wick in an action movie that blew audiences away and showed modern day actioners how to deliver stylish and comprehensible action sequences, he's back in John Wick: Chapter 2, and with him he's bringing plenty more action.Having been dragged out of retirement to exact revenge on a gang that killed his dog and stole his car, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) learns he must repay a debt before he can think about leaving the life he fought so hard to get out of in the first place.The trouble is, when you're such a legend in the criminal underworld, it's hard to make a return without going unnoticed, leading to a large bounty being put on Wick's head, leading to an onslaught of blood and bullets.John Wick: Chapter 2 takes the phrase ""Go big or go home"" and drives it home with extreme amounts of bravado, Derek Kolstad's writing expanding the world of assassins established so well in the first film and Chad Stahelski's confident direction moving the film along at such a blistering pace.As with the first film, the highlight of this sequel is the action sequences, both choreographed to perfection and gorgeously shot by Dan Laustsen, seamlessly flowing from headshot to headshot. They're as brutal as they were in the first film, including a glorious kill involving a pencil that had the audience flinching that comes in one of the best movie montages of recent years.This is a serious film but there is certainly a sense of fun when it comes to some of the action sequences, whether it be the etiquette shown by the assassins when on continental grounds or a quite brilliant moment between John Wick and Common's Cassian during their chase through a subway station that had me in stitches. The score from Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard suitably accompanies the action sequences too, the finale in particular set to a more classical theme makes this feel like a ballet of bullets, each hitting their mark with the precision required for such a dance.Coming to the performances, we all know Keanu Reeves is not the greatest actor on the planet but the dedication he shows to a character that has given him such recognition is certainly commendable. I've seen footage of Reeves training for this shoot and his accuracy on the shooting range at such speed is scary to say the least and he well and truly brings it with him to the film, making John Wick such an efficient killing machine. I liked the supporting performances too; Laurence Fishburne in particular hamming it up to the max while both Common and Ruby Rose make for quite formidable enemies to Wick.With John Wick: Chapter 2, Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have collaborated again to deliver brutal action aplenty in a pulsating sequel that is worthy to follow the awesome original. Just wait for the final scene, if that doesn't get you excited for the potential of a third John Wick film, what the hell are you doing watching these films?!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bigger and Badder (the Good Kind), But It Comes at a Cost","Picking almost right where the previous film ended, ""John Wick Chapter 2"" deals with the consequences of Wick's return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin with.As expected, it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie, with the revelation that there's a high council of sorts, other Continental hotels around the world, and a very widespread network of assassins.Also as expected, it ups the ante with bigger action sequences, and a much higher body count. We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose (whose character communicates solely through sign language; in many cases, this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them, but it's not the case here and is used only as an aspect of the character; smartly done). Keanu Reeves...let's the Reeves of old come through a couple times, with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections. Ian McShane's Winston expands a little bit, although he still refers to John as Jonathan, which is just wrong. If it's supposed to be some kind of an in-joke with them, they don't reveal anything about it. Again, I think there's more going on with Lance Reddick's hotel manager than they're letting on. And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasn't in more of the film, as he's always fun.Again, the world is very wide, and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld. There is an indication that that's not the case here and there, but we never get to meet anyone who doesn't know what's going on, which keeps some of that suspicion up.The plot follows a pretty basic structure. Actually, it follows a pretty rigid structure. In a two hour movie, it can be broken down almost exactly into half-hour sequences, something that struck me as a little odd. There are some minor plot twist. Nothing major or out of the blue, but at least there was an attempt.So now we come down to it. Is it better or worse than the first movie? Well, I would have to say ""yes"". It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie, expanding on the mythology and the characters. At the same time, it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger, badder sequels fall into, which is that with the bigger scope, it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own. In fact, they may have expanded the world too quickly, going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second. That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and, while the ambition is admirable, at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chew.Still an enjoyable action film, and if you liked the first film, you'll most likely enjoy this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Chad Stahelski's direction shines in masterclass in action filmmaking,"I want to talk about Keanu here. I really do, but I didn't think I could pass up the chance to expand upon Stahelski's direction, because it was wonderful in this film. The film opens up the world of John Wick more than the first film did, and Stahelski gets really creative with how and what stunts he films.From the scene on the train with Common's character Cassian to the finale in the hall of mirrors, Stahelski draws on previous films and filmmakers to create something all his own here. The first film in the series established that the direction was about actual fighting and how grueling it can be. The second film continues that trend. The first time Cassian and John Wick meet up, they get into a brutal hand-to-hand fight that lasts far longer than most directors would allow in action films and certainly with far fewer cuts. It's near exhausting to watch, but that's the point. Fighting isn't always fast and quick and clean (sometimes it is, and for that, we get the gun fu that John Wick does so beautifully), sometimes it's long, with no clear winner, and with no real outcome except pain. Stahelski's direction brings together wonderful performances from Keanu, Common, Ruby Rose, and more. This film is absolutely worth your time, and I cannot wait to see where Stahelski takes us next in the series.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Matrix Revolutions was an utter disaster, but that's another story.Hardly are action sequels better than the original, even the good ones struggle matching up to the film its following. John Wick: Chapter Two however is not only better than the first, but is the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road. Chapter Two takes the excellent stuntwork and camera-work of the original and turns it up a few notches with a better budget, larger run time, and oh so much more carnage.Part of the glee and joy of the original surprise-surprise hit was the intriguing premise being intertwined with well-directed and choreographed action. Assassins having this special code and hidden locations where one can interact and be safely tucked away from violence was a fresh spin on an otherwise stale concept of secret assassins existing all over the world. Chapter Two explores this further by expanding past the United States and digging into foreign locale. Although the scope is larger, the movie actually suffers slightly from having to explain the rules and regulations to its audience before unleashing all the mayhem.Action movies struggle the most in balancing content and story, because we see action movies not for the story but for what can be delivered within the script. Chapter Two's opening half is entirely plot-driven except for the sequence preceding the opening credits. Take the entertaining car fight away, and you wouldn't get a gun battle until 45 minutes in. But The Raid 2 also has a slow opening third before delivering some of the best action ever put to celluloid, so the ticking time bomb formula works as long as you fully commit to the chaos. Chapter Two is saved because the twist halfway unveils a dilemma that guarantees a relentless outpouring of action. And boy did they deliver.Once the true conflict actually arises from seemingly out of nowhere, we are treated to a beefy stew of gun fights, hand-to-hand combat, cleverly drawn-out showdowns, and even an Enter the Dragon-like climax towards the end. Just like in the original, Chad Stahelski uses his skills as a stunt coordinator and experience in the action film industry to carve out some killer sequences where the body count is high, the action is easy and clear to see, the sound mixing is top-notch, and lastly the camera-work rivals that of your best sweeping epics. The pacing is consistent, the special effects is kept to a minimum to focus more on stunts, and the violence is gritty and organic. The variety is also great, as we have a concert shootout, a subway battle, a museum chase, and an exchange of bullets and punches in the historical parts of Rome.Keanu Reeves may not win any acting Oscars, but his approach to action movies deserves some mention. In here he does nearly all his own stunts (driving and gun battling included) and garners sympathy as a man that clearly wants to leave his old life while grieving over his loss. Adding to the fun is a good cast of minor characters each with their moment to shine, each with their vital role in the doozy of a flick. Lastly, we are left wanting more, even you though you have to feel for the obviously crappy month John Wick is experiencing.John Wick Chapter Two won't change cinema like The Raid nor will it set a benchmark like Mad Max: Fury Road. Nonetheless it improves upon the original flaws and all because you get a healthier dosage of action-packed fun that is full of variety, creativity, and superb intense precision. If you like your action bloody and raw like the best we've seen this decade (Raid, Raid 2, Mad Max) then you will not be disappointed in the least bit here. Between this and the upcoming Atomic Blonde, it's good to see American filmmakers finally stepping up on their uncut action skills.Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"bigger action, scope, slightly improved story, and more Keanu Reeves badassery","Building on its predecessor, John Wick: Chapter 2 expands the mythos of its titular protagonist with bigger action, scope, slightly improved story, and more Keanu Reeves badassery.Chapter 2 follows John Wick in the wake of the consequences in the original's story. The Russian Mafia Wick battled is but a member of a large group of a connected mob, with their own rules and code. Wick is once again forcibly drawn back to his previous profession when he is tasked by an influential mob boss to kill his sister.Like the original, themes of brotherhood, loyalty, greed, and power are explored. Many of the hinted aspects of the criminal underworld Wick is a part of is expanded. A larger group called High Table makes decisions every mob and bosses follow. The High Table is composed of mob bosses themselves.Wick is drawn to the task because he swore a blood oath, an unbreakable pact that must be honored. The mob boss, Santino D'Antonio, is driven by greed and greater power because his sister, Gianna D'Antonio, is a member of the High Table and he is not. Gianna commits suicide when confronted by Wick to end her life in her own terms. Before Gianna could kill herself, she poses Wick a dilemma that by killing her, a woman, wouldn't he remember the memory of his deceased wife. Wick proceeds anyway, but not before she committed suicide. Upon completing the task, to deflect any suspicion, Santino has Wick assassinated, with a hefty bounty, to no avail. Failing to assassinate Wick, Santino becomes the prey. The chase lands both Wick and Santino at New York Continental Grounds which prohibits ""business"" within hotel grounds. Wick violates the oath and kills Santino, rendering him excommunicado not just in Continental but the entire criminal enterprise. The bounty on his head is doubled and becomes international, but not before Winston gave him a 1-hour head start of distance. The killing of Santino signifies Wick's full return into his old profession but as a lone wolf.Compared to its predecessor, Chapter 2 has a slight improvement in character development, but not enough to be considered emotionally fulfilling. There is a jarring tonal shift between the film's two halves wherein the first is mainly about Wick's loss and the assassination job while the second half is him on the run. The world-building is really impressive, presenting how big the criminal enterprise Wick lives in. The fight scenes are spectacular. One standout, in particular, is the hall of mirrors fight, which is inspired by Sam Mendes' Skyfall. The amount of car crashes Wick survives in this particular film shows what a legend he is. His reputation as an assassin extends beyond New York. Keanu Reeves is great once again showing some real acting chops by performing different languages, both verbal and sign. The direction is sleeker. Somehow, Chad Stahelski manages to improve Chapter 2 in spectacle and direction while remaining faithful to the original.John Wick: Chapter 2 is a very good follow-up but one where the sequel may improve upon with better writing.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick 2 is sick! Insane cinematographic violence and man-to-man combat.,"John Wick 2 is sick! Insane cinematographic violence and man-to-man combat.The cinematic presentation sometimes veers into an eerily serene but macabre space, and is very reminiscent of the horror genre. The effect ultimately creates a style of its own which was not explored in the first movie.Keanu Reeves is as stoic as ever with his dreaded violent background and in-your-face killing instinct. The story hasn't got much to offer as was also evident in the first instalment. The discernible difference in the plot is that the stakes have been raised, the looming threat on the protagonist has been multiplied ten folds, and the climax sets up a sequel which would raise the stakes a hundred times over.All in all, a must watch for action and Keanu Reeves enthusiasts! :DRating : 3.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A bold and adrenaline-fuelled sequel that expands excellently on the first, setting up what could be one of the greatest action trilogies ever.","'John Wick Chapter 2' explodes onto the big screen shamelessly loud and exhilarating, opening with Keanu Reeves' John Wick tracking down his stolen 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, bombarding it out of the chop shop it was stored in, killing a good many goons along the way. This truly does set the tone for the entire film; bigger, more badass, and leaving a longer line of dead bodies after all the turmoil.These sorts of action films rarely exemplify such artistic flair, but director Chad Stahelski, who co-directed the original with David Leitch, gives us a fantastic spectacle to behold. The experienced stunt director provides some more immensely choreographed car chases, thrilling fight scenes, contrasting with intense sequences of drama with unique style. The inspiration here is more based on martial arts films from the likes of Hong-Kong, intricate yet fluidly flowing between shots, differentiating the Wick franchise from the likes of 'Bourne' or 'Bond'. Additionally, there's an incredible section in the final showdown in a hall of mirrors, which is just visually spectacular. The tension is masterfully sustained, and while this is an aspect that is present throughout, it is remarkably prevalent there, making it one of the most surprisingly gripping set pieces in the film and an absolute joy to watch.Extraordinarily for this sort of film, it is a wholly justified sequel that doesn't damage the game-changing legacy of the first. Still as hard-hitting, still as intriguing and still as fresh in its approach, 'John Wick Chapter 2' does what the likes of 'Taken' could not, or rather chose not to; it proudly returns embodying the tone and feel of the previous, flowing naturally between the two instalments (which may be down to the fact that this is set only days after the first). For fans of the original, this film serves sufficiently on every front. 'Chapter 2' develops on the premise of the first, delving deeper into the criminal underworld with intriguing outcomes. It introduces some interesting characters, notably combining 'The Matrix' veterans, Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne (who plays the campy crime lord Bowery King), for the first time since 'Revolutions', along with the familiar faces of the first, Ian McShane (as the owner of the New York Continental hotel, Winston) and Lance Reddick as Charon, both with larger and more captivating parts to play.Like the original film however, 'Chapter 2' requires a substantial deferral of disbelief. But this does not deter from the brilliance of the gracefully streaming narrative, or the awesome impact of the action sequences on the viewing experience.But at the essence of it all, John Wick is without a doubt the worst retiree ever. Yet I don't expect anyone to complain about that besides him really, and maybe those who attempt to stop him in future. 'Chapter 2' is fantastic escapism entertainment, establishing a franchise that promises to be enticing to the last. Here's to chapter three being just as breathtaking.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A high-octane masterpiece of an action flick,"It is an unwritten rule that in 8 out of 10 cases the following sequel to a successful movie can be a very risky business.In truth, most of the times the sequels are not living to the expectations not only of its creators but which is worse, they disappoint the fans.Here I am to remind you that luckily for us, the fans every rule has an exception.""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (2017) is a brilliant exception which not only lives to its high expectations but it arguably exceeds them.Shortly after its release, the stylish Noe-noir flick received an average rating of 8.2/10 on IMDb and a score of 90% from 168 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.Let's see who is responsible for that immense successCast and Crew:The movie is again directed by the debut ant Chad Stahelski who is a professional stuntman and this is only his second director's credit.It is a curious fact that the talented director with a kickboxing background was one of Keanu Reeves' stunt doubles in The Matrix trilogy.The star-packed cast includes Riccardo Scamarccio in the role of the villainous Santino D'Antonio and again Ian McShane as the Hotel manager Winston.The gorgeous Ruby Rose (""Orange is the new black"", ""XXX: Return of Xander Cage"") and the rapper turned actor Common are strikingly convincing as the professional assassins Ares and Cassian.Peter Stormare as a Russian gangster, Lance Reddick as the Hotel receptionist, John Leguizamo and the living legend Franko Nero have also small but remarkable appearances in the film.A pleasant surprise is Laurence Fishburne in the role of the powerful underground boss Bowery King who has an important part in John Wick's revengeful actions.The writers of the movie didn't hesitate to make reference to ""The Matrix"" by giving both characters some lines similar to the ones in the masterpiece directed by the Wachowski brothers.For instance, John Wick says to the Bowery King ""I guess that you have a choice"". If that doesn't ring a bell, then you will need to refresh your memory and watch again the dialogue between Neo and Morpheus.This is a great action movie because:The heart-pounding action starts with an insane car chase scene from the first second of the flick and it barely stops at the very end of the film.I was totally blown away by the masterfully choreographed fight scenes and by the intensity of the plot.It grabs you, it puts you right on the edge of your seat and then squeezes you only to leave you breathless and wanting for more.Keanu Reeves trained Jiu Jitsu for four months to prepare for his role and he executes 90% of his stunts. The effect is visible-the character fits him perfectly.The 53 years old actor is in great shape and shows spectacular weaponry and fighting skills.His on-screen feud with Common (Cassian) leads to some stunning one on one fights between both characters. Be sure that you'll have some sweat drops on your forehead!The cast is awesome and all the actors have done an impressive job, deserving applause for their genuine personifications.Ian McShane, Riccardo Scamarccio and even Peter Stormare and Franko Nero, although their short presence as a Russian mobster and Italian Hotel owner, they all made memorable performances.Also, it was great to see Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne acting together, the last time being 14 years ago in ""The Matrix"".What makes ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" so enjoyable is not just the action. It is the whole haunting world of the professional assassins, all wearing expensive suits, which is represented in the movie.The audience receives an alluring view towards the underground criminal world.The viewer is entirely moved by the hit men's secret society, driven by a strict code of conduct and honor.It is interesting to explore their hidden gathering places that are mostly fancy hotels in New York and Rome; the way they conduct their ""business"" by operating with terms like ""contracts"", ""markers"" and ""deals"".The film is visually stunning, the action taking place in some spectacular venues in Rome and New York.The special effects are present but almost invisible, making the whole feeling of the movie even more realistic.The dialogue is minimalist and symbolical and the camera work is masterful.There are several mind-blowing shooting scenes, taking place in the underground catacombs in Rome, where John infiltrates the celebratory party of Gianna- Santino's sister.The other thing that grabbed my attention was the great soundtrack of the movie which perfectly fits the dark, intense atmosphere.The OST composed mainly by Tyler Bates, Joel J. Richard, and DJ Ciscandra Nostalghia is a mixture of dance, house and explosive techno that electrifies the motion picture even more.The breathtaking ending of the movie is opened, leaving us impatiently expecting the third, conclusive chapter of the trilogy.John Wick 2 Movie Review in a Nutshell:The second chapter of John Wick is a high-octane, adrenaline pounding roller coaster.The stylish Noe-noir action flick maybe reminds a little bit of ""Crank"" (2006) with Jason Statham but it highly exceeds it in every aspect.It is far better than the previous part from 2014 and with this ongoing upward trend, I can hardly imagine what the third part would be.""John Wick: Chapter 2"" has all it needs to deliver great fun and spectacular action-packed experience.With some slight flaws, this is arguably one of the best action movies in the past decade.

"Action up, story down","John Wick chapter 2 is to me more or less on par with the first, but for different reasons. The set pieces feels so much more grand, the action and worldbuilding is incredible, but this time the stakes and plot just feel lees impactful than the first to me. I didn´t care as much for the stakes here as the first but I am left with a great and fun action movie no doubt.After the retirement of John Wick an old friend knocks at the door with a marker, a pact that needs to be repaid, that leads John on a bloody hitman mission.What these movies do so well is the subtext storytelling. It´s so nice having a movie not overexplain every single persons backstory, every single detail as to how the world works, we, the audience are not stupid, we can pick the clues up, we can understand the relationships and the ins and outs, without minutes of dialogue. It´s so nice having a movie respect the viewer in that way. And I love how we see more of how a hit would work in this world, making a plan, going to different shops, I love how famous Wick is, his relations, this movie handles everything so well. This is how you do subtext storytelling.The action is absolutely phenomenal. The gunfu this movie dares to do is incredible and everything is elevated by an incredible sound design, incredible cacography and amazing set pieces. Every shot is felt, every cool move is awed, all the lighting and use of moves, everything comes together to make incredible action. Except for a few cuts that's disoriented me, I feel like this movie gets away with so much and really runs with it. I must complain about the ""coming from the camera side"" moves that makes henchmen feel a bit too incompetent. Half the time people with guns don´t use them, running towards Wick for no reason. This could easily have been fixed by not having that, but it´s a minor nitpick.The movie is so well shot with some incredible wide shots and some great lighting. This is helped by the many set pieces this movie uses to its full potential. From the party, to the later art gallery and mirror room to the fun buy weird subway fight, this movie likes to make fun and iconic set pieces that you will remember. Although the subway fight and other public fights were a bit too out there for me. Turn of the brain for that to really have fun. How people aren´t reacting to guy clearly bleeding and clearly holding a gun in public to places clearing out of people that should have people running around everywhere. Yeah this is where the realism break stepped in for me, but again, still fun sequences none the less.Like the previous this movie feels really light on plot an it´s just a way to catalyst the action. It´s not really important what´s going on here, just that it can make the next action sequence happen. But I felt something with the last movie I didn't here, I didn't care to much and the stakes felt lower even though they are way higher. Maybe it´s just the taking of a life compared to here that doesn't really translate well to me. But again the plots are just here to make the action go.The soundtrack also really elevates the movie and it´s action. So many incredible matching of scenes and music makes this movie feel so much stronger. I didn´t expect to hear a rock version of Winter by Vivaldi here, but this movie did it!The performances are very over the top, in a very over the top universe. I didn't like how most character speak some native tongue and then goes back to English, I feels like a character like Wick would know all these languages- Laurence Fishburne is incredible in his role, clearly having fun with the character. This is also a movie were we see the humanity of John Wick coming through, I felt much for him here a man that just needs an out of his world but always gets pulled back in. Keanu Reeves acting with these breakdowns are great, from the direct screaming, to a small head nod does so much to teel how tired this character is.I just cared more for the first movie, but the action really elevates this one- This too a little to get going and felt lighter on plot, but the overall action sceptical feels stronger than the first so they are more or less on par for me with the first one edging it out slightly. I most also say that the ending creates an interesting start for the next movie I haven't seen as of writing so the movie feels more like a chapter indeed than a stand-alone like the first.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bullet Ballet at its finest,"When I saw the first movie, I thought: this is something new. Someone took the real hardcore action movies from the past, where people use handguns like extension of their hands, kill and keep dropping bodies like nothing. Usually, those movies end up to be campy, unbelievable and quite bad, especially on the story and sfx side.John Wick was the exception in a long time. A tortured soul, who has to do what he has to do, because other force him. And he does it with style and determination.The second chapter takes the setting from the first one and adds more on everything. Brilliant shot, gorgeously lighted, nice locations. And intense and insane action, where the bullets fly and the main actor performs a ballet of (gun) raw fight sequences you simply have to see. And there is, by all means, even humorous moments where you would least expect it.In the seemingly endless barrel that is replaceable, cutout superhero action, John Wick is a class of its own. I saw many groups of women without male dates in my packed cinema. Which means that this series delivers more than just action. It delivers an fresh experience, and the second film fixes probably all problems the first had. This is not ordinary.For quite some time, action fans had troubles to agree ""whats a good action movie?"" if asked. Look at the reviews. This one is easy. Its relentless, its beautiful in its own way - and has an Keanu Reeves, who simply owns the role of an legendary assassin and never lets it go. 9/10. Must see for action fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

No compromise on action in this one, you get every bit of what you saw on the first movie and more. I had little complain that the first movie wasn't much gruesome, but they solved it here less gunshots and more pencils and knifes. They have a good chance at making this a successful franchise.

Keanu shoots more people,"Would it be harsh if I said that many people were actually quite surprised at how good the first 'John Wick' film was? Keanu Reeves' star seems to have waned over recent years and he's hardly the A-lister he once was. However, with such success of the first outing, I guess a sequel was guaranteed. I eagerly sat down to watch 'part 2,' but somehow I didn't feel that lightning has struck twice.The first time round the - seemingly indestructible - titular assassin went on a murderous rampage of revenge because some hoods killed his dog (no, seriously - that's the kind of 'character motivation' we deal with in these films!). This time round, some baddies only go and total his car. Guess what... John Wick doesn't just call his insurance company and hire a rental car until the garage can knock the dents out. He gets pretty much gather every gun not already used by Schwarzenegger and starts shooting people.And he does shoot a lot of people. He travels from one location getting surrounded by baddies who can't really shoot straight (I believe this is now technically called 'Stormtrooper aim') and, if any do manage to scratch him, bullets only seem to graze him slightly. Then he shoots more people in a different setting.And that's about it really. As much as I do enjoy action scenes (some of the shoot-outs in 'The Matrix' were literally revolutionary and nothing had ever been seen like it before in cinema) here it was literally Keanu shooting people. If a film's main selling point is its action, I'd like to see something a bit more original. I know most fans of the genre will probably have seen every hero blast every type of gun in every type of location known to man, but, even now, there are still ways of coming up with something new (think of how the action is portrayed in recent films like 'Kingsman, Shoot 'em Up' and 'Upgrade'). Here, it's just shooting people.At the end of the day, 'John Wick 2' isn't a bad film. I didn't hate it. I just was hoping for something a little more than one generic shoot out after the next. I felt his car 'died' for nothing here.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Amazing car action sequences at the beginning of the movie, followed by some very fun shoot and run scenes, and ending it with a crazy, super entertaining, and stacked, though not as long as I anticipated,final fight scene. Also, the build-up to the main events is so interesting and entertaining.The second chapter of this franchise is a little bit more comedic compared to the first installment of the John Wick movies, which was a really good idea as it added some more flavour to this film.

Revenge is even sweeter in Chapter 2,"Keanu Reeves delivers a supercharged performance as the embattled ex-assassin, John Wick, who gets dragged back in to the world that he desperately wants to escape from. But a marker is a marker and Wick gets forced to pay back a debt he can't refuse. Then everything hits the fan.Even though Chapter 2 is pretty much the same as Chapter 1, this is an even better, amazing film. Wick kills more people than I've ever seen in one movie.Keanu is excellent as Wick, who is always cut up, tired, disshelved, wearing the weight of the world on his shoulders. Tired of everything, except living and killing. Laurence Fishburne is terrific as the bird man who kind of helps Wick out. The Continental Hotel is again central as a sanctuary - no business on the property - or is it? The hotel manager is again excellently played by Ian Mcshane. He has a terrific voice and is a superb actor. I love the role of the Reception Manager, played by Lance Reddick who you will recognize from the Bosch TV series on Amazon.Fast-paced is insufficient to describe the speed of the story, including a terrific chase scene to open the movie. You also get treated to a beautiful trip to Rome and the catacombs, with some wonderful cinematography. The bad guy is an Italian mobster younger guy, and you just can't wait for Wick to slap the entitlement out of his smug little face. Be patient - you may get that or not.Since there is now a Chapter 3 coming out this month May 2019, you know that Wick survives the onslaught in 2. How can they top this? I don't think they can, but if they can even equal it, that will be quite a feat.I can't wait to see Keanu slip into the dirty black suit jacket, with his dog, and his car, and give it his all to defeat the challengers. Will be fun.
For now, Chapter 2 is a big success. Not for the squeamish, but hey, if you like Wick films, you already know that.

And he will not have a romantic dinner with a goo-goo eyed. He is not expected to fall in love with two woman and try to choose one.A well paced action movie, with awesome choreography, believable throws, marksmanship.The movie all in all gives the audience a feeling of an secret organisation, in its own discipline and management, dating back centuries, stricktly controlled, intelligently managed, executed with cold heart.John Wick world is nothing like u have known or encountered. That world is so well filmed, u can see different branches of the organisation, behaving according to their area of service, professionally but slightly in fantasy borders, just enough to make u relate but enough to blow ur mind.Consider all other action movies where lead actors cant run or fight.Then consider this last 10 years how Hollywood lacked and still lacking good plots (maybe good writers) No movie has good written plots. For past 10 years writers cant come with a remarkable work.This is one of the best written (if not the best) pure action movies.İm glad i saw this. Recommend without hesitation.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Very fun, but not quite as much as the first one","POSITIVES:1) I really liked the way in which this film expanded on the world created in the first film. All the different rules and politics of this criminal underworld was really interesting to explore
2) The action scenes are shot superbly and are really fun to watch. I wish all films could shoot action as well as this does
3) I really respect that the film didn't reduce its graphic content to try and get a younger ratingNEGATIVES:1) As fun as it was to see Laurence Fishburne, his performance was sooo over the top and honestly awful. Common wasn't great either
2) I didn't think the first act did a very good job of justifying why this sequel exists. Obviously we know it was because the first film was so successful, but the film still needs to come up with a good reason to exist
3) None of the action sequences were as good as the nightclub sequence from the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worst hit-man in history,"John wick is suppose to be, the best and the baddest hit-man of all. Yet he is as discreet as a bull in china shop, literally.Whenever he kills someone it's never discreet. He is always seen, and always have to shoot a whole bunch of bodyguards.And said bodyguards are as incompetent as wild E coyote. What kind of super secret over the top professional assassins. Start blasting each other in full public view,in a crowded area no less.*******Warning small Spoiler Ahead***********The plot is friggin ridiculous. First he goes to great lengths to kill a half a dozen henchmen's so he can get his beloved car back. Than he wreck the car killing the rest of said henchmen's and have short dialogue with their Russian mob boss.Than leaves in his now totalled car.Not to mention.For being such a pro.He spend way too much time fighting one opponent, when attacked by two or more bad guys. In general he spend way too much time on target,for being a super pro. The choreography is quite horrible. If it was a cartoon,I could accept & overlooked a lot of the stupidity and the flaws in this movie.

"sharp, crisp, atmospheric action movie",This is a very good and entertaining action movie and Keanu Reeves carries it effortlessly. Most of the scenes are done the old-fashioned way (sans-CGI) and the movie is better for it. Plot is simple but mercifully it is in straight line with no deviation from the main goal---get back to fun with imaginative action set pieces. The plot elements are clearly described in the trailer so I will not waste space here. One could argue (nitpicking) that the movies sometimes lacks a genuine tension and if there is a follow- up it would be good to see some of this without changing the general tone. Regardless this is high quality action movie--even for non-action movie lovers!,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Better in some parts, worse in others. Still, a worthy sequel.","The intro was a little bit worrisome; it acts like you never saw the first film as it rushes through a repeat of the first half of the previous narrative. Fortunately after that we get a more consistent film that builds its world further and ends a lot better than the first.The physics are pretty ridiculous and unbelievable, yet the fight sequences still manage to feel grounded and authentic thanks to the excellent stunts on display, and very well planned out sequences.Overall, it's about what I expected from the franchise. A solid follow up that could have easily been much dumber than it was. I'm invested and looking forward to where the third one takes us.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nice Splatter Action Movie,"Nice splatter action movie in order to kill two hours of your time.

"A sequel, for better or worse","When making a sequel, the rule of thumb around Hollywood is to push the action, the blood quantities and the speed up a notch or two. So John Wick 2 follows this rule to the letter, it also follows the first chapter in style, namely the unlikely action scenes are made to look as real as possible. Not synthetic ballet like action but gory bloody fights in which everyone get hurt. That is everyone who's not an innocent bystander. No matter how crowded the scene is, there won't be any collateral damage here. Which means that no matter how real it does look, it's still a movie. But the gritty real appearance does make up for the small plot holes. Keanu Reeves is still within the limited borders of his range and most of the other roles are performed superbly. Ian McShane, is as first class as ever, even if I've seen him doing this role many times before. Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, and almost everybody else on screen are performing at the highest quality possible.But the worst thing that could happened to John Wick is that it will make it big in the box office, since they're already working on chapter 3. And obviously, it'll be bloodier, faster, grittier. It'll make even less sense, but people will die here by the truckload, so who cares, let us all have action galore.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Too much burning the candle at both ends for this Wick?,"2017's ""John Wick: 2"", directed by Chad Stahelski. Starring Keanu Reeves, Riccardo Scamarcio, McShane, Ruby Rose, Lawrence Fishburne, Peter Stomare, John Leguizamo, and Lance Reddick.In the first John Wick movie, we saw a retired hit-man (Reeves), brought out of retirement after his dog was killed by Russian gangsters (Spoiler alert: Reeves came out ahead while proving he was a murderous man of principle). In the sequel, we see Reeves back for more, initially miffed at how his car had been stolen by more Russian gangsters (lead by an over the top Peter Stomare). After sorting out an Uber issue, the film explores more of the ironic principles of the hit-man world. Reeves is given an offer by Scamarcio that he cannot refuse, to kill the titan's sister so that Scamarcio can be the leader of a syndicate. Dispatched to Rome, we see a standard getting-ready-for-action montage as Reeves reluctantly goes to work.Unfortunately (for Reeves), the Italy job is just the tip of the iceberg, as the plot thickens with treachery, bullets, and dynamic subtitles. One of the stranger and most unique action movies around, the sequel expands upon the original's simplicity (and protagonist's blankness), as we see more luxury hotel safe zones for assassins (must be quite the chain), more casual hit men in a universe filled with nothing but them, a homeless group's unlimited kingdom of riches, loyal concierge that double as dog sitters, and a hotel manager who seems to have omnipotent powers. By the end, as Reeves' affectless hit-man is ducking in a ""Enter the Dragon"" crossed with ""Neon Demon""'s set design, we want to ultimately know where this kill fest is going. As an underling states in the beginning of the film- ""Huh. Why don't we just give him back his car?""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A successful sequel,"Adrenaline rush whole throughout the movie. The greatest thing is this movie will hook you to this franchise. This movie gives every bit of the action the first one offered and more. In fact this one had a lot of emotions associated unlike the first one as it was limited to the first half of the movie. This movie dives into John's vulnerability. The cliffhanger, thats the main highlight of the movie. I think they have a successful franchise here. They weren't planning a sequel to the first movie, it was evident in the first half of this movie, where the movie struggles with the plot. But as soon as it gets into the track, it takes you on a exciting trip.
The direction and screenplay was awesome. Action scenes on point.
The cast is the same, nothing much has changed.

Never stab the devil in the back,"The first John Wick (2014) was such an awesome action movie starring Keanu Reeves; It showed how cool Keanu Reeves can be. John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) was remarkably close to being as good as the first, even though I still thought this movie was exceptionally good and fun like the first movie it was not as good as the first movie.Keanu Reeves as John Wick is still fantastic; knowing what he went through in the last movie, having more sad things happen to him in this movie, and being dragged out of retirement because of what he did to get out of his assassin job. Keanu Reeves was still awesome in the action sequences doing great stunt work and a lot of shooting people in the face. He is still believable as an assassin pulled out of retirement trying to set things straight, while also not caring about any consequences for his actions.The action sequences are fun and cool to watch; a lot of them are in beautiful camera long takes with a lot of particularly good cinematography. It is cool seeing Keanu Reeves being skilled in these fighting styles, and how he uses it against enemies. There is particularly a great action sequence in a big party that was fun to watch, and the third act final fight that takes place in some kind of room with mirrors that made it suspenseful to watch.They expanded the assassin world in the movie expanding more about the assassin hotel called The Continental was remarkably interesting on how the rules work and what happens when you defy them. Also, some of the rules in this assassination world and the people who ran certain parts of the high table were interesting, especially when John Wick is going up against them for what they did to him mostly because of this guy named Santino.John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) is a particularly good sequel to a fantastic action movie that I recommend watching if you have not already. They expanded the world these characters live in, and the rules these characters follow and how they survive in a world like this. If you liked the first movie, then you will like this sequel for Keanu Reeves, the great action sequences, and how investing this movie can be.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

John Wick Kills A Lot Of People,"If you've seen the first John Wick movie, you know that Keanu Reeves is John Wick, a retired assassin who comes out of retirement when someone kills his dog. In this one, which begins a week later, matters are still reverberating, and some one has stolen his car, which calls for a lot of carnage. That settled, John is called on to pay off an old debt by helping Ian McShane take over the Assassin's Guild by flying around to Italy, Canada and Manhattan and killing what seems like hundreds of assassins.Ho hum. People who know far more about mixed martial arts than I would ever care to tell me the fight sequences are well done; certainly with all the punching and kicking and stabbing and shooting, Reeves does not come out unscathed. His face is scratched, although his clothes remain spotless. The only sequence noteworthy to me is a series of hand-to-hand fights in a hall of mirrors, which vaguely recalls THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. There are also references in dialogue and composition, to the Matrix trilogy; Laurence Fishburne shows up to make the point.As with so many movies these days, this is a movie you'll like if you like movies like this.

All of those original juicy bits are included in the sequel with even more of everything we loved in the first! The underworld of crime has many levels it seems.

A great action entertainer. Don't miss it if you are an action lover.,"John Wick one of the best action movies of the decade is back. Did you love the John Wick Chapter 1 (Prequel) then Chapter 2 will make you go crazy for the franchise. Director Chad Stahelski, a stunt man himself knows the pulse of the audience and adds what is needed. He has given extreme importance to the action scenes and he succeeds as well.Though the action starts after almost an hour into the movie, the wait is worth. Even the built up for the action sequences are good than the action itself. The initial hour narrates the story and it is better than the prequel (Far better). Chad might be aware that the prequel didn't have depth in the plot.Keanu reeves has given another mind blowing performance. He is a natural in action scenes, his looks and expressions stands long. He utters only less dialogues which adds up the style as John (Thanks to Chad). After Neo, Keanu has got John to stick in our hearts. Riccardo Scamarcio as Antonio has contributed as much as Keanu (Sequel beats prequel this time). He just make phone calls to execute his plans which is better suited for the villain of John.It is difficult to take a franchise to new level, we have seen many directors trying some extravagant addition in each installment of their franchise. But Chad doesn't need all those, rather he does what he does the best. He didn't exaggerate or degrade the franchise instead he did the same as the prequel, but this time far better.John Wick lovers and action lovers will celebrate the movie for sure. The length of the action scenes might feel too much for sure, but I believe it won't be for action lovers. On the whole John Wick Chapter 2 is a great action entertainer. Kudos for the whole team The open ended climax has all possibilities for Chapter 3.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The Man, the Myth, the legend , and the suave.","Chad Stahelski brings back the slickest and most dangerous hit-man alive, John Wick in a whole new thrilling and air punching adventure to bring another perfect cinematic action experience.Following the events of the first film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) after tying up final loose ends, attempts to retire his highly skilled assassin life, but his past indeed catches up again as he is pulled back into the game when an old acquaintance tries to entice Wick into a debt. However as he is forced back into his dark life, things take more of a turn for the worst as he faces a darker world hit men, vengeance, and sharp suits.What could be described as slick cool fashion show of suits, guns and cars is actually more then meets the eye. John Wick (2014) was a hidden gem of a film, that really entered a league of its own in the action genre. What the sequel delivers is really more of what its fans love cranked up to 11. Still fuelled with the wonderfully choreographed violence which I like to describe as beautiful. This also again is shot so professionally Dan Laustsen that makes the action so fluent in one shot with really no cuts.What is the base line in the John Wick universe is the hotel of assassins 'Continental' a very interesting and exciting concept that definitely pulls you in from the first film, and again is a real pleasure to enjoy with Ian McShane being the lead manager of the establishment, and later Lawrence Fishburne chewing up as much scenery as he can gets his hands on. At again Reeves doing more acting with his boy over his voice, which I guess is the heart of Wick's character.Although the world that John Wick lives is a clearly ridicules world of mad violence looking cool while shooting people in the head, this is what makes the films enjoyable. Chapter 2 really does go a bit more mad though, but it doesn't weaken the films purpose. Of course what should be taken from this experience is the enjoyment. I wouldn't call the first Joh Wick a exploitation ""throw away"" movie, John Wick was real new fun and exciting action experience. But Chapter 2 may push us into this characteristic more but does not steal the spirit that the first film gave us.It should be understood that viewers who haven't seen the first one may not take hold of what John Wick Chapter 2 offers. People who are fans of the first film will probably enjoy the sequel, but may not be everyone's cup of tea.Chapter 2 does fail to not quite live up to its predecessor, but still lives up to the fun. Still facing issues with the story and ridiculous suave action Know what your in for John Wick Chapter 2 and don't take very seriously but take it for what it is, because then you can just really enjoy the nonsensical violence of the John Wick world. So if you want to punch the air in fun excitement, which is not provided for you by Fifty Shades Darker, then experience another telling of the impossible legendary hit-man John Wick. 7.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is a quintessential pure bad-ass action sequel ever made in my opinion. I love the first original movie but John Wick Chapter 2 I love to death more than the first one. I would put this movie right with The Raid 2: Berandal. John Wick Chapter 2 is my personal favorite action sequel of all time, that I love it more than the original. This a fast paced entertaining action packed sequel. I am big fan of Keanu Reeves I Love, Love, Love this film to death. It is an entertaining one man army against of all assassins. The film made 40 million budget and 92 million dollars in the US. improvement over the first movieChad Stahelski returned to direct this action packed film and he directed well both of the films I enjoy and love. Keanu Reeves returns as John Wick and the role is written on his skin. Keanu Reeves is excellent as John Wick his best character he ever played who is written on his skin. I think it is Keanu's best performance since The Matrix, Speed, Constantine and Street Kings (John Wick is a new action kick-ass bad-ass action hero.) Like is said I would put John Wick 1 and 2 with The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Raid 1 and 2 and Rambo movies because those 2 John Wick movies are my favorite action films of all time.I love this film I love one man army movies and this is one man-army movie easily my personal favorite film in 2017 and I don't understand the criticism and the hate for this film or the first one. Today we don't see such a good action movies like we had in 80's and 90's. It is rated R most bloody action film there are body's every where. Bad-ass martial arts in the film bad-ass action ever.Here are the reasons to watch this film: A female violinist in the subway pulls out a gun from the violin and tries to kill John, but he subdues her and breaks her neck. A heavyset Asian man goes after John and gets his brains blown out. Two men in the subway try to get in on it, and John brutally kills them with a PENCIL. Cassian finds John as he gets on the subway and fights him in the train. John stabs Cassian and pushes the knife into his aorta. He tells Cassian that if he pulls the knife out, he will bleed to death. John leaves Cassian on the subway. Those are my favorite scenes in the movie.I love John Wick's dog more in the first film than the first one, yes I am an animal lover and Keanu said the dog was trained to obey everything Keanu said. I have a 6 year old white dog Rick at home who I love very much and yes it is a she and she obeys me very much. I love the bond between John Wick and his new dog I love those two on the end running together.Keanu Reeves, Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, John Leguizamo, Peter Stormare, Claudia Gerini and Ian McShane did all a good job in the movie. I care about this characters more than I did in the first one.Why I love this film? Because you have a bad-ass elite of assassins trying to kill John Wick: A female violinist, A heavyset Asian man who looks like sumo wrestler, Cassian and of course Ares (Ruby Rose) the bodyguard and top assassin of Santino D'Antonio. I am not going to say that Ruby Rose was better assassin than Adrianne Palicki I disagree I love Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins more than Ares Ruby Rose that is my opinion. Santino D'Antonio (Ian McShane) was a memorable bad guy.Keanu Reeves, Common and Laurence Fishburne all reunited again for this sequel.

A worthy sequel that expands the storytelling and gives us a superb action movie,"A worthy sequel to one of my favorite action movies, the movie does everything as great as the predecessor but improves in the storytelling with a deeper look into the world of the Assassins and such. With John Wick being an assassin again we get to see him truly in action, from getting the equipment, planning and executing the plan, it's remarkable. Chad Stahelski's stunt and kung-fu background truly makes his vision and directing great as he knows what he is doing and with Derek Kolstad as the writer once again they helped to deliver an even greater movie in a much bigger scale and also keeping the same tone as the previous movie. This movie was a lot better the second time after I watched the first movie the day before I saw this one and I believe it's supposed to be watched that way.The locations are stunning and just flows so good into the story and choreography, thinking mostly about the Rome sequence as that's some quality action sequence mixing suspense with crazy gun fu choreography.The ensemble cast has many returning actors, everyone doing great work but the actors that stand out are Keanu Reeves, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ian McShane, Claudia Gerini and Common.

Our friend executes around 40 bad guys in this movie, and many of them close up with brains blowing all over the walls.The background visuals are stunning in this picture. The backdrops of Rome in particular left me somewhat breathless and a little distracted from the story, but no matter. They are truly beautiful and give a picture of how the genuinely rich really live.A totally loaded movie with a stunning visual landscape, but the extreme violence might be an overload for young children.Loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing visuals,"John Wick: Chapter 2 really showed us some absolutely eye drawing visuals, not gonna lie, the starting sequence at the start was really good and the action was also like DAMN.

A lot more of the same in ways that are great and ways that are disappointing,"""John Wick"" deservedly earned a cult following in 2014 because of the way director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad blended revenge-driven action with martial arts and the aesthetics of both first-person shooter video games and graphic novels. They created this seedy, neon hit-man underworld and tapped perfectly into the strengths of star Keanu Reeves. In ""John Wick: Chapter 2,"" Stahelski and Kolstad bask a little in their first film's unexpected limelight and deliver a film that's in ways satisfying and a little disappointing.The story of the first ""John Wick"" was an emotional cannon shot that never lost momentum. ""Chapter 2"" begins shortly after that film's events with the introduction of the first film baddie's brother (Peter Stormare), a wink acknowledging the action movie cliché of the previous villain's sibling commanding the sequel. This taxi garage sequence acts as more as a cold open/prologue that provides fan service rather than contributing anything to the movie. We don't start to feel that first film's incredible momentum until nearly an hour into the runtime.""Chapter 2"" introduces us to the man who helped John Wick earn his initial ""retirement,"" Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), who visits John's home — just as he finally actually appears to be moving on — to cash in a marker, a very serious blood debt that John must repay if asked. When John refuses D'Antonio's bold job request, D'Antonio blows his house to smithereens. John caves and fulfills the mission (in Rome), but then things take a bad turn for him and he goes on the run.Kolstad carefully generates scenarios that will lead to more moody, dark, superfluous action sequences similar to the first film in which John will take down dozens of armed men at a time. In that modus, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is truly gratifying, but there are times when it feels paint-by-numbers or as though some arbitrary obstacles were needlessly thrown in John's way for the sake of our trigger-happy entertainment. Every action movie can hit a point of desensitization, but this movie hits it early on and then Stahelski largely course-corrects as the stakes get more interesting. The modern art mirror exhibit finale is a bit stylistically on the nose, but everything that happens between when John goes on the run and until then works pretty well.Side by side with ""John Wick,"" however, ""Chapter 2"" doesn't measure up, largely because Stahelski and Kolstad seem more interested in celebrating their initial success through a series of nods rather than focusing on generating new ideas that could expand upon the framework of the first film. Most unfortunately, the film revisits the same exact themes (e.g. can John find peace? Is he as bad as the bad guys he kills? etc.) John takes a step back in terms of character growth and has to go through the whole revenge thing again, only with less powerful motivation.Not to disparage ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" too much, however, because it doesn't run into the usual pitfalls of bad action sequels. Stahelski and Kolstad seem to understand the fine line between acknowledging your initial film's strengths and assets and utilizing them in the right ways versus leaning on them completely and assuming you can set up the same circumstances and deliver a similar result. The novelty of ""John Wick"" was never going to be replicated, and though they certainly could've spent more time building on it and taking risks, fulfilling the essential requirements counts for a lot.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Golden Fleece,"""Chapter 2"" may be an improvement upon the first ""John Wick"" (2014) if only for the hall-of-mirrors sequence. Besides being visually spectacular fight choreography in a kaleidoscopic museum art installation, it does a lot to confirm the suspicion from the last chapter that John is an action-movie Orpheus. Not so much an assassin as a poet, an artist whose guns provide the music, where martial-arts wrestling is a dance, and blood splatter decorates an art gallery like the abstract expressionism of a Jackson Pollock. I also love that such a modern blockbuster production would open with images of silent-film clown Buster Keaton. Another reason for me to consider the later mirrors, which although the filmmakers have specifically cited Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"" (1973) as precedent, as an extension of Charlie Chaplin's ""The Circus"" (1928), although in the noir tradition of the franchise, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1947) also comes to mind.If chapter one was the Greek myth of ""Orpheus and Eurydice,"" of him turning back to the ""underworld,"" in both classical and modern senses of the word, to see his dead wife, then chapter two, although a continuation of the irony of that story--in that continuing to try to hold on to her, he loses her forever (note how he looks at her photograph in his home and what happens soon thereafter)--may also allude to another narrative involving Orpheus: that of the Argonauts and the Golden Fleece, in that the entire struggle John finds himself in is one of authorial rule, the death of one king and the threat of the rise of another. Quarreling gods. Spot on in this regard, too, that instead of an Eastern Orthodox church from the first picture, this one goes to the Vatican, the seat of the Roman Catholic Church.For gods, power and art (as well as satisfying the sequel coda of world travel), one can't do any better than Rome and what lies therein--in addition to the Romans having been the first, long before the ""John Wick"" franchise, to adopt Greek mythology to their own dictates. Heck, the entire worldbuilding could be a fall of Rome metaphor, for all I know. The old beside the new; ruins from the era of gods next to the cathedrals of the God (especially love the catacombs action); modernist and futurist paintings centuries old among a conceptual art installation from the future, modern day; silent films with trains upon skyscrapers rising above car-and-motorcycle chases below. Where Wick seeks an answer to escape his impossible position, or marker, and threat of excommunication in the underworld, Ares, the god of war, is literally mute.And, wow, as if this franchise didn't already have plenty of veterans from that other Keanu Reeves-starring, martial-arts shoot-'em-up series, ""The Matrix,"" they went ahead, anyways, and cast Morpheus himself, Laurence Fishburne, as, well, nominally the ""Bowery King"" of a mafia of beggars, but, really, he's playing Morpheus again. See, he was once ""saved"" by John; he had to ""make a choice."" Moreover, John goes to sleep, symbolically and likely literally given what he'd just endured, after asking to see the King. He, then, after passing by ""Jesus saves"" signage, is granted his dream (to an extent) and transported to his mirrored metamorphosis. Also interesting to note how that climactic sequence is a call back to his mission in Rome, which culminated in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) type multi-plane reflections. In other words, great mirror motif--even the earlier rain reflections through the windows of Wick's home, or the numerous times characters are thrown through glass. Metamorphosis, mirrors as movies, reflections of the soul, the nature of self.Ancient mythological narratives to Catholic doctrines, silent films, neon noir and a mirror motif, gun-fu as ballet, including again as played before a musical concert, blood splatter beside Pollocks, an Italian civil war planned in front of a painting of the Italian Civil War, fighting amidst a museum of paintings and sculpture and within glorious architecture, where characters with fine suits and tattoos are even wearing the art, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an action movie as art exhibit. The journey, the descent, for whatever MacGuffin doesn't so much matter; just appreciate the beauty of the Golden Fleece itself.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Harsh critics would rate this a 5/10,"John wick the first time around was so fun because it was short, straight to the point, and just an amazing action movie. When you make sequels, you have to find away to keep building the plot in a way that you shouldn't be able to predict certain things. This movie was more of a ""Hey, we are gonna give you this movie because you will enjoy the action"" and yes i did enjoy it. Chapter 2 is also longer than the first movie so i guess i expected more from the plot.

An action movie how it should be!,"John Wick was a blast and a welcome addition to the action genre, like ""Dredd"" or ""Punisher: Warzone"", it was pure action without much distraction. Chapter 2 follows that path. It starts of kind of slow, but maybe I just expected little too much, you can't do action and acrobatic head shots all the time. But after the stage is set, John Wick is doing what John Wick is doing best. And it's just a hell of a good time to watch him doing that. And the one-liner he delivers are cheesy but still great. Maybe one comparison that comes to mind would be John Woo's ""Hard-Boiled"" or ""The Killer"". It's like a John Woo flick if he wouldn't suck now.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

You will be astonished by the way things turn out like wick's connections and the marker which starts the spree. Coming to the highlights of the film, the conversation between Ian McShane(Winston) and Keanu Reeves(John wick) is top notch, especially the way Keanu Reeves pronounces makes the talk extraordinary.

Wild Wild Wick,"If there ever was a great videogame movie, it'd be John Wick. Its everything a gamer would love in a movie: a paper-thin plot where you don't have to exert your brain, a motive to kick ass and then kick ass like there's no tomorrow; all leading to a satisfying conclusion. John Wick did just that and excelled at it. Its not everyday you get to see a man hell bent on seeking revenge coz someone killed his dog. In a day and age where audiences are slapped and saturated with a superhero movie almost every second month, the directors had also crafted an enjoyable action flick.Sequels are always at the receiving end of biting criticism and with good reason too. Sequels, be it to a good movie, a game or a book, they try hard to up the ante, top its predecessor by doing the same crap again & again (Quote Einstein here) and fails miserably at it. There are only a handful of movie sequels which actually bested its first outing. Chapter Two of John Wick's saga picks up exactly where the first left off and there on its another fight to the finish. Emphasis on FIGHT to the FINISH. The movie wastes no time to put you into the thick of action and boy, does it feel good to see John playing an orchestra with those guns.Where Chapter Two wins is it knows exactly what to do to please its audience. People who loved the original will definitely feel right at home, people who wants more are obviously served more plot, more action and more characters and people who wants a great ending are also satisfied to a certain extent. Chapter Two recycles the best elements of John Wick and adds a bit more depth and a lot more action and never forgets where it belongs. While John Wick's premise was laughably good, Chapter 2 let's you go indepth into the organization Wick works for. It ain't anything groundbreaking but the organizations's rules and mechanisms are put into good use and serves for a good plot device.Keanu Reeves had been the butt of memes and jokes for a while now. While he wasn't always known for his acting prowess, he was always known for his style. I was a fan and I am still a fan. There are pitfalls in any actor's career and he's gone through hell of a lot. John Wick was a well deserved break for the guy. He'd put in a lot of effort in the role and it showed. And its no different here, Chapter 2. The supporting cast were pretty good too starting from Ian McShane as Winston, the seemingly innocent owner of the Continental hotel and Lance Reddick as the all-welcoming receptionist of the same. Ruby Rose as Ares, a mute femme fatale and the same goes for Common as Cassian both out for planting a bullet in Wick's head. Reeves' old 'mentor' returns in Chapter Two, yep, Lawrence Fishburne returns as an eccentric, semi-preaching crime lord but does the job well for his meagre screen time. My only disappointment was Santino D'Antonio as the lead antagonist, he did give Wick a hard time but the guy just didn't cut it for me neither was he an intimidating villain.Dan Laustsen is a name I haven't heard much prior to Chapter Two, but he does a decent job in bringing out Rome as well as New York to life. The total standout is the score from Tyler Bates and it just blew me away. I never paid attention to the score in John Wick, but in this one, the themes are much more apt syncing perfectly with the scenes and it definitely stands out.Try listening 'John Wick Reckoning' and tell me you didnt love it. Chances are that if you loved the movie, you're gonna love the score too.If I had to discuss flaws it would be the complete disregard of the open violence that was happening on screen. I do believe the justification would be so that these are trained assassins and they can be super silent killers. Chapter Two also lacks a bit of emotion which was what visibly motivating John Wick in the first movie.While it disheartens me to see a man running and gunning around for his life, unable to mourn for his dead wife and to get some peace, John Wick and Chapter Two has set a perfect example how to create a good old school action movie. Chapter Two's action was fluid and less of that motion-blur nonsense. Its well choreographed and packs a punch, the gun play felt orgasmic and there were some melee sequences that made me cringe. Calling it 'Hyper-violent' would be an understatement coz while John Wick actually laid ground to a violent action movie, Chapter 2 takes it to whole new level and believe me it just feels badass. Its definitely not GREAT, but John Wick franchise proves that you don't need superheroes to have an enjoyable action flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Suave and brutal,"The follow-up to 2014's surprise smash hit is much the same of what came before. And it's brilliant. Completely, unashamedly, couldn't-give-a-damn brilliant. It sticks close to its barebones formula: Wick reluctantly comes out of hit-man retirement, some idiot decides to double cross him, Wick goes on a killing spree that makes Rambo look like a humanitarian. The simplicity of the plot allows director Chad Stahelski—with his extensive background in action choreography—to focus on what is most important; brutal, balletic and innovative set pieces. Combining bruising close quarters combat, methodically stylish gun battles and subwoofer-breaking car carnage, the action sequences are rushes of pure adrenaline. The second act showpiece set in the Colosseum is an early contender for best set piece of the year. What amplifies the awesomeness of the action is the lack of rapid editing and messy cuts, the lengthy, uninterrupted shots showcasing not only the classy choreography but also the immense effort put in by Keanu Reeves to perform majority of the stunts. Reeves has long been known as a dedicated action star ever since his gigantic input into the Matrix trilogy, however, at age 53, his commitment is as astounding as ever. He's crafting John Wick—all stoic heroism and suave ferociousness—into a memorable action hero. John Wick: Chapter 2 offers no surprises narratively or tonally, but delivers all the imaginative, kick-arse action you could ask for in a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Action,action,action,action and even more action !","""I'm not that guy anymore. You are always that guy, John.""Once again I couldn't withhold myself from watching a sequel, although I knew it probably would be a watered down version of the original. And yet I could not resist it. And after re-reading my review of the first movie ""John Wick"", I can only conclude that I was right about that. The final sentence I wrote was as follows: ""I admire Reeves that he's still capable to portray a character as Wick at his age of 50 and bring this kind of personage to a higher level, but I'm afraid that this sequel will be a weak carbon copy from the original."" . Unfortunately, I was right.The only difference with the first movie is the amount of fake blood they've used. Again, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) acts with extreme effrontery and he leaves a pile of bodies behind. The fight scenes, with lots of onrushing guards being killed with a well-aimed head shot, are bloodier than in the previous movie. As for the rest, the structure of the story is the same. This time it's not stealing Wick's car and killing his puppy that starts off an unprecedented revenge action. Nope, the retired assassin is required to perform a task commissioned by Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio). A task he can't refuse because of an old code among assassins. The initial refusal is the cause for a drastic revenge, after which Wick is forced to carry it out anyway. The asked execution has such a negative impact on Wick's surroundings and gives rise to even more over the top violence and action packed moments.Obviously the emphasis in this second movie is focused on the action segments. Once again, the story itself is pretty thin and the lack of depth when talking about the characters is omnipresent. But ultimately, this lack is just an advantage. This way they could focus completely on the well-choreographed action-scenes that follow each other at a fast pace. I am convinced that the number of eliminations is a lot higher here. It was a prudent attempt to further deepen the story about the assassination syndicate and the neutral area in the shape of the Continental Hotel. Interesting? Yes. Necessary? No not really. You know what the movie ""John Wick"" stands for and that's what you want to see. Sheer brutality, violence and a lot of action. And fortunately, they were very successful in that respect.I wasn't particularly impressed by it this time. Even though they moved Wick's work-space to a more imaginative location and the images from Rome are more eye-catching than those of New York, I got the impression that this movie simply exploited the success of the first part shamelessly. Even Keanu Reeves didn't have to do his utter best. Granted. The man is very suitable for this role. John Wick's cool-blooded, stoic gaze and the limited use of dialogues are characteristics which are tailor-made for Keanu Reeves. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a logical sequel to the unexpected success of the first movie. If you are a lover of the better action-movie, this is definitely is something to watch. Now you'll also see how the myth John Wick can kill someone with a pencil. Personally, I think it's time Wick starts to think about his retirement!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Seriously excellent car-fu stunt driving and by the end it doesn't really matter that much that the car being retrieved isn't really much of a car anymore.JW wants to again retire but gets a visit from an Italian assassin who hands him a marker, basically an IOU coin, which JW must honour as this man helped him leave the assassin life 5 years earlier to be with his then living wife, Helen. The Italian wants his sister dead so that he can ascend to the High Table, a group of powerful assassins. JW at first refuses and feels the wrath of the angry Italian but thereafter realises if he doesn't help this Italian that his life will be in danger. JW travels to Rome to kill the Italian's sister. He gets a nice new suit, guns himself up and heads to the nightclub to kill the sister. JW finds the sister and allows her to die the way she wants to die but before leaving the nightclub bumps into the sister's bodyguard, played by rapper/actor/film producer/poet Common and then the kung-fu/gun-fu begins again. The killing was so hectic that I unfortunately forgot to do a body count. But it was full on, action packed and looked bloody convincing to me and the best thing is not one innocent person got shot. Bloody dam near perfect to me. JW and Common chase each other through the crowded streets in Rome but JW manages to make it back to the Continental Hotel (the safe haven) so they can't kill each other. In true assassin code they sit down and have a drink together at the bar and JW tells Common that the Italian ordered him to kill the sister.When JW heads back to New York the Italian decides to double cross him and puts a $7M bounty on his head. Now everyone in New York City wants to kill John Wick! ""I heard he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil, a f**g PENCIL...!"" Secret assassins from every nook and cranny in New York City come out to try their luck at killing the Boogeyman. JW again bumps into Common, this time on the subway and a fight ensues. An extremely entertaining and stylised gun-fu chase happens with the every day public none the wiser to the attempted killing, either that or they are just too used to that sort of stuff going down...JW then bumps into an old assassin Morpheus (sorry, I mean Laurence Fishburne). They sit and reminisce about old times and how JW once spared Morpheus' life and that Morpheus should now help Neo (sorry, I mean JW). Morpheus tells Neo where to find the Italian. There is no mention of a red or blue pill...JW heads off to find the Italian before he takes his place at the High Table of assassins. People die. Lots of people. Brilliant gun-fu chase through a hall of mirrors exhibition in the museum (where the hell did they hide the cameras and production crew for this scene?). Deaf/mute girl (Ruby Rose) who is an assassin associate of the Italian fights JW here. He finally catches up with the Italian at the Continental after every other person in New York City is dead (I'm pretty sure). Winston (who runs the Continental) informs John that the High Table have marked him as ex-communicado and doubled the bounty on his head to $14M - every assassin in the whole wide world will be after him now! Because Winston is JW's mentor he gives him one hour to escape before putting the word out about the new bounty. He runs off into New York City with his unnamed pit bull in tow. This is where the third instalment of John Wick will begin from.Acting - 5/5 - All characters held up well, were convincing Storyline -5/5 - rather detailed story line, I especially like how they write the dialogue on screen to emphasise it, or to translate it from Italian/Russian, or if it is hard to understand the foreigner's English Action sequences - 5/5 - the pre-movie training involved in the kung-fu, car-fu and gun-fu is outstanding. I especially liked the gun handling skills that JW portrayed in the film Cinematography - 5/5 - the buildings they filmed in, the camera angles used, the lighting (lots of scenes of JW half in/half out of light), the use of colour (or lack of it) in the film People I want to see in the next instalment - John Wick (obviously...), Morpheus, Winston, Helen (they have kept his dead wife so mysterious), unnamed pit bull, the guy that fixes up his car.The movie showed great insight into the underground workings of the assassin world and in doing so set it up well for a third instalment. The film was directed by Chad Stahelski. Chad was Keanu Reeves stunt double in The Matrix trilogy. For that reason alone, I believe the John Wick movies are THE BEST action films of all time. Realistic and hardcore. John Wick the character, even though he is an assassin, is likable. He only kills the bad dudes. Not one innocent bystander gets hurt. He loved his wife, he loved his puppy and he loves his car. John Wick: Chapter 2 is as good as the first movie and I highly recommend that you see it on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A thrilling, action packed sequel","Opening four days after the first film ended we see retired hitman John Wick retrieving his car... inevitably this includes a fair amount of violence. Following this prologue he returns home and is approached by Santino D'Antonio, a senior Mafioso who wants John to do a job for him... go to Rome and kill his sister so he can take the top position in their organisation. John declines despite having given the man his marker. Soon it becomes clear he has no choice. The job isn't going to be easy as his target is well protected and Santino doesn't want any loose ends... Wick is considered a loose end.The first film may have had more emotional depth but that doesn't mean this is inferior. It is action packed from start to finish. There are only brief lulls in the action as the job is explained and Wick gets the equipment he needs for the job. Even these quieter scenes are fun as Wick and his arms supplier talk about firearms as if he were discussing what to eat with a waiter at an upmarket restaurant. The action scenes are full-on with numerous bad guys being shot, stabbed and even dispatched with a pencil. It is delightfully over the top at times; I loved how just about every other person in New York appeared to be a hitman keen to get the seven million dollar reward for killing Wick. Keanu Reeves does a fine, no-nonsense, job as Wick and the rest cast are solid even if their roles are much smaller. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of full on action.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A slaughterhouse,"This movie is basically identical to the first one: John Wick slaughters hundreds of people with his guns, karate-chops their necks and breaks their arms. I like the assassins network with the hotels (Franco Nero, my favorite actor, being one of the managers). The ""John Wick"" series is not very original, but the constant fight scenes are so cool that the movies are worth watching. You can tell Keanu Reeves practiced his fight moves hardcore. Keanu Reeves is an ok pick for John Wick, since he's usually the quiet type and that fits John Wick's persona: A gentle loving guy who happens to be the worlds greatest assassin. I'm going to watch the next one now.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Never Stab The Devil In The Back,"""Matrix"", The Wachowskis' pinnacle work and reforming of the 1990s action films, announced sinuously some of the most superb and appealing minds (and faces) in the nonstop action movies.Two of Neo's stunt doubles, the emblematic main lead played by Reeves, have rebuilt and invigorated a genre which gradually verges on the inadmissible to entertain; they, like The Wachowski, burst in the middle of bullets and blood with touches of black humor, martial arts and choreographed nearly sublime aesthetics in their directional debut ""John Wick"".Unthinkable was its commercial and critical splendor, which cooperated driving the evident continuation of The Boogeyman's story in order to dilate and delve into Hotel Continental's registered assassin universe.Like any sequel, it runs the risk of withering that eccentric formula which dazzled in the first installment, on the contrary, and miraculously—keeping in mind unpleasant second parts about films of today,— this is much more violent, much darker, much more brutal and a lot better made than the original. Jonathan is back with another dog, other gadgets, and another reason to kill.Leitch isn't director here, however, thanks to his deafening first movie, has been set to direct ""Deadpool 2"" and thriller war ""Atomic Blonde"". His colleague, Stahelski, is the sole director of ""Chapter 2"", and has signed for ""Highlander,"" a sci-fi film. His years as stuntman were enough to absorb the most magnanimous pieces of knowledge, ideas shining in the hands of Derek Kolstad, an eloquent and congruent screenwriter with the development of his story, which fits together like geometric pieces the star character.Wick has not concluded the singular self-compensation in the name of his adorable pet, just one item needs to be crossed out in the list of the refrigerator: his car. After ""recovering"" his costly auto, he determines to absolve himself of that Russian mafia and that hotel which tore his life down once and for all, nevertheless, his first free nap is hampered by recent ghosts. Now, Jonathan must go back to his life as a gun killer to finalize a pact that involuntarily reopened. The problem is that he'll have to do it with an auction for 7 million dollars to his back, meaning each assassin in Rome or New York is behind his steps. A cocktail of bullets, blood, neat beauty and action to its maximum expression.A cult movie wasn't adequately entertained and conscientiously filmed like this one for a long period, which converts it into the best action feature film in recent months, excelling by far to Tom Cruise's, Liam Neeson's or Jason Sthaman's adventures. Its director understands how to build up the frantic scenes with readable shots, static angles, sketched fights and a gleaming visual status quo accompanied by myriad elements convening a great cinematic banquet, where morbidity, injuries, and amorality don't distort behind the PG-13 rating. He knows the legacy which is in his hands, his mission is to keep it up and as one would expect of any sequel, developing better and bigger things, for example: one substitute pet, a new classic scene and foes as complex as realistic strengthening the plot with subtitles on screen, silent shootings into a jam-packed subway or an emblematic final confrontation in the hall of mirrors; a crystal glassware that diffracts danger with blue and red neon lights.Reeves, a loathed and idolized actor in equal measure returns strengthened to the role which gave back him contemporary glory: John Wick. This time, the man exhibits solid convictions which justify his vindictive ire; actions are savage and remorseless, nonetheless, aftermath are serious enough to continue stirring up his wrath which has held since his spouse's death. Wick may be a killing machine, but in his emotional level stands out his self- awareness. Rome comes with special guests, who supply empathic and outstanding performances, from a fatal mute lady, portrayed by an always excellent Ruby Rose, to malicious and scowling Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), from a violent Cassian (Common) to old well-known Laurence Fishburne, into what seems a brief cameo.Artistic determinations are equal and even more unusual than narrative ones, in a neo-noir story where the politically incorrect decisions are the first happening, emphasizing in capital letters the unexpected twist (shot) inside the Hotel. It's difficult to see such levels of elegance and repugnance combined in an action movie. Among so many compliments and wise choices, the most remarkable is its amazing mise-en-scène, photography, and staging; they're sublime and imposing, stunning and superb, images exceeding their expression limits together with a soundtrack that points to the audience's heart; a blood ceremony grotesque sensibly as to admire the beauty of human nature. From neon colors to Romanesque streets, from car chases in the rain to shootings in underground caves with heavy music, from nudes to stab-wounds; night or day, city or plain, the filmmakers employed all their tools.""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is the correct sequel for first installment's eccentricities; the sequences and twist plot don't let down, by the contrary, duplicate the effective results with daring performances, exquisite scenarios and a cinematography that will leave real film lovers astounded. Ironically, the smallest details are which work against it, however, are harmless but visible. Wick ends with a beautiful open ending, which will culminate in a third and possibly last part of the life of a man seeking redemption, revenge, and peace. A cocktail of radiant narrative, artistic and technical decisions. ""Wick"" is the film that any twenty-first-century action motion picture would wish to be. An aggressive, hectic and subversive experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Burning the Candle At Both Ends.,"Starting soon after the conclusion of the first film, Keanu Reeves returns to another stint of what he does best, highly choreographed fighting and emoting terribly.Word of Wick's re-emergence has spread around the organised crime community and prove particularly interesting to Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) a passed over Gomorrah boss, to whom Wick owes a blood debt. Dante calls this in and refuses to take Wick's ""please ... no ... don't do this"" for an answer - blowing up his house. Out for revenge, but bound by the code of Assassins, Wick agrees to the job.Your opinion on John Wick 2 is likely to be pretty similar to your opinion of the first one, as it is, generally, more of the same. It's fair to say it's not quite as good, just by virtue of being so similar to the first it doesn't have the same effect. Also expectation is much higher now, whereas the first film came out of nowhere. My opinion though is that they are very welcome additions to the action genre, disregarding CGI heavy combat, or blurry heavily cut nonsense, for proper choreographed action, performed by stuntman and to an impressive amount by Keanu himself. The body count is high and the action is brutal, although not without is comedic moments too. Direction (and art direction) is excellent and the creation of the hyper stylised world that Wick inhabits is really strong.Acting in the film is . . . interesting. As if to counter act Keanu downplaying everyone else chews the scenery with abandon, none more than Lawrence Fishburne who clearly enjoys bellowing his lines at the top of his voice. Ian McShane isn't far behind and neither is Riccardo Scamarcio, twirling his metaphorical moustache as the films primary antagonist.Chastising the films realism is, for me, missing the point. Finding it dull or repetitive I can appreciate, even if I don't necessarily agree - but it's clearly not supposed to be set in the real world. There isn't really an assassin's hotel in the Flat Iron Building, people sewing Kevlar into Italian suits or a worldwide cabal of organised crime. You want to drive yourself really crazy, trying working out the exchange rate for what the gold coins are worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best action/drama films of all time - part 2!,"The first John Wick did to action films as Bruce Lee did to Martial Arts films. One would expect a sequel to that would be hard to top. Well, not in the case of John Wick: Chapter 2. This is another action film with an amazing story that's as real as it gets. The writing was sheer perfection, and a very nice sequel to the first story, that I though would never be topped. Once again, you feel like you are right there in front of all the tension. Incredible directing, cinematography, choreography, editing, sound and perfectly cast. This is one of the best action/drama films of all time, right next to the first John Wick! Keanu Reeves nails his role once again, and has beat his legendary role in the Matrix with this outstanding production. I can't wait for Chapter 3! It's another perfect 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterful Stylised Action,"If John Wick (2014) afforded an introduction to the Boogeyman, this Chapter offers evidence to substantiate the reputation.As with the first part the story in this segment is very very simple and straightforward. And this is a such a huge relief. Much like the first film, JW2 has a character driver plot and very impressive action sequences.Personally, for me the cinematography in this part is brilliant and more refined than the prequel. The action has been choreographed and captured really well. There are many great sequences in the movie.The movie has all trademark elements of a Reeves flick. To be fair, there are some moments in the movie that seem repetitive and slightly dull or overdone.To me this could have been tackled better. the movieHowever, the director is a man of focus. The entire onus is on the slick action scenes and character deification.While the first part merely introduced the social setting with the "" unwritten"" law under which the characters operate this one elaborates the social setting . Do not expect a philosophical charged setting or deep dialogue. The plot is simple.The cast does a fairly decent job as before. Though their performance is marginally compromised due to the lack of novelty.On the whole it is a good solid action movie in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sad,"As much as I loved original John Wick, I couldn't make myself to watch Chpater 2. Looks good, no doubt, played well, quality is through the roof. But... no more interesting than another comics movie. Really pointless and absurd.

In second part mystery turned into farce...",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Very Fun Sequel to a really good film,"Plot: After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.This was a fun sequel to a film that grew on me overtime, I won't get too much into the story since I do want people to see it before it leaves theaters, Keanu Reeves is so good as this character showing us that he can act unlike what other people say. The rest of the cast also do a very good job particularly Common who has some of the best scenes of the movie with Keanu. The action in this film is very well handled using zero shaky cam and instead using wide shots which lets us see what's going on unlike certain action films. I wish certain filmmakers would take a lesson from this film to know how you should shoot action, but that's just me.The only negatives I have are the little pacing issue in the beginning especially one scene that could've been cut down by a minute or two and that the villain wasn't particularly interesting, although the actor playing him was fine, I wish they got someone that would've made the character more interesting.Besides that, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a really good sequel to a really good film that is worth your time and money. You won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Can we let the man rest !,"""Consider this a professional curtesy""
Chapter 2 takes everything that made the first movie work and dialled it up a notch. This movie has more action, more brutality and leans a bit more into story telling.The first thing I notice about this movie is the struggle John is going through, with all his might he does not want to return to the life he once lived but now after the events of the first movie it's out there that John is active again which leads the story, john had given a marker and now it has come back to haunt him as he must carry out a task that will be difficult and the repercussions form the movie!The action is as good and it not better than the first, every fight he is in, his body flows like water and he is in every right position, the arsenal of weapons is also expanded, get get some great gun fights and knife fights. The hand to hand is accompanied usually by a knife in this one and it's so good.The cast is great, the music is awesome, these are just damn good movies, another rare occasion where the sequel is as good as the first and for a lot of people arguably better.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick became a mix between Jason Bourne and Kingsman and I am not sure if I like it,"It was a good film, moderate I can say...With a lot of movie clichés of course, John Wick Chapter 2 is a mix between Jason Bourne and Kingsman because it is full of action (fighting, shootings, high-tech weapons, etc) and...comedy ?! Yeah, comedy, it made me laugh at some scenes even if it was not suppose to I think... Keanu Reaves is a rock-star yes, and these John Wick films are representing his reborn as an action-hero character...Some would say John Wick is the new Neo from The Matrix, you will decide that after you see this one !",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Wick - Chapter 2: He  REALLY is the Batman with guns this time!,"Let's say the bunch of good things first, and after I tell some little issues that I have with the movie.The soundtrack is GREAT! Really, I mean, John's theme song is one of the most bad-ass track's I ever see. Right on the beginning of the movie there is a wonderful scene, with bad-ass fight's, and all that stuffs that we want in a action movie, and the track plays a big role on that.I said that for the first one, I said that for Matrix, and I will keep saying that for every action movie that Keanu Reeves do it: HE IS A GENIUS!OMG, really, the guy simple destroys in every action scene of the movie, and is so satisfying to see a good action scene, that is film in the right way, without a billion of cuts! It's really so good to see. Well, besides that, I really think that the first movie had more memorable scenes (like that one on the club), there isn't one specific scene of this one that people will talk forever or something like that. Buut, even though, there are a lot great scenes, with great ""OMG! WTF!?"" moments, like when he KILLS A GUY WITH A PENCIL! Or shoot in other guy's balls! The action scenes are undoubtedly the best thing of this franchise.I really don't have much to say about the actors, on the dialogues part, they are, in the majority, fine. Keany Reeves, as we already know, is the best bad actor out there, so, he's fantastic once again. The main villain, I mean, is ""fine"" too, i don't know, the guy didn't convince myself. The only one that I really thought was great is Ian McShane (he's by far the best actor in the main cast, so that isn't a surprise I think).There are some silly things about the movie that I think that some people might find it annoyed. Like, HOW IN THE HELL can a guy be a good hit-man if EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM?! Kkkkkkkkk, well, but this doesn't take away the shine of the movie to me at all. In fact, I really thought it was funny for the majority of the time, so I enjoy it a lot (it's like every time that he leaves a place, someone has to say ""good hunting, Mr. Wick"" or something like that. Literally, EVERY TIME! A M A Z I N G !).Now, seriously, it's seen to me that they really get out of the box on this movie, and kind of change the vibe of the franchise (well, this time he is really a fusion of the Batman and the Punisher. Literally, there is a scene that he use's his suit like a Bat-cape, to avoid the shoots. In the first movie, the vibe was kind different, like a underground, and visceral action thriller). But, I think that is fine, will probably be more difficult to build a franchise based of on the first one lonely. I strongly believe that they aren't able to do another one good as the first, but, well, it's OK, isn't? As long as they keep doing good movies (like John Wick 2 is), they will have my money, they doesn't need to do fantastic movies (like ""John Wick"") for that.In short, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a great movie, really entertaining, and another lesson to a lot of directors out there of how to shoot action scenes.8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
the second instalment,"Ah yes the second movie in the john wick trilogie, an awesome sight to behold. this movie had a little bit more cheesyness in its plot(if there even was any plot) yet it did succeed to improve on its visual narritive with stunning visual displays on its composition and mastery of the cinematography. The dog this time around is even more cuter and it did what i could given its last bits of plot to work off of from the last movie. Although in bitter taste i have to say that this movie lives up to its role as a John Wick movie.10/10 would watch again for doggo.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
