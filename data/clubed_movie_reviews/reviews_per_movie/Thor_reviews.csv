Thor proves a strong contender,"In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director, it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare, but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the larger-than-life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki, who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain, and more of a misguided soul, trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father, making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads, Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor, first as the brash, acting-before- thinking hero, and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor, and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston, working with the somewhat subdued (at first) Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak, malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers, peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.Thor isn't without its weak points, however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought, rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop, it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role, but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.Once again, Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version, with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An immensely enjoyable Marvel entry that complements the tone of Iron Man films,"I watched this last night at a preview screening in London.I prayed that Kenneth Branagh would learn from his mistakes with handling a big budget movie, namely his Frankeinstein. Thankfully, I am glad to say he learnt a great deal from those mistakes. Of course, this is no Henry V, this is just pure popcorn entertainment but a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to Thor for the big screen. Chris Hemsworth played the part with a lot of energy, charisma and I have to admit from a bloke's point of view, annoying good looks. Anthony Hopkins added much needed heavyweight presence as Odin but its a role he has quite frankly played a gazillion times but I never tire of it, so I'm not complaining. In a year long span of brilliantly playing vastly different roles from psychotic to swashbuckling heroine, Natalie Portman this time plays the sweet determined scientist girl who falls for the strangely mannered good looking guy. Nothing too taxing for any of them but they do give a re-assuring aura about them.The visuals were quite spectacular, mainly, the sweeping canvas of Asgard. The action scenes were also good though I thought could have been executed better with lesser use of the fast cut edit style that is too often the norm in action film these days.There is plenty of humour when Thor is on Earth but not in a put-off way as there is a suitable contrast of a serious tone with everything set in Asgard. Even though the storyline was somewhat predictable, it was still a riveting one.For those like me, who were concerned about how Thor fits into the established Marvel connected universe set by the Iron Man films need not worry. That is just another thing that Branagh and crew pulls off very well. We can now fully embrace the forthcoming Avengers where a God, a man who transforms into a giant green beast, and a man who flies in a hi tech amour suit can share the same screen. So its all coming together nicely.And make sure you stay for the end credit scenes. In case you did not know of this before, I urge you to go back to the previous films (Iron Man 1 & 2, Incredible Hulk) and watch the end of credit sequences if you haven't already. They tell a separate story strand that will culminate to a certain upcoming Marvel movie. The end credit sequence of Thor is the most fascinating yet as it actually takes a major plot development in the story strand ;) And it was the longest bloody end of credit sequence I've ever seen in any movie! One last thing, the film I saw was in 3d and once again, it practically nearly ruined all the action scenes for me. In the non action scenes, it was pretty useless and just simply made the film much darker.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Kenneth Branagh adds heavy dramatic depth to an already quite-unusual superhero flick,"Alright, back when this was into preproduction, I (and so many comic book fans) were surprised when Branagh was slated to direct. Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.Thankfully, this helps. A lot.Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there's a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.Here's another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there's some action bits that are not too well-filmed.All is forgiven though - ""Thor"" is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that's fine enough by me. I didn't see anything worth watching in 3D in it.Overall rating: 68/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"Thor is a film that takes risks - and they pay off wonderfully. The movie grounds itself in reality while keeping a mythological and fantasy-esqe tone, and it never loses sight of the humanity within the characters, with elevates this above standard superhero fare.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun movie,"Great movie! Has a comic book feel to it. The storyline is very well done! I love how they show Asgard and explain how everything fits into place. The humor is very tasteful, but can be oddly quirky in places. Lots of fun action. The only thing that could have used some improving was the way they filmed the movie. The shakey camera and weird angles are a little annoying, but the rest of the film makes up for this. Very good choice in the cast, could not have picked a better actor for Thor or Loki. Natalie Portman's part isn't the best. She has cheesy lines and her acting doesnt flow right, even though she is a talented actress. She does better with serious parts inatead of light and comical. This movie is very clean and makes a great fun movie for the entire family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining Adventure,"In 965 D.C., in Tornsberg, Norway, the Frost Giants from Jotunheim led by King Laufey (Colm Feore) attack the locals, and the Allfather Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the warriors of Asgard protect the humans and win the battle against the invaders. They take their source of power and bring it to Asgard and they start an armistice with Jotunheim.When three Frost Giants break in Asgard trying to retrieve their source of power, they are destroyed by the Destroyer. The arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) decides to attack Jotunheim with his stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and four Asgardian warriors and disobeys the order of his father Odin. In order to avoid war against Jotunheim, Odin removes the powers of Thor and exiles him on Earth to live among the humans. Odin also throws his hammer Mjölnir to New Mexico and orders that only the one that is worth will get the powerful hammer and achieve Thor's powers.In Puente Antigo, New Mexico, the physician Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is researching a phenomenon in the desert with her professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and her mate Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). Out of the blue, Thor is hit by Jane's truck and she takes him to the hospital. Thor unsuccessfully tries to retrieve Mjölnir that is protected by agents of the government SHIELD. When the Machiavellian Loki sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor, he needs to retrieve his hammer to save not only the humans, but also his Allfather Odin and Asgard from the evil Loki.""Thor"" is an entertaining adventure based on the character of the comic book published by Marvel Comics. Natalie Portman is usually the synonym of a good movie and she is delightful in the role of a scientist. The plot is funny and the scenes with the human Thor; the Nordic black gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba); and the Vikings and Gods speaking in English are hilarious. The special effects are top-notch and the viewer may bring the popcorn and delight with a pleasant family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Thor""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is Thor!,"This is Thor! Not the guy in Ragnarok and Love and Thunder. The plot for this movie is a simple and easy to follow movie with a like able villain. I will say the movie did not have me engaged. The theme is the generic ""Who am I? What's my potential?"" theme. The acting and dialogue is good. And the editing is well paced and the effects are good for 2011. I love the music as it fits the cosmic and mythology side of things. There's not much to say about this other than it's good but has flaws. The Thor franchise is my least favorite in the MCU though. But I'd say Kenneth Branagh did a decent job at introducing Thor into the MCU. Not one of a kind or anything special though. Definitely watch this for the Avengers though! 7.5/10.

"Me Thor, You Jane","The Marvel Comic hero Thor of course based on the ancient Norse God of Thunder comes to the big screen in a fine version with very nice computer graphic special effects. And it has the added attraction of a classical actor like Kenneth Branagh directing and having the lines of the Norse immortals spoken as if the Bard had written them.As played by Chris Hemsworth, Thor's been exiled to Earth, the last time he visited there was when the ancient Norse were worshiping him and other such beings who visited from Asgaard. Thor's a warrior, but it takes more than being mighty in battle to rule as his father Odin keeps patiently trying to tell him.Anthony Hopkins another actor with classical acting chops plays Odin and I wonder if Hopkins might have envied Laurence Olivier for getting the plum role of Zeus in a film. He's now equaled him in playing another immortal deity.Thor lands on Earth, New Mexico to be specific and runs into scientific researcher Jane and she tickles his fancy the same way that other Jane rang Tarzan's bell. Natalie Portman is the object of Hemsworth's affections.But back on Asgaard Thor's brother Loki as played by Tom Higglesworth is plotting a palace coup of his own. That leads to a really spectacular fight to the finish as Thor's mighty hammer gives a few folks an attitude adjustment.Branagh served up a fine tasty dish for those who like their comic book heroes. Hopefully we'll see these folks again in some further adventures.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hail the Mighty Thor!,"Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor didn't suck!,"This MARVEL movie was satisfactory. It had humor, action and family complications. It did seem annoying at the start though. Instantly you can see that Asguard was based off the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz and a little later, any Star Wars geek or cinema geek who sees this movie will instantly notice a scene at the start of Thor that is a total clone of the ending scene in A New Hope.Besides the clichéd start it turned out to be a good movie. It didn't feel like a MARVEL movie, but a fantasy epic that tried it's best. Me, I'm personally looking forward to Green Lantern after this one, also Captain America and Tin Tin: the Secret of the Unicorn at Christmas.I recommend Thor to anybody who's a fan of fun, comics, eye candy or just MARVEL comic fans in general will love this movie. For those of you who think this will suck, watch this and see how wrong you were.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thunder?  More smoke and mirrors,"Plain and simple - when the humans show up the movie dies a slow death.It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Intelligent and fun comic-book popcorn epic!,"Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"One of Marvel's best adaptations, pure fun at the movies","I highly recommend ""Thor"" to anyone willing to go on this type of escapist journey, which was prepared clearly as a fun inducing devise. It has all of those elements of good Marvel film. It is colorful, full of great CGI(3D really gets it job done well this time), deprived of unnecessary weight on plot(it is rather simple, yet not stupid), and it doesn't overstay its welcome, running just below 2hrs mark(but stay for an extra scene after the credits). Also it features very good performances all around. I was really impressed by newcomer Chris Hemsworth, who played lead role. It was spot on choice to go with him, instead of some more famous face, since he's done his job almost impeccably in a clearly star making role. Other players were very solid also, with beautiful Natalie Portman as main female character, Sir Hopkins in surprisingly long supporting role, and other fine actors(like Ray Stevenson, who was so disguised I only recognized him after the movie). I must say that it is best movie of it's kind since first Iron Man, and definitely in top group of comic book adaptations. Great way to start off summer time in cinemas, and let's just hope that what will follow this season(Transformers 3, Green Lantern, Captain America etc.), will be at least around that good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel does it again,"As Marvel's mega-budget Avengers film draws ever closer, the stand-alone origin films are slowly coming to an end. Only Captain America, starring Chris Evans, remains to be released. So Thor arrives, amidst a worry that a portrait of the God of Thunder arriving on Earth after being banished from his kingdom in the sky may look a bit silly, especially when played by actors rather than drawings in a comic-book. But Marvel's track record has been good so far, and even very good, in the case of the first Iron Man film. Their left-wing choices for both actors and directors, and bold decisions have made for interesting viewing, and it's no different here.King of Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), sits proud on his throne after defeating the Frost Giants of Jotumheim and bringing peace to the Nine Realms. He has two strong warrior sons, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), one of which will eventually succeed him. But when Asgard is breached by Frost Giants trying to take back their precious Casket of Ancient Winters, seized by Odin, Thor invades Jotumheim with a small band of warriors including Loki, and starts a new war. Odin, livid with Thor's defiance, banishes him to Earth and takes away his all- powerful hammer Mjolnir, deeming him unworthy. When he arrives on Earth, confused and powerless, he is taken in by a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while Mjolnir sits in the desert, moulded to a rock, awaiting the touch of someone worthy of it. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, war is afoot and Odin lies near-death, while Loki starts to act suspiciously.This may all seem ridiculous and silly, and it is. The opening ten minutes, which condenses the history of Asgard and its war with the Frost Giants, is a confusing and silly blur of CGI and narration. My hopes of another Marvel triumph were somewhat dashed, but thankfully, with the arrival of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and a bit of character development, the film started to become the enjoyable romp that it is.Marvel's choice for Thor, Chris Hemsworth, whose CV consisted of a main character in Australian soap Home And Away, and a cameo as Captain Kirk's dad in the Star Trek reboot, is a stroke of genius. He has the charm, acting chops, comic timing, the physical presence to actually convince as a God. He was born to play this role, it seems. He juggles between irresponsible, immature and arrogant in the first half, to show off his skills as an action hero you can truly root for in the second. And when the film calls for him to play the fool, he pulls that off too.The choice for Kenneth Branagh to take the directing reigns was a strange one. A director who is most at home directing literature, namely Shakespeare, would not have been my first choice to direct a blockbuster that could easily go tits-up if mishandled. Yet Branagh handles the duties with a natural flair and confidence. The film goes back and forth from Thor's growing humanity on Earth and his relationship with Portman, to Loki's evil plotting on Asgard without ever losing focus of the story at hand or the large collection of characters.Overall, this is just a fun film, never taking itself too seriously, yet always maintaining a respect for the source material. The undoubted star to emerge from the film is Hemsworth, who I'm sure will go on to have a successful career. I'll be looking forward to see his character again in the Avengers film, which arrives sometime in 2012. Special mention should also go to Tom Hiddleston, who arrives from the London stage after winning several awards to play a menacing and pleasingly complex villain.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but by the book","The film opens in a realm and/or planet far removed from Earth and human existence. We're given a brief overview of the major events in its history and then we're introduced to its royal family battlefield conqueror, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth). After disobeying his father, Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is banished to Earth and stripped of his godlike abilities.Enter Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not- so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth.I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least.

Anthony Hopkins was great as Odin. Natalie Portman was fine as Jane Foster. I liked Stellan Skaarsgard as Erik Selvig. Kat Dennings was over the top comic relief, but there were times when I enjoyed her. My main problem was that the story was full of clichés and was very predictable.

A perfect popcorn entertainer...,"The Marvel magic continues with Thor, as they create yet another throrouly enjoyable, fun, action packed and humourous adventure, where we're introduced to a bigger universe extending far beyond Earths realm.What this movie does perfectly is ground the characters, and link them to our reality so that even though we're dealing with the mystical Frost Giants or the humoungous Destroyer, the characters do not appear other worldly or over powered to the existing superheroes.The visuals are captivating, whether it be the splendours of Asgard or the chilly Jotunheim, the CGI is excellent. The story is crisply told, fast paced and simple, taking us across the realms and giving us a background to some really interesting, well written and well portrayed characters.Chris Hemsworth nails the role of Thor with this charm, comic timing and of course good looks. He brings across the carefree, impulsive Thor while also showing a compassionate, gentle side to the character who'd otherwise have been all brawn and no brain.Antony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, playing Odin Allfather with all the gravitas that the ruler of the nine realms should possess. He shows his steely, ruthless side, as well as his soft, wise nature with elan.With Tom Hiddleston Marvel have struck gold when it comes to antagonist. His portrayal of Loki is by far the best negative character in the Marvel universe thus far. The God of mischief oozes charisma and brings out his underlying conflicts to perfection.Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard play important roles in helping Thor in his transformational journey, and we get small bits and pieces of Idris Elba and Jeremy Renners Heimdall and Hawkeye with a hope that they'd play meatier parts in future movies.The action sequences are frequent and fun, there's a lot of humour, especially as Thor adjusts to the ways of the Earth and it keeps you engaged from the start to the end.All in all, this film provides a perfect introduction to other worldly elements to be incorporated later in the MCU while managing to hold its own as a spectacle.It may not be on par with Iron Man when it comes to a deep, rich story line, but it's the closest a movie in the MCU has come so far in touching those grand heights.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Has the potential to be great, but never really gets the chance to achieve","When Marvel announced its intentions to create a film based on The Avengers, most fanboys cheered with delight. I remain to be incredibly interested in what the company and Joss Whedon have in store for us next summer, but in the interim we have Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to look forward to. While every new image and trailer has kept me excited for Cap's entrance, I have always remained skeptical on Thor. The trailers did nothing to help my hesitation going into the film, and after watching it, I am even more apprehensive Marvel's future plans.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a ridiculously powerful god living in the ""realm"" of Asgard. He is due to be crowned king by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), but during his commencement, Asgard is briefly invaded by rogue members of the Frost Giants, a group who hold a long standing truce with Asgard. After acting out recklessly and endangering the lives of his warrior companions, Odin strips Thor of his godly powers and his hammer Mjolnir and exiles him to Earth. As he searches for hammer, Thor ends up in the care of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a scientist studying wormholes, constellations and the causes for certain spatial phenomena.I find it incredibly difficult to go even further trying to describe Thor. The ending is ridiculously obvious moments after the film begins, and the proceeding moments make no attempt at trying to do something outside of playing by-the-numbers. Origins are vaguely discussed, and there is such little emphasis on character development and explanation that you wonder why Marvel even bothered giving the character his own film in the first place. The best part of the film is the initial introduction to Thor, Asgard and the powers possessed by these godly warriors. Everything past his exile feels secondary and almost useless.One of these reasons is the simple fact that Thor's journey on Earth is not interesting in the slightest. It is the battles, the characters, the settings on Asgard that offer the most fascinating, engaging and enjoyable scenes in the entire film. The film has a habit of jumping back and forth between what is occurring on Asgard as Thor treks on Earth. Almost every time, I found myself more focused watching those scenes that keep jumping in, and was ridiculously bored by everything else. I figured these scenes would be the most satisfying parts of the film, but never figured they would make me totally oblivious of everything else that was happening.But I digress, because it seems like the plotting and story existed only because Marvel needed some time to show Thor off to anyone who does read comics on a regular basis. He is the character with the most ""development"" in the film and his role in the film is defined merely to tease how he comes on S.H.E.I.L.D.'s radar and becomes a part of The Avengers. Hell, they even go so far to only give us small dialogue exchanges, a few nods and two awesome cameos as they build towards that film (unlike Iron Man 2, whose second half revolves almost entirely around increasing audience awareness), and spend the rest of the time trying to tell us who Thor is. I appreciated less emphasis on Avenger lore, but considering Thor is not an incredibly exciting character, that appreciation can only go so far.Special effects wise, the film is a mixed bag. Many of the scenes on Asgard are simply astounding to watch. They are truly breathtaking, and provide one of the only reasons anyone should bother watching the film. But a lot of the fight scenes are the exact opposite. They move too fast, are hard to see, and are almost cartoonish in nature. I know Thor and his warrior compatriots exist in a place of pure fantasy, but that does not mean everything has to look so preposterous. The 3D adds to a few of these scenes and makes them infinitely more impressive. But at the same time, it also helps mask how terribly composed a lot of them are as well.Hemsworth as Thor is one of the other small amount of reasons to see the film. He is built like a tank, and has a powerful aura about himself. He easily embodies the character's superhuman abilities with ease, and makes something as silly as waving a hammer look ridiculously bad-ass. He transcends the role, and stays strong throughout, whether playing the character as an arrogant and pompous warrior, or a meek and mostly powerless stranger. He has a lot of fun with the role, but he never forsakes or even attempts to not take the role deadly serious.Sadly, much like the interchangeable story, the majority of the supporting cast simply does not match up to the power of Hemsworth's performance. Portman, fresh off her Oscar win, is supposed to be a brilliant scientist. But one look at Thor, and she is thrown into a giggling schoolgirl like trance that she is unable to shake for the entire film. Stellan Skarsgård is decent, but he does nothing outside of answer a few questions and hint at future developments. Kat Dennings exists solely for comedic purposes. Hopkins and Idris Elba are two stand outs, but they are so horrendously underplayed that it is practically criminal. I was actually really impressed by Tom Hiddleston's performance as Thor's brother Loki and Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson of S.H.E.I.L.D. But sadly, they can only do so much in light of being overshadowed.While there is quite a bit to enjoy about Thor, there is way too much to dislike. It had potential to be something great even with what it has working against it, but it sadly just never makes anything for itself. It exists merely to help Marvel fit an agenda. And Kenneth Branagh seriously directed this? You could have fooled me.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor!""","It is crazy to see how much Thor has changed since his first movie. Talk about a character arc! From arrogant, bleached eye-browed man to one of the most loveable personalities. I like how this focused mainly on Thor and Loki's relationship, but also feels a little corny when he is on earth.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Two worlds. One hero.,"The epic adventure THOR spans the Marvel Universe from present day Earth to the mystical realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is The Mighty Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. As a result, Thor is banished to Earth where he is forced to live among humans. When the most dangerous villain of his world sends its darkest forces to invade Earth, Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero. (C) Paramount PicturesTHOR is a mediocre superhero flick. It opens with a shaky 10 minute beginning that introduces the mythology of THOR in a fast pace with exposition-esque dialogue. Here, you can see one of the main problems of the film: The scenes in Asgard are waaay too serious. So serious, in fact, that you might find yourself laughing unintentionally at the damn cheesy lines that are being said by the actors with a straight face. Fortunately, most of the film takes place on Earth, where it DOESN'T take itself too seriously. This is good because the film is actually really funny when it needs to be. This is mostly due to the whole ""fish out of water"" aspect of the film with Thor being banished on Earth. He acts the same way as he does on Asgard, and that is what makes it funny.Saying that, you might feel that there were two directors working on this film because of the completely different tones between the settings on Asgard and Earth. Since THOR jumps between the two settings now and again, you feel like it's doing a juggling act to try to balance the serious and laid back parts of the film. I can't say the film maintained it too well since I just couldn't take the Asgard scenes seriously. And those partly to blame is on the actors themselves.For starters, I didn't think Chris Hemsworth had enough in him to play the serious side of his character. Every time he tried, I had to hold the laugh waiting to burst out within me. As an actor in general, I think Hemsworth is great. He CAN do serious, as seen in A PERFECT GETAWAY and the opening of STAR TREK (2009). It's just that he couldn't do it here. Tom Hiddleston is a bit better, but I felt that he sometimes played his character more over-the-top than it needed to be. I can't say many good things about Anthony Hopkins either. I felt like he just wanted a paycheck. However, I did like Idris Elba. He played his serious character without being too laughable.The ""human"" actors, on the other hand, are better. As much as I love Natalie Portman, I didn't think she did much here. She seemed to just go through the motions with nothing spectacular to do in particular. Even her chemistry with Hemsworth didn't seem convincing enough. Kat Dennings' character, on the other hand, might be my favorite. She provides some of the films biggest laughs, and it's obvious her character is in the film to only provide comedic relief. Stellan Skarsgård was pretty good too, but he doesn't get to show much range.As for the action in THOR, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. Apart from the opening action sequence in Jotunheim, the majority of the action scenes were pretty middling and incomprehensible. Even the scene with the Destroyer seems to be a rip-off of Klaatu from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (2008). I just felt the film had too much CGI and not enough practical effects to make the action scenes memorable or exciting enough. I guess I was spoiled with the fresh and exciting action scenes in FAST FIVE the week before. Overall, I found THOR to be mildly enjoyable mostly because of the scenes on Earth. It's not the worst superhero flick, but it's not THE DARK KNIGHT either. It's just ""there."" Once the credits roll, you'll forget mostly everything about it. 5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pleasant Surprise,"When I heard they were making a movie of the character Thor I had serious trepidations. When I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing it I had even more trepidation not due to the fact that it was Branagh but the fact that all he's ever directed was drama's.Going into the theater I very low expectations from this film and man was I blown away. I like the fact that Branagh didn't approach the story as a super-hero film but more of a Shakespearing epic. The fantasy elements alone were marvelous.Anthony Hopkins IS Odin...I cannot imaging another actor portraying him. His performance as Odin captures the essence of the character and the delicate balance of ruler verses father. He exudes power with subtle touches of vulnerability.Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. He's got such a likability about him that even at Thor's most arrogant point in the story you can see how his friends stand by him. His performance is rock solid and extremely enjoyable.Tom Hiddleston is THE perfect Loki. He's captured the sleazy, slimy, be nice to your face but looking for a place to drive the knife in your back nature of the character.As I had stated earlier the story plays out as more of a fantasy epic than a dyed in the wool super-hero story. The journey into Jotenheim was stunning and Asgard itself was just beautiful to behold. The set designs were excellent. The humor in the film was very organic and never seemed forced. The story itself was very well balanced and didn't leave you wondering what the heck was going on. I almost wish they'd have kept it separate from the upcoming Marvel films. It works very well as a stand alone epic.The effect's that I was expecting to be sub-standard were in fact top notch and even Thors trademark spinning hammer from the comics didn't look as cheesy as it could have.This movie is a gem. All parties involved should be proud of themselves for bringing such a great piece of work to the screen. I for one cannot wait to see a sequel to this film. With any luck we'll see some of the other nine realms such as Muspelheim, Alfheim or even Vanaheim.This is definitely a MUST SEE film",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly Good,"The powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.I have enjoyed Thor as a supporting and humorous character in the past -- both in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and one of the early Hulk movies. But I was never convinced he could be the leading character... his story is a strange one outside of Norse mythology.But here, I think it worked. For me, the biggest concern is how do you reconcile Thor being a god with the other gods of the world? For Christians, there is only one god, so calling Thor a god calls everything into question (in the Marvel Universe). But they made it work here by strongly suggesting he is not, in fact, a god, but was merely seen as one by the old Norse people because his strength was so superior to theirs. Nice save.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Re-watched after the last 2 years of MCU content,"Disney's touch is felt lightly here as well:addition of out of place random Asian guy, with a few lines, in a Nordic myth - check!addition of out of place random black guy, with a few lines, in a Nordic myth - check!This will become a theme for awhile...Surprisingly, they handled Sif very well. She is a warrior from an advanced, almost demi-god genes, so obviously she is powerful. However, instead of putting her in unrealistic situations where with her slender agile frame, she would withstand and overpower a bunch of buffed brutes, she is shown utilizing her agility to her advantage - she sneak attacks a giant robot with a spear in the neck! On top of that she is not obnoxious, pretentious and resentful and the male characters around her aren't made to look weak, so she would look strong. Well done!They handled Jane very well, too. She is a smart, driven scientist AND a young woman at the same time. She has a complex personality, she is brave and gentle, she is believable and natural. Like Sif, she is not obnoxious, pretentious and resentful, and the male characters around her aren't made to look weak or stupid, so she would look strong. There is nothing forced about her, unlike many future incarnations of female characters in the MCU. Well done!Unlike the previous solo hero movies, it is more lighthearted and fantastical, more PG. There is a lot more of a light show feel to it, compared to Iron Man.Still the focus is on the hero, his journey, pain and growth. It is again very much what a super hero movie should be - very entertaining and relatable. The characters are natural and fun, the script is honest and focused on the story, and the story itself makes sense throughout.Compared to the last 2 years of MCU content - miles ahead!Checkout my review with the same title of Iron Man for reference of why I wrote the previous sentence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Powerful Family Dynamic and Beautiful Landscape,"This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of cliché and predictability...to a point.I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there's a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top ""glory"" of this old four-color trope.But certain things caught my attention as well-done.First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second, Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that's been done far better.Thanks for reading.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mystique long forgotten,"I'll jump the plot for Thor as the short one provided by IMDb is more than sufficient to spoil half the movie.Chris Hemsworth seems at home with his interpretation of the young and naive Thor, although abit ludicrous and not strong enough to carry the heavy crown of a superhero in Hollywood. That's not measured in muscles by the way. Hopkins, Portman and Skarsgård do what they can with the script they are handed. Tom Hiddleston on the other hand steals the show in my opinion and brings some character to the otherwise weak dialogues and shallow story. The mandatory romance is unexpectedly uncomfortable with Natalie's character Jane Foster playing out almost as an under aged groupie to the rock star Thor.The visuals are good as you would expect, but nothing jaw dropping. The many backgrounds have great detail but I never felt any mystique or ancient power hidden in the pixels.There are some goodies to extract from the movie don't get me wrong. Agent Coulson reveals his connections with Iron Man and perhaps hints about the upcoming The Avengers set to be released in 2012.If you are still not sure whether or not to watch Thor, I'm sad to say if you've seen any marvel-movie from Hollywood, you've already seen Thor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Flawed, but the Power of Thor Goes a Long Way","While it did sag in the middle, and could have used a tad more action, I found the movie to be enjoyable from start to finish. I especially loved seeing Thor getting his ego battered as a mortal on Earth, which is something that could have been worthy of a movie all on it's on. When I heard about the magical elements of the mythology being explained away as science fiction, I didn't like the sound of it, but I thought the movie did an excellent job of this, and I honestly loved the idea of magic as science and science as magic.While the movie's time spent in the fantasy realms had an extremely stylish, polished, and cheesy quality that made it seem like a live action animated Disney epic (one of the classic and great animated Disney epics at that) , I was giddy as could be watching it play out, and loved how it contrasted with the Earthly setting.And about Loki, I thought he was an awesome villain. Seriously, the guy's one slick, smooth operating fiend, one sympathetic enough to be understandable yet despicable enough to boo for. He ended up being my favorite character.On a down side, I feel that the movie could have used more action, and more time in the eye-popping fantasy settings. I do like the Marvel easter eggs scattered across the movie, but it's getting to the point where these movies are being some what bogged down with attempts at interconnectedness (Iron Man 2 suffered from this problem as well). I'm hoping to see a sequel in the future, one with much more focus on Thor's mythology and maybe a more serious tone (not too serious, I still want the movie to be able to laugh at itself, but maybe not as cheesy). In the mean time though, this movie will do, despite it's flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the best comic adaptation,"Thor has always been one of my personal favorite among mythology. A warrior with a heart of gold, forever tormented by Loki the trickster and magician. Thus, Thor became one of the very first comics I've ever continually subscribed to, for an extended period of time. However, the stories in the series became kind of stale in the 90s, and so I stopped after much disappointment.The recent revival was great but I'm already over my addiction.This movie is very well made with plenty of strengths and little weaknesses found in so many comic adaptations. I watched the 2D version as I still can't stand 3D for all that hype about nothing.1. The cast is a strong one with strong character-actors, even among those with less important roles.2. CGI is realistic and not over the top. I just wish they would have made the Frost Giants' world less of a twilight zone.3. Loki was a great character. Instead of portraying him as the standard evil villain, he was made into a sad and jealous antagonist.4. Costumes and equipments were very well made, especially the armors and weapons. Will there be a life-size replica of Mjolnir? Why do they call it a hammer, when it is obviously a mallet? 5. Wasn't Sif supposed to have long golden locks?.....",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underated Movie,"What a character introduction! Through a generic but emotional story this film follows the journey of Thor. The classic, arrogant, egocentric and selfish hero who, removed from his powers, discovers the path of wisdom and compassion through love. A strong attribute of this film is the way in which from the start clarifies the mythological world that introduces, leaving no loose ends.The characters are well-crafted, Thor has a mature and emotional arc as well as a solid and beautiful relationship with Jane Foster. Jane, on the other hand, manages to be more than just the love interest, which is not usual in this genre of films.

Very entertaining!,"Just came back from watching Thor - and I loved it! The 3D really made the movie feel more alive and intense. And I liked the fact that it was used in a way that I didn't jump in the seat from some item ""coming out of the screen"", it just made it more exciting to watch. The acting was good, Hemsworth was perfect for the role, just as I have pictured Thor to be. And the movie had a lot of humor as well as action. I liked the switch between Asgaard and our world, it gave the portrait of the gods a twist and some humor. And I loved Thor with the hammer in the action scenes - that is some power to have.This might not be a movie that will haunt your mind, but for the purpose I went to watch it - pure entertainment - it was perfect.

"Brash, Blunt Action That's Just Skin Deep","A solid enough popcorn muncher that never even hints at reaching a deeper level. Chris Hemsworth does what he sets out to, making waves with his appearance if not his acting, while Natalie Portman tries in vain to turn her uncertain supporting role into something more significant. It's really two films under one heading, as the developments in Thor's celestial homeworld of Asgard provide gorgeous vistas but no meat, and the fish-out-of-water character moments of the god of thunder fallen to Earth deliver good-natured, if shallow, fun. With a few listless fight scenes thrown in to stir the waters, Thor never runs the risk of growing stagnant but also doesn't give its audience much to think about. It's all spelled out with no regard for subtlety, hammered into the pre-planned groundwork for Marvel's upcoming Avengers mega- pic with the kind of blunt nuance one might expect from a character known primarily for his rash, impatient brawn. I had fun, but it didn't leave me clamoring for a follow-up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I learned something from Thor....,"Chris Hemsworth is very hot. I never noticed him in a movie before, but there is one too short scene of him shirtless, that is not to be missed. Other than that, I thought this movie was OK with the beginning being the best part and I didn't care for the ending. The first 45 minutes was very entertaining with some good special effects. Basically the first part is about Thor's people and their conflict with the frost giants. The frost giants invade and Thor with his other brother, Loki, and friends go to the frost giant land looking to start a war. We see some of the cool powers Thor has with his hammer. But the King is furious and banishes Thor to earth minus his powers and that's when the movie starts to get duller. He meets scientist, Natalie Portman, whom of course he falls for. I thought there should have been funnier scenes between Thor and regular people. He gets in trouble with the Feds, but just gets released, then the ending is this giant robot that is some how controlled by Loki from the other planet. Then the final battle between Thor and Loki, I just thought the latter scenes were not as entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the comic book movies, then I'm sure you will want to see this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Thundering Triumph!,The first blockbuster of 2011 may be the best. They certainly set the bar very high. It's an exciting and certainly an all-around entertaining comic book adaptation. Nothing in this genre since LOTR has been any better. Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.They found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mind-bending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you've seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations.

Not too many movies continue to have character growth from start to finish but still pack in the action and heart.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A worthy entry into the MCU,"Upon re-watching Thor tonight for the first time in nearly seven years, I was thoroughly entertained. Thor is a well made film and a worthy entry of the God of Thunder into the MCU. Tom Hiddleston does a great job as Loki and Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. This film does have cliche, especially with the love story between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman). It's sometimes silly but doesn't detract too much. This film does a good job at introducing information to us about the outer realms that will be important in the MCU for years to come. The special effects lack at times and there are some lazy edit jobs during some major action sequences. The charm of Thor and his discovery of what has happened to him after he is sent to earth is really a fun part of this film and it is rather enjoyable to watch. In the end I was quite entertained and I did enjoy Thor. It's a good film and a solid entry into the early days of the MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One man and his Hammer!,"The forth movie in the MCU Thor was released just a year after Iron Man 2s end credit scene teased fans with a shot of Thors hammer being found by Shield in a crater. As a fan of Thor and the Avengers comics I couldn't wait to see how Marvel would bring Thor to the big screen for the first time and I wasn't disappointed at the result.Thor really helped open up the potential of the MCU by not only introducing two strong and fitting leads to play Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddlesten) but the movie also ventured into completely new realms outside of just earth where so far all the hero's have been and have all been humans with powers or advanced technology and uniquely honed skills such as Iron Man, Hulk and Black Widow. In this movie we get to see the god of thunder Thor and the god of mischief Loki in Asgard a new realm filled with gods, magic and the power to travel between the nine realms for Marvels first venture into more than just earth it is done very well and is visually breathtaking.The movies storyline is strong and well written and gives Thor and Loki pretty much equal screen time building up their rivalry as brothers while also having their own storylines with unique ambitions and personalitys this movie set the stage for the later released Avengers Assemble movie and their rivalry and story's continue in future Thor movies which is great to see as both Thor and Loki are two of the best characters in the MCU hands down.Thor also included a very brief cameo by Hawkeye not a great introduction for such a cool character but Avengers made up for that in the longrun so it's forgivable.The movies special effects and CGI look amazing you can really see the difference between this movie and the Iron Man and Hulk movies that came before it more detail was added into Marvels movies after Thor giving us more colour and more detailed designs this mainly due to having a bigger budget as Marvels then new MCU idea was paying off and making box office record making more than enough profit to cover the budget costs.I recommend this movie to fans of Thor, The Avengers and comic books in general this big screen interpretation of the classic superhero and god of thunder smashing foes with his trusty hammer shouldn't be missed by fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor is exceptional because its an adaptation that does it with utter belief in the story and with the best talent and FX possible.,"WOW! No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Ebert, Roeper, Joyce Kulhawik. etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Two thumbs up from me too! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will find something to enjoy. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet ""another comic book film"" can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession.If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel rules the cinema and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. Come on Disney, spend that cash and reunite the Marvel Universe! Avengers will be great but imagine if Spider-Man and Wolverine pop in to join Thor and company in Avengers 4!!!!!!Yet, Even in an era when an explosion of comic-book properties are hitting the big screen, Thor stands alone. This has little to do with an individual who utilizes special powers and everything to do with your typical Marvel hero. It's the classic Marvel style with a great twist, a hero with flaws and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. You must see this flick!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Hemsworth brings warmth and humor to Bombastic Thor,"My expectations were set pretty low with this film. I am a bit of a comic nerd but was never really that into the Thor books. Most of my interactions with the character were from his role in the Avengers. As a kid I just never really related to his bombastic personality and was fairly ignorant of his Norse God back story.This film more than enlightened me to the wonders of the Norse God of Thunder. Chris Hemsworth portrays an unbelievably ripped Thor the god of thunder in this picture. The plot centers on Thor being cast out of Asgard by his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Thor is ousted for disobeying his father's commands and almost starting a war with the frost giants. He is banished to earth and stripped of his godly powers and his mighty hammer mjolnir. When he reaches earth he runs into, literally, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The rest of the film centers on Thor trying to get his powers back and help his Father Odin who is gravely injured.The story itself focused extensively on the Thor Norse god origin story. More than half the picture does not take place with Thor on earth. Thankfully his bombastic personality was juxtaposed with humor and a budding romance with Jane. The cast in this film was top notch and I especially enjoyed Hopkins as mighty god king Odin and Portman as the sexy scientist Jane.The movie has some awesome looking special effects and CGI created monsters. The kingdom of Asgard that is depicted is truly something to behold. The action is fast and plentiful throughout the film, with just enough time to catch your breath and get your bearings. Your speakers will also be getting a workout from the sounds of mighty combat. Although the action might be a little over the top for some I found it fun escapism.Unfortunately, I can't really address if the film sticks to the Marvel comics canon. As stated previously I am just not that familiar with the Thor series. I did however catch a sweet Cameo by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Stan Lee makes his usual drop in.In summation this is well worth a rental for and a viewing in your lair.

It's not all about action and more about story and that's what makes this film somewhat better then other mcu films.it has its flaws it does drag on at times but it's still good.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hammer Time!,"In ""Thor"", I don't think the action is the big deal here while it's a movie from Marvel. Kenneth Branagh is more fond to tell the story, which is a better thing. The changes of the story of ""Thor"" is very fascinating. It's not a generic superhero movie that has a weak man becoming a superhuman then ends with a lot of action mess. It's more of a compelling drama fantasy with a little action and a lot more sense. ""Thor"" has some problems with the action but who cares, it's definitely great & entertaining.First goes to the performances. Chris Hemsworth hams it up (no pun intended. he really did) although he is quite entertaining. Anthony Hopkins, he made Odin more than what we expect him to do. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal made Loki the best villain in the universe of the Avengers so far.The action of the first act was pretty good. Plodding at times but when it comes to earth scenes, it's becoming somewhat unexpectedly boring. Kenneth Branagh has problems in making some of the action scenes but he has the heart to tell the story. It's amazing how the changed story and the performance are more mind-blowing than the action since this is a superhero movie. As you expected in a Marvel movie, ""Thor"" is hilarious at times.While some of the action scenes weren't mind-blowing, The visuals were good. Asgard is beautifully made by the effects and the solid production design. Some of the effects are like video game graphics though. The cinematography has a tilted camera style to make it a better experience to the movie. The score is your standard fantasy music.""Thor"" is a little disappointing but it's still good because it's compelling. It's not an ordinary superhero movie. It's a drama fantasy movie with true depth. The storytelling made it more interesting. ""Thor"" has more magic than superhero action. It can be one of the best superhero movies although it isn't really loyal to its superhero movie elements. ""Thor"" is pretty unique to its genre and it's a good Kenneth Branagh film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid start to a future billion dollar franchise,"This origin story of Thor was quite telling as we could see the future potential crafted by the characters, most notably Chris Hemsworth as Thor. This film sets a solid tone as we learn about the characters and their motives. Perhaps too many characters to focus on, but the central characters are clear. Few action sequences that are well done and the overall interest is there with its family drama dimension. For the first film, it is decent and a good stepping stone for its foundation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the better Marvel movies,"When I heard that there was going to be a Thor movie, it got me curious. I love Norse mythology and all the gods and demigods and other characters from those aforementioned legends and I had only heard about Thor as a comic book, but it was cool. Anthony Hopkins as the leader of Asgard; Odin himself. One of my favorite Norse gods. Some of the characters were a little hard to follow but this was the first time in a long while I had seen Rene Russo, who played Odin's wife Frigg. She did very well. Lots of action and Loki, the mischief-maker of Asgard himself, steals the show. I'd never even heard of Tom Hiddleston until this movie, but he seems very cool. If you're looking for a movie to watch before tackling the Avengers saga, start here, along with Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and the others.

"Enjoyable, but What's Up With the Cinematography?","Thor is an enjoyable, intriguing movie with infuriating cinematography.The characters simple, but interesting. One could say there's too many, but I enjoyed both story lines and their characters. I think the concept of mythology being the truth is really interesting and fun to watch. The story is predictable, but the dialogues felt realistic.On the other hand I hated the cinematography. There were rarely any great shots and every second frame is in Dutch angle. It was infuriating, because it doesn't have purpose. The Dutch angle is meant to make the audience feel uncomfortable, but in this movie it was used everywhere and in most of those scenes, there was no tension. So obviously I disliked the cinematography and direction. The editing is fine and the pacing is good.Thor is a movie I like more than most people, but I don't understand how the cinematography could be this bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I really don't understand all the positive feedback for this film,"This film was one of the most tedious experiences of my life. I enjoy a good cheesy action film like the next guy and was genuinely looking forward to a mindless 90 minutes of fun. What I actually experienced was self important, overly buff, lord of the rings reject extras spouting some of the worst lines in film history. How Natalie Portman, let alone Stellen Skarsgard, got roped into this I will never know. Repetitive actions scenes, awful editing that cut the middle of conversations and light humour from Thors friends (puke) and the terrible Kat Dennings made for a challenging viewing experience all round. Where Iron Man went so right with its self depricating humour and quick wit Thor has languid scenes, flacid romance and wooden character interaction.The picture lacks a decent development of storyline and character which is always difficult when introducing a character with a deep backstory but it has been done so well recently with Batman Begins et al. There is a definite smell of studio meddling in the final cut with some scenes jumping all over the place. Loki (Tom Hiddleson) changes from loyal brother/Son to evil traitor with no story or character development. Anthony Hopkins spends most of the film in a coma. Chris Hemsworth can't be to blame for a film which seems over produced, over edited and that was marketed as Return of the King but was more Masters of the Universe. The decision to assign 'Ice Giants' (yes Ice Giants) as 'baddies' falls flat as they are about as scary and menacing as frosty the snowman.The whole project felt a thin and is so poorly put together you could see it unravel before your eyes. Fingers crossed for a better Summer Blockbuster in the near future...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible Action and Fantasy but with a Superb Story! Best in Years!,"Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it again! It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think and challenge all your movie viewing skills but it does so and more. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from Kenneth Branagh. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us. Overall, a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen in years.The director's background in Shakespearian themes comes in to play right from the beginning of the film and run throughout. Thor is a super-strong ""god"" and can travel through space with supernatural powers yet the story is paradoxical and contrary about those elements instead choosing to focus on the human elements. THAT elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting but I should have known better considering the source material and the director.The genuine and relatable qualities of these characters are what make it a great film. Sure, the action and fantasy are incredible but the story works so well. The family dynamics between fathers & sons along with sibling rivalry and the price of vanity and lack of humility all resonate. The choices made and the relationships on display are as wonderful as the brawling and action... which are as good as any summer movie that I've seen in years.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wild Asgardian Foolishness,If it maintained the gleeful silliness of its first hour this could have been the greatest superhero debut of all time - as Branagh really made the floppy-haired Marvel god come to life. Asgard was excellently realised and it really hits the core emotional beats well... but Thor gets bogged down in its own formulaic love-at-first-sight-subplot (that both wastes our time and Portman's talent) which is a huge shame. It's a faulty film but with inspiring moments of cosmic wonder that would've made Ditko happy as the proverbial Larry.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular,"Wow, this one absolutely blew me away. I can remember thinking that this was just an okay MCU movie, but now it's one of my favorites. This is a film that gets better as it goes on.

The scene where Thor gets Mjolnir back is probably one of my favorite scenes from Phase 1.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor Continues to Build Up the Momentum for The Avengers,"¨Whoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.¨ With Thor, summer movies have officially started in Hollywood. It's not one of my favorite seasons of the year for films, but if the rest of the movies can live up to what Kenneth Branagh has accomplished with Thor it will be an exciting and entertaining season at the movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Thor before this movie came out, I wasn't even expecting too much out of it, but I decided to go see it because he's still one of The Avengers and I couldn't miss out on all the propaganda that began with Iron Man. With each one of these films my expectations for The Avengers is rapidly building, and even Thor managed to win me over to his side. The first thing I can say about the movie is that it was entertaining enough for me to want to go see it twice in two days. The story, the visuals, the strong performance from two relatively unknown actors like Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are all factors that contribute to making this movie successful. Include Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins into the mix and you have an even better film. The directing had a lot to do with it as well because Kenneth Branagh is a serious and dedicated director; he has proved it time after time with his adaptations of Shakespearean plays. He was dedicated with this project as well; adapted this Marvel comic superhero and prepared him for the big screen. Like most every Marvel character, they are very well developed and the film is no exception remaining true to the comic.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) the god of Asgard. He is a great warrior and his father has been preparing him to be the future King of Asgard. It is no easy task because Asgardians are the keepers of the peace in all nine realms (Earth being one of those realms). They can travel from one realm to another through the Forest which is guarded by Heimdall (Idris Elba). Odin saved Earth from extinction many centuries ago when the Frost Giants tried to destroy the planet. Odin defeated them and took away their power so they could no longer leave their planet, Jotunheimr. Odin has kept the peace during all these years but now it's time to proclaim Thor as his heir to the throne. On the day of his proclamation something unexpected occurs and three Frost Giants manage to enter Asgard and almost steal the cube which holds their power. However The Destroyer does his job and kills the invaders before they can do any harm. Thor is furious and wants to give the Giants a lesson, but Odin wants to maintain peace and orders Thor to remain in Asgard. Against his father's command Thor travels to Jotunheimr with his younger brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the 3 warriors: Volstagg, Hogun, and Fandral, and Sif (Jaime Alexander). Together they face the Giants who tell them there is a traitor in Asgard. Odin discovers that Thor disobeyed his command, rescues the warriors from the Frost Giants but vanishes Thor to Earth without his supernatural powers. In Earth Thor meets a group of scientists: Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and Darcy (Kat Dennings) who help him rediscover his path.I can imagine how difficult it was to try to make a serious movie out of all this Norse mythology about the nine realms and so on, but Branagh pulls it off by combining humor with the story. For instance when the three warriors come to Earth to find Thor, the unbelievable situation is toned down with a lot of humor. The same can be said with the Destroyer when he arrives at Earth to try to destroy Thor. When the SHIELD agents first see this metal giant they believe it could be one of Stark's creations. So whenever the plot seems to be getting ridiculous, the tone of the film is cooled down with a lot of humor. The funniest character is Darcy who with clever one-liners manages to steal most laughs. I liked Kat Dennings in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, but here once more she proves she is a talented actress. The true stars of the film however are Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. Hemsworth plays Thor to perfection, and Hiddleston is excellent as Loki. The scene where he realizes his true identity is perhaps one of the most dramatic and best acted sequences in the movie. I know we are being bombarded with a lot of superhero movies, but as long as they keep on making them this entertaining I have no problem with that. Thor is no Dark Knight, or even Iron Man for that matter, but it still is a very good film. I will end my review by quoting my six year old brother's words after the movie ended: ¨I don't want to have an Iron Man party for my birthday anymore. I want it to be Thor!¨ http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Great Introduction to Asgard,It was beautiful to watch. Some Amazing Scenes in Asgard.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor - what worked and what didn't,"+ Dutch angles.
+ Asgard, although not seen much, is well realised.
+ Good to see the trickster Loki not as a grinning, wailing nogooder but as a quiet, manipulative, lost little brother.
+ Cool, trippy sci-fi iconography not seen again until Guardians of the Galaxy.
+ Real life sets are quite well designed to be memorable and interesting and big and layered with lots of background activity.
+ Pre-sitcom Kat Dennings
+ Thor's hammer festival with everybody trying to lift it is kinda apt and funny.
+ Thor's fish out of water story is actually still quite funny. He's a sort of loveable dumb dumb.
+ Tom Hiddleston starts a tragic character arc as a distressed and around royal adoptee.
+ Thor is funny. Ragnarok made it good, but this set it up pretty well.
+ Natalie Portman is also funny and it's good to see her.
+ Cheeky Hawkeye cameo that I forgot about. Useless but I still grinned.
+ I sort of like that there's not some cave-dwelling, stick-wielding bad guy allegory for Osama Bin Laden and that Thor is basically the bad guy even if that makes the third act a little lame and stakeless.
+ ""Son of Coul"".Dutch angles.Rene Russo doesn't have much to do.Cheesy Warriors Three crassly shoehorned in.Action is clunky and messy and not pleasurable.Time jumps and crisscrossing stories are badly paced and screw with a lot of potentially meaningful moments.Effects are very dated.CGI backgrounds are depthless and unconvincing stages and wastelands.Chris Hemsworth's accent is a little off.Loki's plan is a little unclear here and there hard to follow.Odinsleep is an incredibly handy plot device/deus ex machina.Post-credits sequence review: 4/5. An actual coda scene again. Shows the trickster and the link set up for Selvig to lead in to the start of the Avengers. Makes little actual sense but in retrospect links the movies nicely.Stan Lee as: Old Man that drives truck trying to pull Thor's hammer out. ""did it work?"" 1/5: Surprising but a bit generic. Basically a stand-in. Not integrated well or a reason for it to be Lee.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Offers absolutely nothing.,"This film was an amalgamation of every ""superhero"" cliché from start to finish. It did absolutely nothing for me or my girlfriend. Seems like a script by committee situation. An artless product by all accounts.The only redeeming quality was the lead actor. Despite having a strong cast and a respected director, the film delivered Hollywood triteness at its worst.I'm not sure why Hollywood penguins insist on making products terrible. No matter how many trend data sheets they sift through, a good story is not a sum of popular topics or a mix-and-match of proved techniques. A good story has a voice of its own and this had none. Branagh obviously didn't fight hard enough to get anything valuable here. It shows no effort. As I said, artless.I only speak so harshly here because in 2011 there's no excuse to spend 150mill and this is your end product.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost a good film,"If you are looking for a wall to wall action film, you will be disappointed with Thor. Not that there were not action scenes, but, they are few and do not take up much film time.If you are looking for a Spiderman-like romance angle for the main character, you have also come to the wrong place. The reason for this, and much of the reason why the film didn't work for me, can be summed up in two words: Natalie Portman. My guess is she took the film for money. She seemed like an actress who showed up on set simply to recite her lines. You can get better acting from a tree stump. Thus, it is difficult to believe that the super hero, no matter how great a nature worshiper he may be, could fall in love with a tree stump. I would have been much happier to see Thor's love interest played by a complete unknown. This would have worked.The story is slow to develop as much time is taken to set the scene. Eventually, the action moves to earth and it is here that the film livens up. Personally, I wish the entire movie took place on earth. I dreaded returning to the dull life on Asgard. On the other hand, the special effects for this realm are really quite good.Certainly, the highlight of the film was the acting by Chris Hemsworth. He played the confused, serious, laughable hero angle to perfection. It's too bad he had to work with Portman. Better luck next time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Chris Hemsworth is definitely the right man for the plan.,"Without saying to much, this movie is a true example of the work that MCU did in the last decade, the story is apsolutely beautiful, the setting in the galaxy is eye-watering, the characters are likeable, relaxing and fun to watch, Thor is played without a single flaw throughout the whole movie, Chris did an awesome job, and also, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), my oh my, what an actor, what a villain ! Maybe it would be nice if the movie went on for a bit longer, with some more action packed drama, but still, a very good MCU piece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: Striking Lightning but Missing Thunder,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Thor. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 17, 2011. It has a runtime of 1hours and 55 minutes. Thor was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Kenneth Branagh and was created by Ashley E. Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack KirbySummary: We follow the journey of the powerful yet arrogant god, Thor, who is cast out of Asgard by his father, Odin. This punishment sends him to Earth (Midgard), where he must learn humility and discover what it truly means to be a hero.Review: -I appreciated the film's opening and the effective use of voice-over narration, which clarifies the storyline for viewers while smoothly transitioning to scenes depicting children being told the tale. We also get a glimpse of how the children and their father, who narrates the story, will appear in the future. As the film progresses, it further develops its narrative. I found the casting to be excellent; the actors were well-matched to their roles, and their performances felt genuine within the film's context. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue.The film skilfully intertwined drama and humour, making it appealing to a broad audience. Thor's interactions with humans provide a refreshing comedic relief that contrasts effectively with the more serious aspects of his character development. This harmonious blend of humour fosters a light-hearted atmosphere, catering to viewers seeking entertainment while still maintaining narrative depth. I appreciate how ""Thor"" presents a captivating interpretation of Norse mythology within a contemporary framework. The film's integration of mythological themes such as fate, honour, and sacrifice enhances the narrative, enabling audiences to connect with ancient tales through modern storytelling techniques. This approach allows viewers to engage with narratives beyond their own cultural experiences. However, while the film weaves these mythological elements into its plot, it does so in a way that emphasizes entertainment over strict adherence to authenticity. For example, certain facets of Norse mythology are simplified or modified for dramatic impact. I felt that certain aspects of the movie felt a bit rushed at times. I believe I would have appreciated it more if it had been adapted into a mini-series instead. With the current format, I would have enjoyed seeing Thor spend an extended period on Earth-perhaps a month-where he could learn to navigate life among humans. This approach could have allowed for a gradual realization of his past mistakes and a deeper sense of regret for his previous actions. I would have preferred if the film included more scenes featuring Thor and his family, as this would have provided an opportunity to explore their relationships in greater depth. The initial scenes depicting their childhood felt insufficient, and I feel that it might have been beneficial for the narrative to incorporate flashbacks that connected Thor's experiences and emotions while on Earth throughout the film.I appreciated the cinematographic choices made in the film. The use of Dutch angles throughout various scenes effectively conveyed the characters' emotional states and highlighted the dissonance between their worlds. Wide shots provided expansive views of Asgard's stunning architecture and Earth's vast landscapes, emphasizing both grandeur and isolation. Close-up shots were skilfully employed to capture the characters' emotions, particularly during critical moments in Thor's journey. Over-the-shoulder shots enhanced dialogues between characters, fostering a sense of connection and perspective that deepens viewer engagement with their conversations. Establishing shots were crucial at different points in the film, setting up new locations and facilitating transitions between scenes. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes beautifully.I appreciated the ambitious visual effects, especially in the portrayal of Asgard, Thor's home. The grandeur and scale of the city were remarkable achievements in CGI, significantly enhancing the film's epic atmosphere. The vibrant colours and intricate designs effectively created a convincing otherworldly setting. I was particularly impressed by the character designs for Thor and Loki; their costumes and appearances were skilfully enhanced through CGI to reflect their comic book origins while still maintaining a level of realism that resonated with audiences. However, I noticed some inconsistencies in the quality of CGI throughout the film. Certain sequences-especially those featuring action or special effects-appeared less refined. At times, it felt as though the film relied too heavily on CGI, which detracted from character development and storytelling.-I appreciated uncovering the abilities of the characters in the movie and enjoyed getting to know Thor's companions. While I wasn't entirely enthralled by the film at first, my interest deepened as the narrative unfolded. Thor's character arc was relatively straightforward, transitioning from arrogance to humility with a degree of simplicity in his development. The film illustrates his journey from a reckless and proud warrior to a more grounded and responsible leader. This transformation can resonate with audiences who appreciate narratives focused on personal growth and redemption. The relationship between Thor and his brother Loki enriches the story, highlighting themes of jealousy, betrayal, and ultimately reconciliation. I appreciated the deeper exploration of Loki's backstory within the film. Jane Foster was presented as an intelligent and capable scientist; however, her role sometimes feels less developed compared to her male counterparts. At times, she appears a little more as a love interest than as an independent character with her own agency and storyline.-I really enjoyed the ending of ""Thor""; it left me feeling hopeful, and I'm eager to see what unfolds next. I was also delighted to discover an additional scene after the credits. Now, I'm off to watch ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" followed by ""The Avengers"".I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 6.5 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Top score for Thor,"Thor truly defines the word ""Blockbuster"". It has an abundance of testosterone fueled action, a plethora of mind-blowing special effects, a hint of well-timed humor sprinkled throughout it's 111 minutes running time, and a powerful yet fragile protagonist that you actually care about by the time the credits roll.Hardcore Thor enthusiasts will be fully satisfied with this amazing adaptation of the Asgardian hero, and for the rest of us who have no knowledge or background on the Marvel character, it will still be an enjoyable and unforgettable ride.They cast the role of Thor perfectly, nobody else could have filled his shoes, Chris looks fit and healthy, and exudes the cocky arrogance that is associated with Thor during the first act. The pace doesn't slow down through the second and third acts also, and I was extremely impressed by this.The acting, in my opinion, was top-notch for a comic book adaptation, the only downfall for me was, surprisingly, Natalie Portman as Jane. I didn't really feel the chemistry between her and Chris was electric, and her part almost felt redundant and forced. But that is only a small imperfection in an otherwise perfect film.I highly recommend seeing this film, it lives up to the hype, which is rare for most summer blockbusters, but in the case of The Mighty Thor, thankfully it's true.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Awesome,"in one word Awesome!I was really curious and excited to see Thor as I love big budget movies and also it's the first time I see Kenneth Branagh directing a movie like this. Normally it's not his style. So I went in and just loved it!. It's so beautiful to look at, at how beautiful they've made Asgaard look. It's not so much a comic book movie but the Thor myth come to life! It's funny, witty, moving ( a few scenes I admit I was crying like when Thor was so happy to have found his hammer but could not lift it and the scene at the end between him and Odin, played by an astounding Anthony Hopkins who IS Odin, and does even a better job than Bob Hoskins. And yes it did remind me of The Mask with Loki etc. This is in my opinion the BEST movie that SIR Kenneth Branagh has ever made and I hope they call on him if ever there's a Thor 2!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Very Pleasant Surprise; Applause-Worthy,"This summer is shaping to be a big one for action blockbusters and sequels (with more expected this year than any preceding). We got Fast Five recently (with the sixth installment already underway), Pirates of the Caribbean's fourth outing is a couple weeks away, while July will be giving us more than just Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Transformers 3. Thankfully, we're getting some films that are at least trying to give us a tale not told in a while on-screen as well. And one of them just happens to be what is, in this writer's humble opinion, the biggest theatrical surprise since Iron Man in 2008.Seeing the trailers for Thor, I expected it to be a mediocre at-best film not far from what G.I. Joe apparently turned out to be. But then the reviews came in and, combined with urging from personal acquaintances, I succumbed to what had long-since caught others. Being almost completely unfamiliar with the tale(s) of Thor, I wasn't sure if the film would be able to truly catch and maintain my interest. Thankfully, we're given a pleasing introduction within the first act that sets the stage well without creating overexposure. Essentially, after years of battles and quests, Oden nearly bestows one of his two sons, Thor, as his proper successor. But after a thought-past threat ultimately shows what Thor is truly like, Oden banishes him to our world without his true strength (since Earth is the ideal place for the outcast).Thor (as a film) doesn't have any problem deciding what kind of film it wants to be: this is an action blockbuster with traits of an epic. The first act has some impressive visuals and an excellent action sequence that the final act actually has trouble matching. Despite the genre being clear-cut and not requiring much (if any) of an attention span, Thor thankfully manages to avoid falling into the rut that too many action releases have. By this I'm of course referring to a lack of compelling characters and, more so, an even lesser tale to tell.Most of the characters we're introduced to are nicely developed and are quite likable, with one in particular being more dimensional than audiences might anticipate. The cast here is notable, with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsgård all being among my personal favorite performers. Yet it's the relatively unfamiliar lead title character who steals the show (and thankfully so). With the exception of a small role in 2009's Star Trek, Chris Hemsworth was unknown to me until now. But he fits into the role of Thor perfectly, going through his personality with almost as much strength as his build. He's sure to become one to find in future action films.Thor is a very enjoyable film with just enough action and laughs to make it one that most anyone can enjoy with an open mind. While the script might show cracks here and there, namely with regards to a few lines, most of what we have here is quality material. Here's hoping that Thor proves to be a precursor to other fun summer films to take us away from our daily hardships (which is what most films should do).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
God of Slumber,"Hmmm, Thor where do I begin? I have long since given up the erroneous notion that superhero movies should be true to its comic book counterparts. I also have lived long enough to see superhero titles rebooted so often that they bear no r...resemblance to their origins as told in my youth (Jane Foster is an astrophysicist stormchaser?) So, I entered Thor with absolutely no expectations. Good thing, too, because if I had any, they wouldn't have been met. First, I must agree with Sir Anthony Hopkins and state that there is far to much CGI in this film and not enough character development. There were opportunities to delve into characters and their back stories that were simply ignored.Other problems include: Fight scenes that played out like video game ads, with actors trying to strike the right ""badass"" pose for the cool action shots. Annoyingly silly humor that wore thin quickly. Conflicts that were one-dimensional and built no real suspense. A forced love story. And I understand that even a god of thunder must have a character arc, and Thor's was a common one that I could have overlooked had it been better acted, and yes, better directed.The whole movie lacked gravitas. Plain and simple.There are some that have said it's nothing more than a two-hour preview for the upcoming Avengers movie and I can't totally disagree with that. But it is not the worst superhero movie ever made (far from it), it is simply the weakest Avengers prequel movie made to date (and yes, I'm including Iron Man 2 in that category).Who knows?

Amazing Film On Every Level!,"It's been said that good comic books can often times outshine the best book, song, film, or television program. The in-depth story details, accompanied by amazing illustrations give comics their own identity. Well, then there's the rare case where film captures that and brings it to life. Such is the case with Thor.This Thor movie is amazing. You have the color & fun of Spider-Man, the darkness & mystery of Batman or X-Men and the grounded cool reality of Iron Man. Thor is massive but they played it just right.It's easy to see why Kenneth Branagh is considered a film making master. He delivered a film that looks and feels exactly like a live action Thor comic. (The good ones anyway) His detailed yet not too busy screen is filled with tender as well as cerebral moments but when it's Hammer time... run for cover!! This quote sums it up best for me...""Thor has a real emotional depth - it's unusually soulful for a superhero film. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman efforts had a similar sensitivity, though it came from a darker and, thus, ultimately less interesting place; Thor is more bittersweet. There's a hopefulness to the film, particularly its ending, that verges on elegiac.

"Oh my god!! Everything I expected, and much more...","My title really sums up how I perceived this great movie. I just returned home from watching this tonight. And holy cow, Mr. Brannagh really delivered!! When Kenneth Brannagh was announced as Thor's director, I was really expecting something great from the one who directed various Shakespeare adaptations. I've only saw his remake of ""Sleuth"", and despite weak ratings from the critics I really liked that crime flick. I really loved how he handled the characters. Brannagh really knows how to set the stage for clever and suspenseful drama. Furthermore I adore him as an actor (my IMDb nickname says you that).So as a longtime comic-book fan I was really excited getting to see a visually spectacular and dramatic comic-book adaptation by a skillful director. And boy my expectations were fulfilled. F...... hell, this rocked!! The (first two) X-men and Iron Man movies were always said to be the Marvel Masterpieces when it comes to movie adaptations. Personally I always thought these movies to be entertaining, but not much more. They didn't really deliver an epic feeling. They didn't introduce you to a fantastic world in all it's glorious beauty that wants you to explore it. ""Thor"" just delivers all that. To me ""Thor"" stands as the best Marvel comic-book-movie till now, by far...First of all, the characters are really likable and portrayed in a realistic way. All character developments don't seem to be forced. The most interesting character is Loki. At the beginning I really felt sympathy for him. It is until a tragic revelation, where his character undergoes a change to a more evil side, but even then some of his behaviors seem to be understandable. The father-son conflict is portrayed brilliantly. Kenneth Brannagh at his best!!This movie is visually outstanding and some scenes, like for example the prologue, deliver this ""LotR"" feeling that gives you the goosebumps. There are many memorable shots that are purely majestic. When Thor, Sif and the Warriors Three ride on the Bifröst it just shouts ""pure awesomeness"" into your face. Many scenes on Asgard are just spot on. The buildings on Asgard seem to be based on a hybrid of krypton and middle-earthen architecture. The visuals on this world show the advanced, noble and god-like status of the Asgardians. Asgard is depicted as a heavenly and unbelievably beautiful realm in the never-ending depths of the cold space. It provides a subject for speculations, if the Asgardians are indeed gods with magical powers, or if they are extraterrestrial beings with technology far beyond our understandings, but the movie doesn't really discusses this issue and leaves it to the audience to give an opinion in this matter.What else can be said? The action was exciting. While the frost-giant-battle on Jotunheim was a bit visual overkill and at some parts almost cartoony, the fights on earth were harsh, gritty and bloody. Brannagh really handled the different worlds very well. On earth, humor was predominant, the scenes on Asgard stood out for Shakespearian drama, while Jotunheim delivered a creepy and threatening atmosphere. The CGI-Environments were all breathtaking. There were sequences (Bifröst, Asgard mainly) that really were out of this world. All in all, the visual effects were amazing and god-worthy. The score was magnificent, it perfectly captured the proudness and courage of the Asgardians.I gave ""Thor"" a 10 out of 10. It surely is on of the best movies of it's kind. I stands up there with ""The Dark Knight"", ""Star Trek"", ""Avatar"" and ""Inception"". It's the perfect Blockbuster.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This Time  Frosty Reception Is Good,"Visually striking, generally well-directed, competently performed super-hero epic made with state of the art CGI effects. Norse mythology via Marvel comics and Stan Lee are brought to life here. While not your typical Marvel comic ""epic"" - Thor spends most of its time in the world of Thor, Odin, Loke, and Frost Giants - a banished race. The story was inventive and conceived imaginatively. Anthony Hopkins does a great job playing Odin and relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth makes an appealing Thor, even an affable one for guys as well as girls. The rest of the cast was judiciously cast. As Loki, the villain of the film, Tom Hiddleston stands out. Beautiful Natalie Portman plays the female love-interest. Veteran, and a good character actor, Stellan Skarsgard plays a pivotal role as well. i liked really most of what I saw. Director Kenneth Branagh does a serviceable job with the material - and adds some class to this Marvel addition. you are given clues throughout that The Avengers is on its way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A genuine delight.,"I've known of the super hero Thor for a long time, I didn't gel with the character as a comic book reader in the 80's though The Ultimates version of Thor got me hooked.Again when I heard Kenneth Brannagh was directing I rolled my pretty nerd eyes, again I was to be surprised.I just saw Thor, in 3D, this afternoon, I'm still on a movie high from it and that's why I'm writing this review. I can't remember the last time I left the cinema all buzzed and excited by a movie, actually yes I can it was Avatar, the 1st time I saw a 3D film.Thor is classic story telling done 21 century style, no shame over the Gods and magic, merely they are presented as fact and we accept them as there in the film. The story is exciting, again a simple tale but as Avatar proved tell a simple tale well and you will entertain, no clever story tricks or sneaky twists, merely an entertaining story, which can, in the right directors hands be elevated above what it is.The graphics whilst not perfect look good, some beautiful Asgardian shots and some amazing 3D moments, I love 3D, it's exciting and Thor is the kind of film it would seem made for, sumptuous, beautiful sets, dripping in colour and scope.Helmsworth and Portman share a good chemistry, I could have used some more of them together but that's all to come, the secondary characters are all fine in they serve the story though there are some moments of over acting that seem excess to the scenes, again though it's a new franchise and a first film so all is forgive. Hopkins is understated but obviously great and Hiddleston who plays Loki is excellent, sneaky, relate-able too and not outright evil, more a maker of mischief, as Loki is.I have to stop now as new Doctor Who is about to start, go see Thor you will enjoy it as a fan of the character or as someone adverse or unaware of his greatness.I don't believe in God but I do believe in Thor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Thor"" earns its power with strong leads and a focus on character arcs","Looking at the whole of the Marvel universe, Thor would have to be the black sheep. For one thing, he's the Norse god of thunder. His world — the realm of Asgard — is completely foreign to us, as is most Norse mythology. Greek mythology, maybe, but definitely not Norse. As for the hero himself, similar to Superman, he possesses inherent power and immortality and wields as brute an arrogance as his mighty hammer. In other words: hard to identify with and hard to like. Yet under Kenneth Branagh's direction, the worlds of magical legend and that of the contemporary superhero manage to find a common ground through humor and relatable themes of familial conflict. Channeled through Chris Hemsworth's bravado and highly aware performance, ""Thor"" manages to stand tall as a hero's journey among all else, a trait that serves as its saving grace.Bouncing back and forth between Asgard and modern day New Mexico, ""Thor"" tells the story of how the young arrogant king-to-be of Asgard reignited a long-ended war between his people and the evil Frost Giants and was therefore banished to Earth by his father Odin (Hopkins). Now a mortal on Earth, Thor seeks to reclaim his power and the throne with the help of an astro-physicist (Portman), while his younger brother Loki (Hiddleston) plans to secure his own place as ruler.Thor's personal quest as well as the conflict between him, his father and Loki provide the film's true lifeblood. The three give the film's best performances, and though familial treachery rates far from original storytelling, there's a reason these Shakespearean plots have been around forever. Hiddleston thrives here as the story's most complex character, which is a title more often given to someone other than the villain in a superhero film. His transformation from untrustworthy worm to full-on bad guy feels complete thanks to the way Hiddleston seizes every moment of screen time.But that doesn't mean he overshadows our golden-maned hero. Hemsworth shows a definitive comfort as a leading man, happily commanding the attention that ought to be demanded of an actor playing a god. It helps that he's 20 different kinds of jacked and therefore physically appropriate for the role, but he shows surprising depth. In the Jotunheim (Frost Giants' planet) sequence, the one that gets Thor in trouble with Dad, he infuses a childish innocence into his untempered pride, and we become more apt to root for his predestined change of character rather than despise his arrogance. Although the writers give him one too many shouts of ""Noooo!"" during the film, he makes it convincing, especially when he comes to the realization that he simply cannot take back his hammer, Mjolnir, or his powers through simple use of force.Speaking of force, Hemsworth makes the grade as an ass-kicker without a doubt, yet the action sequences leave a bit of something to be desired in terms of excitement and creativity. But while Branagh might not be a student of action filmmaking, he never loses sight of what's at stake. The writers have ensured that the action sequences feel necessary rather than like needless fluff; the tension of the story keeps the fights engaging and Branagh retains focus on the characters involved.The element of the script that will divide opinion the most will likely be its humor. Kat Dennings' character carries the brunt of the comic relief as Darcy, an intern for Portman's Jane Foster and Stellan Skarsgård's Erik Selvig. Sometimes it goes a bit too far, but I would almost label her as crucial: she helps keep ""Thor"" from getting too serious to be taken seriously. ""Thor"" contains a lot of talk about magic, science and rainbow bridges; it helps to have a character that takes all of it lightly and also breaks the rhythm of what would be an all-too-typical ""girl meets boy fallen from the sky"" love story between Jane and Thor.At the same time, Hemsworth ends up being the funniest of anyone. He doesn't even flinch as he proclaims his enjoyment of a cup of coffee and smashes the mug on the floor demanding another. He doesn't play it up for laughs or try and act confused by why it's not acceptable behavior: he lets it be part of who he is. Branagh and the script also do a nice job using humor to break the awkwardness that occurs when the Warriors Three and Sif (Asgard's best fighters) come to Earth looking for Thor. Their extravagant costumes look simply awful out of the context and set design of Asgard that one of the film's pivotal action sequences that follows would've lost all sense of credibility without some self-aware humor. Considering the potential for ""Thor"" to be a laughingstock in this manner, it's actually impressive how well Branagh, cast and crew handled the clash of fantasy and reality.The only significant chunk of the film that didn't quite hit was the love story. Despite being excellent in the role, Portman had no reason to take the part of Jane Foster. She's criminally underused in the film and rather one-dimensional. She cares about her life's work and is smitten with Thor. Their scenes together are nice, but hardly serve to up the stakes when Thor returns to Asgard for the final showdown. My curiosity for a ""Thor"" sequel definitely hinges more so on wanting to see Asgard and its realms more fully realized than wanting to know whether Thor and Jane can keep their flame alive despite being worlds apart.But no matter how many misfires you can find in certain aspects of the film, its devotion to its core conflict and character arcs helps make everything more entertaining. The plot of ""Thor"" remains simple and pure; a lesson in humility that few summer blockbusters are ever willing to learn.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Agree With the Critics... GREAT Film!,"Now everyone can see why they cast Hemsworth. He's perfect because he certainly fits the part physically but, more importantly, he's able to play Thor both as a mighty pompous loose canon as well as being a big lovable ""god out of water"" unable to adjust to human ways. Both are absolutely crucial to the character winning audiences over, especially those who may not be familiar with the character from comics. Hemsworth and the script does this with style. I also love the texture of this film. Example: The power struggle within Asgard between Thor and his brother and Thor and his father, Odin. It feels very relatable and very passionate. Their passion and rivalry was something anyone can absolutely relate to in their own lives.No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Travers, Roeper, Joyce, Maltese, etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will realize delivers a fantastic and fantastical reason to make the trip to the cinema. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet ""another comic book film"" can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession. As good of a summer movie that's been released in years.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
i will carry a hammer in my backpack from now on,"the movie delivers pretty well. i think the best thing about marvel studios is that they have a big interest in the characters themselves. the performances made the movie for me. the story is not as twisty as i have expected but it does not bore at all. the battle scenes are awesome but there's a lesson to learn, don't watch marvel movie trailers ever again. All the action sequences are shown in one way or another in the trailers (just like iron man 2), but it was great fun, I'm gonna definitely watch it again and i know I'm not the only one. i loved Chris hemsworth as Thor, he was the best part of the film in my opinion (robert Downey and Edward Norton were the best part of their respective films also, so we can conclude marvel is doing a damn freaking great job) plus the scene where selvig and Thor return to the trailer after some drinks is priceless... the 2 cameos were great as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"When you'll see ""Thor"" you'll want to see more!","Awesome, superb, epic!!! I've yet to see a movie that made me so eager to see it as ""Thor"", I really couldn't wait for the premiere and... I wasn't disappointed, not one bit. The new Marvel movie about the Norse God of Thunder has the potential to become a top 3 best of all time superhero movies. While standing in the theatre and watching it for 2 hours made me feel like only 10 minutes had past since i've sat down, the story sums up pretty much all the essentials of the Mighty Avengers STORY, Hemsworth does a great job as the thunderer , great acting, a lot of charisma, he was cast perfectly,good accent too, excellent performance by Hopkins and an ever more impressive one by Hiddlestone as Loki. Special effects were superb, (Asgard looks amazing)but not forced over the edge, the movie has it's parts that make you laugh and also the fighting scenes are superb and sufficient, I couldn't have wanted more or less! Idris Elba does an excellent Heimdall and personally I loved Jaimie Alexander as Sif. The story really sticks together, Brannagh did a wonderful job from top to finish. Having already seen Iron man 1 and 2 and the Incredible Hulk, and now Thor, the big picture is starting to be clear: can't wait for Captain America! I just want to say AVENGERS! ASSEMBLE!

Derivative and hackneyed but Hemswroth scores highly,"With just one more movie to go before next years big screen adaptation of Marvel comics ""The Avengers"" hits the big screen ""Thor"", the penultimate film in the Marvel chain of films that makes up one quarter of the Avengers team that acts as a precedent to what is to come. Preceded by ""Iron Man"" and It's sequel as well as 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" reboot, not one of those films (although none of which were bad) were anything close to remarkable. So with this in mind I have to admit that my hopes for ""Thor"" weren't incredibly high but I decided to at least give it a chance and watch the movie with an open mind. However once again I can't say that my expectations were not confirmed.The set up which is plain and simple enough is this, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules over the world of Asgard. A realm where magic and science are one and the same. His people defend the nine realms from the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and in defending the Norse people of Earth in 970 AD they come to be worshipped as Gods. In the present Odin has two sons Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor(Chris Hemsworth) who will one day take his father's place and ascend the throne of Asgard. When a group of Frost Giants invade their kingdom in a failed bid to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters which was taken from them by the Asgaridans after their defeat over a millennia ago. Thor demands that an example must be made of their icy foes. Going against the orders of Odin he leads a band of his friends to confront them ultimately leading to a war which enrages Odin who strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth. It is on Earth he is eventaully forced to redeem himself and become Earth's greatest defender while befriending scientist Jane Foster (Nathalie Portman)As a film ""Thor"" marks a departure for it's director Kenneth Brangah who up until now has been concerned mainly with helming serious drama's as well as his trademark inclination for adapting Shakespeare's plays to the big screen. I was intrigued how he would cope with handling a big budget fantasy/adventure movie and It's to his credit that he does an admirable job. His handling of the fight scenes is top notch and are well choreographed where upon the cinematography fits in well with the flow of the action. While the more light hearted moments of the script compliment the overall feel of the film which means it never takes itself too seriously. The fish out of water moments where Thor explores the new world that he has found himself banished strike the right chord and are handled with good natured charm. As Thor Chris Hemsworth is equal parts charismatic and charming while portraying the acquired level of cockiness so that he makes a affable yet flawed hero who doesn't fall beyond the way side in to caricature. He also proves to also be adept at the more physical aspects. The supporting cast are also solid with Nathalie Portman proving to be likable and touches the right note of sincerity as Jane, while being a neat foil to Hemsworth with Anthony Hopkins providing a commanding and wise presence as Odin. But the break through performance for me has to go to Tom Hiddleston who is fantastic as Loki. He really makes you believe in Thor's stepbrother if at times you find yourself struggling to completely swallow everything due to the slightly leaky script. I am keen to see how his career will progress on the back of ""Thor"" as he he is someone who I think might have a promising career ahead of him.What lets the film down is It's flat, routine plot which is overstepped by of the action and the overall grandeur spectacle. The sub-plot regarding Thor's road to redemption meanders in to cliché and is therefore predictable, relying on his trademark hammer as a threadbare tool to punctuate the point. Some of the characterisation from some of the supporting characters is a little too hammy and a bit thin on the ground and seem at times to be nothing more than window dressing to help further the progression of the films narrative. I also found myself not being able to reconcile myself to the motivations of Loki who the film tries to inject some depth in to him which goes beyond that of being a mere villain and that of a tragic figure but it doesn't come off as the least bit convincing. It's easier to envisage Loki as being a man driven by greed and ambition rather than that of a despondent antagonist left rocked by the sudden revelation that his father has been forced to impart on him. Triggering him to further an agenda to prove his inner worth. The presence of SHIELD, the government agency seen previously in ""Iron Man 2"" is only there to generate some action and create an obstacle to Thor retrieving his magical hammer which has been sent to Earth along with him. Anything other than that it just seems like they factor in as plot set up to next years Avengers movie and offer little else to the films plot making them largely obligatory. An overawing experience for non-fans although I suspect those more familiar with the comics will find more to like. I wouldn't bet my hopes on the film finding a wider appeal beyond it's fandom on the strengths of it. As this type of film goes It's inoffensive enough and passes the time and has It's colourful. little flourishes to commend it. However It's just another by the numbers blockbuster that ends up putting It's money where it's heart should be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Strangely Shakespearean superhero film; a bit rushed, but enjoyable","'Thor' follows its eponymous protagonist, the Norse god of thunder, banished to Earth to learn humility, as his brash and arrogant attitudes provoke a war. Meanwhile, his brother Loki takes his chance to seize the Asgardian throne.Part of Marvel's attempt to create a cinematic superhero universe (the Avengers franchise), 'Thor' stands apart as the most outworldly of the bunch despite its basic banishment and redemption plot. I did not know much of the superhero beforehand, but I know a lot of Norse mythology and I felt Marvel's attempt to recreate it within a real world to be very good. The visuals of Asgard (and Jotunheim) are stunning and truly worthy of gods, whereas the effects involved in the Bifrost scenes are also wonderful.Kenneth Branagh, mostly known for his Shakespeare adaptations ('Henry V', 'Hamlet'), is quite an odd directorial choice. He brings a distinct Shakespearean feeling to this film: the Asgardian world has a distinct medieval structure, with Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in special evoking quite a lot the kings of old. Many other developments within the film reminds of 'King Lear', 'Henry V' and other Shakespeare's works, plus a very old-fashioned dialogue.The cast is partially good. Anthony Hopkins, as Odin, is capable of transmitting the regal wisdom and imperative power of his character. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Thor as far as looks are concerned, and manages to convey well the god's personality. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, a delightfully machiavellian villain, and gives quite a powerful performance as the film's most complex character (surprisingly so for a superhero film). The other Asgardian characters, in special Heimdall (a controversial Idris Elba), are also very good.On the other hand, the film faces quite a bit of problem with the Earth setting. Not only is this part of the film very dull when compared to the Asgard one, the redemption part of the story is quite rushed with Thor somehow relearning his values far too fast to be believable. The rather weak performances from the human cast (Natalie Portman in particular is very bad, but Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings don't shine either) only makes the situation worse. There are some tries at humor, which doesn't work always, and some rather good action sequences.The film is mostly successful thanks to the stunning Asgard portion of the story (8/10), but it suffers from the rather poor earthly development (5/10). Overall, still quite a fun superhero film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
wonderful surprise,"I must be honest, my hopes for this movie were very low. The trailer wasn't very appealing and to capture Thor's comic magic was quite a challenge. Gladly i was mistaken, the movie is a great introduction to the asgardian hero and i was kept entertained from beginning to the end.Balanced action that moves back and forward between Asgard and Midgard. Sadly 3D doesn't make the movie better, on the contrary. I sincerely hope 3D is reserved for pure animation movies... that's right... leave ""pure"" cinema alone.Chris Hemsworth played the perfect Thor (after being bitten by zillions of steroid ""bees"" to bulk up for the part)Hopkins plays Odin very well, wise, mysterious and powerful like the god of gods should be.Was impressed with Tom Hiddleston has Loki, moving from a friendly innocent role to a mischievous, dark character (just like it was in the norse Myths).Portman did her part, strangely looking very young compared to some other roles, but Chris/Tom lead the play here.Using a color actor for Heimdall (Idris Elba) was a very odd move, considering we're talking about norse gods. Surprisingly it worked very well, since Heimdall is the guardian of Bitfrost and he messes up with magic portals, the dark skin gives him that arcane-wise looks.Can't say the same about the Asian actor (Asano) who is COMPLETELY out of place here, with his strange accent and looks... one of the reasons i don't give 10 out of 10. Actually, i find Thor's friends (apart from Loki) a bit of the ""weird bunch"", lacking charisma and presence in the movie (and with the Asian guy, lacking on the norse department).Asgard was well portrayed, CGI all the way... but comparing with the comics, Asgard is a very stylish version of a norse ""olympium"".Action sequences were great and so was the humor. Many times i found myself laughing my behind off to some viking style behavior.Don't want to spoil it for you, but if you know the comics style, you will actually feel like inside them sometimes, with all that cosmic atmosphere around the fight sequences - colorful, mysterious, out of this world.The only last fault i can mention was me wanting for more... and isn't that a good thing for a first movie?Bring on Thor 2!!! Odin be praised!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
watchable,"After a slow start, with lots of actors speaking in stiff, we-are-an- ancient-peoples voices, Thor picks up as the vain, arrogant god comes to earth and hooks up with some scientists. But while the movie does get better, it never moves past the mark of a Saturday afternoon time killer. There is some pretty scenery and some nice effects (the fire-shooting armor giant is particularly nicely done), but nothing that raises this above the ordinary.The acting is decent, although Thor's romance with the scientist feels less like true love than like two good-looking people who have fallen in lust, and there's not an ounce of real emotion anywhere in the spectacle. But it's perfectly fine for what it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Super hero love story...,"The Thor character is a bit goofy and very child like so if it weren't for his good looks and super hero abilities he would be very lacking. That being said, there was enough character development to engage you towards the personalities in this film. The action was really good, it was not over used. The special effects were used sparingly, so no distraction from too much fake looking CGI (like in some of the spider man movies). All in all, a fun trip to the movies. If you want a light hearted fun evening at the movies, I recommend this movie. For the ladies... Thor is very generous about showing an exceptionally developed torso. When I first saw this preview with my girlfriend, it seemed she wanted to see this movie mostly to see Thor without shirt. So ladies you will be pleased.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel has surpassed them selves,"I just got back form seeing ""Thor"" in my local cinema. First off, big negative to them for ruining the after credits by just stopping it after 10 seconds. So yes, we again have scene after the credits, and yes, I can confirm it's epic (after googeling it), and no, I am (of course) not going to tell you what it is.One small side note for those who read this, I am a huge Marvel fan-boy. I'll try to conceal that and try to be a bit objective. That is even harder for me considering I am of Frisian lineage, meaning, well, lets just say I have a Mjölnir tattoo and tend to hail to Odin and Thor while raising my drinking horn.Onward to the movie!I expected a fun movie. It's Marvel after all. Lots of special effects, good, decent acting, not to deep of a story. Did I come unprepared. It simply blew me away. Marvel picked up the pace after ""Iron Man"". I liked that one a lot. Then came the new ""Hulk"" which, in my opinion, was also time well spent watching it. ""X-men: Origins Wolverine"" was awesome, be it a bit simple. ""Iron Man 2"" topped all 3 of them. But until now, the ""X-men"" movies have always been my favorite. As said, until now.""Thor"" is everything you would expect from a Marvel movie, and so, so much more. The visuals are stunning. They are by far the best I personally have ever seen in a Marvel movie. They can compete for the first prise with ""Avatar"", and probably win that contest. Everything about it breaths ""epic"". This also goes for the music. Sound and visual blend in perfectly to create an overwhelming experience.But acting is important as well. And it's spot on. It is here that my knowledge of the Northern mythology and stories kicks in. I caught myself comparing the facts I knew with that in the movie. I went in, thinking there might be some references to the Edda, but it was as if Marvel actually took the time to read the book! Yes there are some minor flaws, but nothing that really bothered me (like in other movies, big example being ""Clash of the Titans"", fun action, but just threw entire Greek mythology aside). Odin is spot on. Anthony Hopkins did it 100% perfect. Thor is as he should be; a good hearted, arrogant, slightly dumb, but enjoyable character who loves to drink, fight, drink and fight some more. His one-liners are really worth repeating when drinking with friends(I already warned my mother that she should start buying new coffee cups). The, for me, relatively new actor Chris Hemsworth just made it in to my ""I want to see more of him""-list. Same goes for Loki. He might not have noticed it, but I think the Trickster took over a part of Hiddleston's body during the shooting of this movie. And last but definitely not least, a special notice for Idris Elba. Heimdall is simply awesome. Only a view lines for him, but he makes them count, for two! It's to bad that the other actors fade away in the background next to the 3 leading actors. Their performance is solid, they do what they have to do, but nothing more. This is also caused by the fact that their characters only reach a moderate amount of debt.That is about the only remark I have on the movie. The debt of the supporting role's. The effects are breath taking and the references to the North religion is kept spared, even honored from my personal point of view. The action and special effect that come with them are, as said, epic. You all know the feeling when you watch a terrific movie scene, or listen to an awesome song. The goose bumps, the water in your eyes, the smile on your face. I've had it a view times during different movies, I always get it when listening to a new ""Amon Amarth"" CD or track, but I never experienced it multiple times as I did during this movie. I ask you to stay a while and watch the beautifully animated ""Yggdrasil"" during the end credits. I thought it was breath taking.-Marvel fan boy (like me)? MUST SEE! -Viking/Norse saga/mythology fan/believer (like me)? Set aside the fact that it is Marvel, and you'll see an homage to our Gods yet unseen.I'm rating it with 8 stars, because 9 and 10 is the region where, i.m.o, the movies with the deep stories and characters belong. That's the only reason. I think it is the best Marvel movie existing at this moment, and if they keep it up at this level, I can't wait to see what the future movies (""First Class"", ""Capt America"", ""The Avengers"") have in store for us.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best MARVEL ever created!,"This movie is amazing! The perfect mix between hilariousness and seriousness, this is a MUST watch! I love the way MARVEL incorporated Mythology with modern times. Chris Hemsworth's outstanding performance will catch the eyes of every audience. Alongside with Tom Hiddleston, who's skill in planning Loki could not be outmatched by any other actor. What I love about this film is that it is not the usual American superhero movie, it has a relaxing feel to it, a sense of an English production, something that you cannot find in many movies these days. The story is put together in a lovely way, and Natalie Portman's Jane is played with significance. Darcy is always there to brighten the day, and the link with avengers is intriguing beyond doubt. I often wonder–with the new Thor Ragnarok looking bad, will MARVEL ever be able to capture the quality of this movie ever again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Darwinian Superman II with Big Laughs,"Nearly half of Thor is set in Asgard, one of the universe's nine ""realms,"" which is reigned over by King Odin.

For this, Odin takes away Thor's power, which comes from his magical hammer, and expels him to Earth, where he's accommodated by Natalie Portman, in her third decidedly unambitious screen role since her success with Black Swan, an astrophysicist who's in the infancy of hypothesizing the very universal trapdoor through which Thor just came. The biggest shock is that the film is most effective and involving where you would least expect it. One would think that Branagh would do more with the film's unsmiling supernatural constituents and probably labor over its more down-to-earth relief stretches, yet it's precisely the opposite.The tone is unexpectedly good-humored. Baffled as to who he is, Jane imagines that Thor might be extraterrestrial, although her partner Stellan Skarsgård is dubious because all the words and names that Thor uses are recognizable to him from his Scandinavian background. Nonetheless, they wind up helping him in his pursuit to reclaim the hammer, albeit double-super-secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, known from the Iron Man movies, has located it already. Meanwhile, back in Asgard, Thor's younger brother Loki, who initially seemed to be a level-headed sounding board, is scheming behind Thor's back to guarantee that his exile is eternal and he inherits the kingdom. Given Branagh's qualifications in Shakespeare and literary adaptations, one would assume that the royal and familial plot on Asgard would be the film's highlights, but these scenes are indeed very tedious, and occasionally fairly stilted.Maybe it's due to all the digital sets and backdrops, which are lavishly accomplished but never quite seem palpable, not to mention a whole 'nother century of cinema's worth of dutch angles. Where Branagh genuinely enlivens the film is on Earth, where a light-hearted and even cleverly hilarious streak offsets the take-me-serious histrionic matters. The first half hour of this silly movie is indeed a drag as it's too sanctimonious, but once Thor discovers himself in the deserts of New Mexico, it's priceless, and all the more so as it's so unexpected, to see these very relatable mere mortals look on while he speaks in some sort of imitation-medieval English. ""I need sustenance!"" he proclaims at a small-town diner, shortly before smashing his coffee cup on the floor. And eventually he grasps, rather hilariously, that he's no longer as mighty as he was before, his schooling in modesty and logic assume a valid emotional concentration.Thor, a prince in any case, is chivalrous and reverential of women, but also a hard-drinking, giant-slaughtering conqueror once deified by Vikings. We find ourselves regularly laughing with the movie, for instance at the way he reacts to doctors attempting to take his blood, or how he asks for that second cup of coffee at breakfast. Still, where the movie loses my interest is in that faraway dimension, where the set design's tawdry golden flash envelops the quarrels of the gods---essentially, the swarthy conspirator against the heroic Aryan---comes across as an incessant, uninflected one-note huff. Kat Dennings as Portman's friend discharges some well-delivered lines and then practically evaporates, beautiful bosom and all, but on Asgard, Rene Russo, as Odin's wife-slash-Thor's mother, has one line and nothing else to do.Thankfully, the Shakespearean at the helm manages to inculcate a taste of the Bard's irony. Speaking of which, just because Loki's a hackneyed character doesn't mean young British actor Tom Hiddleston wouldn't make a first-rate Edmund in King Lear: He's better at relating his resentment and jealousy than any evil or wickedness. Thor boils down to nothing more than big laughs, loud and tacky Hollywood action, and a hero who requires suffering the loss of his might before he can truly be mighty. It's a lesser installment in the superhero adaptation bubble, but one that is wonderfully entertaining on its own restricted conditions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved This Movie,Thor is one of my favorite Marvel movies. The characters were fun and the world building was fantastic. I was so excited to see the visual effects that brought Asgard to life. Chris Hemsworth really is the perfect Thor and Tom Hiddleston is perfect for Loki. The only actor that fell short was Natalie Portman. Her acting was very bland and for a top-billed actress she should have put more effort into the character of Jane Foster. It seems that she had become so unlikable that she was written off during Thor: Ragnarok.Thor is the best character in the whole Avengers roster and seeing him on the big screen was a real treat. The plot was a simple hero's journey but the growth and action has made this film even more enjoyable with each viewing. My favorite scene was the battle on Jotunheim because of how great the effects were and the choreography of the fight scenes. It did not feel like they were just actors playing near a green screen. Thor was the first Marvel film to succeed in creating dynamic new worlds that felt as real as the action scenes in New Mexico.Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Fiege brought a lot of comedic and memorable moments that are still referenced in other movies and shows. Truly this has become one of the most iconic films in the past decade and has ushered in the impressive Marvel Cinematic Universe.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Disappointment,"Why aren't there any fans working for this movie?! I saw this movie with my brother. We are two fans of comic-book heroes. I admit I went to the movie thinking ""Why did they not cast that viking from 13th Warrior?"", ""Why are they going for the cute guy instead of making Thor really scary and north like?!"". The reason: Hollywood is getting stupider with every film. No more suspense, no more nothing. Money, money, money.... See this movie once and then never again. The acting is awful, Natalie Portman is done making good movies and I feel so bad that Anthony Hopkins really involved his name in this movie. P.S.: Thor's hammer looks like it's made of plastic, same as Green Goblins plastic outfit from Spider Man 1.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This One Delivers,"I'll admit I hadn't seen many comic book adaptations prior to this, but Thor may very well have hooked me on the genre. Director Kenneth Branagh places greatest emphasis on maintaining a quick pace, by stringing together a series of quality action scenes. Unlike some other action films, this one avoids such a blinding speed where all other key components (character development, plot, scripting...) are left by the wayside, gasping for air. Thor is a film that focuses on character and plot, and develops these through the action scenes.The character development in Thor is fairly light, which is to be expected from an action film, but all main characters are developed through the main and sub plots. Academy award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman have smaller roles yet provide the acting substance which nicely balances the film. Also, two lesser known actors, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, both easily hold their own as the protagonist and antagonist, respectively.Thor was an impressive watch, the visual effects were slick, Thor's home-world of Asgard was thoroughly polished and real-looking, and the fact that it had plots occurring in completely different environments (Earth and Asgard), was just plain cool, and added to the scale. Overall, the absolute best thing about Thor is that it combines quick and intense action scenes, with both plot and character development. The team behind the screenplay deserve credit for this, because it elevates Thor easily beyond your standard actioner.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Norse God has arrived....,"The Norse God's arrival on Earth was imminent from the appearance of his hammer, Mjolnir at the end of 'IronMan 2' and director Kenneth Branagh presents The God of Thunder upon our humble planet while making it entertaining with fantastic scenes of the realm of Asgard and quirky moments of Thor adapting to life on Earth. But those who know of the arrogant, powerful and reckless son of Odin, the expectations of thunderous action would be greater than the might of the hammer as depicted in the movie.On the day of Thor's crowning as King, some frost giants mysteriously break into the secret chambers of Odin and upon such discovery, Thor ventures into their realm of Jotunheim to respond to their threat. Along with his friends, Thor wages a reckless war with the Jotuns, with Mjolnir swinging wildly at any adversary and Thor flying brutally through a monster's mouth; but it is Odin's wisdom that saves them at a crucial juncture. Annoyed with Thor's rash behaviour and to teach him a lesson, Odin sends him to Earth without his powers and it is on this humble planet, that Thor, in his powerless state, learns to respect life and calms down as an almighty. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who crashes into the fallen Thor in the middle of a stormy desert, cools his temperament and serves as Earth's cheesy interest for him. His foster brother, Loki, meanwhile, plans to usurp the throne of Asgard while Odin is lost in his sleep and unleash the frost giants upon the beautiful realm. It's up to the mighty Thor to re-gain his powers and return to Asgard to re-establish order and destroy its threats.Undeniably, Thor is an exciting adventure. From the spectacularly depicted realm of Asgard, to the brutal battle with the frost giants and through the funny moments of Thor's introduction to our planet, there is entertainment galore and with Chris Hemsworth's cheeky Norse-like persona, Thor is all the more enjoyable. However, there is one major element that disappoints. This is a movie about Thor - The God of Thunder. The almighty one who has fallen from Asgard into the correctional facility that is Earth. His nemesis include frost giants and the destroyer that is sent to Earth by the evil works of Loki but apart from their brief confrontations, there is a certain dearth of the mind- blowing action that we would expect. The Mjolnir is hardly put into use after the initial battle and thunder is never used upon Thor's commanding. While the anticipation for the climax grew, the realization that there wasn't any action to be enjoyed, was the film's most disappointing aspect. It just did not end on a high that would be worthy of a thunder God.Instead, Branagh's approach seemed to center around portraying Thor as the reckless hero who couldn't control his mighty powers with a short fuse. Hemsworth enacts that aspect brilliantly with a boyish charm. Branagh also takes the liberty to throw in some cheesy romance between Thor and Jane which just doesn't suit the Norse character. Natalie Portman blushes her way through awkward moments and the excitable ones. Hemsworth too, seems lost in those romantic escapades since even he cannot relate to the Thunder God indulging in the cheesiness. Anthony Hopkins, in his brief role as Odin blends rather well and so does Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the insecure and mischievous foster brother of Thor.It does seem impossible to overlook the inspiration for the battle sequence with the frost giants ('The Lord of The Rings'), the depiction of spectacular Asgard (Rivendell) and Odin's palace (Minas Tirith) but the result however, is simply astounding.Thor could've been a bigger, more thunderous epic but from a director with a Shakespearean background; this works. For what it's worth, Thor entertains in a wholesome manner with all the gorgeous effects, action and a superhero's helpless struggle being on Earth. Thundering into the summer box-office, Thor sets things up for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s 'Avengers Initiative' that is due next year and as the disclaimer in all superhero movies goes, ""wait till the end of credits.""8.199 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS,"""I never wanted the throne, I only ever wanted to be your equal!"" – LokiMarvel: Phase One is hurtling along the Bifrost (Norse Rainbow Road) at break-neck speed towards the eagerly awaited Avengers Assemble. Hold on a second though, as we're still missing a character: the God of Thunder, Thor son of Odin. With Iron Man, Captain America and the Hulk's backgrounds already covered, Thor was the final major Avenger to appear on screen, and, similar to Black Widow's incorporation into Iron Man 2, we are introduced to the complete Avengers line-up by the end of Thor, as Clint Barton (Hawkeye) features in a small role as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Onto the small task of giving Thor a strong foothold then; Kenneth Branagh was arguably given the most arduous pre-Avenger movie to direct, having to create a story spanning across several worlds. Whilst it doesn't stand up to Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Thor is a decent enough film in its own right, greatly helped along the way by a strong cast.Having disobeyed his father, King Odin (Hopkins), Thor (Hemsworth) is banished to Earth from his home realm of Asgard on war-mongering treason counts. Little brother Loki (Hiddlestone) becomes the de-facto heir to the throne. Whilst Thor tries to adjust to his human body and lifestyle, he meets an enchanting young scientist, Jane Foster (Portman), and gradually learns to quell his rash judgemental character. However, Loki has been secretly spinning a web to ensnare his extremely gullible blonde-haired brother, hatching a plot to wreak chaos wherever he possibly can.Positives first: Kenneth Branagh did a very good job directing this film. He successfully got the best he could out of his actors. Hemsworth is commanding, loud, and has a perfect grasp of the term ""fool-hardy"". He shares a workable chemistry with Portman (some awkward moments, but nothing drastic), and plays extremely well off of the brilliant Hiddlestone. The two on screen brothers have an essence of polar opposition; one a devious, sincere and resolute thinker with patience in abundance, the other a foolish, brutalising warrior with a thirst for blood and glory. I'd like to have seen more of their relationship explored though, especially with their father. The supporting cast are also largely accomplished, Skarsgard, Hopkins and Elba in particular. Unfortunately I have to harshly critique both the character of Darcy and her portrayer, Kat Dennings. Pointless. She should never have been written into the film in the first place and genuinely ruined every scene she was in by being generally annoying and interrupting of any positivity taking place. Thor's crew were also fairly weak, and were merely there to serve a purpose of providing him an ally, nothing more, nothing less.Storywise, Thor started very strongly; the mythical Lord of the Rings feel to the opening, and the exploration of Asgardian culture was all excellent, the visuals are mind-boggling to boot. The tone suggested at this point that Thor would be a sincere epic, detached from the general quirky Marvel superhero film feel. Enter Earth, and things change drastically. A let down at first, Thor's experiences on Earth are rife with comic relief, less in-your-face than Iron Man, but also less natural to the script. However, as the story develops, you begin to appreciate the change in tone between the two worlds as a representation of cultural differences. Branagh handles directing this complicated matter competently, but the story jumps around a bit too much to allow you to do the same (something I would suggest had something to do with the large number of writers). Along with a few questionable plot points (Loki knowing what Earthlings wear when he manifests himself onto the planet, Thor's regaining his powers from his comatose father's tear), the ending was fairly weak. Loki was beaten far too easily, and his story wasn't concluded properly, undeserving after a strong performance. The whole thing also felt a little rushed, possibly because the premise was to introduce Thor's background and set up his place in Avengers Assemble.Thor is a mixed bag with regard to music. Asgard is littered with grandiose and majestic passages of music that would grace much more artistic films, and are befitting of the fantastic CGI scenery they are accompanying. However, Patrick Doyle is forced to work with the jagged tone of the film, and had to sacrifice building on the epic Asgardian themes for something more fitting with a general superhero score on planet Earth: piano for the romantic moments, standard percussion heavy action music for combat scenes, and so on.Overall, Thor is an enjoyable film. You're not going to watch it if you're looking for something you have to immerse yourself within. It plays out exactly as a standard popcorn movie does: good guy versus bad guy, pretty, independent girl who suddenly is overcome by burly protagonist's masculinity etc. Where Thor excels beyond mediocrity is through its strong cast (Hiddlestone in particular), unbelievably stunning visuals (Asgard just blew me away) and a lack of reliance on action scenes to fill out the running time. It does, however, suffer from distinct changes in tone and disjointed plot elements, and a feeling of being three quarters finished due to the big rush towards Avengers Assemble.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor's origin is underrated,"I have to admit that I will always have a soft spot for Thor. This is in part due to the outstanding performances of the cast, especially Tom Hiddleston as the mischievous Loki.Director Kenneth Branagh brought his Shakespearean background to play with this movie, and it shows in some of the dialogue and dramatic scenes. The story also does a great job of bringing the world of Asgard to life and giving it a unique visual style.One of the major highlights of Thor is the scene-stealing performance of Idris Elba as Heimdall, the gatekeeper of Asgard. His commanding presence and gravitas bring a sense of seriousness to the movie that is sometimes lacking in Marvel films.All in all, Thor is a fun and engaging superhero movie that introduces one of Marvel's most iconic characters to a wider audience. While it may have some flaws, the strong performances and unique visual style make it a movie that I would recommend to any Marvel fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect blend of Fantasy and Action,"Of all the movies leading into the Avengers, Thor was perhaps the film i was least looking forward to. Whenever I think of Marvel's superheroes, I think of Spiderman, Fantastic 4, IronMan, Hulk etc. The last guy that comes to mind is Thor, who is ""the god of lightening"". After watching this film however, he's right up there. I enjoyed the blend of fantasy, Shakespearean folklore and modern action. Everything seemed to flow through easily. The transitions from the planet Asguard and Earth were seamless and very well done. The special effects were decent and not too overbearing. The buildup to the Avenger's movie is in full effect in Thor with regular appearances of Agent Coulson representing S.H.I.E.L.D.Thor was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Chris Hemsworth performance as Thor was great. He was a natural fit for the character and showed a great range of emotion. He can be menacing and funny in one scene. He can also be serious and mellow as well which is impressive. His interaction with Jane (Natalie Portman) seemed authentic which would've been difficult to do with the story behind Thor.All in all this movie kept me engaged and I bought into the Thor Mythology. I was entertained through out the film. There was a good balance of comedy/drama/action in Thor. Looking forward to the next phase in the next Thor movie.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The fourth Marvel Studios film is another triumph that's witty, dramatic and entertaining.","Thor was one of two films by Marvel Studios released during the summer of 2011, the other being Captain America: The First Avenger. Both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) appeared in The Avengers (2012), a film that I initially didn't like much but after some time have grown to appreciate. The Avengers is a superb superhero film, one of the best of all time in fact. In Thor the best performance is by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Tom again played Loki as the main villain in The Avengers. Loki is clearly up to no good but Hiddleston managed to show that he's a complex sympathetic character. Hemsworth was a good choice to play Thor, the crown prince of Asgard. With his dirty blond hair and ridiculously chiseled physique Hemsworth has plenty of charisma as Thor. The humor is frequent here and so is the action. The CGI was put to good use, and the realization of Asgard and the Bifrost is especially impressive. Still, the center of the film is the relation between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons. Director Kenneth Branagh was a good choice to tell this drama reminiscent of a play by William Shakespeare. Hopkins is a commanding presence as Odin, so his is another standout performance. But really, all the actors deliver here. There's Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three, there's Heimdall (Idris Elba), and there's Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The love story is a bit rushed since Thor and Jane fall in love by the fire with a starry night sky behind them. The pacing too isn't perfect but Thor is a thrilling film which can improve just about anyone's mood. Patrick Doyle delivered a good score, and the Foo Fighters song Walk was also included in the film. In conclusion, there's much to like in Thor and I highly recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
OK film...,"It's a fun flick but that's about it. I particularly thought the action scenes could be a bit cooler and complex towards the end but all the excitement and fight scenes occur early on. The ending fight scene was lame. Also the Frost Giants were all clones... very dull enemies. However, that's just the action. The story was very simple and I felt like any Marvel Comic fan or reader could've easily written it. Nothing out of the extraordinary. You'd expect a bit more ingenuity in the screenplay. I thought I'd expect more especially since the casts were so high standard but I was slightly disappointed. Not a memorable film but it's still fun film. I'd give the Action 6/10, Screenplay 6/10, CGI&SFX 6/10, Acting 7/10, Fun Factor 7/10. Overall about 6.5/10 but I'll downplay it to a 6 since I don't understand how this movie could get such a overall high rating... It's fun but not that great. Maybe the rating is high because it's Thor which I think is understandable haha. If it wasn't Marvel, I doubt it would've gotten such a high rating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you've read the comics or at least have a brain, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE","First of all, after seeing both, I'd recommend you watch this movie in 2D. It is one of the worst comic book adaptations I've ever seen. All the fight scenes happened to fast and you could barely see it if you watch it in 3D, all the female characters are portrayed as useless idiots and if you haven't read the comic book this movie will not make any sense. Just don't waste your money. It has ruined my childhood. The plot was strung together very loosely as well. Don't get me wrong, some of the acting was very good. For example, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddlestone really brought this screen to life when they were given time behind Chris Hemsworth and his horribly cheesy acting. The directors could have done so much better. I guess that's what happens when you sell your soul to Disney (Marvel was sold to Disney). What a shame",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor - a successful adaptation of the comics and a reminder of the golden age of action films,"The trouble with making a film about Thor is that you are making an adaptation of a comic book that has run for 50 years which is itself based on ancient myths and legends. The comics have been written by numerous talented writers taking in many different variations on the character and include stories that adhere rigidly to the myths and are set in Asgard, or that are modern superhero stories with Thor in contemporary earth (Midgard) as well as cosmic comic book stories where Thor fights aliens in outer space. With the comics this all adds up to a rich, though often confusing, depth to the character and his history – something that tends to be true for most comic book characters that have lasted for a long time: there are debates about what is canon and what never really happened; things get re-imagined or revised – over 50 years these characters can develop and change tremendous amounts. When someone new takes over the Thor comic it is up to them to decide what aspects of the character they like and what they will focus on, and the success of the writer is usually dependent on how well they 'get' the character.I think it is fair to say that Kenneth Branagh gets Thor. Sure, his interpretation of the character varies from the comic book versions (and from the myths) in some ways – for example this Thor does not have a body swapping scheme going on with Dr. Donald Blake – but he has the main points down pretty well. Its like how Christopher Nolan gets Batman – though Batman is a undoubtedly a more complicated character. The Thor film is both cosmic and mythical, incorporating a version of Asgard that is decidedly more sci-fi than the version seen in comics recently – it's a shiny golden space fortress with a Bifröst bridge that looks like it is crafted from crystals and LEDs rather than rainbows. These Asgardians are spacemen, travelling to alien worlds with technology as well as gods with their magics, but then 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic' as Arthur C. Clarke said.I like the style of Asgard, it looks like Flash Gordon or Masters of the Universe, all glitter and glam – it's very theatrical with the rooms looking like elaborate stage sets rather than complicated but forgettable cgi nonsense. Asgard seems like a real place where real alien gods live – and sure it's all hideously tacky and you keep expecting Queen to start playing or Brian Blessed to pop up, but that's quite refreshing when most fantasy these days is so bland and unimaginative. Compared to the dreadful Clash of the Titans for example, Thor undoubtedly has a lot more style.So Thor is quite a simple character but portraying that simplicity without it turning into a farce or camp is always going to be hard – see the appearances of Thor in the 1988 Incredible Hulk Returns TV movie. I think they handle it pretty well here. The costume especially is fantastic though possibly a little plastic-y in places and I wish he would wear his helmet more often. I was very glad to see Loki in his helmet, it's something that a more conservative director might have cut out as it does look quite outlandish. Thor's interactions in Midgard are funny without being stupid and are kept to a minimum – such as him walking in front of traffic. This could easily have been overdone but instead the film concentrates on action. Everyone accepts Thor quite quickly and gets on with things.The action is well done, the Destroyer fight being a highlight I think even if it is a bit brief. I preferred the action set on Midgard to the cgi heavy fighting on Jotenheim, home of the Frost Giants. I watched the film in 3D and frankly it's a tiresome technology that adds nothing to a film like this. Occasionally the tricks with forcing focus just meant that the little people looked like toy railway models – sometimes this just looked ludicrous like tilt-shifted photography. I would suggest seeing it in 2D if you have the option, but then the people I was with liked the 3D so perhaps that is just me.The acting is all very good. The Warriors Three and Sif were quite forgettable but Heimdall – played by Idris Elba – was a fantastic presence and perfect for the role despite what some racists might say. It's strange to see Tadanobu Asano, one of the best actors in the world in my opinion, in such a minor part as Hogun and forced to speak English, the guy is a legend in Japanese cinema. Natalie Portman, Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins were all solid. I'm a big fan of Kat Denning even if she didn't have much of a role – she made Natalie Portman a bit redundant here, and Tom Hiddleston was excellent as Loki.Overall Thor is a very enjoyable blockbuster – it could so easily have been another travesty like Clash of the Titans but instead is more like a happy throwback to the golden age of action movies. The plot is lighthearted and the action is exciting but it never feels too shallow – a similar accomplishment to the best parts of the Iron Man films. It's fun rather than important or ground breaking, but sometimes that is all you can ask from a film. If only more blockbusters were like this – hopefully Captain America: The First Avenger and the subsequent Avengers film will add to Marvel's successes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
OK but nothing more,"I have to say that I was pretty underwhelmed by Thor. It has had a lot of good reviews, so I went into the film expecting something really good. Unfortunately the film didn't work for me. I thought the pacing was slow and the story jerky and didn't work particularly well. It did have some fun moments but not enough.Acting wise the film is OK, no one stood out and really I didn't care about any of the characters. The directing was OK, but again nothing special. The cinematography was OK but at no time did I think wow.The CGI was mixed much of it felt very cartoony (not in a good way), some just looked bad but at times it did work well. The score for the film fitted but was pretty much instantly forgettable.I have used the term 'OK' several time in this review and I think this sums up the film for me, it was just OK.

The God of Thunder impresses but forgets about the development along the way......,"I'll be honest – I wasn't looking forward to this movie. It's not that I thought the plot looked boring or anything but I have honestly had a bit too much of superhero Marvel films. How many more superheroes are there? I think we're gonna have a shortage soon on who can make it to the big screen eventually. So I went into this, having to pay $25 for a seat (I nearly had shock when I heard that was the amount) for 3-D plus V-max seats. And believe it or not, this is the first time I have seen something in 3-D! So I was very excited to get my first taste of it.Thor (played by a very physically fit Chris Hemsworth), who was soon to be crowned King by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is banished to Earth, stripped of his powers and essentially become mortal after his arrogance and hasty decision making cause their enemies the Frost Giants to have bad blood against them again. While on Earth, Jane foster (Natalie Portman) runs into him, along with two of her friends, who are on a mission to explore stars and the galaxy above them.Meanwhile, Thor's brother and underneath the surface rivalry between them, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has some questionable motives. Does he really want to look out for his brother or is he after the throne that has been denied to him for so long?Ten minutes into this film you can already see where the plot will take you and only someone with a blind eye would fail to notice it. It manages to make some believable characters out of this with a good performance from Wensworth, who has come along way from his Home and Away character back in Australia. He is right for the part both in his look and physical appearance and makes it believable. Anthony Hopkins is decent as King Odin but doesn't have as much screen time as I would have liked, considering his character does a vanishing act in the second half. Hiddleston however, felt more like he was meant to be cast in a spaceship movie and overacts in his role.The contrast of the two worlds of Asgard and Earth is an interesting one, though I will be honest in saying the scenes on Earth are nowhere near as fascinating as the scenes in Asgard. With the 3D, it is simply beautiful to look at, in particular the bridge that links the two worlds together. Visually, I was blown away by how good it looked.However, one of the themes of this film they explore in this is the making of a good leader. In the beginning, Thor is arrogant, self centered and proud so his lesson is to learn how to be a better person/leader. This aspect was not developed well, mainly because Thor's time on Earth is more concerned with bringing humour and establishing a very boring and highly unconvincing relationship with Jane, the physicist. Why they cast Natalie Portman into this when any other commendable actress could have done this with such a small role is pretty much for star power to attract more people to the theatre. It's funny when Thor mentions one of his lines 'I miss her' when he is back in Asgard – I was thinking to myself 'how could you miss her? You barely spent ten minutes with this woman and you miss her?' I didn't buy it for a second.For a character like Thor, who is meant to be arrogant and proud, he pretty much snaps out of it quickly on Earth, and not a lot is done to really engage you or convince you that he really has changed for the better. I'm not saying you don't see his manner change, but what really triggers this? I really felt he didn't really learn many lessons with the short time he spent with these humans, and thus the character is underdeveloped when there was so much potential for him to grow.The real plot driver is essentially another family feud in terms of sibling rivalry and is sort of the norm for epics like this. This is where the real story derives from. In terms of the enemies with the Frost Giants, there is a great scene in the beginning where Thor and his army like friends go head on battle with them, then after they become second nature to everything else, hence the enemy is often neglected in the story.The overall wrap up of the film in its conclusion is not cliché and I am glad it avoided going down a path of sentimentality to the extreme where you feel this has been done over and over. However, the end feels a bit rushed considering you are meant to have a great high respect for Thor in what he has been through. And yes, I can see why, but I didn't feel it nor did I want to give him the respect, most likely because I think the writers don't give him as much respect he deserves for what could have turned a good film into a fantastic one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mighty way to kick off the summer movie season,"I just got back from seeing Thor at my local theatre, and I have to admit I was impressed by it. To those who are wondering to go see it or not, you should it's different then the other super hero movies. Thor is based on the marvel comic of the same name, it's of course about the God of thunder Thor. The movie starts off on earth, then changes to Asgard. I have to admit the Asgard scenes were some of the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie, some of the visuals even match that of Avatar. Of course all of the actors were great. Loki was just a bad ass I wasn't expecting to like him but I did. For once they made you feel for the villain they gave him emotion. Loki is quite the character and by the end of the movie you kind of end up feeling sorry for him and the way he's been treated. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddston give the best performances of the whole movie I have to admit. The action scenes were great in the movie, exactly what you would expect from Thor. The movie ends with a bang, and if you don't know already there's a scene after the credits, so stay for that. Now I saw this in 3D so as far as that goes, the movie did a good job with it, it's the best 3D converted movie I have seen, but not the best 3D movie. Some of the scenes really didn't seem 3D, which is why it's only decent 3D for, the scenes that really worked in 3D were Asgard and the action scenes. I'd say go see it in 3D if you like 3D movies, but 2D would be just as good. Anyway I'm giving Thor a 10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It will blow you away.....unless you are dead!,"I had very low expectations for this movie when my daughter dragged me to the 12:01am showing of ""Thor"" on opening night here in the States. After all, I've never read the comic and there didn't seem to be all that much publicity concerning this film--and I just thought it would be one of Marvel's lesser films. However, when the film began I was absolutely blown away. It had to be the most beautiful and mind-blowing superhero film ever--with gorgeous visuals of other worlds that even sci-fi films haven't come close to matching. And, combined with nice 3-D effects and an exceptional score, you just turn off your brain and absorb it all--like some sort of mind-altering drug! And speaking of the score, while the ""Iron Man"" soundtracks were great (with LOTS of great AC/DC tunes among others), ""Thor"" chose instead to mostly use original compositions--and they were gorgeous.Fortunately, in addition to the gorgeous visuals and music, the film had a very good story, nice acting and great direction--by none other than Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh). I also admire the script--it had a lot of excitement and occasional humor that made the film more than just an action film crammed with amazing stunts. Well done--and hopefully the film will catch on--it deserves to do very, very well. I'd say this one was about on par with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"" in quality and entertainment value--proving that even film snobs like me can enjoy some good escapist entertainment now and again.By the way, I did have one complaint about the film. It had among the most obvious and annoying product placement I've ever seen. I got absolutely sick of seeing 7-11, Southwest Airline and Kashi crammed onto the screen. Could Paramount Studio do any worse to whore out this film?! For shame, as the film was terrific but was cheapened a bit by this crass corporate decision. Oh well, at least they weren't paid to place laxatives or hemorrhoid creams in the film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"This film, I like it. Another!","With The Avengers in the horizon, there is reason to doubt whether this will be Iron Man or Iron Man 2 where its development was rushed so that Stark would be ready to team up with the likes of Hawkeye and Hulk. However through Kenneth Branagh's directing he is successful in making an enjoyable action film about the God of thunder.In an interview Kenneth Branagh said that Thor is similar to Shakespeare because of the family conflicts. The script itself may not be Shakespeare but you can draw some similarities. It is in these moments of conflict between father (Antony Hopkins) and son (Chris Hemsworth) where the film shines. While the filmmakers did their best to make the Earth scenes interesting, they do not hold up well to the scenes on Thor's home planet.Thor is a visually spectacular film with amazing CGI. Some say that it is becoming over used in films today but this film uses it with care. There are no moments where the CGI would drop below par. Like the film it remains consistent throughout.The acting that includes many recognisable faces, is very good. Chris Hemsworth as Thor handles the character well as does his brother in the film played by Tom Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba are also really good. Natalie Portman, while also good, is never given any dialogue to help project herself above romantic interest sadly.While you might not really care for the romantic sub-plot until the end, the film packs a punch, delivering solid action sequences. Unlike Iron Man 2, this left me interested in seeing what happens next in The Avengers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Superhero adaption lacking the spark of depth,"The movie adaption of Marvel's superhero story Thor is a decent one with the common superhero movie themes. It is a bit shame since some of the characters could have easily been far more interesting, especially Loki. The lack of depth in characters is the biggest flaw of the film. I ended up wondering whether the writers and the actors knew what kind character they are playing or not since there was obviously some themes lingering around that made the film to feel a bit more unique than average. Also some of the sceneries are awesome and very well made and they turn out to be the most impressive thing in this a bit over the average super hero movie. It was amusing superhero movie to watch and made a difference between other superhero movies. Unfortunately sharpening the characters and adding more depth into the plain good versus bad, the hero versus the villain could have made this a remarkable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

As quoted by Thor in this abominable movie: ""For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do"". As bad as this movie is, I can understand why.

'Bore',"(sigh). I really don't know what went wrong. Or rather I do, but simply don't understand why it was aloud to happen. Thor is flashy, exciting, and at times, downright epic. It's only when the film slows down (and it does this A lot) and the actors are forced to rely on the script, that the premise begins showing holes.Thor was going to be tough sell from the beginning. Superhero films were hard enough to market due to some of the source material just being to silly to adapt to screen. Even comic book fans (which I am) can admit that some of the more ludicrous Batman villains (if you're in the mood for a laugh, look up Calenderman) could never make it in the serious, gritty, plausible world of Christopher Nolan. The same goes for any other superhero film. There must be an attempt to ground the more fantastical elements into realism or the audience will taken out of the movie. It's a fine line between realistic, and believable. Thor is about the Norse God of thunder, who's been banished to earth for starting a war with Frost Giants, leaving his sorcerer brother Loki, to plot against his father and all of Asgard; the home of the Gods.Thor doesn't fit into realistic or believable, to say the least, so that was the first strike. But would not have been the ending blow. Fantsy has done will in the past for summer movies (See Lord of The Rings). But when Thor is bluntly introduced to the very nonmagical world of Midgard (That's Earth doncha know), your mind is suddenly faced with a juxtaposition. This meeting of two very different worlds can work. If the script is any good. And this is Thor's problem.The dialog feels really wooden at times, and the interactions between Thor and the lesser characters (see everyone who's not Natile Portman), is never developed on. Thor and Jane's relationship just seems forced, as does everything else that's character motivated in this plot. When the film delivers an action sequence, it delivers one HELL of an action sequence. The fights are amazing, and creative, and the effects really show where most of the money went. The acting is great, if hammy at times, and there are no bad actors. There just simply isn't a lot to work with in terms of script. There are some lines that, while emotion is clearly being delivered behind them, just sound flat out silly, and create unintentional comedy.For what material there was to work with, Chris Hemeisntworth, delivers a more then adequate performance, coming across as the right amounts of kind, confident, but arrogant and angry to a fault. Natiel Portman, feels a bit wasted here, but she delivers a passable performance. Thor is by no means a bad movie, or even a bad superhero movie. Where more of Iron Man 2 territory, rather then Dardevil here. But a poor script keeps the God of Thunder from being great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The only God of The Avengers,"After seeing it in a Special Screening I only have to say it. Wow, I wasn't expecting that, I knew that Kenneth Branagh is a great Director but the way that he translate the story and the comic into life was marvelous.The acting is good, the actors bring the characters to life, Hemsworth brings an excellent Thor (maybe the wrestler fighter Triple H was a better choice because has more the look of Nordic),with an splendid Odin(Hopkins) and a great Loki(Hiddleston).The only failure that I can find is the size of the hammer, if you have seen the trailer you will know what I am saying, I think was too small for the size of Thor but besides that the movie is great.The 3D in this movie was good but sometimes is a bit unnecessary.8/10 for some dialogs and some excessive use of Special Effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Your ancestors called it magic but you call it science. I come from a land where they are one and the same. ""","Surprisingly Thor has got the magic of an amazing, popcorn overflowing, comic-book movie. I have to say I was quite sceptical about this movie, the footage in the trailers looked pretty lame and stupid, but the great reviews I kept reading about this movie made me change my mind to go and see the movie.When I read that Kenneth Brannagh is directing Thor I had no idea what to think about it, I mean a renowned Shakespearean director and actor at the helm of a high-budget comic book movie? It just didn't seem like a good idea, but I didn't believe that Jon Favreau could pull off a good movie with Iron Man and he proved us wrong and so does Brannagh. It seems that Marvel has got good hand on picking the directors.The character of Thor is a tricky one to translate to screen. Firstly Thor isn't like other superheroes, he isn't human, he is a God, one who was worshiped by ancient Norsemen. The story might be simple but that doesn't matter if it's well told. Thor is cast down to Earth by his father Odin for his reckless actions that reignite an ancient war and is forced to live among humans. Thor is one of the most charismatic, arrogant, noble, physically imposing, powerful and romantic characters that have come on screen recently. Chris Hemsworth brings all that into the character so he proves himself as a great actor. Brannagh handles the action scenes very well. A guy huge like a mountain fighting his enemies with a hammer sounds silly but it looks great on screen. Hell, it actually kicks ass. The action is exactly how I expect it from a comic book movie: it's cheesy, little bit over the top, fun and kick ass.Brannagh was chosen for this movie for another reason, he knows that in a summer movie the action can't be simply there just for the sake of having action scenes in a movie. You need emotions and he delivers that through almost Shakespearean family tragedy. Anthony Hopkins as Odin is amazing, when he shouts ""Silence"" nobody ,even in the cinema, says a word. Tom Hiddleston gives here an incredible performance as Thor's devious brother Loki, who is scheming against everyone, hidden under this facade of a meek. Natalie Portman as a beautiful young scientist hasn't got much to do in this movie just to be amazed by Thor and you can see that she really is. When he kisses her hand as a noble man you can see how she is falling for him in love. I love how the writers incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. into the story in such a casual way. Once again we get the marvelous Agent Coulson. His interactions with Thor are the funniest and also the most tense one. Idris Elba as Heimdall the guard is a perfect casting choice. He is calm, great in action scenes. He is just perfect. There is also Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga but unfortunately she doesn't get a lot of screen time.In the end this is exactly what you pay for and even more. Thor is one of the greatest comic book adaptations, it's funny, has great characters and actors,great score/soundtrack by Patrick Doyle, amazing visual effects, great action scenes. In my opinion it's a comic book movie the way they are supposed to be made.Watch out for a great Stan Lee's cameo and as usual with Marvel movies stay till the end of the credits for a genius post-credits scene.Thor will return in The Avengers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Grandiose action meets simplified theme,"Epic action, glorious 3D and Chris Helmsworth's rapturous good looks make for a gratifying but hardly epiphanic outing for the first God in a crowded superhero genre. Thor is a good action movie. The battles are grandiose and the pace and intensity of action never flags. Ashley Miller's screenplay is family friendly and the characters are as cookie- cutter as they come, with the possible exception of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The special effects are cool and the different planets sufficiently spectacular.That said, Thor's kaleidoscopic production values could have done better with a less monochromatic storyline, and more believable acting. Despite his highs and pitfalls, Thor's character remains too much of a knight in shining armor. Perhaps a little more fallibility could have made the character more endearing.In short, Thor is an entertaining action-packed spectacle, but disappointing if you expect anything more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More shallow than it should be,"The Gods are crazy. Norse Gods even more so. After long raging battles they rest in Asgard, keeping an eye on the worlds so that they might intervene when necessary. But not all is well, first there is the arrogant son of the King that lusts for power, second there is the constant threat of an ancient enemy.And so starts the story of Thor, a young brash member of a tight group of Gods that is about to meet its newest challenge. Playing partly in Asgard, partly on Earth this film hits solid gold when reviewed as a graphical feast - the depiction of Asgard is great and would make even the largest creatures feel humble and small. The effects all through the film are quite well too.But then there is the story. The fact that is biased around Thor is one thing (he is the title character after all) but insulting many of the other players by allowing them little to no screen time is unnecessary. Given the length of the film the makers obviously had no problem making a film longer than average, and an extra 15 to 30 minutes would have solved many of the thin backgrounds to the supporting crew quite decently. It's a shame really for now it's nothing more than popcorn amusement and eye candy.6 out of 10 bored Gods",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The action scenes were cool but nothing special,"I am not a comic book type of person so that is not what i will be talking about. What was good about this movie was everything that did not take place on earth. The battle scene excited me, got me interested. The visual effects that went into making Asgard look real were flawless. My problem with this movie is everything on Earth. Once Thor landed on earth it stopped being and epic tale of the god of thunder to a romantic comedy. On earth he falls in love and she changes his ways in two days. That does not sound like any good action movie. Next was the so called humor. All the jokes were Seth Rogen-esq. By that i mean they were normal statements said at inappropriate times. All the jokes were forced and unfunny. All the film makers accomplished while trying to make a movie that had a little bit of every genre in was show that one movie and be a bad action, romance, and comedy movie all in one",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A triumph of pure mediocrity,"I have to admit that it is a lot of fun to review bad movies that provide an easy opportunity to sparkle with witty humor, to give vent to your suppressed negative feelings, and to be sarcastic and full of biting irony.On a rare occasion, it is also quite nice to indulge myself with reviewing a good movie and with reflecting on the multiple thoughts that the movie provokes. It is fun to enjoy praising a visionary director, a talented actor, a moving soundtrack, or some exceptional special effects.There are movies, however, and ""Thor"" is among them, that are no fun to review, no fun at all. The problem with these movies is that they are average, solidly built popcorn flicks so perfectly mediocre, so utterly derivative, so shamelessly fake, so amazingly shallow, that watching them does not awake any strong emotions or feelings, and does not leave any particular memories or any aftertaste whatsoever.The story and the dialogs in Thor make the script of ""X-Men: First Class"" look like a Shakespearian play. I cannot help thinking that this is a case when too many cooks spoiled the broth. The story was re- written multiple times: first to lower the movie budget from $300 million to $150 million, then because the change of the director, then for some other obscure reasons.The directing was ""okay"", although it is hard for me to comprehend why Kenneth Branagh, mostly known for directing Shakespearian dramas, operas, and the other psychologically nuanced movies agreed to work on a film with such a primitive story. The only explanation that I was able to find was that ""Thor"" was among his favorite comic books. Who knew? Oh well, we all have our weird little secrets, I guessThe visual effects definitely suffered from reducing the projected movie budget in half. Sadly, they were quite unoriginal and not even particularly realistic. Sometimes ""Thor"" reminded me a slightly modernized version of these old Japanese ""Godzilla"" movies with the pitiful ""Destroyer"" somewhat clumsily playing the Godzilla part. While I did not expect the special effects to match those of ""Avatar"", or of ""The Lord of the Rings"", it was still disappointing to see such an underwhelming effort in a movie that by definition should have had great special effects as its main strength.Somewhat surprisingly, a previously little known Chris Hemsworth did not disappoint as the title movie character. While having not demonstrated any particularly strong acting abilities, he was still refreshingly genuine, enthusiastic, and energetic as Thor.The strongest performance in the movie, of course belongs to Tom Hiddleston, who was quite convincing as Thor's cunning brother Loki. Loki, by the way, was the only movie character that had a little depth in it, as a striking contrast to all the other characters that were so perfectly one-dimensional and so disgustingly primitive.The primitivism of the characters is the most likely explanation why such talented actors as Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgård were so awful in the movie – they just did not have anything substantial to impersonate. Even Sir Anthony Hopkins did not seem to be fully himself, brutally constrained by the outrageously simplistic script.Personally, I did not feel I gained anything by watching ""Thor"" – a triumph of pure mediocrity. However, if you are excited about ""The Avengers"" hitting theaters in May and are willing to spend some of your free time learning more about the characters involved, watching ""Thor"" might not be a bad idea for you.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Anything taking place outside of the earth is just absolutely boring to me, Star Wars included. Guardians of the Galaxy is one exception.So with this movie, all of that stuff bores me beyond belief. The earth scenes were funny and kinda cool. I like Chris Hemsworth but he's like a giant beast rather than a character you could identify with. Natalie Portman is annoying.

Don't expect an epic story and you'll have a great time,"Any viewer with more brain cells than feet will, after seeing the trailer (or reading the IMDb description), know pretty much everything there is to know about the storyline.

The director put a lot of attention into detail, and there is plenty of candy for the attentive viewer.

EPIC! Every bit as good as Iron Man,"Although an avid Marvel comics reader I never once read Thor comic book. I was hooked on X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Alpha Flight and others, but for some reason Thor never interested me much. So when this movie was announced I wasn't all too interested. The trailers weren't much help, though they perked my interest. A few good television spots and the final trailer convinced me to give it a try. So yesterday I took my 3 teenage kids to see it on opening night here in Oslo, Norway at (allegedly) the biggest screen in Europe.I was effing blown away! Maybe because I wasn't expecting much. Or maybe because it was a great film. I like to think it was great.Remove your biases and (even if you didn't like the trailers) if you loved the first Iron Man movie you will LOVE this!Personally, I didn't much like Iron Man 2, didn't like either of the Fantastic Four movies but loved Iron Man 1 and all the X-Men, Spider-Man and (Nolan) Batman movies. (Just for your comparison with taste.)Only word of caution/advice is to see it in 2D if possible. We watched it in 3D and though the 3D was pretty good (comparable with Green Hornet if you've seen that) it made several of the scenes blurry. Our projectionist said it was because the theater is so big and the screen is too far from the projector for this particular movie to work in 3D, but that others (Avatar, any animated movie, etc) work just fine in that theater. So either watch it in 2D or on a medium or small screen in 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Names like Branagh, Portman, Hopkins, Skarsgård, Russo are usually trademarks of sophistication and high quality, but their performance - at least to me - remained just above average, probably due to mediocre screenplay. All the main issues touched have been scrutinized in so many movies, that Thor became just another ""sparrow on the line""...Of course, as the budget was high, the donors and lenders seemed to want to act for certain: different races, genders and ages were carefully picked.

A Let Down of A Marvel Flick,"D+ I'm not much of a Thor fan to begin with, but I was not against the project and was rather intrigued by it. The casting choices seemed very spot on, myself being particularly excited by the presence of Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. Kudos to Idris Elba as well. However, the film opens with the annoying character played by Kat Dennings. Not only that but Portman's character was one I was completely unable to connect with. Then we go to Asgard and the visuals as expected are stunning. The lighting and wide range of colors was well done and all around beautiful. The mythology was very engaging and the choice of Tom Hiddleston as Loki was a damn good one. The elite ""Warriors Three"" look great from a distance but do little to nothing in the movie. There is not a single reason for me to go into them what so ever due to their lack of screen time and the fact that the majority of the time they were on screen the director treated them as over-redundant comic relief. The Ice Giants were very imposing and served well as antagonists. The battle with them was one of the film's few saving graces.Then Thor is banished to our realm, Earth, and so begins the painful midsection of the film. And this I mind you is the longest section of the movie. The dialogue is corny and the script struggles to find any bit of memorable dialogue and character development. For the longest time I forgot I was watching a superhero flick and instead a badly staged comedy/sitcom. The director refused to take the material seriously at all, even as far as having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents poke fun at the Asgardian warriors as they stroll down the street and then smother the window of a restaurant like lost dogs. And the vast majority of the humor wasn't funny sadly. This wasn't ""Iron Man"" with its smart and quippy dialogue, this was so cliché it hurt to watch. Denning's character comment s on how hot Thor is, a predictable and very corny romance starts that just grated on my nerves throughout. None of the protagonists seem to take their roles seriously, which would be okay if this were a straight comedy. The villains are menacing enough but don't get enough screen time. I know I keep comparing it to the Iron Man films, but the way the comedy and action are spliced together only shows how badly director Kenneth Branagh tried to make a sh*t-stained copy of those films. I found myself yawning more than anything.Destroyer was awesome in my opinion, making even further jokes out of the ""Warriors three"" without a fight at all. By the time Thor gets his hammer back I was beyond bored, and in usual Marvel fashion the writers try to throw a curve ball concerning the main villain and it's a decent one I'll admit but the end battle is too short to be breath-taking. In short there are a few colorful shots and nice monsters, but this is outweighed by corny dialogue, cheesy humor and story development that redefine boredom. I cannot recommend this my fellow fans.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The sons of Odin strike,"Thor is a fun, action packed ride, which guides you through this fabulous, Norse myth era of MARVEL comics, hosted by none other, then the one and only Kenneth Branagh. Although we can all agree, that he is a better actor than director, he did a very good job in bringing the script adapted from the comics to life. The best thing about this film is the score. Patrick Doyle is a great musician and he did a marvelous job in scoring Thor. The visuals are stunning, and the cinematography is good too. The actors did their job well, and I have to say, that Chris Hemsworth proved to be the best of the cast.Now that I listed all the good things, we shall move onto the bad ones: the story is simple and doesn't really hold together, it's like of a not-too-good video game. Frost giants battle the vikings of Asgard, and Odin's son, Thor is banished from the Kingdom, because he was disrespectful with his father (he called him an ""Old man and a fool!""). The Asgardians use this teleport-thing to transport Thor to the Earth where Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard and a second chick hit him with their truck, while admiring a weird storm (it came from the teleport-thing, actually). The second chick is annoying, Skarsgard's character doesn't really have a purpose in the film, he's just there all the time, and the three viking friends of Thor don't really serve a purpose either, they only fight a little. Although I have to admit, the relationship between Thor and Loki is very well written.I liked that Agent Coulson was in this movie too, and there was a surprising cameo in the film, which I won't ruin for you. All in all, Thor is worth checking out for MARVEL fans, and comic book lovers, because it's a pretty decent adaptation. Not as good as Iron Man though, but it beats the crap out of all the Spidey movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
""" In a land before the age of Man, there existed Asgard, the home of the Viking Gods ""","From the creative mind of Stan Lee who makes his usual Cameo appearance, there arises yet another of his comic book heroes, "" Thor "" the God of Thunder.

There he meets Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, who we last seen in 'Red October'), his wife and Jane Foster.

Like i've said before, the performances by the actors has been good with the exception of Natalie Portman. I wouldn't say that her performance in the movie is bad but it's just lukewarm.

A decent surprise,"Thor (or ""The Mighty Thor"" as some would call him) is admittedly and personally one of the most uninteresting characters in the MARVEL universe. Not only does he lack any good opposition in his villains but there's only so much a writer can do with an established Norse God turned comic book superhero. In the hands of the wrong team, a THOR movie adaptation could've been equally bad but thankfully this is averted in the case of 2011's THOR.The movie is pretty much straight to the point, serving as an introduction to the future Avenger and it does its job well. The film thankfully decides to avoid side stories that could've bogged down the story and concentrated on Thor's story alone, ranging from his family problems in his home Asgard and romance on Earth. A small problem with being straight forward is that the film was a bit predictable since it still followed a typical superhero plot (redemption, save the girl, etc.) but this does little to bog down the fact that the film is enjoyable.The characters are thankfully not as two dimensional as the trailer implied since they're a lot deeper than what one may expect, especially Loki. The whole cast did their part but it was Loki that really stood out for me. Loki could've been a boring one note villain but instead we get a conflicted god trying to prove himself worthy to everyone. Though everyone did play their roles well, not everyone got a balanced amount of screen time, which if done would've made them more engaging.The action, on the other hand, is kind of weak. Not to say it wasn't bad but it failed to maximize the 3D which, again like most other 3D film out right now, seemed unnecessary. It was rather interesting to see how a hammer would fare against a spear and the like and believable melee weapon choreography IS hard to accomplish so points to the film's team for making it as real as possible without compromising the fun out of it.Overall, THOR serves its purpose as an introduction to just who the mighty Avenger really is. If some other team made the film adaptation of the character, the end result could've been another DAREDEVIL; we may never know. But what's important is THOR lives up to the bar set by IRON MAN back in 2008; this looks like it's going to be a good decade for MARVEL studios and the rest of Stan Lee's creations.Again, wait for the credits to roll. There's a stinger there leading up to THE AVENGERS",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome movie!,"I saw this movie yesterday, cannot really add any more to the rest of the reviews below, apart from saying. Awesome film - 'nuf said true believer!Thor has set the pace and raised the bar to how superhero movies should be. Captain America and The Avengers have a lot to live up to now. Like the reviewer below has already said I was bit sceptical about Chris Hemsworth being cast against Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, need not have worried as held his own against the heavy weights!Kenneth Branagh's directing was a beauty to behold, you could tell he knew his subject, especially how he manage to depict the beautiful looking Asgard. Loved his interpretation of the rainbow bridge.Bring on The Avengers!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor he's a jolly good fellow.,"Thor (Chris Hemsworth), arrogant son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), is stripped of his powers and banished from Asgard for disobeying his father's orders (by fighting the frost giants of Jotunheim). Landing on Midgard (or Earth, as we call it), he meets a group of scientists, falls in love with Natalie Portman, learns some humility, and defends the human race against a deadly foe, before finally returning to Asgard to face off against his deceitful brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who has since laid claim to their father's throne.I'm finally getting around to watching the standalone superhero films that paved the way for The Avengers, and I've got to say that, so far, I have much preferred the characters in their individual movies than when working as a team; this one is no exception. Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, which originally concerned me since he hasn't really had much experience with big budget blockbusters, but I'm happy to say that Ken did a great job, handling the material intelligently, delivering a film that gets the balance just right between drama and spectacular action.Hemsworth—a relative unknown before being picked to play Thor—is excellent as the hammer swinging God of Thunder, a strapping fellow who not only looks the part, but who also gives a fine central performance. Hopkins is, unsurprisingly, great as Odin, Hiddleston is suitably loathsome as the boo-hiss villain, but Portman is required to do little other than look pretty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just as good second time round,"I enjoyed this when it came out and was interested to see if it stood the test of the me and I'm glad to say it did.
If anything I appreciated the humour more which brings a different side to the character of Thor which would lad have been pretty one dimensional otherwise. 
Very underrated Marvel movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A nice welcome pack to Marvel's cinematic universe,"A good movie that chronicles the story of Thor and how he became the king of Asgaard and earth's greatest defender. But even so, I expected an all out action flick, as the trailers seem to have us believe.To my astonishment, it had too much humour for my liking. Also, the storyline involving a god of importance like Thor is often very deep and intense. But director Kenneth Branagh made the movie simple and straightforward as if he'd just read Thor's book and decided to do a movie about it.Two scenes peaked my interest though, that is when Odin was in his Odin sleep and helped Thor regain his powers on earth, as well as the post-credit scene, when Nick Fury shows Dr Selvig a brief case with the tessaract.But despite my light remarks, I have given the movie at least 7/10 because the flaws I've highlighted are fare outweighed by the great things that occur in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Family Drama,"Thor was a unique film. Though people expected more action sequences, As for me I loved the chemistry between characters. It revolves around families and kingdoms. At least it stood way above Green Lantern. Thor is one of the most investing superhero films, where you are curious to find out more about these characters. The performances were great, All the actors were very good. It was kind of a Drama which was enjoyable. This is Kenneth Branagh's baby which wasn't disappointing or bad. Iron Man 3 on the other hand was a disaster, I'm not a fan but I was disappointed. Though It isn't action packed but Thor was entertaining, fun, watchable, popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of Marvel's best,"First off I was never aware Marvel had made a comic out of the Norse mythology, and after doing some research into the franchise I learned why. Suffice it to say ""The Mighty Thor"" is not one of their best characters.The film is about a race of aliens living on the planet Asgard, who have a history of war with the so called Ice Giants from a nearby planet. Odin, the king of the Asgard who defeated the Ice Giants is dying and his son Thor is set to replace him. However, as Thor is about to become king, a group of Ice Giants infiltrates Asgard in order to steal some weapon or other. Odin stops them, but Thor wants revenge and goes to the Ice Giant's home world to challenge them. The resulting confrontation almost unleashes another war between the planets, but Thor's father intervenes just in time. As punishment for almost starting a war Thor is banished to Earth, where he has to live among humans as a mortal.If you know a thing or two about Norse mythology you will of course recognize a lot of the themes in this film. King Odin, the Halls of Asgard and of course the thunder-god Thor with his hammer, which also has a prominent presence in the film. While this all sounds rather cheap, far fetched and ridiculous, the writing is surprisingly good. The dialogue is strong and the mix of humor and tension is executed nicely. Most of the characters are strong, albeit only the main ones. The side parts, such as Thor's team of warriors, would have more personality if they were replaced by cardboard cut-outs.The acting is also, frankly, quite superb. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of the arrogant warrior prince very convincingly, Natalie Portman is great as the love interest and Anthony Hopkins is as good as ever in his role as Odin. However Tom Hiddleston, who plays Thor's evil brother Loki, really steals the show in my opinion. He is given a well developed character to work with and he does it very well.I was surprised to hear that Kenneth Branagh was directing. Needless to say he did a good job. Being a super hero movie most of it is action, but there are enough quiet scenes to give us a rest from all the running around and screaming and these are also handled very well. The art direction is superb, there are glorious alien vista's and incredible special effects, even if everything is CGI.To me Thor was a surprising film. The first half hour or so, with all this stuff about Asgard and all the fancy visual effects and not much proper story I found myself thinking that I was watching a cheap, no brains, action movie with no real depth. Just as I started to think that the film seemed to spin 180 degrees and turn into what I now see as a surprisingly good feature. With an all star cast, stunning visuals and good story telling, Thor is definitely one of Marvel's best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's good, not great","95% unnecessary Dutch angles and 5% bleached Hemsworth eyebrows.I wish we got an entire film that takes place only in Asgard because of how much I love the Shakespearean direction Kenneth Branagh takes here.Hemsworth shines as Thor, perfectly capturing his early arrogance, lovable mortal idiot moments, and overall larger-than-life persona. Hiddleston also steals the show as Loki from his very first appearance and is the most interesting villain of any Phase 1 stand-alone film by far. The supporting cast is also really great, especially Anthony Hopkins as Odin.The visual design of Asgard is beautiful and ethereal, a perfect contrast to the dry desert of New Mexico. The plot is simple and straightforward and is able to adequately introduce a lot of lore and mythology organically to the story, without it feeling too forced.The cinematography is terrible, with almost every shot being a Dutch angle for absolutely no reason, and it takes you out of most scenes.Overall, it's a solid origin story that feels fresh after four MCU films that all deal with scientists and the military, (the weakest parts of this film are when it also deals with scientists and the military) and expands the universe by a lot, whilst also setting up The Avengers (2012).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor-oughly entertaining,"after weeks of seeing trailers for this on TV, I finally got to see this last night at my local cinema. I love superhero movies, and this movie didn't let me down at all. I was Thor-oughly entertained from start to finish. this was different to other movies in the genre, it had a bit of everything,sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, drama. The acting was great, Chis hemsworth as Thor was perfect. he has a certain prescence on screen and oozes charisma.looked the part too, beefing up well for the role.For an Australian, he really nailed the medieval English accent required. he definitely has a future in film, i can see him playing a jason bourne type character in the future. Other top actors in the film played their parts well too. most notable Anthony Hopkins as Thors father Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Thors brother Loki. Natalie Portman was fine as scientist love interest Jane Foster, but all she had to do really was say her lines and look good, which she did great. the 3d effects in this movie also added to the entertainment. I thaught the effects were as good as avatar in places. certainly better than any other 3d film other than avatar. didn't take away from the action at all like in films such as Clash of the Titans, where the effects became blurry at times. the scenes in thors home realm Asdgard were especially good in 3d. I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3d if you have a choice.To sum up, fantastic summer superhero blockbuster that doesn't fail to entertain, had the potential to be really bad but wasn't at all. has all the elements that make a great summer blockbuster, superhero movie, go see it !!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than I expected,"After watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" and reading negative reviews of this movies, I was dreading watching it. But I am pleased to say that it surpassed my expectations. When Thor is banished from his home world, he lands in New Mexico in the presence of three scientists. They aren't sure what to do with him and as they get to know him, they find that there is more to him than what meets the eye. Meanwhile back home, his father has fallen into a sort of coma and his brother is now the ruler. And not a very good one at that. Chris Hemsworth does a great job in the lead role as does Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Loki. The movie felt refreshing and although a bit cheesy, it was entertaining. Not as good as ""Iron Man"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", but not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor is Mighty,"Let me start off by thanking Marvel Studios, cast and crew. They made a wonderful adaptation of Thor. When I first read that they were making Thor, I never expected to see such an amazing comic based adaptation. The movie is mostly based in Asgard which they obviously worked very hard on the design and their hard work payed off. Thor might be bigger than most superhero movies.The movie is very funny, I loved the humor in it. It's not very much dramatic and doesn't include much action which to me wasn't a disappointment because the writer obviously wanted to introduce Thor to watchers. They portrayed the origin in a very good way and the movie started with in an excellent way. The acting was spectacular, Tom Hiddleston just wowed me throughout the movie, Idriss Elba was perfect as Heimdall and the rest of the cast was excellent. Wardrobe was amazing, they didn't change much and didn't ruin anything for comic book fans.I never expected to see such a movie that can actually take you to another ""realm"" and makes you believe its real. I suggest you see Thor, thank god Egypt had a early release date.Thor is truly Mighty",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,I have been into Marvel films much more then I have been in the past. I thought this was a very fun and well written film. The movie takes place with a man being outlawed to come to modern earth because he fell out with his family from a different time and universe. He is now on Earth and is extremely out of place and odd. His brother is trying to locate him but not with good intentions. He meets some good people along the way that he becomes fond of and so do they. I thought the cast of this film was great and so is the story overall. I would definitely recommend this film if you love the Marvel series.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My family loved it.,I didn't see it personally but my stepbrother and stepfather did and they invited me. Now I wish I would of went to see it. They had a lot of great things to say about it. And my stepfather said he would like to go back and see it again. And my stepfather doesn't like many movies of this generation. And my stepbrother is 12 and big into Marvel. From what I've heard I can't wait to buy on blue ray and watch it with my little stepbrother. I would recommend this to a family member or friend and I have not personally seen it yet myself. I will see if I can update this post when I have seen it. Being the God of thunder. The plot and story line sound pretty cool to me.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The decent origin story of the black sheep of the Avengers,"Thor is the oddball in the Pre-Avengers movies simply because it concerns a character that is quite literally out of this world. That would mean that the origin story of this superhero would require more time, a heavier budget, and more emphasis on making him likable. There was a tougher task at hand: mixing in all the fantasy elements with the literal-down-to-earth elements and giving it the proper balance.For this main reason, Thor becomes very unbalanced as a script and as an overall film. When a movie looks like sci-fi Lord of the Rings on some scenes, and thennormal for the others it can become quite jarring. And for the majority of the movie it took a while for Thor to find its footing. Luckily once we get to the third act the movie does indeed take off.We do not have the best script in the world telling the story of Thor, but bad scripts can almost always be saved by good acting. And with the help of Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman (Who had the worst lines of all), Anthony Hopkins, and our lead star Chris Hemsworth, Thor survives past the clichés, past the slow middle act, and survives the sometimes-crummy dialogue.The action also paces like the script, plenty at first, minimal in the middle act, and plenty in the final moments. Even though the direction was a bit muddy (Kenneth Branagh's random career still hasn't given him the ability to helm big budget projects) he still delivers when the emotion is ramped up (which happens more than you may assume in a comic book movie).Thor's saving grace was the final waning moments starting from when Thor really gets to shine right up until the end, which was actually devoid of your usual blockbuster clichés. By the time we get to the end we are treated with a nice final action sequence, a few surprises, the emergence of a now-notorious villain (Now complete with a massive online following), and a great ending that doesn't wrap the production nicely, but sets the tone for things to come.As an origin story, Thor could have been a lot worse, could have been better, but considering having to follow up to the likes of Iron Man---this movie does just fine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor - 5/10 Hollywood.  Still waiting to be impressed.,"As the first installment of the upcoming Avengers movie, Thor was said to be one of the first great hits of the summer. The trailer is edited with just the right amount of action, humor, and dramatic moments. I try to give Hollywood the benefit of the doubt when it comes to showing all the best parts in the trailer, but recently they have been letting me down. The 3D was incredible, even though it was post-converted, but it was easy enough due to the fact that all the shots of Asgard (Thor's home world) were CG, and fifty percent of the movie was that. Still, props to this one - it's one of the first live-action movies to *almost* pull off the 3D.But still, this movie lacked. There were three holes in it that, from an artist's point of view, cannot be overlooked. A relationship that motivates a character, that is his driving force, and creates the ending as a byproduct, needs to be developed. Not thrown together, not seen as ""He's Thor! And that's Natalie Portman, of course it would happen!"" Terrible excuse, Hollywood. A romance that permeates a story like that cannot be put on a back-burner. Secondly, in a movie that is supposed to be epic enough to draw the audience back for Captain America and all these other Avengers movies, well, rule number one; your biggest battle cannot be in the first fifteen minutes. And last of all, if you're going to make these basic formulaic mistakes in making a movie...at least have the heart to make your music halfway decent.I have been jumped all over by the people I work with at the theater for not liking this movie. Granted, these are the people that loved Green Hornet, but that is for another day. Still, they believe Thor to be an excellent movie (even watching it in 2D...they don't like 3D) to such an extent that I am seen as insane not to like this. Strange, I think I heard that after Green Hornet as well. The truth is, I view movies as an art form, not just entertainment. I have the respect for my fellow artists not to expect anything but the best of them. So far, Hollywood is proving me wrong.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining and fun,"I'm a bit of a sucker for super-hero movies, although I was unfamiliar with this particular character. Equally unfamiliar to me was the actor who plays this Norse god, 27 year old Australian Chris Kemsworth, and the one - British Tom Hiddleston - who portrays Thor's brother Loki. But I'm a fan of Anthony Hopkins, who here has fun as the top god Odin, and of Natalie Portman, who here is rather wasted after her terrific performance in ""Black Swan"". And then I was intrigued by the director: Kenneth Branagh who more usually directs works by Shakespeare (although let's not forget ""Frankenstein"").The result is entertaining and fun, although the visuals are often stronger than the plot or the dialogue. I saw it in 3D but the extra dimension did not add as much as one would hope. While other men lose their mojo, Thor mislays something called his Mjolnir (his mighty hammer) but, once it's back in his hand, the young cosmologist (Portman) is all over him (so why does he leave her behind?).Note: Like ""Ironman "" and Ironman 2"", if you sit to the end of the credits, you'll see a clip which is setting us up for another Marvel Comics movie ""The Avengers"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simplistic yet Thortful,"The closest I've ever got to Odin & Thor is through The Vikings; this was slightly different fare to that classic. I didn't expect much from this but got lots which surprised me – it's the usual Marvel superhero cgi cartoon movie, but taken at a cracking pace, shaved of gristle and utterly daft. Quite good in fact, although I was warned by a few friendly movie experts it was naff – however I always bear in mind none of those particular experts have ever seen or intend to see Citizen Kane.Hammer wielding impetuous youth Thor is thrown out of celestial Asgard by his all powerful father Odin, crashing to Earth, while his brother Loki machinates for overall control by apparently siding with the grunting red-eyed baddies from the Dark Side. Time is saved not only by accepting the universality of the English language but that standard plot devices involving falling in love, straightforward fight scenes, and metaphorical battles between Good and Evil are implicitly consented to as well. So many things are simply assumed that it gets a bit confused at times, and any characterisation is completely jettisoned as not worth the time – and in kids movies like this it isn't worth the time. The cartoonery is swift and relentless but atmospheric and not as senseless as other similar efforts, such as Man Of Steel for example. The contrast between the serious ethereal world and the flippant real world is cleverly handled, almost impressive and reminded me of The Fountain in its doom-laden commentary. Different story strands all come together satisfactorily, whilst Thor or is it Brad Pitt lopes about suitably heroically. A nice one excellent in its inconsequentiality and well worth watching – Gary Son Of Jan has so decreed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great film,This film does a good job starting up the Thor films. It's a good movie with a good story to back it. The screenplay feels a little slow at points though.

Definitely a film that should be watched by all superhero lovers.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor Fans Might Be Disappointed,"Long holiday here in the UK so I added Thor to the list of the films I watched at the movies with one more to come tonight. I grew up reading the adventures of Thor, and he is my favorite superhero God. I liked the choice of the main actor. The rest of the movie did not come across as powerful enough. It was very run off the mill story. I remember the comics had some very brilliant themes and plots. It seems that Hollywood is finally coming to terms with the fact that Effects are only limited by imagination. And imagination falls short in this movie. It was OK to watch. A nice popocorn movie so to speak.. The Batman series have done Batman justice but this does no justice to Thor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movies I've seen in a while.,"My friends and I follow a lot of movies, we look at what's coming out and we're open to pretty much seeing anything with a good rating and use IMDb daily to check ratings. I wanted to see this but i did not have high hopes for it. I thought it'd be good and had a good cast but I thought it would have really cool visuals and effects with an okay story that wasn't too true to the comic. I saw this yesterday and let me say it was amazing, the whole movie was put together very well and the story line left you interested and even emotional at times. I looked up the rating while i was waiting for it to start and after I left the theater I could not stop talking about how good it was and how impressed I was (as well as having to rate it at at least a 9/10 when I get home).

Light Fluffy Popcorn..mmmmm,"I saw this movie with a friend of mine. And I will admit the preview looked promising. The film was OK but I'm wondering if I'm just becoming more discerning or jilted in my older age (this film is certainly no 8 rating), granted I'm only 25. For the film tried to move way too fast since it is covering so much material in two hours. In that sense I felt like more could have been done on character development and background but due to the massive amount of material it decided to go the typical Hollywood comic book adaption route, lets cram it all in! That aside the story was fairly cohesive and there didn't seem to be any glaring gaps or horribly inexplicable scenes, some small things perhaps but nothing were I felt it was just an atrocity. The actors were all solid. Which was one of the things that drew me. All of them performed the roles well but once again the largest failing was the writing. Sadly I feel people who adapt these films by and large, although there are exceptions (iron man, x men, watchmen), are trying to appeal to a lowest common denominator. Which financially is sound but for people who like good movies it is a bit of a let down. I'm no comic geek but I know that most comic geeks have very mixed feelings on most of these films. They are happy they came to light and brought new fans but are also disappointed about the loss of nuance. Ultimately after all is said and done it was good light fun for an afternoon but I doubt I'll ever see it again. I'm more looking forward to Captain America, Avengers, and Green Hornet. Hopefully these will be less disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Entertainment,"This is a fun movie with a lot of nice humorous touches. It is as much fun as Iron Man with perhaps just a little more depth to the back story.OK the whole thing is a crock from a scientific or mythological point of view... but who cares? If you are the sort of person who complains because James Bond can't really have an invisible car then maybe you should get a life.If you want to spend a couple of hours being entertained by an action movie that is also complex enough to argue about in the bar later, then this absolutely hits the spot. Portman and Skarsgaard are almost only cameos and Hemsworth practically carries the film, but the cast all deliver well.This is entertainment that sits fairly and squarely in the 'let's pretend a little bit' camp and rewards the viewer with some good action scenes, a plot that has some substance, and a few good gags along the way. Go see it if you want a couple of hours fun. NickB",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it!,"Other than the Dark Knight best superhero movie to date. I don't know what else a COMIC book fan could want out of this film. I liked this take on Thor, one of my all time favorites.

Go see it and let's hope the rest of the super hero films coming out this year are just as great. CAPTAIN America!!!!!!!! can't wait!!!! Then the Avengers Next! Man I feel like a kid again. All these action comic films bring back the memories of reading comics and wishing there were good films to match. If anyone remembers the 70's attempts at these characters you know how great it is to finally have good versions of some of these HEROES! Keep it up.

A Truly Enjoyable Film On Every Level,"This spectacular film works on so many levels but in large part because of the great cast and the fact that the director took this subject matter seriously. Casting an unknown like Chris Hemsworth was perfect. Veterans like Anthony Hopkins really shine in their roles. What can you say about the stunningly beautiful Natalie Portman? She's just fabulous and is actually better here than in her Oscar winning role from Black Swan. It's written well and the special effects truly are Oscar worthy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don't be. Also, don't believe the naysayers at all. I'm betting they are ALL DC/Green Lantern fans afraid their film is going to get lost in this crowded summer. Thor being exceptional gives them pause and actually something to worry about.

Very close to an 8 rating; very well done,"The trailers for Thor underwhelmed me for the most part. It just looked like just another superhero movie made to make a quick million bucks. Besides that, I wasn't even very aware of Thor until I learned about him before this movie was released (I'm not a big comic reader at all). Still, I wanted to give the movie a chance and see what all the hype was about. What really got my attention was the very positive reaction from critics. With an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, the film was getting better reaction than I expected. Since I had work over the weekend, and opening day was pretty much my only chance of seeing a movie during that weekend, I decided to go see it on that day. Walking in I had high enthusiasm, and as it turned out I was very satisfied. Not only is the film very well done in execution, there is also a very deep story involving Thor's brother that really surprised me, which I don't want to give away. I also really liked the character Thor. The way Chris Hemsworth, and the writers especially, portray him fascinated me and got me involved in his arrogant personality, as well as his change of mind. The movie also has tremendous entertainment value. The action sequences are very well choreographed, supported by top-notch visual effects. Director Kenneth Branagh, who directed Shakespeare based films such as Henry V, shows his talents in a god-like setting as well as modern setting. Overall, the Branagh and company handled Thor very well, satisfying me and hopefully fans of the Thor comics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Roughly Good, But Has Many Flaws","I just watched 'Thor', to get ready for 'Thor: The Dark World'. I had heard many good things about it, so I decided to give it to shot at being good. I have to say, it very much surprised me...How was the acting?The acting in 'Thor' was good. By that I mean everyone portrayed their character and played their part above average. The best of the acting was Natalie Portman. She definitely did the best. She played Jane Foster and just killed it. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was a good choice. He portrayed Thor very well. Tom Hiddleston did just about as well as Natalie Portman playing the main antagonist: Loki. Anthony Hopkins did fine as Odin. There wasn't necessarily anything bad or good about his acting.How was the writing?It's hard to critique the screenplay for this type of film. I did like how the story went, though. It did have many predictable elements, but some things surprised me. This film did have a bit too many slow parts and the romance between Thor and Jane Fisher just decides to happen, but the things that bugged me the worst weren't those things. It was how there were many illogical, unrealistic, or unexplained things in this film. All of which took me right out of it. Also, the frost giants were way too easy to kill. Those things are twice the size of what the people of Asgard are, and are still killed with one small cut of a sword across their chest. It turns out, the writing was not very good.Did it have an interesting premise?I did like the premise and get the humor of what Thor is going through on Earth. Yes, the premise overall was interesting, despite my few flaws with it that I described in the writing section of the review.Was it entertaining or boring?Like I said earlier in my review, the film did have a few too many slow parts, making the film kind of boring. Although, the situations at hand during 'Thor' did bring some light into the shadows. The film was entertaining overall, but nothing special happens, and there are only about two scenes that I found exciting. Most of the film was enjoyable, but not entertaining as it should have been, in my opinion.What things in particular did I like (that I haven't already covered)?I really liked all of the beautiful scenery, CGI, and effects in 'Thor'. I also liked the direction the film went in story-wise. There were also some pretty entertaining action sequences, too.What things in particular did I dislike (that I haven't already covered)?I have already covered most of the things that I disliked about the film, but I have one more. I thought that some of the action sequences were not exciting, a very small number that even that entertaining. There was also one in particular of which I predicted almost everything that happened, and I really did not enjoy it.How was the film overall?Despite all of my many flaws with 'Thor', it was mostly entertaining, and had a couple of exiting parts. I say 'Thor' would be good if you don't watch it seriously. That means don't sit down and try to enjoy it. Watch it with a few friends. Text during it. Doing these things could make the film enjoyable. I would give 'Thor' a C- on the grading rating scale.Do I recommend this film?As I just explained, I only recommend this film if you didn't try to sit down and enjoy it. If you tried to do that, it wouldn't be very good. If you try to have some fun with it, and watch it with some friends, talk during it, or text during it, 'Thor' could be good.Will I buy this film?No, I will not buy this film. If I can't just sit down and watch this film seriously for it to be good, it's definitely not worthy of me buying it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Thor"" hits the nail on the head, if the nail were Jotuns and the hammer was Mjolnir","I came into the theater with more of a knowledge of Norse mythology than of Thor's Marvel lore, which gave me the pleasant surprise of recognizing some of the names from mythology. However, this also made me cock my head at some of the inconsistencies with legend- like how in mythology, Sif is Thor's wife and is noted for her golden flowing hair, but in ""Thor,"" she was a fiery brunette warrior woman who runs around with the Warriors Three, who I guess are a group of Asgardians from the comic who aren't gods but kinda run with them.Anyway, Norse knowledge aside, the casting, especially of all the Asgardians, was incredibly well done. Anthony Hopkins, known mostly for his role as Hannibal Lecter, plays a wise and diplomatic Odin, who casts his son Thor down from Asgard. My favorite actor from the film was Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who really embodied the role he was given.As far as the movie itself, I was always really excited about the scenes that took place in Asgard, but not so much so the ones on Earth. When Thor touches down, he spends a solid day and a half on Earth, and doesn't cause nearly as much chaos as I would have liked.I saw ""Thor"" in 3D, and the effects were great- Asgard was a fantastic golden wonderland, like one would expect it to be, and you could almost feel the chill of Jotunheim's icy wastes. And it wasn't gimmicky- the movie definitely could've stood on its own without the 3D. All in all, ""Thor"" was a great movie-going experience for Marvel geeks and even Norse geeks, too, if they can ignore some inconsistencies and remember that it's a comic book movie, not a mythology movie. This is definitely a film to see this summer. My only advice- girls, try and contain yourselves when Thor is on screen if you go with your boyfriend. It'll be difficult- trust me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Combination of Norse Mythology, CGI Effects and Dry Humor Makes for a Comic Book Epic Worth a Look","Among the Marvel Comics characters that have come to the silver screen, the biggest stretch to the imagination may be this elaborate 2011 fantasy adventure because the story is rooted in Norse mythology rather than technology and science fiction like ""Iron Man"" or ""Spider-man"". That's probably why producer Kevin Feige chose actor Kenneth Branagh to direct since his erudite touch, showcased in his numerous Shakespearean adaptations, is what the epic film needs to ground the more human elements into something more relatable to the audience. That's no small feat considering the amount of exposition needed at the beginning to give a brief history of Asgard where its king Odin has been waging war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim led by their malevolent king Laufey. Odin has raised two sons, Thor and Loki, opposites in disposition as the arrogant Thor prepares to ascend the throne while Loki seethes in jealousy. Thor's fate is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to seize the Casket of Ancient Winters.Seeking revenge, Thor recruits his band of warriors to enter battle in Jotunheim, an act of defiance which causes Odin to banish Thor to Earth where he becomes mortal without his all-powerful hammer Mjolnir, which is stuck in a rock in the middle of the New Mexican desert. There he meets scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and their assistant Darcy, where the movie diverges into a fish-out-of-water tale, while back in Asgard, Loki learns of his true identity as the son of Laufey and consequently attempts to take over the throne as Odin lies in a deep sleep. There are plenty of battle sequences to tie the story together and keep the momentum going, including an impressive, darkly lit fight with the Frost Giants and a classic ""High Noon""-style confrontation with a nearly indestructible automaton. However, in the screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, what really makes the movie great fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.Ideally fitting the imposing physical dimensions of the title role, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth plays the stalwart, uncomplicated hero with aplomb. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston brings out the villain's veiled smarminess with ease. In danger of overexposure by now (this is the fourth movie of hers I've seen in four months), Natalie Portman manages to make the most of a wafer-thin role as the plucky Jane as we are meant to believe she is a master astrophysicist. Her comic interplay with Kat Demmings, amusingly acidic as ever as Darcy, provides nice relief from the action. Anthony Hopkins isn't really challenged much by the role of Odin, but he brings his trademark authority nonetheless. Idris Elba is hardly recognizable as a stoic sentry, while Rene Russo is given little to do as Odin's wife Frigga. As Selvig, Stellan Skarsgård gets to play the unadventurous voice of reason on Earth, although he has an intriguing encounter with Samuel L. Jackson after the credits. All the production values and CGI effects are what you would expect from a $150 million film, and surprisingly, Branagh manages to tell the story in less time than ""Bridesmaids"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The God of Thunder,"The movie is entertaining from the beginning to the very end of it, filled with great acting from every actor on camera, to great dialogs. I even very much enjoyed Stellans performance. He truly did a great job and I can't wait to see more of him. Could also easily see Peter Stormare taking his role, both great actors.This movie surprised me. Didn't think it was gonna be this good when I went to see it, but every detail amused me and my family very much. Only downside is that they apparently speak English in Asgard. Wished they had done something like they did in Avatar and Lord of the Rings, inventing their own language. Otherwise Thor is everything you need for a good movie, anytime.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Journey into Mystery, well maybe","As with most comicbook adaptations, this is a mixture of the stunning and banal. The vivid depiction of Asgard, influenced by Jack Kirby's visionary 1960s art, is hugely impressive. The story is a mingling of various classic tropes from the comic: the humbling of Thor, the destroyer, the Odin-sleep. Even elements prominent in the comic, IE Thor's alter-ego Donald Blake, is slyly referenced. There's always a problem, not avoided here, with introducing so much comicbook mythology so quickly, that the ideas can tumble over each other, whereas in the comic the developed over months over even years.But the main problem does not derive from the comic but in the new material. The humdrum romance between Thor and Jane Foster, who is supposedly a physicist but talks in this generic teen-speak way, and the utter trivia of the loss of her stuff in this context. The appearance of the ""men in black"", already a tired cliché but out of place here, made my heart sink. Haven't we seen these characters too many times before? But all was not lost, and the film does manage to do a few surprising things and I guessing that the writers' hands were tied to a certain degree by having to bring everything together for the Avengers film (Hawkeye puts in a brief and pointless appearance too).The cast is ideal. Chris Hemsworth (despite a strange accent) could hardly be bettered in his role of Thor, and is given admirable support from the rest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A baroque but dumb entry in swords and sorcery,"Thor rumbles violently enough to shake the theatre, and if that's all you want than that's all you'll get. It's a film that looks spectacular but sounds lame. Such a baroque project doesn't deserve such a bad screenplay which is comprised of stilted dialogue and bad plotting.Swords and Sorcery is tricky, not many films get it right, and Thor is an example of why. There are too few surprises. It's not all that hard to figure out where the movie is going, and although it effectively gets a few laughs in, Thor feels rather humourless and doesn't have much of a soul. There isn't much of a character to the protagonist, and subsequently not much for actor Chris Hemsworth to work with. In fact, I strongly felt he got upstaged by his co-star/love interest. Natalie Portman is quite delightful, and far more frisky than I'm used to seeing in her, the movie becomes equally brisky when she's on screen.For a film as Theatrical in appearance as Thor, it comes across as slightly disappointing that it fails to raise a pulse or generate excitement. The only time it comes close is in one scene where Thor, on Earth, must break into a Quarentine to retrieve his hammer. which is wedged in stone and nobody can pull it out. The only thing more discouraging than that is the fact that nobody has considered the option of breaking the stone.If you plan to go see Thor, my advice is this. don't see it in 3-D, because there are parts where it's too dark to see anything, and don't even bother to make connections between this movie and Viking mythology. Thor will satisfy some, but I wasn't too impressed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just an ordinary spectacle,"The biggest problem about comic book adaptations is that sometimes movies are too short for them. That's the problem about Thor. I'm not familiar to the comic book, but it's clear that the story has much more than what 2 hours can offer and it's impossible to digest all at once no matter how long the movie could be. Kenneth Branagh's efforts to transform it into a Shakespearean thing is just an attempt to give to a comic book adaptation a different approach intensifying some mythological beauties and artistic layout within traditional direction techniques so Thor wouldn't be called just another regular action movie full of special effects. But in fact that's what the movie is, an ordinary action movie full of ambition as well as its main character. The movie fails to specify the audience it wants to achieve shooting everywhere and everyone as possible, giving the feeling that sometimes you are watching Henry V with lame dialogs played at a Comic Con event by amateur young actors.The movie is more beautiful than interesting: the special effects are better than the dialogs and the visuals are better than the plot. Chris Hemsworth did what he was supposed to and Natalie Portman is beautiful and responsible to give the charisma that the movie lacks. Kenneth took a comic book character serious enough giving a huge blockbuster spectacle and limiting the layers he wanted to give instead of just defining it. Thor isn't what it seems to be and that makes it a little frustrating. Kenneth Branagh was responsible for the longest Hamlet adaptation, so of course you can expect hours of useless progress and a movie full of things that regular action movies shouldn't care.Anyway, the movie isn't bad, but isn't better than other comic book adaptations, but at the same time you can't ignore the fact that it's entertaining most of all because gives one of the best visual effects sequences so far in 2011, the acting is fair and also is Mr. Branagh's first step into action movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than I was expecting,"I will start by saying I was never a big fan of Thor in the Marvel universe. There was just something about the character that annoyed me.I wasn't expecting much from the film as I have never been sold on Kenneth Branagh as a director or in fact as an actor (way to lovey dovey for my taste). However I went to see it as I am really looking forward to The Avengers movie and wanted to go in after seeing the films leading up to it.I am glad to say not only did I enjoy Thor, I enjoyed it a lot. The film is great. It is well acted, well directed and goes along at a brisk pace. The first part of the film filling in the back story was done with a lot of pace but didn't feel rushed. The action was superb and I now have a growing respect for Kenneth Branagh.It is not perfect but it is purely enjoyable. In fact I would say it is to date the best of the films leading to The Avengers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
good effort...!!!,"Undoubtedly ""Thor"" is a good movie and maybe one of the best movies about comic heroes. I must admit that the beginning of the film was really amazing and some scenes remind me the lord of the rings (my favorite movie ever).However from the middle of the movie and until the end, unfortunately, the rhythm was calmed down and the movie lost the interest which had engender from the beginning. Anyway, the choice of Anthony Hopkins as a king was utterly successful and the same I can say for the actor who play the ""THOR"". In general terms I enjoyed the film and I anticipate to see the sequel with quite more action,and this time at vikings time....!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Nice effects and cinematography, cheesy and predictable script/plot","The only reason why I've not given this a 4 out of 10 is because the computer graphics of Asgard really impressed me, the camera angles and screen play was also very tight, and the music/ sound effects aren't bad either, so from an aesthetical perspective this is a good movie. However, some of the lines in this film are simply cringeworthy. The romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character simply didn't work for me, it was too cheesy even for a low budget Disney children's cartoon. I think they tried to make the film too ""epic"", like a wannabee lord of the rings, but it doesn't work. And while I don't think that the film pretends to be a serious gritty thriller, it lacks the substance to be anything else other than a poorly scripted action movie. The concept is good, and it's a shame more time and effort wasn't put into writing a better script. If they removed the romance factor this wouldn't be an alright movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining Fantasy That Rarely Slows Down,"When I first started seeing trailers for Thor, I was fairly unimpressed. I worried that the fantasy elements would be treated poorly and that this was really just a cash in to set things up for The Avengers. However, good buzz about the film prompted me to see it, and sure enough, the buzz is right. This is an entertaining summer blockbuster that continues the trend of early summer films from Fast Five.A bit different from the other Marvel films, this one concerns a different take on the Norse myth where Thor is the brash, blood lusting, and proud son of Odin. He is soon sent to Earth and relinquished of his godly powers in order to be taught a lesson. However, forces conspire against him and his home, Asgard. Certainly, there is heavy tie in here with the rest of the Marvel universe of films, but the film establishes itself as something different. Where as most other Marvel films have been grounded in reality with all the flashiness and powers mixing with everyday life, Thor generally keeps the film's fantasy and reality separate. In fact, for once in a Marvel movie, people question how these things are happening. It is in this fantasy element that Thor separates itself. It's story is heavily invested in it's mythology, and that is a welcome change of pace. This is, for the most part, a fantasy film, with magic and powers and even the silly costumes.The film is led by some strong performances, most notably in the three main actors of Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and veteran thespian Hopkins. Each delivers strong, with Hemsworth and Hiddleston stealing the show and providing some very good drama and character growth. Natalie Portman and the rest of the supporting cast to a great job as well, with Portman acting her usual adorable self while appearing to have a lot of fun in the role, which helps make her performance that much more enjoyable. Branagh does an admirable job as a director here, showing a flair for the dramatic and making good use of the source material in it's scale and scope.There is surprisingly not as much action as I expected, but there is also a lot more humor than I anticipated, especially when Thor first comes to earth. My only major complaints against the film are it's seeming lack of focus and the romance angle. There doesn't seem to really be a straight focus here as the film shifts between several different groups doing things all at once. There is an overall quest of Thor to learn from his predicament, however, it really lacks a lead up to a climax. Even when Thor does head into the finale, it's underwhelming and it sort of just happens. The human drama and characterizations make up for some of this, but, none the less, it comes off as a bit of just passing through the motions. The second is the supposed romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character. It's simply not believable that Thor would just fall for the first beautiful woman he see when he gets to Earth. Her attraction to him is more understandable, but any actual love is hardly believable.These two things, however, as minor in the face of the grand spectacle. With great fx, great performances from the cast, and a snappy pace, this is a great way to start the summer blockbuster season and brings hope that rest of the Marvel films coming will follow suit and be just as good. Here's looking at you First Class and Cap. Am.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Are you kidding?,"I could only stand about 3 minutes of this ****. Maybe if your life is comic books and not Norse mythology you could stomach this cheap rip off, but realize you're being ripped off.

This is an hour or so you could be doing something else, anything else: go ride your bike, walk in the park, have a coffee, talk to somebody...anything but waste your time with this ****.

"THOR, THE MIGHT AVENGER!","Thor I would say is not my personal go-to superhero. I knew of him. I'd seen the character in different forms of media and comic books, but he was never the standout for me. I was young when this film was upon release and I was very little aware of the film's existence or it's placement in the MCU. The moment I found out about the connection was in the Iron Man 2 post-credits scene. If you read my review for that, you'll see that I didn't exactly watch the film until it's home release. I wasn't aware that the post-credits were a trend at the time. After watching the first Thor trailer and then researching it, I came across the scene. Now again I didn't watch this film in cinemas. I watched it with a close friend, and we were both mildly impressed. And over the years I have seen and read many mixed reviews, but I still maintain that this is one of the better produced and made films in the MCU!
POSITIVES!
Now I understand the audience reactions that come from this film. Ones that think because the character isn't kicking ass throughout the film that it's boring. I don't think that at all. There is action. Not an insane amount, but enough to show you what the character can do. But this is a great character arc. One, I thought, so great that it made Thor my favourite Avenger for a time. This is something I love about the plot and writing. This is a character driven story with a character that rises above selfishness and arrogance. The writing overall has a very Shakespeare charm about it. A story about family, and, brotherhood. Tom Hiddleston portrays the antagonist in this film, and he is brilliant. You instantly understand his motive and the actor's approach to a ""villain"" and so well deserving of the praise the character and actor has received throughout the MCU. But this film is packed full of amazing talent. Whether they a good or not, the actors that are involved are all talented in their acting background. I must praise rich and unblemished cinematography. This is a beautiful film to look at. The visual effects are stunning as well as is the artwork behind them. It is a great blend of having these God-like characters in this comic book world. The costume and makeup departments have very immaculate work. Brilliant sound design, particularly with Thor's Might Hammer, Mjolnir. A pungent score, that I think is improved on, but it works for this film.
MIXED!
Chris Hemsworth stars in the title role. An actor that had only gotten a starring role on soap-operas in Australia. This was the big break for the actor, and he is okay. Obviously over the course of his own and The Avengers' franchises he has really delivered an entertaining character. But in this film, he is adequate. Now the director of this film Kenneth Branagh does a fine job. Some of his camerawork was a bit off, especially with the dutch-angles. But I feel as if his main intention in this film was to deliver a grand scale epic drama rather than a comic book film.NEGATIVES!
Natalie Portman is a fine actress. There is no doubting that. But the chemistry she has with Hemsworth feels very much like acting than natural. Portman feels miscast. Like I said before there is a lot of talent in this film, but some of that talent feels wasted. Particularly with Idris Elba. I keep forgetting that the actor is in the MCU. And the actor never really shows off his incredible range in any of the films he is showcased in. Now my biggest complaint would be, despite the filmmaking in this project, the film isn't as enjoyable as other entries in the superhero genre. The urge to rewatch this film isn't very potent. It is a great character arc and the audiences that criticize the film for not having as many action sequences do have just opinions.
CONCLUSION!
So, Thor I enjoy for its filmmaking troupes. I enjoy the character more than the performance. The antagonist, for sure, outshines the protagonist. It is a great expansion and departure for comic book films and the MCU. Delivers a brand-new character and one of the most powerful Avengers. It is a bit hit or miss for audiences and I understand that. But there is more to enjoy than dislike for me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Review - Thor,"Thor is one of the ""prequels"" to The Avengers - the ""prequels"" are Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk. I still have yet to see The Incredible Hulk, but I have seen the other four films. I personally think that Thor is the worst of them. However, despite it's ultimate shortcomings, it does have its positive aspects.The story is about Thor of Asgard. This arrogant Thor recklessly travels to another world called Jotunheim with Loki and some other Asgardian warriors and attacks the Frost Giants there, stirring up tension and possible war between Jotunheim and Asgard. As a result, Odin, Thor's father, strips Thor of his powers, and his mighty hammer, and banishes him to Earth.On earth, in New Mexico, astrophysicist Jane Foster is researching a phenomenon in the desert (which turns out to be associated with Asgard-related activity, in this case Thor's banishment). Thor arrives and is discovered by Jane and her partners, and pretty soon he begins to learn the error of his arrogant ways, and he even falls in love with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki has taken over the Throne of Asgard, and he plans to send the Destroyer to earth to kill Thor, and Thor must retrieve his hammer and his powers to save both earth and Asgard.The film has both its ups and downs. I'll start out by talking about the effects. The visual effects are pretty good. The mythical words are pretty well designed, and the actions scenes are good. As for the script, it does have its flaws, but it's an acceptable script. The story isn't the best, and it's a bit bland and formulaic, but again, it's acceptable. It even has some creativity in it. Unfortunately, however, despite its creativity, it's a bit bland and formulaic. The first act of the film (the first half hour) is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the film, and it felt to me that the movie was relying a bit too much on effects, but it does establish the characters and basis necessary for the story. It's also where most of the film's creativity is.Weak as the first act is, I did find some things a bit interesting, and some things were introduced that had a lot of potential to get even better and more interesting and creative. But unfortunately, at the end of the first act, right after Thor arrives on earth, the movie abandons a lot of its creativity and resorts to a formula. Some of the things in the first act (which had a lot of creative and interesting potential) are even abandoned and not brought up again in the film. This, and the film's bland-ness, and a few other flaws, are the main reason why I only gave this film two and a half stars instead of three or higher (it almost got three, but it just missed it). Also, I felt that the Thor/Jane romance was a bit rushed.However, despite this, the film does get going a little bit more after Thor's banishment. This is where the heart and characters begin to shine. That brings up what I liked most about the film: the characters. I found them somewhat likable and interesting. The film even has a surprisingly good sense of humor; there are a lot of good comedy moments. These things are not strong enough to bring the film up to a higher rating, but they are still somewhat enjoyable. I especially liked Loki, even though he's the villain, and I was glad to see him and Thor return for The Avengers.So, overall, I think Thor is a so-so movie. It is a bit bland and formulaic, and could have used a better story, but it has enjoyable characters, humor, and action, and is not bad overall. It's a bit meh, but it's a bit entertaining, although it's not something I'd want to watch more than once.My Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I didn't think he could do it but Chris Hemsworth nailed the role!!,"Although having originally balked at director Kenneth Branagh for casting Chris Hemsworth in the lead of this film, i have to say i was presently pleased with the job he did in this. Now as you will see in this version Chris Hemsworth is ribbed and cut however I was hoping he would've used a wrestler such as the likes of Paul (Triple H) Levesque he's way more massive in the body building sense then Hemsworth is. Im sure however that Hemsworth is a better actor. Needless to say the film rocked and turned out to be one of the better comic book adaptations i have seen to date. Branagh carefully handpicked his cast in this with the end product proving this immensely. After being cast out of his mystical city of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor is sent to earth with his famed hammer. He is befriended by scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and with her team they follow Thor as he treks to find his hammer. Upon finding the mystical and powerful weapon he cannot seem to pull it from its place embedded in earth. This leads him and his friendly band of scientists to find out as to why he has come to earth and deemed powerless. It takes a powerful Asgardian foe that comes down to earth to destroy Thor and with malicious intent to do more harm then good to earth's mortal citizens, to give Thor what he needs to conquer and rejoin his father as a King in Asgard! Kenneth Branagh in his first comic book super hero genre type film did a superb job in retelling what is one of my favourite heroes that the great Stan Lee crafted in his comic book series. Seeing Thor only left me craving to see 2012's The Avengers that will be directed by Joss Whedon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best movie ever!,"Thor, a movie about a superhero who faces many of the challenges of Earth, is the best movie ever, in my opinion. Thor has all of the great elements of a superhero movie: evil villains, betrayal, romance, and the occasional splash of comedy, making it definitely the best movie that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.This movie's special effects were absolutely outstanding. The quality of the picture, as well, was certainly outstanding. The portrayals of the characters were all spot-on. Hemsworth's Thor, Portman's Jane and Hiddleston's Loki were all amazing portrayals, and I felt as if I could really connect to all of the characters on screen.I have now seen this movie four times, and every time I manage to find something different; a different shot of a character, a different joke that I didn't hear, a different look that one character gives another. I believe that every time that I see this movie, it gets better and better.Thor, by far, soared above my expectations. I was expecting a good movie, but not one this great. I can easily say that Thor is my favorite movie of all time, and I am so glad that this movie was so well-made, and so inspiring and fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Mindless, Family-Friendly Action Picture","When I was a child in the 70's, I was a real comic book nut. If this movie had been put on the big screen in 1976, I would have been beside myself with joy. For my middle-aged self today, however, I must say that Thor left me feeling somewhat indifferent.I liked the fact that Thor is an old-fashioned family film. There's a lot of violence but it's cartoon violence, not realistic, so it doesn't nauseate you like most action movies do today. Thor is also not salacious, which is refreshing; there is only one kiss and no lovemaking. The only person who shows any skin at all is Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and if I had worked as hard as he has to develop his musculature I would demand to show it off, too!The film is lavishly produced. The costumes were fitted beautifully and the armor and capes were blocked as perfectly as a Philip Treacy hat... and were equally as outlandish! The sets, lighting, effects... all beautiful, even surreal. When I'm relaxing with a flagon of mead, staring into the gigantic firepit in my cathedral-like living room, there's nothing I like better than to wear full dress armor and a cape! And the Asgard skyline with the inexplicably floating geometric buildings made a fitting homage to classic Thor artist Jack Kirby. I did feel a little sorry for poor Natalie Portman as Jane Foster; the nicest outfit she got to wear was t-shirt and jeans! But everything was lovely to look at... if somewhat lacking in inspired artistry.The main problem with this movie is the character story, which is weak. How and why do Thor and Jane Foster fall for one another? God only knows! Jane must only be thinking with her crotch because Thor is stunning; nothing else seems to happen between the two of them. I mean, this picture makes Legally Blonde seem deep. And Loki as the quasi-villain... I won't spoil the ending by going into his motivations but the writing and Tom Hiddleston's performance are not very convincing.Nor does the plot make very much sense. I mean, everything mostly works but the story seems very formulaic... such and such happens on page 27, the climax on page 82, etc. Does the climax of the picture really make any sense? So much that happens in Thor seems pointless and anti-climactic, however grippingly it is presented... the script feels less than heartfelt.Kenneth Branagh's direction and Paul Rubell's editing make this picture flow along with great pacing, and are really a triumph of movie magic over substance. Patrick Doyle's score is gripping and effective without leaving one with any memorable themes. Anthony Hopkins as Odin really submerges himself in the character to great effect, and Chris Hemsworth is a terrific Thor, full of bravado and bonhomie and hail-fellow-and-well-met swashbuckle-yness. Natalie Portman does a great job with a largely thankless role as the love interest. And the rainbow coalition of racially integrated actors forming the supporting Nordic gods do a fine job... although what they're doing in this Scandinavian realm is beyond me. The special effects are great, beautifully done. It's a very nicely made film and a fun ride, if a little boring in places and lacking in inspiration overall... but check your brain at the door, because there is nothing under the hood. And watch for Chris Hemsworth's beautiful upper body exposed about halfway through, because that's all the skin you're going to see in the entire picture!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

So far, Thor, is a blast.An arrogant warrior is banished from his homeland after disobeying his father's order's.

It's more of a father and son relationship.There's nothing else I can say about, Thor. It's an awesome comic-book film that is definitely worth watching and one of 2011's best movie's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not Quite What I THORt,"'Thor' makes an excellent start as pseudo-historical action adventure, but its misguided focus on redundant elements within the script mean that the film falls short of the promise it makes early on. We begin at Asgard: it is portrayed artistically, magically, and convincingly - a golden, sacred, Romanesque kingdom ruled by the father-figure of the film: Odin.Sir A. Hopkins plays this character spot-on; he expresses wrath, pathos and vulnerability interchangeably. Under-used throughout the script, he is given only a moderate chance to flex his divine will and power, and he is put away fairly annoyingly to make way for the less convincing and single-sided character of Loki (portrayed unevenly by T. Hiddleston).Like all modern comic-to-film adventures, the fish-out-of-water mechanism is employed in what seems to be an ever shortening delay from the film's outset. Read: Thor is banished to Earth. Here he we see a cast of supporting players (N. Portman et al) who give Thor the vast majority of his admittedly explanatory dialog. There are a few tries at comic relief here (just how *would* a man-god react to a modern hospital, restaurant and so on...?), but they are fleeting.Action sequences are just as sparse, and even more baffling is that they are really rather small-scale. Lack of scope is what the film suffers from - and what seemed like the beginning of the end sequence was revealed to be *the* end sequence. Choreography is mixed too; there are some satisfying big hits, but they have to make their way through scrambling, scuffling brawls. Thor's most interesting enemy is dispatched late in the film, but this sequence seems to have arrived too late to have any sway on the plot for this viewer.3D effects are well executed, and the typical cheap shots of pointy things for the sake of pointy things is tastefully avoided. When it *does* happen, it is with purpose and sound timing. Visuals are smartly married to excellent sound design, the technical aspects are what carry this film through its slumbering second-reel.Cinematography is victim to repeated tilting of the frame. There is hardly a square shot in the film, and all mid-to-close shots are tilted up to 45-degrees or less. Even establishing shots are annoyingly angled, disfiguring the space of the sets and disorientating the viewer from the physicality of the character movements and local spaces of scenes.Performances are apt all round - it is a testament to the performers to see them break through some of the stilted characterizations. Thor himself is well played, though most of the performance is carried by physical presence, not emotive expression or dialog. His goofy costume is accurate but plasticy, his comrades literally look like sci-fi convention-goers. I exaggerate not.The film is worthwhile overall, but suffers from a small-minded script. At least Odin, blessed with divine knowledge, managed to take a nap through the dullest areas of the film. For this, I envied the Gods.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beyond belief,"To paraphrase wisdom from Talmud: 'Without the ability to forget, man would live in a permanent, paralyzing fear of death.'I am grateful human being can forget. If not, I would have paralyzing fear of watching another movie, ever again, scared that it might be as bad as this one. Which is probably impossible, but anyway...I am an optimist here...or pessimist, not sure...If I wasn't clear enough: the movie is bad. If you want to watch super hero movie with (as Thor now has) 7.3 stars, go watch Bolt. Bolt will make you smile, at least.IMDb wants the reviews to be 10 lines at least, so I must write some more. Here it comes:Actors: 1) Thor guy was actually pretty good. I was surprised to see him decently convincing in different moods, but the script didn't give him a chance. 2) Natalie Portman - I mean, I love her, really I do, but this was ridiculous. 3) Stellan Skarsgård – I liked him. Not sure anymore. 4) Sir Anthony – he is a great guy, really. In this movie? WellTo be fair to the actors, screenplay was catastrophic. I guess no one could survive this one.Kenneth Branagh was the director. I stopped liking that guy after he broke up with Emma Thompson. This movie was just a confirmation that I wasn't wrong.Good luck and don't watch this. Go ride a bicycle. Or rent some good movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I'm now even more excited for Captain America and The Avengers!,"Thor is a bit of a harder sell as far as comic book characters go. I mean, how do you transform an ancient Norse god and 60's comic book character into something a modern movie going audience is going to like? Start with great casting (Chris Hemsworth is a dead ringer for Thor), add a brilliant screenplay by J. Michael Strazynski, and mix it with top notch special effects and you end up with a movie that is halfway believable (in a comic book way) and very entertaining.Thor is an arrogant, perhaps spoiled, young warrior that seeks glory for himself and Asgard but nearly reignites an ancient war with the Frost Giants in the process. For his arrogance and poor judgement, Thor is stripped of his power and banished to Earth by Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and his hammer lands in New Mexico and becomes something akin to the sword in the stone of Arthurian legend, ""Whoever holds this hammer, should they be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"". All of this is a result of the subtle manipulations of Thor's evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who seeks power only for himself. Throughout most of the film Loki works from the shadows to manipulate people and events towards an end of his design, as only the trickster god can do. Thor must then work to reclaim his power and stop his brother's machinations, gaining some wisdom and humility along the way.There is really very little to dislike about the film, other than a couple of minor casting decisions, Hogun, one of the famed warriors three, is apparently Asian for some reason, and Heimdall is black. Both choices seem odd for Norse gods but it doesn't really harm the movie, they just seem out of place. I would have liked to see Thor get beat up a bit more in the final two fight scenes with The Destroyer and Loki as both were relatively short and could have benefited from a couple of extra minutes. Overall Thor is a very fun, very entertaining comic book movie that only heightens my anticipation for the upcoming Captain America and Avengers movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Half great - half not so great,"Well this evening my friend's wanted to go out to the cinema, one of which being a huge Marvel fan. I saw the trailer for Thor and thought it looked alright but I didn't have high hopes for it.I really was blown away in the opening 30 minutes of the movie. The effects were great and the movie seemed to have a decent story going for it. The camera angles were great, not all shaky and zoomed like most action movies seem to like to do nowadays.Unfortunately as the movie progressed I feel it got a little weak. As soon as we are brought to earth the movie decides to make clumsy jokes and lightens the mood by repeating the same joke about 4 times within 10 minutes. I found it strange that the mood had changed so quickly.And before I continue I have to say, Kat Denning's character 'Darcy Lewis' made the most annoying and out of place jokes I have heard in some time in a movie.However the thing I found with the movie is that all of a sudden it becomes great again, then drops a bit, etc etc. In places I felt that they couldn't quite make up which audience they were aiming for.Now - the acting.I thought that the acting was brilliant in this movie. Chris Hemsworth was perfect for Thor, Natalie Portman was *as always* great, however I think that Tom Hiddleston who played ""Loki"" stole the show. He was fantastic.Why haven't I mentioned Anthony Hopkins yet? Because, to be honest, anyone could have played his character. He had no scenes that actually required much acting skill and I just think that he was just there for people to go ""Hey, it's Anthony Hopkins!"".So yeah, I liked about half of the movie, and didn't like the other half. One half felt epic and brilliant, the other very clumsy and out of place.However the reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the acting was so good I put it up to a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I was completely sucked into the story, to the point I wanted more when it finished....My 12 year old son also joined me in the enjoyment. Don't forget to wait until the credits are over for that final scene, it takes a while but it answered some unanswered questions for me. Im banking on a 2nd/sequel and the sooner the better!!!! Excellent movie and the best so far for me in 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Move Thee Reviews: The Pursuit of Power Pollutes our Minds,"THOR is an epic adventure about Thor, a powerful but arrogant god whose reckless actions trigger a war. As a result, he is stripped of his powers by his father Odin and banished to Earth where he has to learn what it takes to be a good leader.Like Iron Man, one of the reasons for THOR's success is the three-dimensional and pleasing protagonist that the audience cares about. Thor is not only a mighty warrior with a powerful physique, but also a loyal friend. However, as a prince born to inherit the throne, he is petulant. Because of his impetuosity, shortsightedness, flashes of rage and disrespect, his father deprives him of his powers and exiles him to earth in the hope that he will become more humble and mature. Unlike other superheroes who gain their superpowers when bitten by a genetically altered spider or hit by a gamma blast, Thor becomes a mortal, like us. Owing to the loss of powers and a beauty's love, his heart is softened. Despite the flaw that Thor's personal growth, i.e. the learning of humility, and his interest in Jane Foster are underdeveloped, Thor is still a charismatic character whom the audience aspires to be.What makes this movie so relatable to me is the breakdown of the family. Speaking of family, Thor is no different from us. He also has to deal with family issues, e.g. sibling rivalry for power and attention, a son's impatience to prove his worth to his father, Loki's hatred for his father, etc. That the pursuit of power pollutes our minds sounds plausible. Several scenes showing the confrontations between the father and the son are emotionally affecting, thanks to Anthony Hopkins, an acting legend, whose nuanced performance as an aging king and a distressed father who is hurt and disappointed by his son is very convincing.The delicately crafted Marvel universe sets the scene for this epic adventure. Earth, Asgard and Jotunheim are beautifully shot and their unique features are highlighted. For instance, Thor's stay in remote New Mexico symbolizes the fall of the god. While his arrogance and passion are highlighted in his glowing golden world, his unequaled courage contrasts sharply with the scary snowy world. Thanks to the jaw-dropping IMAX 3D images, the convincing set design and the cool costume design, the three distinctly different worlds are brought to life within the same reality. What's more, that science cannot explain everything and Norse mythology is real adds romance to the story.Albeit not on a par with Spiderman, THOR is a success as a commercial popcorn movie blending together different genres, mythology, action, a character study, romance, family drama, etc.P.S. Make sure you stick around till after the closing credits!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
falling down,"Don't be mistaken, this is not the story of a fallen god, this is, rather, the story of a fallen movie director.How could the director of Dead Again and of several rather watchable Shakespeare adaptations have fallen so low? This movie is so broken beyond repair that it is hard to believe it was not designed to be that way.The characters are ridiculous and uninteresting, the psychology and the science, an insult to the viewer's intelligence, the dialogs could have been written by a 4 year old, the storyline could have been written by a 3 year old, the special effects are ugly and pointless; last but not least: the acting is so plain bad, that you believe that the director selected the worst shots on purpose.Is the lost hammer the symbol of Brannagh's lost inspiration? Is Thor's success in attaining ""worthiness"" by getting drunk in a bar a suggestion to the disparaged moviegoer?Without any hesitation, this is by far the lowest point in Marvel's movie series.

Avengers Assemble!,"Sometime in 2012, Marvel Studios will release The Avengers, a conglomerate of superhero films all rolled into one, and a film I expect will overthrow The Dark Knight as the highest- grossing superhero movie of all time. How it will fare against Nolan's third and final Batman remains to be seen, but with the Tony Stark character already well established, the time has come to add another crucial piece of the Avengers puzzle with the fantastical universe of Thor, the Nordic god of thunder.The soon-to-be king of the Asgard realm, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is stripped of all his powers and cast down to Earth, doomed to life as a mere mortal as punishment for disobeying the orders of his king and father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). There he meets sceptical scientist Jane (Natalie Portman), and learns that his power-hungry brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been conspiring against the ailing Odin back on Asgard, intending to become the king himself.The very nature of storytelling throughout Thor is well executed. It works many interesting facets of Nordic mythology into the story and, while I can't say I've ever read a Marvel comic in my life, I was impressed by the eccentricity of the plot. Never having been a big fan of director Kenneth Branagh (I feel he has the unwanted ability of drawing pretentiousness from otherwise straightforward subject matter), I admit that even he kept a tight hold on the pace. Okay, maybe he couldn't resist aligning the plot with parts of Shakespeare's Henry V and King Lear, but overall he appears very conscious of what he's directing: a popcorn action vehicle with mass public appeal, mostly devoid of unnecessary literary allusions.In fact, if I had to criticise one aspect of Branagh's filmmaking, it would be the cinematography. It's hard to miss the constant use of titled camera angles throughout Thor, which I assume were employed to emphasise the 'other-worldliness' of Asgard, but instead just seem lazy and contribute little to the film other than occasionally disorientating the viewer.Around the time Thor begins his new life on Earth, the film takes on a more comedic direction, with most jokes arising from situations that show the protagonist as a fish out of water (walking across the street with no regard for cars, declaring his love of coffee by throwing his mug against a wall, stuff like that). Unfortunately, most of the jokes fall flat, but this is certainly an area that differs from person to person. Frankly, I thought the best laugh came from a witty and direct reference to the self-centred Stark during the film's biggest set piece.I don't often review films through comparison, but while we're on the topic of Iron Man, it is a great way of exposing the character flaws of this film. While Thor itself possesses an interesting story, there is little depth to the main character, in comparison to multi-faceted personality of Iron Man's billionaire egotist. Where Iron Man builds towards Tony and Pepper's relationship on the back of over four hours of brewing sexual tension, Thor introduces, deals with and wraps up its romantic subplot all within ninety minutes. Portman doesn't butcher her role by any means, but suffers from a formulaic script lacking any interest in thorough character development.All in all, this film offers the same sort of action-packed escapism we have come to expect from Hollywood over the Easter holidays. Hey, this time last year we had to sit through Clash of the Titans, and Thor certainly doesn't deserve that sort of shabby treatment. And for any Marvel fanatics out there, make sure to stick around after the credits.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"It's crap, but I like it.","There are plenty of things wrong with this film, like there are with practically all of the marvel films.I don't like films that lean to heavily on special effects for instance, Thor does. I like a bit of plot and character development in my films, Thor has neither. Although, to be fair. Thor does turn from an arrogant prick into a nice helpful fellow in something like three minutes flat, if that's not character development I don't know what is. To continue: the fights are bonkers, events happen for little apparent reason, Blacks and Asians apparently can be Norse Gods (I don't mean to come across as a racist but I studied Norse mythology for a bit and there are no Blacks or Asians in it) and the one-liners are so cheesy you could catch mice with them.All in all this film is full of things I hate (not that I hate blacks or Asians, really I don't) but I like it. The acting is solid, the overly-prevalent CGI does look good and the fact that there is no character development to worry about does mean there's plenty of action to keep you entertained.In a sense films are similar to food. Sometimes you want to go all-out and have a fancy three-course meal at a high-end restaurant and sometimes you just want to have a kebab-roll with unnaturally orange gob leaking out the sides and garlic sauce dripping down your fingers. Thor is like the kebab-roll, it's not intellectual, high-brow or in any way intelligent, but it's likable in the right circumstances, just leave it for a day when you need some light entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

THOR is Better Than I Expected it to Be,"Marvel continues its push towards its ultimate goal: THE AVENGERS (also known as the most ambitious comic book film endeavor ever). Before we can bring all of the major superheroes together on the big screen, we're treated to a series of introductory films for each of the main characters and that means we were given a theatrical release for someone I've always considered a B-grade character in the Marvel universe, Thor. For those unfamiliar with Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder and wields the powerful war-hammer Mjolnir. In the Marvel canon, he is a being from the mystical realm of Asgard. He is the son of Odin and next in line for the throne, but he's got a few personal issues to work out before Odin hands him the keys to the kingdom. Asgard's longtime enemies, the Frost Giants, sneak into the palace in an attempt to steal a powerful artifact, and Thor reacts with a desire for war. He gathers his comrades for an attack on the Frost Giant realm of Jotunheim. Thor's actions result in war between the two realms and Odin banishes Thor with hopes of teaching him a valuable lesson. Thor is stripped of his power and exiled to Earth (Midgard) while his brother Loki uses the opportunity to rise to power as ruler of Asgard.If that was hard to understand, I believe it. For anyone who hasn't seen the film and doesn't have an established understanding of the comic's canon, the plot to this film is a bunch of gibberish. I really am surprised it did as well as it did in the box office, but I'm happy to see it. I've never been much of a Thor fan and I wasn't excited to hear he'd be getting his own film. When Kenneth Branagh was brought on as director, my interest was piqued but I still had a hard time caring. The heavy fantasy/mythological angle of the Thor series never appealed to me and, even with Branagh's talent behind the camera, I was still worried that a movie trying to cram so much exposition into a single story was going to collapse under it's own weight. I was wrong to doubt THOR, as it turned out to be an excellent bit of summer popcorn fun. It's not as good as Jon Favreau's IRON MAN, but it's a fun, flashy bit of blockbuster action. Visually, it's amazing. The mystical realms of Asgard and Jotunheim look amazing; I could've watched an entire film in these realms without ever setting foot on Earth and I'd have been satisfied. The costume design somehow pulls off a miracle: making the outrageous costumes of the comic work in a serious(ish) film. Thor's winged helmet or Loki's horned piece don't stand out as comically as I thought they would.The film really looks fantastic but the story is pretty thin. In an effort to ensure they had enough time to explain what the heck we're looking at to people who've never seen the character and his world, the actual story is pretty thin. Thor is sent to Earth to learn a bit of humility and compassion, his manipulative brother tries to assume the throne, lessons learned and everyone's saved. I'm sure the next film in the franchise (and with almost a half billion in worldwide box office, it IS a franchise) will move a lot smoother now that the general population knows the character and it's new worlds. Origin stories are always the hardest to present but THOR does it pretty well. It's a fun ride with great characters (well, the Asgardians anyway) and great action, and it continues Marvel's winning streak with its line of films leading to THE AVENGERS.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Yet another comic book character to get to know,"Marvel has rummaged in it's cupboard full of superheroes and dusted off another lesser known character, ""Thor"" the Norse superbeing with colossal powers party attributed to his trusty Hammer ""Mjollnir"".The film opens with a neat car versus person interface, followed by some witty one-liners from Rick (Skellan Skaarsgard), Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Jane (Natalie Portman). The three offbeat scientists, discovering Thor (Chris Hemsworth) by accident, following a tornado like weather event. The story then backtracks to find out where the stranger arrived from, surely he cannot just fall out of the sky?An extended period of exposition details the other world struggle between two fantastical realms lead by King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in Asgardand the Bi Frost people lead by the very cold, in every sense, King Laufey (Colm Feore). Despite being groomed to be King, Thor is reckless, arrogant and keen to fight at any and every opportunity. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has always played second fiddle to his brother and without a cool hammer to his name, stays firmly in the background.Events transpire that cause the wise King to excommunicate his chosen son to earth, stripped of his powers and only able to use the hammer, sent with him, if he becomes worthy.Returning the story to Earth, the scientists find the newly arrived impostor entertaining but weird, speaking in a strange ""old English"" accent and smashing cups on the floor when another drink is required, all standard Norse superbeing type behaviour. These classic fish out of water scenes, are the strongest part of the film. Portman is new to the comic book universe but does well with the limited screen time available. Hemsworth is surprisingly good, buff, entertaining and more than willing to make fun of himself, essential attributes in any comic book film adaptation.Of course on earth S.H.I.E.L.D gets involved, any opportunity for men in black suits, sunglasses and black vans is never missed. Marvel, as most readers will know, are attempting to tie all the characters together for the upcoming Marvel ""Avengers"" movie, to maximize the synergy (i.e. Comic book geek fanbase) that exists between all the characters.Cutting between the real world and Asgar, it is clear that Loki with only a rather boring staff to his name, will make mischief whilst his brother is away. Anthony Hopkins as Odin, is the Anthony Hopkins we know and mostly love to watch, although his wife ""Frigg"" (Rene Russo) all but ending up on the cutting room floor.There are many sweeping CGI shots of gleaming cities, large scale battles with the Bi Frost people, think deep freezers in human form. Monstrous beasts awakened and slain in short order, whilst trusty watchman Heimdall (Idris Elba) guards the bridge to other dimensions. Unfortunately, Lord of The Rings has done many of these sequences better and with more gravitas. Thor's comrades at arms are essentially the Fellowship in barely disguised form and on occasion, the huge sites, throne rooms, outfits with elaborate shoulder pads and capes, are difficult to accept with a straight face.The stand out sequence in the small town between the ""Destroyer"" and the merry band is entertaining, as the medieval knight like automaton, dispatches obstacles in it's path with a rather nifty heat lamp hidden behind it's mask.The film, bizarrely although competently directed by Kenneth Branagh is wise enough to laugh at itself and puncture the pompous nature of this mythical tale at every opportunity. More focus on the actors and their interaction, with less cityscape CGI would make for a better film but this is certainly not as bad as you might have feared.Clearly the producers are looking ahead with an ending begging for a continuation. Box office suggests that audiences have room for yet another superhero. Why such stories should be so popular in these straitened times may not be so hard to ascertain.SummaryYet another comic book character to get to know, whilst fun and self knowing enough, the extended CGI sequences on occasion ruin the good work on offer when the characters are earthbound.Lightly recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

doesn't suck if you think of it a little as a comedy,"So I saw Thor in 3d and released in 2011. So did I like it. Well before I answer that let me say I am not opposed to watching the odd popcorn big budget bonanza, but as my blog states, I shoot more for quality overall than just great special effects. So my girl had free tickets and that is why we went. So did I like it? Well if you don't take it seriously it is kind of funny, something I hoped legendary Kenneth Branagh (who directed this film) intended. Oddly he was a perfect choice for this film considering the Thor planet parts with Sir Anthony Hopkins play more like Shakespeare. Is it really good, no. Is it worth it to see it in 3d, no. Some movies like avatar are meant to be seen in 3d, where it is much more than a gimmick. This movie if you see it in the theaters, save the cash see it in 2d you won't be missing anything. Otherwise the special effects are great, and the acting is not horrible. I kind of thought of it as a modern day ""flash gordon.""

They have sent him crashing to Earth to learn a few lessons along the way. Now one might think that his mission is to hammer out justice to those who dare to cross his path, and although that may be somewhat true, his real mission is to reel in mucho dollars for Paramount Studio ( and indeed he will ). Yes, Thor, the first of the summer blockbusters, has finally arrived! Sit back and enjoy the ride!Shakespearean actor/ director Kenneth Branagh goes all Shakespeare on us with the film's plot and character development. He takes a tried and true formula as his blueprint: Tragedy + Comedy = Thor, and most of the time he succeeds in his vision. With this comic book tale, he amps up the Norse / Marvel mythology aspects and treats his film with a solid pedigree of opulence and pageantry that is usually not seen in this genre. Branagh still provides plenty of action sequences to please the built-in audience of fanboys everywhere. But he wisely throws in some Henry V, some King Lear, some Hamlet into the mix while juggling the lighter comic element that made the original Ironman such a successful enterprise. However, he does make some missteps along the way.Banished from Asgard due to his recklessness and arrogance and forced to live with us humans, Thor becomes a fish out of water as he time travels to the 21st century and tries to adapt to our planet's customs. It is here that he meets Jane Foster who will, of course, become his love interest and help him become a better man-god and it is here that the film excels in its charming and comic tone, if not in its originality.In fact, the film constantly shifts its vision ( and also its strengths and weaknesses ) with varying results jumping to scenes from modern day Earth, the Disneylike inspired Tomorrowland known as Asgard, and Jotunheim, the ice planet of Frost Giants.The modern day sequences work best due to the strong chemistry between the leads: Chris Hemsworth, in a breakout performance as the God of Thunder, displays a nice comic timing while also displaying a even more defined godlike torso. ( Let's face it, he looks and acts the part to perfection. As gods go, he's an 11! ); Natalie Portman is adorable and completely likable as his astrophysicist girlfriend, but it really doesn't tax her acting prowess. ( Let's face it, she looks and acts this throwaway part to silly perfection. But as astrophysicists go, she's an 5 at best! ). Stellan Skaragard and Kat Dennings as Jane's scientific crew provide able support to the proceedings. Also impressive are the battle sequences on the subzero Jotunheim with the villainous Frost Giants. This portion of the film is quite effective and makes for rousing fantasy entertainment. The visual effects and makeup are first rate and Colm Feore as King Laufey elicits the right menace necessary for all the Dark Forces to converge on our hero and his fateful allies.But it is on Asgard where I had serious problems was with the film's lack of inventiveness in its production values and familiar comic book storyline. ( This is the Shakespearian ""realm"".) After all, it is 965 A.D. when our story begins. Yet the illogical futuristic costumes are distracting ( helmets worn as ostentatious headdresses and tacky gladiator armor reminiscent of Hollywood's Cleopatra era ) and the laughable art direction is even worse. The setting is so overwrought with grandiose Art Deco style and Celtic inspired patterns that one wonders if the gods may have time traveled to future centuries and taken too many courses in art history and fashion design for such pretentious surroundings. ( At times, I thought I was at the Crystal Cathedral Ministries or some 1964 World's Fair pavilion with all the excessive gold leaf and gaudy crystal. ) Also caught in this world are Anthony Hopkins as Odin ( his best acting in years ), Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous sibling, Loki, and Idris Elba as Heimdall, Odin's loyal servant and gatekeeper to the realm. The actors go about their paces, don't look to ridiculous in all the gaudy trappings, and are able to extract fine performances from the insubstantial material they are given.Another misstep: the clash of the titans' duel between Thor and a cyborg rip-off. There is an awkward moment, a recycled formulaic similarity of robotic invaders from past films, from the animated Iron Giant to 1951's Gort (from The Day the Earth Stood Still ) to Ironman itself. And while there is nice CGI to enjoy, there is also a nagging sense of déjà in this sequence, a vision completely lacking any imaginative thought of its own.Still, Thor is a mighty sci-fi fantasy tale of redemption that is sure to be a real crowd- pleasing franchise even though it's a bit inconsequential. The action moves along at a brisk clip, the film thoroughly holds your attention, and it is what it is. As big summer blockbusters go, it will make a godlike ton of money and keep the Hollywood gods and moguls happy, that is, until the next superhero comes along ( which should be in about 2 weeks, I would guess.)

"Visually Stunning, good story,a touch of humor and some action","this review is for all the non marvel comic book o philes.I am not one, I was able to get into this movie because i am familiar with the story of Thor. but i think this telling of the story stands on its own without the marvel or mythical background.anyone not familiar with the story of Thor , it , to me , resembles the story of Satan, ...an infinite being just under the head god , gets a big ego , gets stripped of power and cast down to earth...there's a bit of a parallelit has a medieval feel when in the world of the gods and of course it/the story takes place on two different worlds -the world of the gods and the world we know today on earth.The first fifteen minutes, to me, were just visually amazing, I usually don't like movies filmed in darkness, and the god world has that dark background quality , but this was done well, what i usually find annoying was , in this movie , a well maintained accent that actually worked ,I had heard bad reviews of this movie, and i have seen my share of bad movies- This is not a bad movie -- The action is good , story line is not convoluted, and it/the movie does this quirky, touch of realism, humor every once in a while that makes you chuckle. Thor does its job , it entertains, it doesn't take things too seriously, and i think it is a ""re-watcher""---",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Scifi for Yuppies,"Do you have an intellectual, yuppie friend with no imagination who can't understand why anyone above the age of 13 would see a comic book movie? Is she a woman? Does she look like Natalie Portman? If you said yes then you probably have a good idea what this movie is about. The movie does have some amazing special effects, artwork and sets, but it moves from one scene to the next, vacillating between amazing heroic scenes on Thor's planet of Asgard vs scenes of complete dorkiness with Natalie Portman. Will you like this movie? I guess that depends on how much dorkiness you can take with your Thor. Personally I couldn't make it past the final scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A very respectable Superhero movie,"I went to the cinema expecting yet another ordinary superhero film. Having no prior knowledge of Nordic Mythology or the Thor comics this movie wasn't high on my 'to watch' list.Thankfully, I took a chance and I was completely blown away by this movie.I watched Thor with my wife (who wasn't the least bit interested in going to see it). As the end credits started, she turned to me and said 'that is one of the best movies I have ever seen'.The story, effects, sound, acting, directing are all excellent. I also watched it in 3D and this again was of the highest order.Thor is a VERY good film and easily the best film I've seen this year (maybe the last 5 years).

Thor: Movie Review,"I Found Thor easily one of the poorer Marvel Films out of the many that has been created. I think the only ones that are worse are Fantastic 4 and Ghost Rider. Simply because the story is so basic, and you have seen it million times before. The Villain Loki just has no personality and is a very weak character, i think the most interesting thing is in the short clip after the credits.I felt that the start of Thor started well, and the action sequence was good, but from then on, its just abit of a drain. although their are funny references throughout which so make you laugh, but you cant help but notice the poor costumes and CGI when they are on earth.See for yourself because some people obviously like it, as its got a 7 on here, but personally i would say X-Men and Iron Man are far better. if Story and shoddy Costumes don't bother you, then you may be able to enjoy this film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor: The Frat God,"SYNOPSIS:
After making an irrational decision based off of emotions, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of Asgard and his powers are taken away. He ends up on Earth where he has to prove himself worthy of Thor's power once again all while his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has dark plans for the future of Asgard.REVIEW:
Thor would simply be that friends that everyone messs with, you know? Like a chill guy who's just good to his core and very compassionate and if you cross him you get the hammer. This film creates that so well. This is probably one of the funniest most entertaining MCU films so far. I know a lot of people will disagree, but I think this film is funnier than Ragnorak. Hate me all you want and my answer won't change. With all of that being said, I don't think it's top 5 Best MCU films ever made. Possibly not even top 10. I'd have to go through every film again and by the end of this marathon I'm having, I'll have an updated list. I think as far as a character study, this film did great, it really introduces us to the type of person Thor is, as a superhero film, it was decent. Nothing terrible and nothing amazing. What keeps you in this film is the dynamic of Thor and seeing going through this rough experience and coming to peace with the fact that he made a mistake that costed him everything he loves. The love story between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman) was done a lot better than The Incredible Hulk, however, time spent on that could've been spent on the rule of Asgard at the hands of Loki and that dynamic. Again, I understand this film went more the route of introducing characters and it does just fine with that. Chris Hemsworth carries this film from beginning to end and this film accomplished what it set out to do and for that I give this film a 7.1/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

They didn't do too much to try to throw people off the story. Which I love about these kinds of movies.I hate how the ending went though.

Hammertime,"Greetings again from the darkness. Upfront admission: I am not a Thor comic book expert. Many people are and I fully appreciate their take on this film will be much different from mine. I can only judge this movie on the basic background knowledge I have and the final product on the screen.Let's start with the good stuff. Chris Hemsworth makes a terrific Thor. If I had his looks and build, I would certainly consider myself a Nordic God. Heck, I might even carry around a hammer just for fun! Thor, son of Odin, is all set to be named King of Asgard until his quick-temper and love of battle cause a break in the peace accord with the Frost Giants. His dad, Odin, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins is none too pleased with his hot-headed son. Not only does he renege on the promise to name him King, but he strips his power and casts him down to Earth ... specifically New Mexico. For some reason, all alien portals lead to New Mexico. You can tell it's a been a bad day for Thor because he lands in the middle of nowhere and is promptly run over by a science lab van driven by Natalie Portman.Other good stuff: Idris Elba as Heimdall, the gatekeeper, is excellent; there is a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye - a teaser for The Avengers movie next year; Jamie Alexander shows some chops as Sif; Clark Gregg is back as Agent Coulson; some of the special effects are pretty cool ... the Frost Giants are very detailed and The Destroyer looks like Iron Man on metallic steroids; and lastly, Kat Dennings has a couple of sharp lines as Portman's assistant. Ms. Dennings was superb in ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"".OK, the not so good stuff: I am beginning to despise 3-D (it adds nothing, while diminishing the brightness of colors); Jotunheim (land of the Frost Giants) is just plain, gray and boring; Natalie Portman, fresh off an Oscar is just terrible as an astro-physicist with a teenage crush on Thor; Tom Hiddleston as Loki is one of the weakest villains I have ever seen in a super-hero/comic book movie; Rene Russo must not have read the script prior to accepting her role - she has about 3 lines and is totally wasted.Despite the weaknesses, I found the movie to be entertaining enough thanks to the scenes with Thor and Odin. The ambitious son being shown tough love by his father is a missing element in much of society today. Guess it takes a Nordic God to show us how. The scenes with Portman are painful to watch, but I believe there is enough to keep the comic book fans and just about anyone else entertained.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is best known for his Shakespeare and stage work, the movie does have a little different look and feel from the average superhero movie. Still, I wouldn't put it in the class of Batman, Spider-man, or Iron Man. We do get the expected Stan Lee cameo and the end-of-the-credits appearance of Samuel L Jackson. Up next, Captain America!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An entertaining epic that updates the hero's quest,"This movie has many strong points. It has some delightful comic moments when the Thunder God comes to Earth as a man. The fights are imaginative and exciting and the visuals of the strange other worlds are stunning.But its greatest value lies in its telling of the story of an immature man growing into a true hero. This is a kind of male experience that dates back through history, but is a part of the best action films with a male protagonist. This is what makes the film satisfying beyond just a visual action experience.Most of the reviews of this film have been good, but the few negative ones seemed to be from people who didn't understand the hero's quest or were too caught up in a more narrow, politically-correct mind-set to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable Fluff,"Thor is a light, enjoyable comic book movie. The one word that perfectly encapsulates this movie is ""simple"". Thor's character arc of redemption works. The villain has just enough backstory to make him interesting. The ""fish out of water"" type of humour works. The movie is incredibly silly, yet it embraces its ridiculousness. This makes the movie very easy to get into. Only rarely do you get pulled out due to forced melodrama. The movie achieves nearly everything it sets out to. However, that is the main issue with the film. It isn't exactly ambitious. It does a good job telling a simple superhero origin story, but it does little more than that. Asgard seems to be to be very interesting, but more time spent exploring it would have improved the film. The action sequences are decent, but it could have been much more creative given the character's supernatural abilities. Overall, Thor could have been something great if it was more ambitious and creative. That being said, it achieves its goal of being good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the Better Comic Adaptations,"Thor (2011)*** (out of 4)After going against his father's wishes and starting up a war, the arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins) but while he's gone his brother turns enemy and tries to destroy the kingdom. While on Earth Thor meets a young scientist (Natalie Portman) who tries to understand where he comes from. I will admit that I've never read a single Thor comic and I'll admit that I find a lot of these comic movies to be rather bland with more action than brains. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I will admit that I was really confused when I learned that someone like Kenneth Branagh was going to be directing. Well, color me shocked to nearly my death because this is actually a pretty solid movie that has some brains, plenty of action, great characters and some wonderful special effects. I was really caught off guard by the screenplay being able to make some interesting characters and this covers everyone from Thor to his father, the scientist, her friends and just about everyone else in the story. It's strange but I found even the smallest of the supporting characters to be people you could connect with and this certainly helped the story. I also thought the performances were extremely well by everyone involved. The arrogance that Hemsworth was able to bring the part was pitch perfect and I thought Portman was fun and believable in her bit. It certainly doesn't hurt when you've got someone like Hopkins giving it his all. Rene Russo is pretty much wasted in her brief role but it was still nice seeing her. I've always said that I'm not a fan of CGI because more often than not it just looks so fake to me that I have a hard time getting caught up in the world it's trying to create. That wasn't the case here because I thought the picture was visually stunning. The opening bit with the space travel looked amazing and I thought the director did a remarkable job at blending the CGI with the story so that it was never distracting. THOR is certainly one of the better comic book adaptations out there.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A visual spectacle where the plot and character development are also highlighted.,"In general, I have some worries about films who are born from comic books. I've seen a few where the plot falls far short of expectations, and ended up being a bunch of pure simple CGI. This film remains a stunning visual spectacle, but the narrative is much more balanced and well-articulated than I expected.As I am not an expert in Norse mythology, nor in the comics that Marvel dedicated to the characters, and which served as the basis for the film, I accept the plot as it is. It has value because of the way it was structured and how it is presented. The characters are well-developed and have an interesting psychology, particularly Loki, who is an intelligent, calculating, but also angry persona. Considering the ending, I believe that the direction of sequels was already pre-planned, just as Marvel has already done. The dialogues sound strange, sometimes, but I think there was an attempt to archaize them in the first half of the film, entirely set in Thor's world.I was very amazed to see Kenneth Branagh occupy the director's chair and claim that he did so because he was a long-time fan of Marvel's source material. On the one hand, I believe that the director also sought to give us another proof of versatility and overcoming, but on the other hand, I have no doubt that the production's best option was to call someone who already knew the material and who would know how to respect it. And I was surprised again to see Sir Anthony Hopkins among the cast! I could hardly imagine that this actor would accept a job like that, with so many visuals and so little to really play. Of course, he did the job without difficulty. As for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, they probably did the most important work in their respective artistic careers for the next two decades. Both are excellent, they balance well the charisma and ability to play, thus offering us two equally solid leads. Idris Elba is suitably imposing, but he doesn't have much else to do; Colm Feore did a superficial and less interesting work; Stellan Skarsgard has little to do here due to his shallow and featureless character; Finally, Natalie Portman is limited to being the lovebird of the day. At this moment, always follows the standards that Marvel has used us to.I don't think it's really worth highlighting the superb quality of the CGI and all the visual work: from the sets to the costumes, including props, makeup, lighting and editing work, the production invested heavily in creating very elaborate visuals that can appeal to our imagination. They really wanted the film to become another franchise within the Marvel universe. The sound and soundtrack deserved equal treatment, with the composition of an extraordinary original score, which has a very strong epic tone. Unfortunately, as has happened in other films that Marvel has presented to us, there is a lot of advertising for varied sponsors, which becomes tiring beyond certain limits, but this ends up being a lesser evil if we consider that, nowadays, there is no ""blockbuster"" that doesn't do the same thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Feels a bit rushed, but otherwise a fine movie","Thor was always the hardest to introduce into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the rest of the Avengers are all human, albeit some with superpowers, Thor, the mythological god of thunder, is anything but. Keeping that in mind, I think this was an excellent adaptation of the comic book superhero that we know and love. It has its flaws, and if you were to write the whole Avengers storyline from a scratch, you'd probably give a character like Thor a miss, but the film makers managed to make it work.What I like the most about this film is its charm. This stems from the great actor choices, as well as the writing and the dialogues. Chris Hemsworth was a new face for me personally, but I don't think that they could have picked a better Thor. The man has it all, the looks, the attitude, the physical prowess, the charisma. Natalia Portman and Tom Hiddleston are equally great in their roles of Jane Foster and Loki, respectively. The writing, on the other hand, shines through in the dialogues, which are fun to follow and feel real. Hemsworth has some really great lines throughout the entire film, which cause me to laugh out loud no matter how many times I see this film.In addition, the rest of the cast do excellent job as well, the visuals (especially the design of Asgard) are topnotch and the action scenes are creative and fun to follow.Unfortunately the movie falters a bit when it comes to the pacing. Most of the first half of the film is spent in Asgard, introducing the world and building up the characters. And while this is all needed and I enjoyed all of it, it causes the time spent on Earth to feel just a little bit rushed, especially the budding romance between Thor and Foster. So perhaps a little more time should have been focused on Earth rather than the various alien worlds, but even as it it, it doesn't ruin the film. There are some things that could have benefited from extra attention (Odin sleep, anyone?), but only the romance really feels like it should have had more time to develop. Otherwise you can buy the fact that the film can only be so long.Aside from that one flaw, I really think that this is a great film. The characters, the visuals, the plot, they all work and they work well. Marvel can proudly call this one its own and it's a worthy introductory film for the character of Thor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor he's a jolly good fellow,"Being more of a DC comics guy myself, I know little more about Thor other than he has big hair, a big cape and a big hammer. I suppose he's as close as Marvel got to a Superman- type hero, but with more angst, as expelled for youthful bravado in confronting his home world Asgard's old enemies the Frost Kings, he finds himself exiled on Earth,where he quickly (too quickly in my opinion) goes native there, getting caught up in defying the authorities and falling for Natale Portman.The film itself entertains with its sword and sorcery plot-line and neatly contrasts the fantastical world of Asgard and Jottenheim with modern-day America. The story of sibling rivalry is as old as the Old Testament and creates suitable tension in the narrative, while Anthony Hopkins presides over his sons' feuding with the necessary gravitas.The action sequences are especially well done, including the first battle with the Frost Giants, Loki's dispute with Haemdell and especially Thor and his band's fight with the seemingly invincible Destroyer. The c-gen SFX are suitably dream-scape in scale, particularly the depiction of the Bifrost Rainbow Bridge.The acting is serviceable rather than memorable, only Hopkins making you look more at him than the scenery behind him and while I understand the interpolation of S.H.I.E.L.D for continuity reasons leading up to the Avengers movie, for me they were still a distracting presence.All told though, this more grounded super-hero movie was better suited to my taste than those aimed closer at the lucrative market for 13 year old viewers of others of the same ilk.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""What A Blast""","Before the Paramount logo was shown in ""Iron Man 2"", our favorite S.H.I.E.L.D. operative agent Phil Coulson, gets to New Mexico and sees Thor's hammer Mjolnir lying in a crater. So how it got there and Thor wasn't with it. This film will give you the answer.In ""Thor"" we get to find out about his life in Asgard being one of the two sons of King Odin. Loki was his brother. Thor's arrogant nature gets him in trouble and Odin banishes him to Earth to get him to clean up his act. While gone from Asgard, Loki takes over as King while Odin is in the Odin Sleep, then plans to destroy Earth. So can Thor get his act together and save Earth and Asgard from his brother's evil?I felt Kenneth Branagh did a fantastic job directing by using a great mixture of comedy and action to keep the story going. You also had a great cast including Chris Hemsworth, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Denning, Rene Russo, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, Josh Dallas, Jaimie Alexander, and Idris Elba.So with ""Thor"" out now and ""Captain America"" coming in July 2011, the stage will be set for ""The Avengers"" being released in May 2012.

Game of Thrones: A Song of Hammers and Ice,"Based on the Marvel Comic based on the Norse Gods, Thor introduces the Asgardian mythos into the flourishing MCU. Partly set on Asgard, the realm of the Gods, the universe becomes rapidly expanded through an opening expositional dialogue. Setting the tone for most of the Asgard and Jotunheim scenes, the expositions spread throughout the film can often be too slow and visually dark. For realms that are supposed to be fantastical, these scenes were quite boring, failing to inspire the awe that is spoken of. The scenes set on Earth are fun, but they rely heavily on a humor which musters only a chuckle some of the time. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) & his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are the best parts of the film as their brotherly bickering and camaraderie feel so genuine and charming. Each ones personal desire for the throne becomes more heartbreaking as it naturally tears them apart. Besides Odin (Anthony Hopkins), the rest of the cast are mostly one note characters, offering little more than a certain character trait to progress the plot or act as mediocre comic relief. With so few memorable moments set outside of the Odinson family, having them split up through most of the film feels like a missed opportunity. Attempting to balance a serious mythology with an exciting, growing universe, Thor struggles with its tones, but finds its strengths in the familial relationships that develop throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, had some cool ideas coming into the film, but due to a weak back story, and poor execution of the characters and script, this film ended up being decently boring compared to some of the other films we've seen in phase one. Branagh brought his Shakespearian style to Thor, that worked for better and for worse. He utilized a few decent sweeping scenery shots, but the over abundance of dutch angles, really threw me off. Just like most of the other phase one films, Thor had some production issues, hiring, firing, and rehiring castings, while swapping through directors like it was going out of style. After all the smoke was cleared, they casted great talent, and a good director.Thor had a good amount of potential to be at least decent, but it simply felt like another set up film. With such a poor fish out of water story, the expositions were left underdeveloped and dry, while the tones are completely uneven. The first half hour is pretty good, seeming to be setting up for something interesting, but come the rest of the eighty minutes, it dragged at such a slow pace, relying on the characters to drive the film, and that just didn't work in this application.From a stand-alone film prospective, Thor probably has the most talented cast, selected by Sarah Finn and Randi Hiller; all the team needed to do was make a good script, to compliment the characters, and they couldn't do it. Most of these characters are pretty disposable, lacking charm, wit, humor, and overall likability. Chris Hemsworth seems like he was made for this role. At first, he was denied the role of Thor, but he tried out again, and solidified his casting. Hemsworth does bring a lot of charm and good comedic timing to the character, but he can overcook it at times, making Thor a little more over the top than usual. With such a powerful hero, it's hard to make a solo film for him because he is just so strong, that the risks just won't be there, and that's the risk Kenneth Branagh wanted to take, and it didn't quite pay off. Branagh tried to give him a character arch, but it was just so cliché, setting up for a predictable third act. Natalie Portman is such a talented actress, but she is one of the worst love intrests of the MCU, solely because the relationship with Thor is so laughably forced and underdeveloped. Her character is just so boring, I couldn't invest myself into her. Tom Hiddleston puts on the best performance of the film, as Loki, having a good motive, and great emotional connection with Thor. He sold all of his emotions seamlessly, making everything he did and say, feel genuine. I was honestly pretty excited to hear that Anthony Hopkins was going to be in this film, not just as a side character, but as Odin! Other than him trying his best, with great delivery, he basically just hung around the whole time, while Thor and Loki got all the best lines.The action really wasn't all that present, nor memorable at that. The only halfway decent action sequence there was, was the first battle; other than that, the action was just ehh, being a massive downfall considering the power of Thor.The film has a pretty weird production scale. Asgard was ginormous, with all these vibrant colors that pop all over the screen, but when it came to when they were on earth, the small town looked way too much like a movie set, being so dull and boring.Overall, it's like salt in an open wound to say that I didn't really like this movie. It had it's moments here and there, but there was nothing that stood out to make this film stand out on it's own, and hold it's value.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mythology never looked so good!,"I confess i loved this movie, and at first i laughed at the concept. Thor! In modern day, seriously?! But finding out Kenneth Branagh was on board immediately had my attention. The man is a gift to theatre and movies alike, genius like this deserves full attention so needless to say this caught mine.I saw this in the theatre because I was convinced it was a movie that merited my very rare trips to the big, full-screen-and i was not disappointed. From the very first, I was happy to surrender disbelief. The casting was excellent-though I did grumble at Anthony Hopkins at first. I felt he would distract me from the story-he did somewhat but not enough to destroy the flow of the story, and Renee Russo was undeniably gorgeous.After that it was all story. Imagine...take Norse Mythology and smash it into the 21st century. Pure fun.Only serious complaints: some clumsily done special effects and costumes-especially Ray Stevenson in a fat suit. Sigh.Would I see it again?Absolutely.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very good...,"""Thor"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch the powerful Thor of Asgard being rejected and expelled from his world to Earth. He has to live in Earth in order to understand his mistakes but soon enough he will become a defender of it,I liked this movie because it was a nice introduction of Thor as a character. It contained plenty of information regarding his world and him as a character, something that made possible for the audience to understand him and follow him on his adventure. In addition to this, the interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor helped a lot since he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Natalie Portman's who played as Jane Foster, Stellan Skarsgård's who played as Erik Selvig, Anthony Hopkins' who played as Odin and Tom Hiddleston's who played as Loki. Lastly, I have to say that ""Thor"" is an interesting action movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A worthy edition to the MCU,"First of all, the cinematography of the first shot of Asgard is just stunning, and I can't help but appreciate it on every rewatch. The storyline is an interesting one and steers away from a more standard hero vs villain format we've seen thusfar. The characters established here become some of the most memorable ones in the mcu because of the development and time given to them in this film. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are perfect casting and there's great chemistry between the two. The supporting cast, however, are a bit mixed: Hopkins is 100% worthy of the All Father title, Renee Russo too. But Natalie Portman is a superb actress but is wasted here, hopefully Taika Waititi can revive her in Thor 4.They take a realm with mountains of lore in not just comics but mythology, yet ground the characters superbly in humanity. Despite this praise, the characters aren't themselves perfect and are subjected to some cringey lines to fulfil the comedy requirements of the mcu.The characters, story, along with the action sequences, even though they may not as impressive than the other additions to the universe, make for a fun and one of my favourites in the earlier days of the universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic Film Making,"""Thor"" is a triumph in the comic-book genre of live action film as well as action and creative storytelling in general. I have been a massive fan of the director's work and for quite some time, have been praying for him to be given this kind of budget and thank God, he finally was given the opportunity to make this blockbuster hit come to life! I am so impressed. I think even James Cameron should take down a few notes. It is well up there with films like, ""Iron Man 1 and 2,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" along with the ""X-Men"" franchise. If you want to go see something incredible, laugh, cringe, jump, and participate, feeling like you're really there, go see ""Thor"" in 3-D!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
No Spoilers Here,"I'll be honest, I'm part & partial to Marvel Comics, & never really respected Thor as a character. DC played with Gods in their universe, Marvel's genius was always in men. That being said, Thor still had feet of clay. You can't really complain about the movie, just like you couldn't complain about the Hulk. Both are exactly what you'd expect to walk into if you ever took the time to pick up and read the comic books. The X-Men, or rather Chris Claremont's books were the soap opera's with the strong characters & solid, sweeping, plot lines. With Spiderman you expect laughs, people hamming it up with a strict morality as a plot device.Thor isn't one of those titles. The Hulk wasn't either. You can't really bash a movie for staying true to the type of story arcs it published for decades. That being said, it's probably not a title for everyone, but it does deliver exactly what it promises for those that read the title. Part's of it feel like a set-up for the Avengers movie, and it probably is, but Marvel fans have been itching for a good cross-over film.Don't watch it if you want a Dark Knight, or an X2, it never promised to be that type of film & Thor readers would be disappointed if it turned out to be so. You get exactly the type of movie you expected if you actually read the comic, and a much stronger film the ""GhostRider.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surppassed My Expectations,I'll admit when when I went into this I wasn't really interested but by the end I was soooo into it and wanted more. The acting was great especially by Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the guy who played Loki. The frost people scarred the crap out of me. The acting really owes itself to the great writing. The writing was great and it didn't trail off just to give us a battle that was unnecessary. The comedic moments in the film weren't forced and were hella funny. Thor was a great movie and I'm excited for the Avengers film. The effects were pretty awesome. i saw it in 3D but i didn't think it was worth it but there were parts that looked great. The only thing that kinda bothered me was that the battles were a little underdone but they were great nonetheless. The Movie was awesome and if you haven't seen it. You need to.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel :),"I always think movies which are made out of comics are good but the movies which are made out of books may or may not be as good as the book itself. Thor is another example. The movie is interesting as well as entertaining. The effects are cool and Chris Hemsworth looks cool in the role. Anthony Hopkins -- no words... Whatever part you give him, he will blow you away.. Natalie could have been shown more glamorous ;) Personally I think the villain in this movie is a bit of a loser. Common there should have been a big fight. The villain cant lose that easily :D There could have been lot more. But not forgetting the movie revolves mainly around Thor and his character, so that should be expected. Overall.. This movie is worth a watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Oudin were terrific. And the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman seemed genuine.

"Nice visuals, no plot!","Sadly, Thor suffered like many of todays movies from the nice flashy special effects. It had some incredible visuals (such as of Asgard, and the Ice Giant home whose name I cannot pronounce, let alone write, nor remember). Many beautiful, flashy effects that, sadly, it would appear to have sucked the budget dry, as the characters were one dimensional (I won't get into details for those who wish to see it), changing at a whim without rhyme or reason. The majority of the actors were under utilized, except to look pretty (such as Thor's companions, the Queen, Odin, and everyone but Thor), leaving it with a pretty dull, and unimaginative story, with a large number of too unlikely plot devices to save the hero. Not worth the money, and the 3D special effects added life to it, but were unused mostly.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly good,"It was incredible at the time of release to know a Thor film was on the way. The comic character had certain pulpy characteristics, but Marvel managed to create a film that did the main character justice. Hemsworth was an incredible catch for Marvel and they managed to launch a new franchise, separate from Iron Man. The film had a few pitfalls, mainly the storyline on Earth. Loki was a great choice, but his scream time is impeded by the standard Marvel hero focus. Thor was yet another hit for Marvel and at this risky venture, was already heading for The Avengers team-up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The god of thunder,"The other three phase one movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe being Iron Man (2008), the movie The Incredible Hulk (2008), and Iron Man 2 (2010), which were either great, underrated, or just ok; this is clearly a build up to the Avengers team, but now we have movie on the Marvel hero Thor with the first appearance of Chris Hemsworth in the role. The Marvel movie Thor (2011) had well-done performances, good effects, cool action scenes, and cinematography that can at times be weird because of it always shooting in Dutch angles; this movie does a nice job being true to the comics, and this starts giving us one of the best villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that being the God of Mischief Loki.Chris Hemsworth is a great casting choice for Thor, like Robert Downy Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man, with Thor starting out as a selfish battle hungry person who wants to be king of Asgard to being a selfless hero doing what he can to save his friends, family, or innocent people; the progression from selfish to selfless was well-done, and seeing him trying to become worthy again was entertaining to watch leading to some funny moments when sent to Earth or what they call Midgard. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster was pretty good in the movie, being someone who is a physician but also knows science while Thor calls it magic, Thor and Jane Foster had some good chemistry with each other having them form a romance that works well; she has a few funny parts in the movie, and I like how she helps Thor with certain events despite not knowing who he truly is. Lastly, Thor and Loki's father Odin played by great actor Anthony Hopkins does a good job in the role and you can see him as this character with an intimidating presence but also someone who cares for his sons; along with Thor's friends Sif and the Warriors Three played well by Jaimie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, Josh Dallas with Heimdall also played well by actor Idris Elba.The villain being Thor's brother Loki the God of Mischief played wonderfully by Tom Hiddleston, being jealous of Thor and wanting Odin's throne, and having a connection to frost giants who are against Asgardians; this motivation and backstory he has makes him a great Marvel villain, with him doing things that fit the character and how the character acts. The action scenes should have reduced the number of cuts to make them better, but they are fun and cool enough, along with there be cool uses of Thor's hammer Mjolnir in fight scenes with the weird Dutch angles used in the cinematography; with the action scenes, the CGI effects and look of them are well-done with the location of Asgard looking pretty and the way everything looks with the rainbow bridge and the use of the Bifrost for transportation was cool looking.I like the movie Thor (2011), people might say that it can be boring because of how spaced apart the action scenes are, but the movie is well-done with its performances, effects, the interesting dialogue used on the state of Asgard against the frost giants, and the movie's great villain; there some slight issues that makes this movie not perfect, but it is still a good addition to phase one of the well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie is worth going back and watching again if you have not seen it in a long time, but also it was a cool introduction to the Thor character and Marvel's best villain; fans and people who are not fans will enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thunderous applause (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com),"""Thor"" strikes into theaters and starts off the summer blockbuster season.Kenneth Branagh (""Henry V,"" ""Hamlet"") may seem to be an odd choice to direct a big-budget superhero movie. Some superhero movies translate well from comics onto the screen, but ""Thor,"" the story of a golden-manned, hammer-hurling God could be campy or amateurish in the hands of the wrong director. Branagh has proved otherwise.Thor (Chris Hemmsworth) is one hot-headed Norse God. The apparent heir to the throne of the realm of Asgard, he's brash and reckless. After a break-in incident by a few creatures of Frost Giants, Asgard's old nemesis, he defies the order of his father, the wise King Odin (Anthony Hopkins).Thor pushes his way through the galactic portal, watched over by its long-time guardian (Idris Elba), and ventures out to the frozen land of Jotunheim, along with quartet of his loyal fighters (Ray Stevenson, Tadanabou Asano, Josh Dallas, Jamie Alexander). By provoking and starting a fight, he breaks a truce that could lead to a war.Furious and disappointed in his son, King Odin strips off Thor of his supremacy and banishes him to Earth to learn a lesson about humility. In darkness through the storm of clouds, Thor lands in the desert of New Mexico, where he's accidentally hit by the vehicle occupied by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), an astrophysicist, her quirky assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), and mentor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard).There are developments in both worlds. In New Mexico, the S.H.I.E.L.D. government agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), are tracking down the unusual atmospheric phenomenon and taking over Jane's research. In Asgard, King Odin falls into a slumber state and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's iniquitous younger brother, proclaims himself as the ruler of the realm. Loki's dark backstory and motivation is revealingly more complex than a sibling jealousy and deeper than greed. He's a multi-dimensional character and not your typical villain.But no one steals Hemmsworth's thunder here; a star is born. Any doubt about him is erased; as a newcomer, he will make a fine addition to the cast of the all-star ""The Avengers"" (premiering next summer).With his Shakespearean language and old-world manner, Thor is a fish out-of-water and hilarity follows. He gradually transforms from anger and confusion to comprehension and resignation as a mere mortal. For the first time in his life, he doesn't know what he's supposed to be or do. Even with his Godlike, muscular stature, there's a childlike innocence and gentleness about him, wondering around and interacting with humans in his exile.There's a poignancy when Thor finds his hammer, Mjolnir, stuck in a rock, and realizes he could not pick it up even with all his might. Mjolnir is a war hammer forged out of a dying star and could only be held by a worthy warrior. Now this incredible brute strength looks more like a lost little boy. He softens considerably and understands his reprimand.When Thor faces off with the Destroyer, a giant robot sent down by Loki, and selflessly offers himself to end the destruction on Earth, it's a turning point in his character. And when his almighty power is restored in its regal glory, Thor displays it wisely. The God of Thunder is now a dignified warrior.""Thor"" is an epic blend of mythology, action, adventure and fantasy. But underneath all the flash, it has a layered story, well-developed characters and human dynamics. Beyond royal rivalry, it's a story about familial betrayal and tragedy, self-discovery and growth. Yet it's lighthearted enough as a pure enjoyment. The only flaw here, surprisingly, is Natalie Portman, fresh off her Oscar win in ""Black Swan."" Supposedly an accomplished scientist, somehow her portrayal as a love interest comes off as a giddy school girl.Last but not least, what a visual marvel! Asgard is celestially fantastic, fits for Gods - glittering gold spheres, lustrous palace and crystal bridge shimmering in a spectrum of colors. It shines even more luminously, in stark contrast with the dusty, humble Earth.""Thor"" was my most anticipated superhero movie in 2011 since I attended the Comic-Con panel and previewed the extended trailer last year. As an original adaptation, ""Thor"" has set the bar high for ""Green Lantern"" and ""Captain America."" Like ""Spider Man"" and ""Iron Man"" before it, Marvel has another star in its universe, primed for a sequel. ""Thor"" deserves a thunderous applause.***Check out other reviews, resources, trivia, giveaways, etc. at The MovieMaven (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thundered me away,"I went to watch this movie with two friends after I saw trailer (which was too late for premiere, but at least I got it to watch in cinema) and I was blown away. Of course, it was not something that will be the crown of the world for a long time, but it is something you enjoy in the very moment and afterwards.First of all, effects. I mean, it does not do all to film, but it IS first thing you notice among all others. It's truly epic, and there's no other word to describe it. Amazing fight at almost very beginning, and so on, brings things to really new level. Going on, acting. I was really unfamiliar with Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) but they brought characters to life, and I mean it. I mean, it does not happen very often that some acting blow me away, but this did. I just assume that they used given chance, brought up epicness of the story, and did the best they could - it was great. I didn't doubt in Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins performance, and they showed me why.Going on, story is quite well presented on screen. I was never actually fan of Marvel's strips, and I'm not very familiar with many of them, but as far as other reviews, they did amazing job.This epic story is not something that will teach you valuable lesson in your life, but it will return the betrayal lesson you all should have in your minds. It is not, also, film that will stick into cinemas for a half a year or something, but it is definitely film that will provide great time watching it with friends. There is a lot of humor, which is by the way really good, and scenes that will make you think about things you've never taught before.I gave 8/10, and I think that this IMDb ranking does honor to this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"Coming as it does from easily the most interesting of the mythological Pantheons explored by Marvel, this is my favourite from their catalogue. Sir Anthony Hopkins (""Odin"") presides over Asgard with his sons ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) and ""Loki"" (Tom Hiddleston). The former is a bit wayward, but has his heart in the right place; the latter is a bit of a devious schemer whose machinations cause his elder brother to be cast into ""Midgard"" (where we live, basically). It is there - devoid of his strength and his famous hammer (Mjölnir) that he alights on a team of scientists led by the eccentric ""Selvig"" (Stellan Skarsgård) and ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) and sets about regaining his power and returning home before his brother wrecks everything... I was surprised to read that Sir Kenneth Branagh was going to direct this - but he actually does a thorough job. The film is full of action, is well paced and both Hemsworth and Hiddleston have enough depth to their characters to keep this from just becoming another good looking fight-fest. The story is darker, there is more of a sense of menace throughout too - and that reflects the more mature approach taken by the director to give us an adventure film with just a bit more substance to it. The script has humour, especially for Skarsgård and Hemsworth and Sir Anthony has a sagely imperiousness to hold the threads together before a strong conclusion with just the tiniest hint of romance. Great visual effects and yep, I enjoyed this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bo Ring,"There's really not enough curses in the world to describe this piece of drab uninspired humdrum. This movie rates a full star out of ten for two reasons:Natalie Portman is hotOne star is the lowest possible ratingThe movie starts with a long and superfluous intro, which is frankly boring. It's a fight scene where neither 3D nor special effects work well. Fast forward 1000 years and nobody has learned anything. Natalie Portman is hot, Thor is ripped, the story is lame. Everything is third rate until the guardian comes to earth, when finally we see some descent pyrotechnics.

Thor-oughly enjoyable.,"'Thor' has all the ingredients you need for a superb comic book adaptation with a panoply of characters that are perfectly portrayed, easy to follow dialogue with occasional humour, effective CGI and all of this handsomely directed by Kenneth Brannagh.The performances of the cast are exceptional with no one letting the side down. The two main newcomers, Hemsworth and Hiddleston, are jewels in the crown, with Anthony Hopkins upping the theatrics and Natalie Portman delivering a seasoned performance.Chris Hemsworth makes Thor his own with a prodigious performance that captures all the emotions of this young, arrogant and powerful warrior on his journey of self discovery. It is hard to dislike him even when he is arrogant, but as the film goes on, you feel overwhelming support for Thor.Tom Hiddleston manages to catch Loki's mischievous nature with pure precision. Even though he is a deceitful character, you can't help feeling for him as the jealous younger sibling of Thor.Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Odin and delivers a consummate performance of the wise and ancient King of this fantastical realm of Asgard.Natalie Portman superbly plays the astrophysicist who is caught up in all the action, with a straight laced performance that contrasts perfectly with all the fantastical events happening around her.Kenneth Brannagh proves the doubters wrong and delivers the goods with clever direction that blends the splendour of Norse mythology with a workable story on present day Earth. Brannagh knows how to pace the action and is happy to give the audience plenty of breathing space with the slower scenes.Credit must go to Idris Elba and Colm Feore although the latter is criminally underused. Elba is imposing and statuesque as the all seeing Heimdall, with Feore successfully capturing the menace and sadness of Laufey, the King of the Frost Giants.The intricately detailed costumes and sets are a big positive and the special effects up the bar for other comic book adaptations to beat.At just under two hours in length, this is a thoroughly enjoyable action packed romp and takes you places you only usually dream of. Just sit back with your coke and popcorn and let it wash all over you.It's so good, I've watched it twice.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Fun Superhero Movie, But Not Quite There","In many ways, my thoughts on this movie can be summed up as ""Expectations vs. Reality."" It certainly wasn't the best superhero movie ever, but I liked it for what it was. It seemed like the writers and Kenneth Branagh made it about ¾ of the way to having a really good movie on their hands, but there's definitely something missing.My expectations from seeing all the trailers for Thor led me to think ""It looks like it'll look good, but it'll be kind of corny."" I went to see it hoping for a visual spectacle and a fun superhero movie. Just as a side note, I knew only a moderate amount about Thor in the comics before I saw the movie (and I'm more of a DC comics fan, but that'll have no bearing on this review).Thor definitely succeeded with the whole look of the movie. Creating entirely new fantasy worlds in addition to the scenes taking place on Earth is tough, but the CGI was all really well done and convincing. I guess it's easier to make things look better if you have free reign to come up with new worlds that nobody has seen before. The production design and artwork matched the epic scale of the comics, and a surprising amount of practical effects (the frost giants, the real sets in Odin's palace) helped anchor the fantastical to the real. My only complaint is that by the end of the movie, some effects that started out looking cool seemed over-repeated (rainbow bridge cyclones, flyovers of Asgard).But despite the achievement of creating a new variety of mythology, the film failed to provide any deep connection to the characters. The script wasn't too corny, but just kind of bland and a hodgepodge of clichés. Natalie Portman's character was so stupid. All she did was swoon over Thor, give him a ride, and say ""Oh My God"" and complain about SHIELD taking her research (I don't think this is her fault, the script didn't give her much to work with). Her ""relationship"" with Thor was totally contrived and out of nowhere. Kat Dennings' character was the stereotypical sidekick, and Stellan Skarsgard did a good job with what he had to work with. The Warriors Three and Heimdall all were supporting characters with very one-note personalities. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston as Loki all did their best, but the father-sons relationship between them never had much emotional connection or development.There's definitely a bit of overacting involved, and I think that is due to Kenneth Branagh. I just don't think he understands subtlety that well, and preferring to stick to more broader, Shakespearean comedy and emotional moments. I remember watching him in Hamlet and laughing at the scene where he starts hitting a rock with his sword because he's angry. Well, I felt the same way a couple times during Thor.And of course, there was no real suspense. Thor obviously can't die, he has to go be in The Avengers! None of the other characters really felt like they were in much danger. With such a shallow script, you could argue that much of the mythology was toned down because the writers feared that the general public wouldn't be able to follow anything complicated. They tried to root the mythological arcs in emotional conflicts, but none of the emotional conflicts are strong enough for us to care.But the filmmakers honestly did a good job paying attention to details. The cinematography was pretty interesting for a superhero movie, with plenty of dutch angles and wide, sweeping shots. The fight scenes are all pretty cool, and I liked how the different warriors all had unique fighting styles. The costume design made ridiculous outfits and helmets seem natural. I liked the way they incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. (and a special Avengers guest star) into the plot, which was much more natural than in Iron Man 2. And even though there's definitely going to be sequels, I think the ending to this movie had a good finality that doesn't make you feel like you only saw Part 1 of a three part movie.In the Marvel movie pantheon, I would place this above Iron Man 2, but lower than The Incredible Hulk (my favorite Marvel movie), the first two Spidermans, and maybe the first Iron Man. It's worth seeing, as it's not your typical superhero movie, but I would wait until it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray (and it's definitely not worth seeing in 3D). Thor is almost an experiment: Can audiences accept a lighter, mythological-based superhero movie? It certainly has the beginnings of greatness, but still has a lot to improve on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Lots of info dump for those not familiar, but a solid intro to Thor","ThorRobotics, science and government have been tackled in the MCU, but the 4th film in the MCU, Thor, brings in mysticism and alien beings. Marvel had used Norse mythology decades ago when writing the series Journey Into Mystery, which evolved into the adventures of Thor pretty early on. As it was clear by this point that the Avengers were coming together, it wouldn't be right to not involve our favorite muscled Norse god from Asgard. It was time for his ""origin"" film, explaining who he is, who his cast of characters are, and how the universe continues to expand.S. H. I. E. L. D.'s references to ""trouble in New Mexico"" during Iron Man 2 are revealed to be a powerless Thor, and his unmovable hammer, making a dramatic entrance by falling from the sky. Jane Foster (played beautifully by Natalie Portman), is joined by MCU original characters Darcy (love love love her) and Dr. Erik Selvig in finding Thor while researching changes in the constellations due to the transportation system used.The movie spends a big chunk of time info dumping all of Thor's mythology for the audience, introducing all of those characters, Loki, Odin, Freya, Heimdall, the Warriors Three, and Lady Sif, plus of course our favorite hammer, Mjölnir.The rest of the movie is a cautionary tale of letting one's arrogance and bravado overtake compassion and decency. Thor is tossed to Earth (Midgard) because his father doesn't believe he is fit to wield such power while being a colossal brat. Jane Foster helps him realize what a brat he truly is, and rah rah rah, all is well. Hawkeye also makes a short appearance as an operative of S. H. I. E. L. D., like Black Widow in Iron Man 2.I think it's not an uncommon experience for someone to be told their entire life that they are perfect, and will use those skills when they're older. However, that can lead to a big head, and a very black and white outlook on what is right and wrong. The literal translation is a form of racism dumbed down to good vs evil.As usual, the good guys are good looking humans, and the bad guys are dark blue skinned creatures, not as good looking of course. Loki, Thor's brother, living in his brother's shadow, goes rogue when learning of his own connection to the ""bad guys"" even though he can change his form between the two races. This sets Loki against Thor because of this ""us vs them"" mentality and we see this rivalry continue throughout the entire movie series for the next decade.One more origin story to go folks, then we get to the Shawarma! Thor's Stan Lee cameo involved him using a truck to try and drag Mjölnir out of its landing point. I love looking for these cameos as I review these films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I would say this is awesome and definitely watch movie.....There is pleasure to be plundered from some of the battle scenes, especially when Thor is confronting ice monsters with blood-red eyes, and from the culture clash that resounds when he descends to present-day Earth. .Another marvelous adventure.Nicely combines visual splendor and an earthly fish-out-of-water tale with director Kenneth Branagh bringing a Shakespearean flair to the proceedings.Give it a try you will like it. Total entertainer",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just plain bad,"This movie is just plain bad. Yes, I know people say it's ironic and fun and just a dumb summer movie -- but compared to Iron Man or X-men or the Batman movies this is pure junk. The 3-d was horrible too. On the plus side,Thor has an interesting mythology, and it's nice to escape the trap of the wealthy bachelor/superhero protagonists we've seen so much of lately. Also, it's filled with good British actors (the Americans didn't do so well). But to be honest this movie had no soul. It was flat, boring, and not nearly as well executed as others in the genre. This is the kind of movie they release early because they know that if they put it out in the summer it would be crushed.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Stuffed with unfunny crap,"Anthony Hopkins' weird performance is just off and even gives an impression of mockery towards a childish script. And if so he is right. Stuffed with badly delivered, meaningless dialog and unfunny crap and with a general lack of any kind of intensity Thor is not to save. Not like the TV cast, logopedic case Chris Hemsworth or action-unknown director Kenneth Branagh ever had a fair chance of doing so. Thor is an alibi for a movie, existing only to set up a supporting character for another flick, not a lead one. It's not even an investment, it's just a supporting part of a business model. It was never meant to fully satisfy and so it does not. Just ask the accounting at Disney for further explanation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Impressed,"There have been so many superhero flixs churned out of the Hollywood factory this past decade. So much so that it has made my head spin.I have high expectations when it comes to superhero movies. While they rely heavily on special effects, I also expect a great storyline and a believability factor to go along with it as well. With that said, few superhero films over the past decade have lived up to my expectations. While most films have nailed the special effects criteria, they just can't seem to get the plot thing down so well. The Dark Knight was by far the best of the bunch and I did enjoy the X-Men trilogy, but felt the Wolverine spin-off fell short. Unlike most other people I didn't really care for the highly successful Iron Man and Spider Man franchises. They made Robert Downey , Jr's character Tony Stark in Iron Man overly comical and Spider Man was too slow throughout the series. Both Hulk movies, Batman Returns, Superman Returns, Electra, Daredevil, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Fantastic Four were all major disappointments. I could add more recent superhero films to the list, but you get the point. It shouldn't be a surprise to tell you that, as with other superhero movies to grace the big screen this past year (Captain America, Green Lantern, The Green Hornet), I had no interest whatsoever in seeing Thor. The only reason I did see it was because my best friend rented it and pretty much forced me to watch it. I'm glad he did.This was a surprisingly entertaining movie with some interesting plot twists. The war scene that kicks off the movie is a little too dark so it's hard to make out what's going on, but that soon changes once we get into the meat of the storyline.What can you say about Anthony Hopkins? He's a great actor and gives nothing less than a great performance here as Odin, king and God of Asgard. He's also the father of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), although we learn things are not as they originally appear with this family.The best part about this movie is it has a believability factor to it. The characters are well developed and the overall plot works well. I would have given this film a higher rating but there were a few elements to the story that were confusing or just stupid. The fact that we didn't see Hemsworth shirtless more throughout the film is one of them. With a body like that you don't need dialogue!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was a good film,"I seen this film yesterday with my boyfriend and we did enjoy it.There was certain things that made you think ""yeah right you would act like that"" kind of thing but it was enjoyable.The graphics where really nice, it seems like they spent a lot of time on it so it was pleasing to watch.The only thing I did not like was the love story, it just seemed kind of forced and not necessary. I also wish in some ways their was more action it, especially from the gate keeper as he seemed really powerful yet we barely seen any of his powers.Overall I give it 7/10, it is a good film and I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
review,"So I gave Thor a try hearing that it was good. First, let me say that I am a big Natalie Portman fan so I definitely went into this with a bit of a bias. The movie opens up with a ""comet"" striking the earth as Portman and her crew investigate its origin.This is when we are lead to the mythology that is Thor: Thor is a story about two different planets at war one with one another. When the king of the planet, Anthony Hopkins won the war, he temporarily blocked the other planet from being able to enter into the first planet.He has two children, one of them being Thor. Now we come to know that Thor is very hot headed and is always in need to fight. This lead to the ordination of Thor, which was interrupted by an infiltration by Froze. Thor, in his anger, decides to go against his father and convinced his brother along with his four soldiers to go to Froze planet and destroy them all.After destroying an army of froze and going back to their own planet, Thor is met by his own father, who in his anger due to the fact that Thor has possibly cause a future war, cast Thor, along with his powerful hammer, into earth where he loses all his power.Her, Thor meets Natalie who is in search of a new galaxy system and finds Thor to be part of her future discovery. She and her sister decides to help Thor, despite their undeniable confusion towards his actions and behaviors. As the story progresses, you see Natalie and Thor increasingly being attracted to one another.To his dismay, Thor realizes that he no longer has power to weird the hammer.During these incidents, his brother found out his true origin as a froze and now plans to overthrow his father to become king. Subsequently, he is reunited with his four fellow soldiers as they fend off the robot sent by their ""new king/brother"" who overtook the throne with force. After regaining his power, Thor decides to travel back to his planet to confront his brother. Now let me beginning with one of the strongest points of the movie: Cinematographer. From the get go you see that the director has an eye for iconic scenes, from the settings of Thor's planet to the contrast he makes between earth and Thor's planet. There were one particular scene that highlights Thor's power with his Hammer that is reminiscent of Peter Jackson's helms deep sequence. The director's use of galactic and astronomical imagery improves the movie's grandeur and epic quality. Backdrops of Thor's planet are nothing sort of breathtaking and reminds you of Lucas' Galactic sequences.Now, I'm a big believer in that if the special effects does not enhance the story, it should not be used. And to that I think the director did a good job, I felt as if every sequence involving the special effects were used for character development and storytelling purposes as opposed to it be just a show up, which many big budget blockbuster tends to utilize now a days. For example, the action sequences during Froze planet was a foundation for one of the biggest plot points of the movie as it precedes Thor's excommunication. It also serves to give the audience a sense of Thor's tremendous power with his hammer. I find the storytelling aspect of this movie extremely engaging, The parallel story lines between Thor's planets and that of earth adds to the complexity of Thor's character. It highlight's Thor's humanity as he loses his near invincible power. I think Christ hems worth did a great job with Thor, from his bulky, Viking-is behavior, He is able to portray a character that seems fish out of the water most of the time, yet is still humane enough for the audience to care about. there are sequences when he bulks around, or ask for a horse at a pet store, that evoke both hilarity and innocence and becomes great contrasting sequences between Thor' then versus Thor on present day earth. I think Natalie port man plays an impeccable role as the astronomer. She truly cares about what she does and you see how upset she gets when her work is questioned. Her work takes priority and the sense of urgency she has towards it's significance gives her character the appropriate intensity when alongside with Thor. There is a scene where her and Thor got intimate that highlights the thorough character development that adds a much needed human touch to the galactic nature of the film.Overall, I think along with the cinematographer, the story telling aspect of this movie is what makes it for me. The myth of Thor is fleshed out in the beginning of the movie that adds to the intense conflicts Thor eventually faces on earth. Throughout the various sequences, the Thor myth becomes more and more believable as the characters begin to show their strengths and weaknesses and who they are in the context of both their planet and their presence on earth. The hammer also plays an important part in establishing Thor's tremendous power.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Magic and Mayhem in the Mighty Marvel comics tradition,"Blockbuster season thunders in with ""THOR"", the marvel studios live action comic book adaptation based on Norse Mythology. In a sprawling tale of Gods and Monsters, Marvel studio crafts a realistically human story in the vein of the critically acclaimed ""Iron Man"".Stripping away years of convoluted continuity and multiple interpretations, the creative team has combined the best of Thor's comic book incarnations to deliver a film that is both easily accessible to the casual watcher and pleasing to the hardcore comic fan. The only ones it might not please are die hard purists of Norse Mythology, for this is not their noble Viking God of thunder. Marvel's Thor is a proud pompous muscle man with a chip on his shoulder. In his eagerness to prove his might, he shattered a truce between his home realm of Asgard and the dreaded Frost Giants. For his actions, Thor is banished to earth in hopes that his exile would teach him humility and the value of life. Lo and behold, it is revealed that this turn of events was just the first step in a grand scheme by Thor's brother Loki, whose hidden agenda and ambiguous allegiance fuels much of the plot's intrigue. On earth, Thor is found and befriended by Jane Foster and her science team while his hammer, Mjolnir ends up in the possession of the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. In order to return to Asgard, and before he can retrieve his hammer, Thor must first prove himself worthy of his power.Melding magic and science fiction with comedy and drama, the movie's first strength is in its narrative. It has spectacular special effects but never relies solely on that. Behind the top notch computer graphics beats a story about pride before the fall, about themes as basic as sibling jealousy and about some very human ""Gods"". Although blessed with skill and power, Thor, Sif, Loki and The Warriors three never act like immortal deities. They are like Childhood friends, like regular people. They get angry, they laugh, they squabble and they each have their own little quirks that make them memorable. If not for the computer generated scenery and stylish costumes, one would easily forget that these are mythological gods. Though it might seem a bit rushed at points and slow at others, the many plot threads are easy to follow and tie up nicely by the end.Thanks to a top notch cast, the acting is spot on though Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins (the two more well known stars) seem under utilized as Jane Foster and Odin respectively. The highlight is definitely Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki like an actor playing an actor. You never know if Loki's words are truth or more trickery for all the world is Loki's stage and every of his acts is a performance to advance some scheme.The sharper ones in the audience would no doubt notice similarities between the Thor and Iron Man movies. Both feature a protagonist who is full of himself until he gets taught a lesson, humbles down and decides to fight for the good of humankind, both protagonists have issues with their father, both encounter a threat from within their own ranks and both face off against giant machines in a climatic final battle. Thankfully these similarities are only fleeting. Both Thor and Iron Man also benefit from a good deal of well written humor which in Thor's case involves the banished deity trying to adapt to human life. Much hilarity ensues.Humour aside, the most important factor for a summer blockbuster is good action. In that regard, Thor delivers with wild abandon complemented by a remarkably glorious soundtrack by Patrick Doyle. Doyle is no stranger to modern magical mythology movies, having scored the likes of Eragon and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Like the music, the film embraces its over-the-top comic book roots, as seen in the amazing production design and costumes. But while the action is big and poised to satisfy the adrenaline craving summer blockbuster crowd, director Kenneth Branagh seems to have become enamored with the ""Michael Bay School of Camera-work"". Tight close ups and shaky-cam neuter the otherwise epic battles. Action scenes like the flashback of Odin's war, or Thor and his friends' fighting their way through a Frost giant ambush, all lack a sense of scale and scope. Couple that with an ending that feels too abrupt and one gets the feeling that this is not the best that a ""Thor"" movie could have been, that Marvel is holding out on the audience, saving the best for later.Will lightning strike the same spot twice? Will marvel pull off another blockbuster as successful as Iron Man? If the abrupt conclusion of Thor is anything to go by, Marvel seems more interested in generating publicity for their 2012 ""Avengers"" movie. And that is exactly what this movie feels like, a set up for something bigger on the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Superhero Adaption!,"This film was quite surprising, i wanted to see the film but the trailers did not make is seem anything spectacular but after seeing this film i can safely say it was Spectacular!. Another great adaption of a marvel comic hero. The film starts of interesting and delivers right through, the actors who played there roles did a superb job esp Chris Hemsworth as Thor & Natalie Portman's role.. We follow Thor's journey to return to his kingdom and prove he is worthy after his selfish ways that left him on earth, he finds a different world he did not know and this develops him into a loyal hero. The action throughout the film was great with some great effects and CGI, it delivered some great comedy (notably the coffe scene). It was left open ended and left audiences wanting more to see what happens next.. there is also a after credit scene that again leaves unanswered questions which should be answered in the next film. Overall a excellent movie and a great addition to the marvel superhero franchise. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mythical Marvel journey,"""Thor,"" directed by Kenneth Branagh, is a visually stunning entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that brings the Norse god of thunder to the big screen. Starring Chris Hemsworth as the titular hero, the film blends elements of mythology, action, and a touch of romance.Hemsworth delivers a charismatic performance as Thor, capturing both his arrogance and his eventual humility. The film's supporting cast, including Natalie Portman as the curious scientist Jane Foster and Tom Hiddleston as the enigmatic Loki, adds depth to the story with their strong performances.The film excels in its depiction of Asgard, with breathtaking visuals and impressive special effects that bring the mythical realm to life. However, the narrative feels somewhat uneven, shifting from the grandeur of Asgard to the more mundane setting of a small town on Earth, which can sometimes disrupt the film's pacing.Overall, ""Thor"" is an entertaining introduction to the character, offering a mix of humor, action, and mythology. While it may not reach the heights of other Marvel films, it sets the stage for Thor's evolution in the MCU.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Pride comes before a fall,"After Marvel Studios had great success in bringing Iron Man, a character perceived to be only popular in the comics, to the big screen, they began working on other solo hero projects with the overall aim to produce The Avengers; the first time a movie would be made using multiple characters from individual movies to share one universeThor is another one of Marvel's lesser-known characters outside the comic-books, compared to the likes of Spider-Man and Wolverine. Based loosely on the Norse legends, which are referenced in the movie as being inspired by the fictional Asgardian race, which is a nice bit of confusing 'chicken and the egg' theorem. Thor lives in Asgard with his father, Odin and brother, Loki, and acts as protectors of the nine realms across more insidious races such as the Frost Giants, but when the fragile truce between the Asgardians and Frost Giants of Jotunheim is threatened by Thor's strong-minded techniques, the Asgardian prince is banished to Midgard, better known to me and you as Earth.I was unsure whether I would like the Norse mythology aspects to the story, but the film manages to make it seem convincing by portraying the Asgardians as otherworldly gods that inhabit another 'realm' as opposed to being spiritual. The mixture of magic and technology that is showcased in the frankly stunning CGI city of Asgard helps us identify with the characters and grounds them nicely into our world, explaining that the more primitive humans in the past had to explain their technology away as being Gods, which created our myths and legends.The action scenes were very entertaining, and there was a healthy sense of humour to the proceedings too, which made the film very enjoyable. The 'fish out of water' scenes with Thor on Earth were handled well, but it was the sequences on Asgard that were the most visually and dramatically stunning. While I understand that the film needed to be set on Earth to both help the audience identify with the storyline, and secondly set up the forthcoming Avengers film, I do wish there had been more sequences in the fantastical Asgardian worlds. Perhaps a sequel would explore this area more, since it is something seldom shown in comic-book movies, which are so determined to set things in 'our universe'.The cast is really strong, with great performances from Chris Hemsworth (Thor) who manages to start the film as brash and impatient, but evolves into a charming and thoughtful character. I also liked the calculating and sly Loki, played by Tom Middleston, who is so subtle in his performance that those watching the film unaware of the characters histories would not expect him to change allegiances throughout the movie. He also plays Loki much more complicated than I would have expected.As a relatively novice to Thor (but not to comics), I really enjoyed this and found that it didn't require any prior knowledge from the comics, as it explained all of the characters well, and their relationship with each other. The robotic villain known as The Destroyer was actually quite threatening, despite looking too similar to Iron Man (something that is poked fun at in the dialogue, when The Destroyer first appears) and the Ice Giants didn't look quite as visually interesting as they could have been, so for any sequels, I would appreciate more varied designs for the enemies drawing on the fantastical elements of Thor's mythology once more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Made for RIfftrax!,"This movie pretty much sums up everything I hate about Hollywood movies. After 30 minutes of watching I still have almost no feel for the characters but rather have sat through tons of boring over the top CGI action scenes that are devoid of any tension because I don't give a damn about the characters. This is one of the most cliché ""someone from a different time/world/realm comes to modern day earth"" movies I have seen and to make matters worse they (the film-makers) insist that it's funny!

Genius,"Asgard is a city of Great Gods. Finally, a truce has been concluded between the Asgardians and the Frosts. But... careless (?) Thor, on the day of ascension to the throne, tries to deal with the deceiver brother Loki. The war is unleashed again. And as punishment, Thor is exiled by his father to Earth. Deprived of his hammer and divinity, he is forced to solve the difficult task of how to regain his honor and throne.The film makes a very pleasant impression. Smooth and even. With a powerful atmosphere and visual component. Each frame is drawn in detail. And each city has its own individual atmosphere, which is not just felt, it penetrates into the soul. Especially Asgard, truly the city of the gods. The film pays special attention to the action and the actual battles. It's been a long time since there have been such. Having its own handwriting, the film looks elegant with its special effects in a special way. However, the movie is converted from 2D to 3D, which is not good. But the 2D video, being professionally designed, makes the film easy to lift in terms of visualization.The quality of the script and the plot also looks very good. Of course, it was not possible to avoid the template, but we also live a template life. Do not forget that we are talking about the Scandinavian gods. The Greek ones have already been on the screen (""Battle of the Titans"" and ""Percy Jackson"") but there is something special here.

Review,"A truly excellent film, accompanied by a powerful story. Hugely entertaining comic-book adventure that delivers pretty much everything you could want from a Thor movie, thanks to an outstanding script, note-flawless direction from Kenneth Branagh, a tremendous supporting cast and a charismatic, star-making central performance from Chris Hemsworth. The special effects are extraordinary and seemed extensively real. In addition, the fight scenes are nicely handled and the visual effects are impressive, especially in the Halls of Asgard. That said, while the post-production 3D has come out well unlike Clash of the Titans.What was even more interesting was too see how the god's transformation from being an immortal into a mortal didn't change the person who he was. The movie itself was entertaining with nice comedy and action. The actors did a good job in portraying the actors as truly as possible. Kenneth Branagh did in amazing job in directing the film's plot. The character change of Thor was interesting. All together, the film amazed me and left me breathless. In short, Thor is a huge amount of fun and is easily the best superhero movie. Worth Watching!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Thor = a poor film, which became an agonising chore to watch and ends being a complete bore.","WARNING: VOAF (Very Overrated Audience Film) has struck cinema in the form of Thor with a over-bloated 7.9 IMDb rating in what has been described as an ""epic"" superhero film. The only epic thing about Thor is what a bore it was and where I felt myself drifting towards sleep halfway through. Seriously looking on here I shook my head with disbelief at the statistical ratings of nearly 40 per cent of ten out of ten and written reviews of a no less given rating of four (apart from one reviewer). The thing is I have to be honest with how I felt about this movie. I won't go into the plot really because other people on here have already given a synopsis and I can't be asked to waste my time writing one. Sufficed to say the story is very simplistic with no real twists and has all the usual clichés of the ""bad brother"" and the ""damsel in distress"" falling for the ""hero."" But hey this is not really much of a criticism as there are plenty of films out there that follow the same formula, but at least they were enjoyable like Spiderman or the Batman films, the old or new ones.What I will say that I did enjoy with this film, which stopped me giving this a turkey and ultimately becoming as worse as the truly dreadful I Am Number Four is the special effects, which I have to say were quite impressive. Some of the scenery was breathtaking, the 3D in certain scenes was well implemented and Anthony Hopkins gave a great performance. However these small positives are drowned into oblivion by the scale of terrible things about Thor.First off the rest of the performances are terrible across the board. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was ridiculously bad and just sounded like he wanted to be elsewhere. He might look the part in costume but he cannot act and didn't convince me for a second as the hero. This wasn't helped by the script, which made his character stupid (at first) but then he supposedly redeems himself. But for me he was just annoying as you don't come to care about him or any of the other characters. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki carried no weight as the villain as he just sounded so dull and my Natalie Portman! She seems to have lost her brain since her extraordinary performance in Black Swan. She gives the most cringe-worthy and wooden performance out of the whole cast. She laughs like a hyena and smiles like a retarded idiot and I just wanted to slap her as she goes all luvy dubby eyed over Thor (what does she see in him!? There is no romantic chemistry between her and him whatsoever). All the other cast are just as bad in under-performing and again wishing like they were somewhere else and who could blame them with such a bad script.It carried no emotional weight or substance and was just dry and repetitive. All the characters are essentially cardboard cut outs with no depth (though some of the reviewers say there is!) so I didn't care about them. When Thor in one scene is supposedly killed, I kept wishing it would come true but it dosen't. There is very little action and even when there is the Michael Bay trait appears with you hardly being able to see what is happening because the camera is so close up with lack of continuity editing. Furthermore the 3D itself though impressively implemented in a few scenes was mostly bad. I could actually at certain points take off my 3D glasses and see where it was in 2D as there was no distorted image. It's as though Kenneth Branagh the director decided after a while he couldn't be asked to properly implement the entire film in 3D and thought ""well the audience won't notice."" Well he hasn't fooled me. If he thinks audiences are that gullible in that respect when it comes to poor 3D he's wrong. What makes me laugh though is that he in an interview said he added the comedy moments to make sure audiences didn't take the film seriously, but the comedy wasn't funny and the whole film literally had the tone of trying to be serious, which I think is part of it's big downfall for me. The scene where you think Thor dies and there is sad music is just for me sickeningly insincere. (A similar scene to one in I Am Number Four).When it comes down to it is that Thor is just another Hollywood glossy movie that pitches itself as delivering everything (but for most audience viewers it has) but really delivers nothing. Hollywood has duped us all and they should be ashamed of themselves. If you want to waste £7.80 or more if you see it in the evening or weekend on this travesty of a film, don't say I didn't warn you. You watch it as your own peril. The only saving grace surely for how awful this film is will be bought to light by the film critics when reviewed this Friday, which will hopefully help counterbalance the very overrated opinions of Thor from audience reviewers on here.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Amazing Film,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with either action, emotion, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape for two hours like maybe Clash of the Titans. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this amazing film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike certain CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I've seen in years if not ever.

Brilliant Legend in a Long Time!,"It was a chance to watch another movie in 3D and what better choice than a legend action ""Thor"". It was not disappointing at all, in fact I loved the cinematography of the stars, galaxies, kingdoms and simple action. This for me was the winner and oh yes the very sexy Chris Hemsworth! He is so young but perfect as Thor and Anthony Hopkins as his father was good too. I am only wondering how he wore the full armor and delivered the lines, he must be real fit at this age. Natalie Portman was a delight and when she kissed him, well girl way to go! It was a brilliant legend from Marvel Comics and nicely done on big screen, I am looking forward to the next one.

Wasn't great but it wasn't bad,"Went to see Thor because the trailers made it look interesting. I will start with the look of the film which really was very good. The Asgardian planet was impressive and the effects were mostly believable (except for one particular scene on a bridge). The beginning sequence offered a lot of promise as it was pretty quick to get going and quick to set up the concept and the characters place in the story. Maybe it was too quick because the rest of the film seemed to take that quickness lead much to the detriment of the last portion of the film. I have to say the dialog was snappy and the humor was not over the top or silly. What turned out to look silly were some of the more dramatic parts; the dialog there failed in a lot of the most important scenes. Also I agree with a lot of the critics that Thor's transformation into egoless, humble guy was way too quick. Again this speaks to the rush the movie was in to get to the next fight scene or special effect. All in all it was worth seeing once but not multiple times. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Those who did not know Thor now know him,"Marvel does it again with another A-quality screen interpretation of the comic book hero The Mighty Thor. The heart-stopping action, the dark family drama and the well-placed humor were all perfectly realized on screen by Shakespearian director Kenneth Branagh. I wonder why the DC people could not do the same with their similarly iconic superheroes. (Really, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern,? Please! But I digress.)It is amazing that the two main characters Thor and Loki were played by new actors who were unknown to me. Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast as the cocky Nordic thunder god. Not only does he look the part physically, the way he acted out his character's arc is well-done and worthy of audience empathy. It was not forced nor corny. Tom Hiddleston also convincingly plays out his character Loki with the unpredictability this god was known for. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin by ear, as he is well-known for. Natalie Portman, fresh from her Oscar for Best Actress, looks as beautiful as her character requires. It was also exciting to see a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton (""Hawkeye"") with his bow and arrow!The story is solid. Those of us who did not know Thor now know him and care what happens to him. The fight scenes were very exciting. The special effects were very good for the most part. For negatives, I did not really like how fake Asgard looked and I did not like the metallic robot used to attack the earth. The costumes on Asgard also reminded me too much of various Bozanian bad guys from the old Voltes V cartoons. There were some inconsistencies about how Bifrost tele-porter works. Overall though, this was excellent and the first real big action blockbuster of this summer. I did not even watch the 3D version.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Modern Day Nordic Tale?,"THOR was a thrill-ride for me. I left the theater drawing comparisons with Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Superman, Terminator (a reversed version), 13th Warrior, and Lord of the Rings, as well as the story of Jesus Christ. It's definitely a stylized version of Nordic/Norse Viking mythology.Sounds strange huh? Let me tell you this: Kenneth Branagh pulls it off, being the brilliant director that he is.I was expecting another Hollywood action flick with some macho guy raising hell and no substance. I was only half right.Let's recap the story: Before he becomes king, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is banished from his home in the fantasy world of Asgard for his acts of arrogance in directly confronting and causing the deaths several members of the Frost Giant army, who are the enemy.Thor is stripped of his superpowers by his father and is transported through a wormhole to earth. Much of the comic side of the movie comes from Thor's portrayal as an average person who still thinks he has superpowers (is subdued by a vaccination). Another point of humor is his adjustment to things on earth (he walks into a pet store asking for a horse).Thor's exile is so difficult on his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) that he goes into a coma. While in this state his son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assumes control of the throne, making choices that neither his brother or father would agree with and exerting his revenge for being the 2nd best child all his life. Loki is committed to exterminating the Frost Giant race, even though they have been at peace for some time.While on earth Thor's attitude changes as he comes to care for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a researcher of galaxies from beyond, who he meets when transported to earth. As their relationship develops and Thor finds a way to get back to Asgard, he has to make a tough choice as it relates to seeing Jane again.Before going back to Asgard, Thor must defeat ""The Destroyer"", a large robot-like being, that looks impenetrable.The ending works for the movie and the events that lead us there are credible. They even leave it open for a sequel, but you have to stay after the credits.So what are my thoughts on the film? Some of the CGI used in the movie is a little hokey, but I say overall it was well done.It was obvious that Thor's body was, shall we say, ""fabricated""? The costumes were first-rate, very cool.Loved the use of wormholes to transport to other worlds.The visuals were brilliant and we could feel the characters being transported through. Also noteworthy visuals: the weather disturbance/storm at the very beginning of the movie and the destruction scene towards the end. Definitely big-budget there The fight scenes were amazing, some of the best I've ever seen. How Thor's army goes up against the Frost Giants is dazzling and the ice that grows from the arms of the enemy used as attack-weapons was also eye-popping.Best acting performance is given by Tom Hiddleston/Loki, as we see the torment he experiences finding out his true identity and displaying a good deal of rage over that and his jealousy towards his brother Thor.There were a few lulls/slow spots during the first half of the movie.To summarize I enjoyed THOR more than I thought I would going in, but I also expected that since friends who's opinions I valued said it was a very good film. I vacillated between 7 and 8 stars, so I give THOR: 7.5 out of 10 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Really good film, very enjoyable and much better than some reviews suggested","Im not going to go in depth here, want to keep it simple. I really enjoyed the film, didn't know the history of Marvels Thor in any great detail but enjoyed his story and the universe it was set in.The guy playing the lead was very good and main supporting cast were excellent too. Given that some of the reviews had described the film as average I think they have done Branagh a great disservice as I thought the film was very well directed. Marvel fans will enjoy, I think Thor fans will really enjoy it and the fans who just like superhero fans will be varied as Thor isn't your typical marvel superhero.Special effects were very good and Asgard was very well realised and visually interesting. Liked Hopkins as Odin but Rene Russo was not used enough. Really looking forward to the avengers now and I hope there is also a sequel to Thor and Branagh directs again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dutch Angles Galore,"""Thor"" is what you'd expect from the line of Phase One films of the MCU: a little aura of awkwardness surrounding it as Marvel attempts to find its footing. I do think that by this point, the pieces had fallen in place and there's a lot better Marvel style humor imbued, which we come to expect nowadays.The main problem with this movie is its pacing. It kind of drags a little bit. The villains, the frost giants, don't really get a whole lot of room to do true bad guy stuff. The realms of Earth and Asgard never seem to be in that much of a threat from them. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is a dislikable enough character here, but his mischief isn't given its full room to shine until later films.Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Hopkins are all very good in this movie. The special effects are also very good. Another small gripe from me is the serious overuse of the Dutch angle from a cinematographic perspective. It's very repetitive.A pretty good film that is on par with the rest of Phase One; not terrible but nothing special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Immensely enjoyable,"I was interested in seeing this ever since it came out. After finally seeing it I am so glad I did. It is a visually stunning film with excellent cinematography and editing and the costumes, settings and effects look wonderful. There may be the odd longueur in the plot, with a little too much of admiring the scenery, but most of it is amusing and while not sticking true to the original source material there are a lot of nods to it. Kenneth Branagh directs superbly, the action is earth-shattering and the script is filled with witty fish-out-of-water moments. The acting is fine with Chris Hemsworth giving his all in the role, Anthony Hopkins bringing some welcome gravitas to Odin rather than hamming up, Natalie Portman more than a pretty face and Tom Hiddleston's Loki a villain worth watching for. All in all, an immensely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good fun,"I have to admit I went in with high expectations hoping for better movie than all the recent marvel releases so far. As a superhero movie it was great, with lots of subtle little comic references. Though it did make Thor seem a little overpowered compared to the other heroes. In fact he is such in good shape that I he seems to make captain America redundant.To my surprise there wasn't much action at all, but Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins give spectacular performances that keep the suspense going. I thought this superhero movie especially appeals to those who are always complaining that superhero movies always end the same, guy gets girl and beats bad guy(thor is little different).The only bad segment in my head was the involvement of Natalie Portman, aside from the fact that she can't act, Thor and Jane bonding felt a little too rushed. It would have been better to either give them more time or just have a general ""falling in love with people concept"" to replace it.Overall its a fun movie, that I would probably recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"While ""The Avengers"" was a winner, ""Thor"" really doesn't work.","The only reason I watched this film is because I'm going to see The Avengers soon and I've seen all the others, although they range from decent to average. I was already not a fan of anything about this film so I had low expectations and it pretty much met them. I'm not a fan of Kenneth Branagh in whatever he does so Thor was pretty typical of him. The emotional cores of the film are intended to be the father/son, brother/brother and Thor/Natalie Portman relationships, but none of them were convincing as they weren't set up properly, nor did they have any genuine chemistry, as a poor attempt to base them on Shakespearean foundations.Loki is a ridiculous villain, he wasn't evil nor threatening, and I immediately hated the character of Thor. Every character is paper-thin and charmless, I had lots of eye-rolling moments. Especially as they set up the realm of Asgard to be a sincere and the Earth scenes to have lighter comedy, the contrast only seeming sloppy and cheap, as they repeat the same jokes four times in a row hoping to get one laugh. There's no tension or excitement, as the unlikeable Thor battles faceless obstacles, it's no better than a Steven Seagal movie but made PG-13. The other Avenger films had something redeeming about them, but I'll see how the big film is on the big screen. I don't expect something spectacular, but at least worthwhile.3/10Update: I saw The Avengers and it was spectacular. I am pleased.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

there is no acting required here,"According to the trivia page, Anthony Hopkins said this when he saw himself and Thor in their costumes. And he nailed it.This film is nothing but a parade of special effects. The world the producers created is fantastic, but that's just about the only advantage of this film. I love great special effects, but there just needs to be more to a film than that. And Thor fails on every other level.The story is almost ""by the book"" - an arrogant young prince causes mischief, he is banished from home, learns his lesson and regains his powers. That's it. There's a bit of a romance thrown in, but I couldn't feel any chemistry between the main characters.The acting is not present - I mean, why even bother acting when the characters are just stereotypes and say the most cliché things you can imagine? Speeches about great deeds, warrior's way of life and death, great battles, it was all supposed to be epic, but to me it was just annoying.It's nothing more than a popcorn flick. Then again, it never intended to be anything else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thunderously entertaining and heartwarming.,"The big bad boy of Asgard swings a mighty force of reckoning in cinema with the release of Thor, based on the Marvel comic character of the same name. With so many great performances from the Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston, and of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor is thundering with acting and suspense.I can't tell you how much I like this film. There are so many parallels to religious and even familiar territory that's covered in another well-known Superhero flick such as Superman. The beginning of the film is somewhat similar to that of Superman. But whilst the Man of Steel is an alien, Thor, on the other hand, is the son of an Norse god. That's where the similarities end for Thor is set in a mystical and real world with it's own characters and dangers that Thor comes into conflict and contact with.I can't say that I'm familiar with Norse mythology. I'm quite certain that this film takes several liberties from it's mythical background on which it's based. But that alone should not deter anyone from seeing this film and Thor is a worthy addition to an already stellar lineup of films based on Marvel's comic properties; namely that of Spider-Man, X-Men, and Iron Man on which Thor is rightly on par with.Speaking of Norse mythology, I can't quite understand why some are in uproar of the casting of Idris Elba as Heimdall. Even though I'm not familiar with the comic, or Norse mythology, I do know that Heimdall is a Norse god who is white. In my mind, Idris Elba does a wonderful job in his portrayal of one of Thor's most trusted allies. Similarly, this dates back to Daredevil(another film based on the Marvel character) when Michael Clark Duncan was chosen to play the Kingpin, whose background was that of Anglo-European descent. I have no qualms over who portrays these characters as long as they deliver the goods, but overall, Elba did a great job and in that regard, Heimdall is a force to be reckoned with.Natalie Portman has been quite busy this year; what with her recent outstanding performance in Black Swan, she adds another dimension of charm and love as Thor's love interest. Essentially the ""Lois Lane"" of Thor, she is the only human companion our fabled hero has. As hard as it was for Thor to adjust to the daily conumdrums of our world, she's there to help him alleviate some of the muck he has to wade through. I couldn't think of anyone else for the role other than Portman. She's simply great. But it is Tom Hiddleston who really steals the show as Loki, the bad boy of Asgard. Like Heath Ledger's Joker, Hiddleston will no doubt be talked about among comic fans and moviegoers alike with his sinister personality and brash arrogance towards Thor and their conflicts with each other are just....thundering.With all this added up, Thor is simply one of the best comic-book movies of this year. They(Marvel) took another obscure superhero and turned him into a force to be reckoned with at the box-office. See it on Imax to get the full effect of this smash hit. No doubt you will leave the theater with a thunderous smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor was more electrifying than I thought it would be.,"I saw this film when it first came out in 2011 at the theater. Back then I thought it was a rather good origin story and I still believe that. This film is another in a string of films that led to the Avengers that would come out the following year. This one would introduce us to Marvel's Thor, the Asgardian who is the god of thunder and wielder of the mighty hammer. It would also introduce us to the villain Loki, the master of deceit and trickster. Like Iron Man 2, we would also get another hero in Hawkeye; however, unlike the Black Widow's rather substantial role in Iron Man 2 where she even got a battle scene, Hawkeye is in the film only momentarily and we never get to see him do his thing. The film is an origin story which pretty much has to clue us in to the background, but it does deliver a good action scene fairly soon, though the middle of the film really does not have much in the way of Thor action going on. At this point Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 had been released and I have to say I enjoyed all three a bit more than this one. Granted, The Incredible Hulk just about does not even fit in anymore thanks to Norton declining the role further.The story has a group of scientist led by Jane played by Natalie Portman trying to determine what is exactly going on with the sky. There is an event and they end up hitting a man in the midst of it. Then the film flashes back as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) tells his two sons Thor and Loki of the realms and how the Asgardians came to the aide of Earth as they battled the Frost Giants. Years later, Thor is about to become king; however, the celebration is ruined when some Frost Giants enter the castle. Enraged, Thor goes behind his father back to the realm of the Frost Giants and picks a fight. Odin finds out and banishes his son to Earth, stripped of his powers and this is where he is hit by Jane and her crew. The hammer also is sent to Earth and a lot of people try to move it and make a game of it before S.H.I.E.L.D shows up and sets a perimeter. Thor tries to reclaim his hammer, but finds out he is now unable to lift it. Loki, meanwhile learns of his origin and assumes the throne when Odin falls into Odinsleep. He then devises a plan to take out his brother so that he may never return to Asgard.The cast is rather good as Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor and Tom Hiddleston is even better as Loki. His character is good too, as you just never know what he is thinking as his motivations are not cut and dry. Natalie Portman just seems a bit out of place in this world of superheros though. She does alright, but I thought the girl who played Darcy was a lot cuter and had more spunk. Anthony Hopkins is good, but he generally is even when he is in a really bad movie.So, this film was good and a good introduction to the character of Thor and his realm. Could have used a bit more action, but they always seem to cap the action a bit too much in comic book movies always relying on a romantic subplot to pad the film a bit. Mad Max: Fury Road is an excellent example of a film that did not slow the film down to have a bunch of scenes of looking into each others eyes and such. I would have also liked to have seen Hawkeye do something other than draw his bow back, he has not really shined as much as others in this series seeming to be just a good archer. He has a few more skills than just that. Granted, the only real target here was Thor so I guess they could not have him put an arrow through the hero of the film's head. Overall, it was good, but I thought the sequel was better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Average hero journey,"The bad things about this movie are the diversity of hires and the average story.The bad written/ bad editing of the film is compensated by the newcomers Loki (Tom Hiddlestone), and Chris Hemsworth; who was born to be a comedian; and also Anthony Hopkins, and one Broke Girl, Natalie Portman does not shine here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It Gets Better Every Time,"It really does get better every time. I can say that because I didn't much care for this movie when I saw it in the theater, but after having seen it for maybe the fourth time over the weekend, I'm now prepared to give this film 9/10 stars. Here's why:The problem with Thor, as a movie, as a comic book, and as a character in general--is that it's Thor. He's at one and the same time a great character that does have a legendary mythical story to his name, and yet the issue is that his story is so removed from the genus of superheroes that are most common and that so many of us are most comfortable with. There's nothing wrong with that, per say, but Batman, Daredevil, Spider-man, Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, etc, etc, all have the advantage that their stories take place in the world we know. Even Superman is set on earth, albeit with an out-of-this-world origin, but the extra-terrestrial origin of Superman or other alien sci-fi heroes is yet a different sort of tale than Thor's.Thor is, literally, a mythical god. He comes from Asgard, and his father is Odin--just like in the Norse myths. That's the first thing that makes him stand out as a character. But then he gets thrust into adventures on earth, and his destiny becomes wrapped up with the earth. Add in the fact that Marvel then constructs a unique origin story so that Thor and his ilk are actually just a race of aliens, but who happen to have magical powers and weaponry that equate to those of the Norse gods, and the final product, in my view, is a jumbled up mess of a storyline.In other words, I have a pre-existing prejudice against Thor. I think he's great as a character in his own right, but when it comes to actually reading his comics, I'm not a big fan. And that distaste carried over into the movie for me the first time I saw it. It was hard for me to get into the Frost Giants storyline, and I felt like the whole Asgard thing was perhaps as well done as it could possibly be, but nevertheless couldn't escape the hokiness of the Thor franchise.But, as I said above, the movie does grow on you the more you watch it, and in my particular case the repetition has warmed my heart to the Thunder God, and more precisely to this film. The truth is that once I got past my prejudices, the film itself is an outstanding addition to Marvel's MCU canon, and I can't really say too much negative about the film. The final showdown with Loki still sort of wreaks of the 1980's ""He-Man"" film a bit for me, but aside from that the movie is a well made, top notch production.Of course, nothing could be as good as that 1960's animated ""Thor"" pilot. Google it. You'll thank me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Myth Lives!,"Based on Marvel comics classic Norse mythology based super hero, the mighty Thor, Marvel studios -Thor aims to bring this larger than life character to the big screen and start this year's super hero summer with a bang.Marvel studio's Thor, directed Kenneth Branagh and written by Zak Penn is the first of several major big screen comic book adaptations slated for a 2011 release and is defiantly one of the most enjoyable superhero themed films currently in existence. The film covers the adapted origin story of the young but arrogant Thor Odinson, the young Asgardian prince whom is trusted with the fabled magical hammer Mjounir. Driven by the legendary stories of his father's great battles against the frost giants, Thor disobeys his father (Odin) and disrupts the peace between the realms of Asgard. Here upon Odin banishes Thor to the mortal world of man where he must redeem himself and find a way to return and save Asgard from his brother Loki's treacherous ways.The film is a very enjoyable ride and is surprisingly funny for a film of the genre. The studio could not have picked a better actor to play Thor' as Chris Hemsworth is utterly convincing in the role. as is Anthony Hopkins who plays an evidently powerful Odin. Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki also delivers an excellent performance as the trickster. Lady Sif and the warriors three add to the entertainment with strong individual performances.The story itself is very enjoyable and has been well adapted for the big screen, not an easy feat considering the source material. This is due in large part to the humour of the script that is woven throughout the story which fortunately makes the material amusing in a way that does not take away from the seriousness of the characters. Director Kenneth Branagh has done a good job at creating the believable family tension amongst the Odinson family and the other characters of the story. As this is a part of the marvel cinematic universe the signs of the greater marvel universe are woven throughout the narrative with S.H.I .E.L.D playing a large role in the progression of the story. As well as other cameos' and references to other Marvel universe forces.As with most current Marvel films there is an additional scene at the end of the credits which hints at the upcoming Avengers film.Overall this film is a very enjoyable film for both those who have read the comics and those who have not. It is a tale of mythological proportions that will hold you interest from start to finish. Its great strength is that it is suitable entertainment for more than one generation.* A Four out of Five *",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.","Marvel's leap into the cosmos started off with a good movie, not great, but still a good movie. The look of Asgard and it's citizens was incredible as it looks well designed, mystic and huge. This movie brought us a great hero that must prove himself to be worthy of his name and a villain that proves to be one of the best in superhero movie history.Chris Hemsworth's Thor is strong, brave, naive and yet still able to change into a better person. I must give credit to Hemsworth for getting into such shape that he totally looks like a Norse warrior god but he wasn't the star of this film. That honor goes to Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hiddleston shows so much emotion in his acting and I actually was rooting for him for most in this movie because all he wanted was for his ""father"", Odin, to look at him as an equal to Thor. Once he discovers the true lineage of himself, Loki becomes even greater as someone who just wants to know where he fits into the world. In the end, he is such a great villain that it is clear that he is going to be around forever because of his instant appeal and success.The appearance of Asgard and it's citizens were incredible and medieval in some way, however, it is a shame that a lot of the movie takes place on Earth, thankfully though, not in a big city. That might of just been for budget constraints but it was possibly just help fortify Thor's journey to humility.The side characters were split for me though. The Asgardians, specifically Volstagg, Odin and Sif, interested me enough, however, the others didn't leave a lasting impression. The Earth characters though were definitely worse. While I did like Coulson and Selvig, Jane and Darcy weren't interesting at all. Jane was just a typical romantic lead where I couldn't see much chemistry between Thor and Jane. Jane's giggling over Thor was pretty infuriating. That and I don't really buy Natalie Portman as a physicist. She's a good actress, but she couldn't persuade me that she was a scientist. And Darcy was nothing but the annoying ""comic relief"".Also, hi Hawkeye, nice to see you there for the 2ish minutes you were on screen.+ Hiddleston and Hemsworth + Asgardian aesthetic + Some of the characters (Coulson, Selvig, Sif, Odin, Volstagg) - Others really didn't match up so well - Would have preferred more time off Earth as it is Marvel's first step into the cosmosFinal Score: 8.1/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you like superhero movies, you won't be thorry you thaw Thor.","Thor has a genetic advantage over many other superheroes. He wasn't bitten by a 'carrier', exposed to radiation or bitten by a radioactive spider (whew they went the full combo on that one!), Thor is a God.Not THE God, just A God. In this case the son of Odin and a resident of the distant citadel of Asgard, who it turns out saved Earth a millennia or so ago, slapped their hands together and said 'well our work is done', and buggered off into space to watch our progress from afar, taking all the miscellaneous Gods with them to build a floating city strongly reminiscent of the space sequences in Watchmen, only with a distinct hint of Flash Gordon thrown in for good measure.We meet Thor and brother Loki as children, in a scene which seems to set up a lengthy (and usually tedious) 'sibling rivalry through the years' montage. Thankfully though any thought of a long drawn out yawn fest is immediately cut short as we cut straight to a ceremony with proud Dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins) bestowing the King's crown to the cocksure and arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with thousands of citizens bearing witness, including grown up (pasty) Loki. Only the coronation is cut short by an incursion by the sworn enemy of the Gods – the Frost Giants – who as the name suggests are basically tall, cold guys who unfortunately all look exactly alike.Despite the rude interruption Odin decides not to seek retribution by following the Frost Giants to their icy abode but Thor and his *ahem* Fellowship of mighty warriors of disparate origin, weapons and abilities second guess their orders and rush in blindly, putting Asgard on the brink of war.And with this one poor decision, Odin decides that he has no alternative but to cast his own Son from paradise down to Earth, which sort of suggests that Earth must be a sh*thole to them if you think about it.On Earth Thor is merely a tall hugely muscled man with lustrous locks of blond hair, though still surly and aggressive. Now a mortal, gone are his superpowers and his mighty hammer, which was also cast to Earth separately.Thor immediately runs into Team Science, Jane (Natalie Portman), Eric (Stellan Skarsgaard) and sarcastic comic relief Darcy (Kat Dennings), though it would be more accurate to say they run into him – twice. Team Science have been researching phenomena that well I don't really know it was never explicitly stated – but suffice to say they find a huge man who arrived in a massive surge of energy quite interesting, Jane particularly seems to like the cut of his job, what with all of the muscles and golden locks and such.The remainder of the film has Thor fanging around being obviously out of place desperately trying to regain his 'super', starting with his hammer which the government has already tracked down and are guarding zealously, and Team Science (never really called that but they should've) providing a taxi service for his travels, a sounding board for his thoughts, and Jane an inspiration for his loins And all the while all is not running smoothly on Asgard.The movie suffers with the need to switch back and forth between the Asgard-in-space setting and Earth, with neither realm getting to host any scenes of great significance, and it warrants mention that for 90% of this superhero movie Thor is mortal and therefore decidedly non-super. Jeremy Renner and Rene Russo have blink and you'll miss them roles, Renner's being particularly baffling unless he is to pop up again in The Avengers or is such a Thor fan that he was willing to take any role just to be in the film. The Fellowship members are all quite forgettable and essentially rendered wallflowers for much of the film, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin has little to do aside from remain dignified and paternal throughout, though he does get the chance to challenge Morgan Freeman for the 'guy with the most voiceovers' crown.Despite its flaws Thor is shiny and well made; it skips any real violence and there is no sex and profanity, obviously catering to the PG crowd. While that often results in bigger box office from the 'just happy to be at the movies' teens it normally spells doom for any real entertainment value. But while Thor lacks the edge to elevate it above merely worthwhile this is one notable exception where PG can still mean Pretty Good.Final Rating – 6 / 10. Without the violence of Blade 2 or the charisma of Iron Man/Tony Stark Thor was never really going to challenge for the All-Time comic book movie title, but even though for most of the movie neither Thor nor his film are super, you won't be thorry you thaw Thor. .",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just not... good,"This movie was juvenile, poorly written, and idiotic. Written to appeal to the lowest common denominator of humor and action.Throughout the film you are treated to incredibly dry action sequences of ""punch this"" ""block this"" ""hammer that"", and duologue that begs oneself to roll your eyes at the punch lines and scoff at the mechanical delivery of conversation. You can literally watch Natalie Portman die on the inside as she realizes what a mistake she made to accept the role...THOUGH there was one funny line which SHONE above the rest of the movie: ""This mortal form grows weak. I require sustenance!"" I found it quite humorous, but then realized that the only reason I was laughing was because it caught me off guard since EVERYTHING ELSE was poorly delivered/written.-.- So bad...

"Behold, the God of Thunder is Here!","Thor is, quite possibly, one of my favorite characters in the MCU and Chris Hemsworth does really well in his role as the arrogant-but-lovable god of Thunder. The cast is really good, complete with premiere acting talent- topped by Anthony Hopkins as Odin. I loved the special effects, the fight scenes, and the humor, but undoubtedly, the best thing about the movie is the portrayal of the relationships between the characters. The Father-Son relationship, the one between the brothers, even Thor and Jane's bond- it was all structured in a beautiful manner. The movie relied a lot on the special effects but the core conflict between Thor and Loki was what made the movie heart-warming and entertaining at the same time. A great addition to the MCU!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Deserves a little more consideration,"As I said in the title, this movie is low-considered. Might be because of the not-so vast place it is located (A small New Mexico village). First of all, this might be the movie from Marvel avengers universe with better development of the main character. Also gives the origins to a main villain in the marvel cinematic universe, Loki, in a very smart way that might not everyone noticed. Also the score is very good, gives to Thor and his father Odin a Jesus and God-like looking. Also I want to remind the presence of Natalie Portman. One really annoying thing I homever seen is the overuse of slightly oblique shot. In the end, still this movie deserves more consideration. not the best, but not at all that bad as they tell it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"For what Kenneth Branaugh accomplishes, Thor is a satisfying Marvel superhero tale of epic proportions","Thor is an excitement-filled action adventure that competently puts the God of Thunder on the pedestal with flashy visual scope serving a warm welcome for another Marvel comics entry. Taking the director's chair is Kenneth Branaugh who takes the spirit of the titular hero and slaps it on screen with endearing charisma, and the results shine, though not in a way that breaths game-changer. As opposed to many heroes of the Avengers team, Thor is not your typical modern day hero. This hammer-wielding god combines average superhero elements and clashes them with the fantasy-esque world that bears reminiscence to Greek mythology. He is an inhabitant of a mystical world of unnatural wonders outside of Earth, and serves as the center of the story that draws small parallels to William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. In some context, it is an superhero origin story that almost falls in the category of an epic, though perhaps that classification would be rooting too deep. This film is takes us in the distant world of Asgard, ruled by the mighty king Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins). Under his wing are his two sons Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston). As Odin prepares to crown the former as king, the realm becomes threatened by evil Frost Giants. Determined to protect his home, Thor goes against his father's orders and sets out to find against the evildoers. When his actions heightens a war between Asgard and the giants, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth where he is forced to enlist the help of scientists Eric Slevig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) and their intern Darcy Lewis (played by Kat Denning) to help regain his powers. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, Loki, jealous by his father's initial plans to choose Thor over him as the new ruler, hatches an evil plan of his own.Kenneth Branaugh crafts a refreshing picture of the titular Marvel comics star with solid precision, and from start to finish, never takes telling a compelling story for granted. The premise introduces the world of Asgard, warmed with dazzling CGI, and the characters very effectively, and once everyone steps into the action, the results pay off. The first special effects-laden sequence featuring Thor, Loki, and their fellow warriors battling against the Frost Giants not only satisfy with their effects glaze, but energetically set the story in motion following Thor's banishment from the home realm. His quest to regain his strength to fight against the evil that has threatened his home holds the most meant, but also lies a few of the narrative flaws. The story feels a bit rushed at times to the point where you hold the feeling that a half-hour of more runtime could have been more necessary to add more gravity to the plot. Nonetheless, the best thing to say that is that with the script, written by a team of three writers, keeps things rolling without spending too much time sketching out connections with the Marvel Cinematic Universe beyond SHIELD Agent Coulson, played by Clark Gregg, making a sweet appearance as a supporting figure. Chris Hemsworth proves to be the satisfying choice for the titular role, playing his character of humanity and clever sense of humor. His romantic chemistry with Natalie Portman is a bit weak, but perhaps less important to her characterization. English actor Tom Hiddleston on the other hand, submits arguably one of the most appealing villainous performances ever brought to the superhero realm, operating his role with both menace and darkly rooted charisma.Thor is a fun picture for both fans and a little bit of non-fans of Marvel Comics. Kenneth Branaugh crafts a warmly entertaining thrill ride that nicely meets the bar of summer superhero movies. For the filmmaker accomplishes, there is plenty to be offered in this solid rendition of its titular hero, though nothing destined to blow many other superhero entries out of the water. In conclusion, it fits the bill.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
meh,It wasnt bad it didnt overly whoa me but it was still an enjoyable installment in the marvel series.

Thor is OK but since it was converted to 3D.,"This movie was not at all meant to to be 3D and it shows it. There is nothing in the movie that shows 3D was inspired at all. In fact there were times I noticed that I noticed it seems that 3D wasn't even converted. It was a waste of my money to spend watching this in 3D. The conversion of A Nightmare Before Christmas was worth more than this movie. Don't waste your money on this movie. And by the way don't steal my money by cheaply converting a movie. There are to many other movies that could benefit from this and I'm talking older movies. As for the movie itself was OK. I don't like watching something that could have and should have been better. Let's put it this way it was typical and showed they could have done more and better, but they they did set a stage for something even more better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad but pretty meh,"Thor is a pretty meh MCU flick. The Asgard scenes in this film are pretty great. However when the setting switches to earth, the tone seems all over the place and that's where the film gets dragged down.

Another thing, Chris Hemsworth(Thor) is totally gorgeous!! I am also a fan of Anthony Hopkins and I thought he did a great job in this movie. The graphics are also AMAZING in this movie!!

A Little Too Dramatic for Marvel,"As dramatic as it is, Thor still isn't a bad movie. It creates the settings for Asgard's gods and heroes, giving us Chris Hemsworth's Thor, a cocky hero who thinks a little too much of himself and not enough of how he should act as future king. He soon finds that out though, as he's stripped of his powers and sent to Earth by his father, Odin, played by Anthony Hopkins. While the story is a little too slow placed, the action scenes included, it still has a good lesson to be learned, and makes for a lovable character who's a little confused about our customs here on Earth. The romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is okay, and definitely helps keep the movie afloat. Overall, I'd say this is a good watch, but there are better to pick from.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I miss this Thor,"What a great way to introduce Thor. From the beggining to the end, theres a mystic and magnificent vibe. Asgard is presented as this imponent, magnificent place and it manages to have that vibe with all the other characters. The relationships the characters have is awesome, specially Thor, Loki and Odin. The story is pretty good, is simple but really engaging. Maybe my favourite movie from Marvels Phase 1.

Thor is an exquisite film. Fun and Smart.,"I thought this remarkable movie was smart, well written, visually stunning, very well directed, and struck just the right tone for the material. There's really no other movie you can compare this one too. It's a small part psychodrama that explores the depth of human relationships but still delivers great action. It also gives us a human element to which most anyone should be able to relate. This movie really is exceptional. From the epic opening set on Asgard, to the awesome battle with the Destroyer back on Earth, Thor is filled with plenty of action, a compelling story and some superb direction from Branagh. Yes, I said superb. Everything I wanted in a film such as this and, actually, quite a bit more.Yes, I THORoughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with either action, emotion, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape for two hours like maybe Clash of the Titans. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this amazing film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike certain CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I've seen in years if not ever. I have to join the majority of people and even critics that are praising this film. It's a true joy and such a pleasant surprise.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"QUITE BORING, NECESSARY INTRODUCTION TO THOR!","The first MCU film to introduce us to an unearthly plain has some interesting moments but is mostly quite boring. This film is directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is best known for directing movies from Shakespeare's work, so when in Asgard you get this royal tone but as soon as Thor arrives on Earth, the tone completely changes and becomes uninteresting. Chemistry between characters sorely lacks and the only main character you really seem to like a fair
amount is Loki.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent no brainer,"It is obvious that you will like this movie depending solely on your expectations.If you see that the director is Kenneth Branagh, of previous Hamlet fame, and that the story is by Babylon 5's J. Michael Straczynski, you might expect something a lot better, especially since Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins star in it.However, if you know nothing about the Thor comic books and you think that some guy with a hammer will fight crime while spouting viking bull crap, then you will enjoy the movie, because it is nothing of the sort.The design of the Viking and Frost Giant worlds was nice, the acting was decent and Chris Hemsworth steals all the ""aaaahs"" of the female viewers. And I personally enjoyed the movie. However, I can't help but hate the clichés that jut their ugly heads, to the detriment of everything. I really rooted for Loki after all the idiocy exhibited by the people of Valhalla, so they had to make him look like an emotional idiot at the end. Why can't we love and understand both sides? Is it too complicated for the viewers?Bottom line: Check in your brain and you will enjoy it. The 3D aspects of the movie are irrelevant. It is just a normal 2D film with a bit of perspective added to it. The roles are that of Thor and Loki, with a bunch of supporting actors that have nothing to do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The only thing missing was a Hispanic Norse God,"Overall, this was a very good but not perfect adaptation of the mythology of the comic character Thor. The casting was almost flawless with the exceptions of Idris Elba as the black Heimdall, Tadanobu Asano as the Asian Hogun and of course Samuel L. Jackson as the black version of Nick Fury, but I suppose Jackson's miscasting can be blamed on Iron Man and the producers wanting to keep that mistake going with other movies in the Marvel franchise. Hollywood diversification at the expense of staying true to the characters they're adapting. I can hardly wait to see Luke Cage played by Hulk Hogan.The main actors played their roles well, with Tom Hiddleston completely surprising me with his initial low-key Loki who gradually revealed himself to be the sinister schemer that fans of the comic series have known and loved. Chris Hemsworth was an excellent choice as Thor and the always reliable Anthony Hopkins was the perfect Odin, even with the missing eye.The story was well-written but, being a reader of Thor's epic comic book battle with the Destroyer, I felt the metallic menace was felled a bit too easily. The special effects were above average and Asgard's mystic realm was awe-inspiring to say the least.All-in-all, a very good beginning for Thor. I give it a solid 7 and would have rated it an 8 if not for the woeful miscasting of the secondary characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Growth for both Thor and Loki.,"(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) What's great about this movie is that we see Thor grow from an self-righteous egotistical silver platter boy to the more thoughtful and nuanced Thor we see in the later MCU. Similarly Loki goes through his own phase of self-discovery and starts making big (dumb) decisions based on emotion which is his staple. He's not at his best here yet.Whats not so great about this movie is the romantic subplot which was completely unbelievable for time the short time Jane Foster and Thor had spent together. While I can see some earthling swooning over Thor, there really was no need to add this and it didn't matter for the plot in any way.First appearance of Hawkeye is okay, they really don't know how to use this guy properly and I feel it could've been anyone else. Coulson is fantastic as always and I enjoy his increased role in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty good, could've been better","This is one of those movies that could've been great, but falls victim to formulaic Hollywood thinking.Drop the unneeded quasi-romance and Natalie Portman, and you'd have a better movie.I'm also not sure about the casting choice for Thor. I get it, and I get why a lot of people are probably ga-ga about the choice, but Thor would be better off if he came across as more intelligent (and higher emotional IQ). Thor is supposed to be incredibly strong but not a derpy brute.Maybe I'm being too harsh. The fact of the matter is that the way the movie was done, you find yourself rooting way more for Loki, who is absolutely terrific.Have a spin-off with just Loki, and it'd prob be a ten.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I liked it more than others.,"THORI know out of all the superhero films that have been released, this one got one of the worst reviews, but to be honest I liked it. It was not the worst one by far... Captain America was terrible.This movie is about a God who is banished from Asgard to Earth to live among the humans... but when he is here he becomes one of the heroes that protects us.The action in this film is great. I always thought Thor was quite boring before watching this. But this film soon changed my opinion on him. The fighting scenes were great and full of excitement.This film is also visually beautiful. The scenes up in Asgard look amazing, especially at the bridge. The effects were brilliant too. The machines and creatures looked brilliant.The acting was questionably from a couple of people, but the main cast did a good job. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings. Another actor that was a supporting cast member but deserves a mention is Idris Elba. That man has been in so much recently and he is great in everything I have seen him in... except that Sky advert. haha. Tom was the star of the movie though. He played his part so well that you didn't realise he was turning into the bad guy of the movie until it was too late.There are some comedy moments in this film too, but they are places and done so well that it didn't take anything away from the action or the story. It was funny and perfect for the film.All in all this film was not as bad as everyone else thought it was.

Decent MCU movie powered by strong performances,"Thor is stripped of his power and banished from Asgard.This is a solid introduction to Thor, Loki and Asgard whilst nicely setting the scene outside planet Earth.The plot is a simple origin story for Thor and Loki and a fairly easy watch, but isn't hugely compelling. Loki is the more interesting character as Thor goes through a fairly one dimensional and predictable redemption arc.What the movie does well is introduce the Marvel universe outside of stories set on Earth. This world building is important for what comes in later Marvel films, especially the Avengers movies.As you would imagine the visuals are spectacular, with Asgard brought to life with colourful CGI and excellent costuming. The fight sequences are loud, eye popping and heroic as ever. Probably the most impressive sequence involves a powerless Thor facing up to an enemy during the latter stage of the movie, which is quite cool, even though it involves slow motion strutting.Chris Hemsworth looks and plays the part well. His accent is ropey, but his acting is solid. Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston are both excellent in roles they could play in their sleep, particularly Hopkins. He is an actor who projects a lot through his eyes and even does it well as a character with only one. The parts I enjoyed most were the exchanges between Hiddleston and Hopkins, but unfortunately there are not enough. The supporting cast are all solid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Thor,"Another Marvel comic book creation is unleashed into the movie world which is growing desperately thin on new and original pieces of work. In recent years Marvel (Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Iron Man) has given us from average to good but never great with the best of them tending to arrive from the first movie of the series with the new superhero (Hulk is emphatically excluded from this sweeping generalisation). Thor, as the first of many summer superhero movies (including the next Marvel adaptation- Captain America: The First Avenger) could have headed either way.Thor is about, if you haven't already gathered from the title, Thor (Chris Hemsworth)- the god of thunder. After an ancient war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of the Aesir forges a truce between the two races which last until the day Thor is due to be crowned King. During the coronation ceremony, several Frost Giants break into Asgard. In retribution Thor goes against his father's will and leads an assault on them bringing about a war in the process. Odin banishes Thor to Earth stripping him of his powers opening the door for his brother Leki to take control.Arriving on Earth, Thor soon runs into astrophysicist Jane (Natalie Portman) and her colleagues who are unbeknownst to them studying the effects that Thor has caused in the sky. Without his super powers and trusty hammer Thor must learn to adapt to his new surroundings and try to discover a way to return home.As in most of the Marvel movies, comedy is woven into the plot to keep the movie going and Thor achieves this well. Most of this is derived from Thor as he copes with his new surroundings a makes for some funny moments. Portman, the love interest, is smitten from the first time she sees Thor which she creates excellently right from the off.In keeping with the swords and hammers over guns, I liked when the modern day sniper was called into the action and instead of picking up his trusty rifle opted of a compound bow. For those less aware of the Marvel world, that character is Hawkeye and a subtle nudge in the direction of The Avengers film due for release next spring. Along with a Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D reference the movie keeps in line with other Marvel productions by intertwining them together but in a subtle and refined way. Hopefully The Avengers can live up to the expectations they are building! I found Thor to be better than I though it was going to be with good acting performances especially from newcomer Hemsworth and a good balance between action, comedy and drama to keep me entertained for the whole 2 hours. If you do go and see this at the cinema, which I would recommend, then make sure to stay until after the credits have finished rolling for some bonus footage.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is one of my top five favorite Marvel films. How does it hold up today? Check out my review below!,"""Thor"" (2011), up until the first announcement for this movie, I had no idea that the comic book superhero Thor existed. So, when I went to go see this film in the theater, I had literally no idea what to expect. In some cases, that can make the first viewing experience even more enjoyable. That's the case for ""Thor""! When I went to see this movie, I was hooked right from the beginning to end. Since I enjoyed it so much in the theater, I thought it was just a fluke and that my excitement for it would soon fade away. Nope, when I eventually bought it on DVD and watched it a second time, I loved it just as much, if not more than I did the first time I saw it. ""Thor"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a well-meaning but arrogant god named Thor is banished from his realm, Asgard, by his father, Odin, and then sent to live on Earth to grow up. At first I thought, ""oh, here we go, it's just going to be yet another fish-out-of-water scenario."" Now that being said, one of the most commonly used attributes in the world of cinema is easily the best and funniest part of this film. Watching Thor, a god try to adjust to human life in our world is hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Plus, there's an intertwining storyline where his brother Loki is trying to become King of Asgard, like him taking place, which makes the whole plot all the more intriguing. I won't go into any extra details about the storyline. But, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's a cohesive balance of action, comedy and it also has a lot of great morals thrown in as well, that give it that much more heart and emotion to the plot. As for the acting, it's phenomenal from the whole entire cast. They all do fantastic in this movie! But, the shining stars here, in my opinion, are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Odin. They really make this film, and the three of them give the whole cast such a strong chemistry! Had someone else been cast as either of the characters, then it may not have worked. Every single actor and actress nail their roles and fire on all cylinders! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming in New Mexico! But, my personal favorite set is Asgard. That whole location is stunning, and exciting to look at on the screen! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, since it came out in 2011! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Patrick Doyle is exceptional. His film score sets the perfect tone for the storyline and helps bring the movie to life. My personal favorite song in the soundtrack, and one of the best sequences in the film is the end credits. Those end credits accompanied by that big score, simply make it exhilarating. It's easily one of my top ten favorite end credit sequences of all-time. Props to you, Patrick Doyle! ""Thor"" is nothing but perfection in the genre of superhero movies. I could watch it over and over and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Thor"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out today! It's such a shame that the ""Thor"" sequels are trash and don't hold a candle to this one. Yet, for some reason, people consider ""Thor"" to be one of the weakest films in the saga. Why? Are you really that selfish? ""Thor is a fantastic movie, and you should consider re-thinking your opinions. Any way, go see ""Thor"" today. Or else, Odin might banish you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent Origin Movie,"I re-watched this film yesterday as part of my effort to refresh my memory on the MCU prior to Endgame and while this one served its purpose as the origin story for Thor, it seems dated now and not nearly as good a film as others in the MCU. Watching this again in 2019, this movie looks like it was shot in the 1990's and has almost a Michael Bay type feeling to it. All of those slanted camera angles and quick shots during the action made it look out of touch.
Also (and I've seen other comments on this) the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane was just out of place and unnecessary in this film. I'm not that familiar with how their relationship was in the comics, but I realize there was some love interest between the two but it just seemed like an afterthought here and not done well.
Still, it sets the stage for the first Avengers film and does a good enough job with introducing Loki, Thor and the rest of Asgard to the MCU.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wasn't what I hoped for, for a comic book film.","Was looking forward to an entertaining film, and was excited about some majorly impressive cg, but none of those things were met in this film.The acting was dry, and whiny, nothing impressive, quite the let down. I expected so much more, especially out of some of those characters/actors, but was bummed they didn't deliver. I feel that they should've casted more interesting actors, and they should've spent more time learning their characters. The actual comics were much more interesting, and I felt that this film didn't capture any of that.As far as the special effects/sets go, they weren't impressive at all. I've seen other films, such as X Men, and Spider Man, which were more thought out and creative. The costumes the actors wore weren't believable, they looked like something out of some sort of fashion magazine. Everyone looked so clean, and far from being tough super heroes. None of them looked like they were busy fighting, or training, or anything.Half the time, Thor was crying, complaining, and whining about everything. Unfortunately that's what his character's attitude called for, but I believe they could've handled it much better. He was such a wimp in this film, so what if he was muscular - big deal, he still wasn't tough enough. None of the relationships were believable either.Anyway, was a very boring and dull film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Branagh isn't very Branagh here,"While an entertaining film, this, to me, is the weakest of the pre-Avenger Marvel movies. While Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins are all perfect in their roles, I felt Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean talents are wasted here, as Thor in the comic is known for his old-English dialect, and there isn't nearly enough of that. He sounds far too modern. Also, in the comics, The Destroyer is an Avengers level threat, too powerful for a single hero, and so didn't seem strong enough here. But don't misunderstand me. I still like this film, and it definitely has its moments. Not bad, just not excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Throughly enjoyable.,"Thor is a visually brilliant movie but it unfortunately is lacking in substance. The character development of the gods is good but they have overlooked the humans. They feel weak and somewhat unnecessary to the story. While a few of the things are lacking the action sequences are very entertaining. They have put a lot of money into the special effects and it shows.To be honest, Thor is a dick. I'm not sure if it's Chris Hemsworth's portrayal or if that is just the character but he is incredibly unlikeable. As the movie progresses he does gain some humility but underneath you can still see his cockiness. Overall I really did actually like the movie. It was a great superhero action flick that keeps you engaged. Now I can't wait to watch the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Was never going to be an epic... Has its moments none the less,"I'm no fan of superhero movies. I find them a mind numbing mash of explosions and idiotic dialogue. When watching Thor I thought I was in for the same. The answer... Yes and no.Let's start with the negative because let be honest their more fun. The plot towards the end is daft. Like most superhero/action/sci-fi movies it starts well then blows everything up with a dull predictable supposed climax. The over theatrical dialogue for asguard can be a little much, almost like its ripping itself off. Laufey is a pretty forgettable villein and some other charatures are under developed. The biggest problem of this film is having a brilliant classical actor, Antony Hopkins, reduced to a grumpy old man.OK negatives out the way let's move on to the pluses. This has to be the most beautiful superhero movie ever made and I'm not talking about Natalie Portman, (ok maybe a little). Chris Hemsworth gives a fantastically underrated performance as he portrays the change from arrogant hothead to respectable and likable hero.The saving grace of this movie though is the comedy. This film is fantastically funny. Using juxtaposition to perfection, and brilliant banter.All in all, not as good as say the dark knight trilogy but an enjoyable film well worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Mighty Thor!.....or maybe not...,"I think I'm gonna do a first here and NOT relate how good the movie was with how good the special effects are.With that now abundantly clear, the best thing about this movie is the mythology. I found myself most engrossed in the movie when the mythology was being explored, and the powers of the mythical characters was being shown. This is a bit of a cheap screen writing trick though, so not too much credit can be given to the writers.The first act is sloppy, and the third act is equally so. Which is surprising considering the second act is usually the weakest, but i think that was the part of the movie where they were able to have fun with the characters, Thor in Nex Mexico -""Delicious! I will have another!"", rather than trying to establish and resolve a complicated universe and weak narrative.The action was average. At times the only thing you could see on screen was a mess of blurring motion. The were times when i got excited, but it was all rather disappointing. The anti climatic ending felt just felt like a cheap pay off for action rather than any serious resolution.I think for the most part of this movie i was marveling at the expected power of the characters, but when i actually saw them in action, it was kind of a let down. The hype was good, the reality was bad. And whats with the giant robot man, GORT rip off anyone?!Having said all of this, it is a good pop corn movie, and a bit of fun, if all a bit silly. Kenneth Brannagh, whom i greatly admire, holds it together in the best way i think he possibly could, and thats the reason i think the mythology is so interesting, Brannagh's Shakespearean background has given him the ability to handle it, and i applaud the Marvel/Paramount suites for picking the right man for the job.No doubt hordes of Americans will flood to the cinemas, and vast quantities of popcorn will be thrown down their necks to contribute to their already bulbous waste lines. A sequel is inevitable, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.... if you like popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Super Hero Fantasy Mix,"A lot of people seem to prefer Iron Man but for me as a big fantasy fan it was Thor who draw me into the MCU. I'd say of the early movies this was the most original and the one that I personally enjoyed the mostThe weird mix of Norse mythology and super hero tropes, science and magic, as silly as it is on closer inspection, works surprisingly well. Like all the early marvel movies it strikes a good balance between humor and drama. Thor's interaction with modern society is pure gold and his brother Loki is for sure one of the most fleshed out and interesting antagonists in the MCU.Some twists seem a little cheap, however, and the powers and limitations of each character aren't always clear, which may cause confusion and makes this movie fall just short of achieving true greatness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Engaging and Entertaining Movie!!,"The traditional story of an exemplary father and his arrogant and disobedient son who works to make it up to his father and loved ones after wronging. Accompanied by a side love story, Thor fights to gain his father's approval back and, in the end, the movie's story reaches a happy ending; just as expected.I found a lot of comedy in this movie which was unexpected; however, it does not mean it is a negative thing now that it helps the audience keep engaged.

Inconsistent,"On the one hand, I generally support super hero movies. But how, in the early 1960s, a Nordic God became a modern super hero, baffles me. How Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard got to be in a movie that seems above their level is beyond me also.And yet, this film wasn't without entertainment. The plot twist, if you will, involving the dynamics of Thor's family, was well done without being over dramatic. The explanation for how Thor gets to Earth is not something you'll want to think about too much, but it works. The helmets, which look like they were designed for the Royal Wedding by Lady Gaga, were something to look at.What worked best, for me, was the dynamic between Natalie Portman's character, Jane Foster, and her assistant, Darcy Lewis, who says at one point ""I'm not dying for six college credits."" Great and witty repartee between these two apparent friends. Whether intentional or not, the actions of Thor once on Earth were laughter inducing as well.The special effects were solid, although I'm not sure that 3D really brings anything to the table here. Some of the acting, or at least the dialog, is horribly bad here. I didn't leave the theater waiting and wishing for a ""Thor 2"".",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Some good taste,"I usually avoid every sort of mainstream movies, let alone those who admittedly belong to the sub-genre ""popcornis"". However, as my boy-friend is a Marvel fan and at the same time wanted to see a non-existentialist film for a change, I held my breath and thought that I could always sleep during the movie, as a last resource. That's to say I had no hopes for this film whatsoever, and knew nothing about it beforehand as well.The thing is, I have to admit that I sort of liked Thor. At least, I enjoyed some details, like some of the design, the textures used and even the choice of colour in some of the fantasy scenes; there's evidence of some good taste here and there. Of course the 3D almost ruined everything, as usual.Unfortunately the screenplay was much too puerile, even for its genre. Despite some good jokes, evidently this film didn't take itself too seriously in this aspect. Too bad it didn't, because the film could be like a pearl lost in the mainstream space otherwise.Just in the end I got to know it was directed by Kenneth Branagh.

"As an origin story, there's not much space for anything else","This is something I found characteristic for Iron Man as well: with a need to focus on their origin story, there leads to a situation where everything is just not well elaborated enough. A great amount of detail is given to well, his origin story, and the supposed 'climax' was just lacklustre. The focus on Thor and Jane's romance was also only borderline inspiring. Still, for origin stories, it's a necessary evil. For origin stories, Captain America did it best, bringing his key qualities to the forefront while remaining emotional.Even so, I have to admit as someone who has always been skeptical about the entire Thor series, it has surpassed my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I love this movie!,"I can understand Loki's dissatisfaction with Odin for not telling him the truth about his origins; imagine discovering the truth while fighting for your life against your own people. Loki had a point; he'd never be king since he wasn't a true Asgardian, which is why Mjolnir selected Thor; it was predetermined, and I believe that's what upset him the most: he'd never have a shot.

A Straight Forward Superhero Movie,"21 June 2012. Besides from visually dazzling innovative set designs that evoke a beautifully other-world delight, these supposed Gods seems very retro unlike even those depicted in the original Superman (1978) and the potential brilliance antagonist where there are glimpses is never truly realized and simply becomes another stereotypical two-dimensional character. Thor's fall from grace while initially an ""extended"" piece of work does work in a fashion. Ironically the visuals during the ending credits are some of the most intriguing, under-utilized as part of the credits instead of being better incorporated into the movie itself. Somehow, even The Bourne Identity (2002) action scenes are more exciting and compelling than those found in this movie which relies on spectacular special effects even considering the God-like powers supposedly at the director's disposal for this movie.Green Lantern (2011) had a better balance and more story authenticity than the larger than life dramatization of this superhero having more depth of character and and story. Even Elektra had a stylish quality in both the action scenes (without resorting to power) and a poignant emotional pull that Thor didn't have. Lord of of the Rings (2002) had the epic fantasy battles. Spiderman 2 (2004) had the convoluted romantic dimension and the Chronicles of Narnia (2005) and Spiderman 3 (2007) had the innocent corruption that Thor incorporated only a suggestion of but pulled back. And Excaliber (1981) captured the whole realm of character depth and intrigue along with the period stylistic characterization notably lacking in Thor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor holds no surprises,"Thor never seemed like the type of super-hero that could charm the screen. It was, the now infamous scene that takes place after the credits in Iron Man 2, that got me excited. As time went on, hearing Kenneth Branagh had directed the film and seeing some pretty exciting trailers, I thought Thor was going to be the hit of the summer, worthy of kicking ass over Micheal Bay's Transformers, but no.Thor is unbelievably mediocre. Between the story of Thor, which if you're going to see the movie you most likely already know, and what is shown in the trailer, anyone could close their eyes and imagine exactly what you're going to see, almost shot for shot. Some people would call this a good movie, I can it horribly unimaginative.The film, even when lacking in action, never lacks in trying to squeeze every possible laugh of it's audience, as guilty as a television sitcom. Branagh also heavily relies on the pretty boy looks of his leading man, hoping to distract us with Thor's contagious smile so we not take notice at how badly written the dialogue is.Even in 3D, there is nothing that comes through the screen and is common feel through-out the audience. The kids wowed at the special effects, the girls giggled and smiled and the rest of us, hoping it's going to get better.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Second Best Thor Movie,"Thor details the origin how the Norse god based hero came to be one of Earth's greatest heroes. It shows him turning from arrogant to more considerate of his father's beliefs by spending time on Earth and powerless. It is my second favorite Thor movie after Ragnarok, and it's not even close when it comes to Ragnarok when in comes to being my favorite. It does stand out from other phase one movies as it is Shakespearean and fantasy based with some comedy aspects compared to Iron Man as more sci-fi and business based and Captain America The First Avenger is more of a war film, taking place during World War II. Incredible Hulk was more of a sci-fi action pick. Then The Avengers was a team-up with all of them, though The Avengers didn't use as much as Shakespearean elements Thor had or war Cap had. This Thor movie is definitely another peg of buildup for the Avengers and wouldn't have the Avengers (2012) and then everything else without Thor or any other of the phase one solo projects. Though I did find Hawkeye was underutilized and deserved to have his own solo movie in phase one and shouldn't have to wait until his own show after Endgame.This Thor has some aspects of a comedy with it being a fish out of water type of movie while doing the Shakespearean elements at the same time. The second Thor the Dark World kinda abandons the comedy aspects and was less watchable (I barely paid attention when I watched it). Ragnarok abandons more of the Shakespearean elements for more of the comedy and cosmic aspects, which was still in place for Love and Thunder. I like Ragnarok the most as its more space adventures and comedy is best. This one is definitely second as it does a good job at the more mythology and Shakespearean elements and the comedy is better than the more flat comedy we had in Love and Thunder.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Has its flaws but still managed to entertain.,"Alright, let's dive into Thor, the 2011 superhero film directed by Kenneth Branagh.First of all, I have to say that Thor is a visually stunning movie. The special effects and cinematography are top-notch, making Asgard and the other realms look absolutely breathtaking. It's clear that a lot of care and attention went into crafting this fantastical world, and it pays off in spades on the big screen.As for the plot, it's a classic hero's journey tale. Thor, the hot-headed prince of Asgard, is banished to Earth after defying his father Odin's orders. There, he learns humility and falls in love with a human scientist named Jane Foster, all while trying to regain his powers and stop his evil brother Loki from taking over Asgard. It's a familiar story, but it's told with enough flair and excitement to keep you engaged.The acting in Thor is also solid across the board. Chris Hemsworth brings charisma and humor to the role of Thor, while Tom Hiddleston is delightfully villainous as Loki. Natalie Portman is a little underutilized as Jane, but she still manages to inject some heart into the film. The supporting cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, and Stellan Skarsgård, are all great as well.Where Thor falls a little flat, however, is in its pacing and dialogue. The first act of the movie feels a bit rushed, with not enough time spent establishing Thor's character or the world of Asgard. Conversely, the middle of the movie drags a bit, as Thor spends too much time on Earth and not enough time pursuing his goal. Additionally, some of the dialogue feels a bit clunky and exposition-heavy, particularly in the early scenes.All in all, Thor is an enjoyable movie that has its flaws but still manages to entertain. Its stunning visuals and solid performances make up for some of its pacing and writing issues. If you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or just enjoy a good superhero movie, Thor is definitely worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

448th Review: better than most and Brannaugh does an excellent job,"This could have been the new Flash Gordon - cheesy and frankly bad, but with Ken Brannaugh in charge we get a film that frankly is one of the better superhero films. Brannaugh is best known for Shakespearean theater, and Shakespeare on film, as well as Mozart's Magic Flute; and it is perhaps these very qualities that carry the fantasy sections so well.Thor, son of Odin, attacks the Norse gods enemies without permission, and is exiled to Earth, where he meets an astrophysicist (Natalie Portman). PLotting is get simple, but not simplistic, and the fact that we can follow the story clearly at all stages again says much for the director.All in all, this is a very successful film: exciting, interesting, and surprisingly intelligent.

A brilliant adaptation of the comic book,"I'm someone who is very excited to see 'The Avengers' in 2012 ever since I first heard about the project. Howvever, I have to admit that 'Thor' was always the film I was least looking forward too since Ironman and Cap are my favourites of the team and I also doubted if adapting the Thor comic book was going to end well. Luckily, I was very wrong! 'Thor' sets up the premise that the legends of the Norse gods are, in fact, powerful aliens who inhabit Asgard, one of nine worlds connected to each other through a wormhole system known as the Rainbow Bridge. Thor is a cocky and egotistical prince who is preparing to succeed his father Odin as king, much to his younger brother Loki's quiet resentment. However, when Thor's arrogance leads the race of Ice Giants (who reside on another of the nine worlds) to declare war on Asgard, Odin casts his son out in the hopes of teaching him humility. Thor then finds himself stranded on Earth, powerless and mortal with only scientist Jane Foster and her friends to aid him. Meanwhile, Loki is plotting away with his own plans of leadership.Those who were worried about Chris Hemsworth's role as Thor (considering he is best known in the UK for 'Home and Away!) should relax as he carried the character off perfectly, right from Thor's conceited side to his growing maturity and sense of responsibility. By the end of the film, it is easy to see Hemsworth's Thor take his place as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Tom Hiddleston, who played Loki, was also another pleasant surprise as he was excellent in depicting the vulnerability of the character as well as his guile, bitterness and jealousy. Natalie Portman was a good Jane Foster, although this was obviously very much Thor's film and it will need a sequel to properly develop Jane as a character. And, as always, it was great to see Clark Gregg as SHIELD agent Coulson, one of the best original characters that the films have produced.I found that the plot was near-perfect for a comic book adaptation, doing well to explain the background of Thor's character and how he evolves to being an Avenger. Loki was also nicely development as a sympathetic antagonist rather than some bland 'black and white' villain. There was a good mix of drama, action and humour and the actual story flowed. You can see how this is nicely coming together with the 'Ironman' films to finally culminate next year to 'The Avengers'.There are some negatives. I did feel Odin could have done with slightly better depiction as he came across as a rather cold father to his sons (it's easy to see why Loki felt he had to take the path he did). Also, there was no need whatsoever for 3D. I've seen the film three times, twice in 2D and once in 3D and felt the latter added absolutely nothing to the film except for making pretty credits at the end. I wish Hollywood would stop with this fad since it's rubbish.I do highly recommend this film to comic book fans as well as anyone looking for a good film. Roll on 'Captain America' in July!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So so,"""Thor"" from Marvel Films. The best thing about this movie is without doubt, the Foo Fighters ""Walk"" playing at the end credits. Secondly, the film is not so bad. Chris Hemsworth was OK as were most of the actors. The CGI effects are pretty good, the storyline is so so. To sum it all up, the movie was average I suppose.

"Amazing designs, intriguing concepts, plodding plot","The first Thor movie isn't *bad*, but it's not especially good either. It does its job in introducing the Marvel version of Asgard and the nine realms as an advanced alien civilization that the old Norse saw as gods. And it does its job at introducing Thor, Loki and Odin, and their family dynamic -- which is where its heart is, far more than the action sequences. But it's not *quite* as compelling as I remember it being. Though my memory could be mixing in the later movies and other, non-Marvel sources. At least Loki gets to debut as a complex character here, rather than the flat version seen in *The Avengers*.I do really like the Asgardian designs, the mix of futuristic technology, high fantasy, and old Norse art and architecture. That aesthetic is established here, and the sets and effects and costumes really bring it to life. It's fantastic in several senses of the word.But I kind of feel like the Thor series didn't hit its stride until *Ragnarok*, just in time for everything to be trashed in *Infinity War*.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Another fine Marvel film that breaks the superhero mold,"Movie review:OK, slightly behind (I kind of forgot to watch this) but excuses aside, I enjoyed this movie. Yes, I am a comic geek, so may be a tad biased, although admittedly I did not read ""Thor"" so the rating is on movie merits alone. The movie follows the life of a ""G-d"" in the form of Thor(Chris Hemsworth), who is the god of thunder. He is raised in Asgard to become the heir of the throne to a pseudo-Greek mythological type world of people with extraordinary powers. When Thors arrogance to unleash a war upon a race of frost giants that has been ensuing for many years breaks the code of a treaty of peace, Thor is banished from Asgard without his powers and his mighty hammer to the end of the worlds, or as we know it, Earth. Yes there is a side story to all this, but it is weaved between events on Asgard and Earth to tell the hows and whys of the occurrences leading to Thors punishment. Well, now on Earth, without any power and no sense of what being mortal actually is which leads to some humorous scenes, he meets his new friends by being hit by a car containing astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). These lucky folks decide that he isn't some wandering drunk and help him on his plight to retrieve his magical hammer. During the relationship with Jane and back in Asgard, Thors brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is able to seize the throne of king as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) falls ill, but does Loki have some ulterior motives here? The movie moves on with a steady hand of extremely well done character development that being helmed by Kenneth Branagh did not surprise me at all. A master of making you believe in the characters is something no one does much better, and in the unbelievable story material he was given, he scores an A+. The scenes in Asgard look absolutely breathtaking, the scenes in the frost kingdom look so dismal you can almost feel the chill, and earth, well, that is just New Mexico, nothing exciting (but some very good camera-work helps here). Of course, there is going to be some exciting action sequences to tide you over, but this movie is really about the acting and chemistry of the cast which is something to appreciate greatly. I only wish they would've given a bit more time to the romance between Thor and Jane (yes, I did just type that). Their love story seemed to be an afterthought swept under the rug to keep the comic book story going. Ultimately this movie, and Marvel studios, again bring out a quality picture about a superhero, but doesn't just use eye candy action to wow the viewer, but uses real emotions to draw the audience into the trials and turmoils that occur. 6.8/10 IMDb 7.0. Oh, after the credits, there is a bit of more info about the Shield that unfolds which is part of the ongoing story of the Avengers. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The Fledgling MCU has its mettle tested adapting one of the sillier Marvel characters, to mostly successful effect","In the realm of Asgard, King Odin Allfather (Anthony Hopkins) rules over a lasting peace after having defeated the Frost Giants and their king Laufey's (Colm Feore) conquest of the mortal realm by sealing them in their realm and ridding them of their power source. With Odin's son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) now poised to ascend the throne of Asgard, the ceremony is interrupted when a trio of Frost Giants somehow manage to get into Asgard's vault containing their former power source and are only narrowly stopped. Against Odin's orders Thor organizes his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a team of warriors to storm the Frost Giants' realm and demand answers from Laufey how they came to Asgard. Laufey denies knowledge and following insulting remarks from Laufey a fight ensues among Thor and his group which is narrowly stopped by Odin. Furious with Thor's shortsightness, pride, and wrecklessness Odin banishes Thor to Earth and strips him of his Asgardian powers but sends with him his hammer which is enchanted so only one worthy of Thor's power may pick it up. Landing in a small town in New Mexico, Thor's path crosses scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) who are researching anomalies in the area and try to help Thor return to his world which is under threat from a traitor in Asgard.Thor is an adaptation of the Marvel comic book character from 1962 which itself was inspired by the god of thunder from Norse myth. Marvel had attempted to adapt the character in the past including the 1988 TV movie The Incredible Hulk Returns which served as a backdoor pilot for a TV series that never came to be, and various attempts at film ranging as far back as 1990. Eventually, Thor's rights reverted back to Marvel Studios who began arrangements for the film to serve as another stepping stone in the building of the cinematic universe that would culminate in an Avengers crossover film with various drafts written of the film before Kenneth Branagh became director and Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were signed for Thor and Loki. Critical and commercial response to Thor wasn't on the same level as Iron Man, but the movie was seen as a slight improvement from Iron Man 2 and made a respectable $450 million against a $150 million budget. For me Thor isn't a movie I'm all that inclined to revisit in the MCU canon but I do acknowledge it for being a fundamentally solid film.I will say that Kenneth Branagh does a solid job in the director's chair bringing to life Asgard and its various denizens. With Branagh's very ""theatrical"" pedigree he does a solid job of taking these elaborate structures and colorful larger than life costumes and characters and much like the ""science"" present in the Iron Man films you do get the sense that the film is taking Thor's world and origins seriously enough that it wants the audience to buy into it and for the most part you do. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are great as Thor and Loki and you get a lot of engaging moments between the two and become invested in their familial dynamic with Anthony Hopkin's Odin with some enthusiastic if slightly over the top exchanges that fit the theatricality of the character and production. Once Thor winds up on Earth you do get some sense this was done as a ""cost saving measure"" as it's reminiscent of certain 80s fantasy films like Masters of the Universe or Beastmaster II that did similar concepts, but unlike those films there's more effort put here and it feels like they do frame a character study for Thor is this environment that still allows for impressive sequences. Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard are okay as the human characters whom Thor interacts with, but despite giving good performances there's not a whole lot to them with most of their most enduring traits thanks to the performances rather than the writing. However Kat Dennings' character Darcy is really annoying and is definitely a prime example of ill placed comic relief that isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is. We also have some universe setup with Clark Gregg reprising his role as S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Phil Coulson and unlike the cumbersome inclusion in Iron Man 2 the universe building feels much more balanced this time around. The script also has some head scratching plot points like what happens with Odin halfway through the film, but for the most part I was satisfied with the directions taken storywise.In the annals of MCU history Thor is the definition of an ""Okay"" movie. It features solid performances from its cast and has likable leads in Hemsworth and Hiddleston, but does feel like it's slightly lacking in punch thanks largely to not being able to go as far as it wants with its high concept that sees Thor without his powers for a substantial length of time. There's also some issues with certain characters, but these issues aside Thor is perfectly good in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A mighty, but still young thunderer","It has always been interesting to look at the extraterrestrial and mythical world of Asgard. And such a chance fell to the audience in the 2011 film ""Thor"" by Kenneth Branagh. And cinema immerses us in the world of fiction, which, by the way, turns out to be not fiction, and the world of Asgard is simply more developed than ours. ""And there is no magic, there is a more advanced science."" This is about the thought of Arthur C. Clarke, which is voiced here by the main character Jane Foster.The film is extraordinarily beautiful. The colors are striking in the eyes with their brilliance, especially if you compare the film with the first Captain America. It's very worthy - the ability to show what different worlds are. Tall buildings, a gloss of gold, beautiful asgradtsy. The creators came up with love for every detail.Chris Hemsworth really did a great job with the role. At first, he is the arrogant, self-loving prince of Asgard, confidently defies the ice giants with whom his father Alone has been trying to create a world for a long time. He believes that he has the right to decide his own fate, not noticing that politics is undoubtedly behind his actions. And he may well start a new war. Finding himself on Earth without his powers for this, Thor learns to be a man, begins to understand what and how in the vast world. And the actor successfully shows the evolution of the hero. He is handsome, funny where necessary, dramatic. Great game.Loki, aka Tom Hiddleston, is in no way inferior to Chris. And in many ways even surpasses. The darling of fate, with his motivation of a hunted predator, a deceiver and a cheat. Such is Loki, because fate has decreed so. But already here we see that he is angry, because he is unhappy, he has always been on the sidelines, who was set as an example by his brother. And he's not a villain, but an anti-hero who can't say his word in just one movie.The work of Maestro Anthony Hopkins is wonderful. Dubbing is a good thing, but once I saw a couple of emotional moments where the actor speaks in the original, I realized that dubbing does not convey all the emotions of Odin, all the pain that came to life in him when Thor behaved incorrectly. Hopkins is a real decoration of the cinematic universe.Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, is good. She feels inner strength, she is purposeful and intelligent, while remaining vulnerable and feminine.The film is replete with beautiful shots, majestic music, a vivid plot, and, most importantly, shows the transformation of the hero from an inveterate buffoon into a real king.""Thor"" is a great example of a film that combines humor, drama, a clever idea, a good example for the younger generation, there is a hero to look up to.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good start, then it gets TERRIBLE!","Thor introduces the God of Thunder and his mischievous brother Loki to the MCU.The Good: Chris Hemsworth gives a likeable performance as Thor.
The opening scenes set in Thor's homeworld are visually dazzling and entertaining.The Bad: Natalie Portman gives a HORRIBLE performance here (and I usually like Portman as an actress).
The supporting cast is forgettable.
The jokes are dreadful.
The romance is forced and just bad.
This film also introduces Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but doesn't do anything with him. It was so pointless.

One of the Better Comic Book Transfers!,"Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie. There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful. Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously and that is refreshing.Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo). Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired. Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etcIn addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around soon. The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people. It is surprisingly successful!Grady Harp",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Mighty good,"Thor was arguably the toughest of the Avengers characters to realize in live action. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner may be special, but they're also human and their adventures take place here on terra firma. Thor on the other hand is a Norse God from a far flung world that none of us can relate to. Thankfully Marvel and director Kenneth Branagh were up to the task.While it has a fairly modest scope, 'Thor' benefits greatly from its focus on character. There's a journey here that helps us to connect with the mythic character. I also feel the love story, not hot or passionate, but tender and sweet, really adds a strong element of emotion and helps raise the stakes. It also features the MCU's best villain to date in Loki. A hero is only as good as his villain, and Loki takes 'Thor' to another level.While not a classic, 'Thor' is a solidly entertaining origin story and a serviceable cog in the Marvel machine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"Eh, the movie was good. I think there could have been more in it. I'd like to see Thor getting it on with Doctor Doom! I like the main character in this movie, though the person who plays his brother is a complete nerd. I think there should be a way that Thor (A freaking God) could build that freaking bridge or make his way back to that chick someway. I liked the only real action scene in the movie, which was where Thor gets into the fight with the Big metal dude. Other than that, there was very little real action. I cant wait until comic book movies get more gruesome. I think they should take Venom out of the Spiderman series and make a movie about him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Came all pumped out of the cinema,"I loved this movie when I watched it. I remember I came all pumped up out of the cinema. I don't care about critics who say it's poorly written or that the character development is weak. It is not true or else it would not have such an effect on people. Sure, it could have been more complex and elaborate and intellectual. But this movie is about the relationship between Odin, Thor and Loki and it is powerful, emotional, grand and whoever does not have any family issues in their family can maybe say that the story is bad. Also the story is filled with humor plus there is romance. The special effects and artwork is amazing to boot.

The god of thunder begins,"Thor is one of the few Marvel films so far to have a really strong villain in Loka with Shakespearean motivations. Stories that go way back, similar to my favourite movie of all time Gladiator. It has the themes of acceptance and jealousy. Thor played by (Chris Hemsworth) is hungry, egotistical and ready and willing to prove he was the right successor to the throne. Orid (Antony Hopkins) father of Thor, sends Thor to earth in exile from home Asgard for his trigger happy war seeking actions on the ice giants. The ice Giants enter the palace in violation of their treaty. Thor reacts with lack of honour to their treaty and must learn the true value of his virtue. On earth he meets Jane Foster played by (Natalie Portman) where he learns love and value. Striped of his powers and now understanding not all one entire race is evil Thor acts with his heart protecting people he now cares about. The stand out performance comes from (Tom Hiddleston) as we are left constantly guessing what he is up to next. Envious of his brother believing he to be the true worthy candidate for the throne. Mischievous action is being made back on Asgard. The story is one that has been told many a time but not on Asgard and not with what was fresh characters for the big screen at the time.The visual effects are stunning and leaves us wanting to visit Asgard again in the future. The main downfall of this film is pacing as it does seem to drag at times and the spontaneous relationship between Jane and Thor seems all too convenient and quickly rushed at times. Although it does create humour, following up from the darker gritty Incredible Hulk film that felt somewhat out of place in the Marvel cinematic universe. Anthony Hopkins appeared prominent as the king and father of Thor and Loki, his onscreen presence often feels one of an authoritative figure. This film is also the first to introduce (Jeremy Renner) Clint Barton a member of the shield alongside another appearance from Samuel L Jackson briefly.So far I'm been enjoying going through the marvel films in chronological order, much like many of the other films within the marvel universe Thor is a laidback easy watch comedy action. In comparison to the previous viewings it has the most in common with Tony Starks Iron Man. Thor has this power, wielding it out of control due to his inexperience, therefore he must learn the true value of it and what it takes to harness such strength. Stark has the same arrogance at times when developing his technology, the challenge for him is understanding the danger of the latest advancements he makes, often he only understands the consequences and the damage of Stark industries when he himself is thrown into war.Kenneth Branagh brings Thor to life on the big screen for the first time with a talented team, the visual effects of Asgard combined with the bridge and the ice giants all show an aesthetically pleasing result within the comic book realm. This type of movie couldn't have been brought to live quite as well in the early eighties to what it has become now and I must say it has been well worth the wait. The unique blend of Asgard to Earth makes the audience aware of the differentiation as well as the acting of Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman as we see the awkwardness between them at first. You can get a feel of what it would be like to discover earth for the first time through Chris Hemsworth. This isn't to say that it isn't a little over the top and goofy in places but it's obvious it's supposed to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where is all began,"Well, retrospectively looking - Thor is now a teenager that is struggling to find himself in the world. When this movie came out I was only engaged and none of the children was born - now all three of them (mostly my two sons) set with me to see how Chris Hemsworth started, without being funny Thor or without being an actor with the capability to make us laugh.All muscles Hemsworth looks sometime like Tarzan when he meets his Jane. We all know how this will end up, but back it the days, when Kenneth Branagh was the director and Stellan Skarsgård wasn't the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Thor came out with his hammer and completely conquered us - the viewers with fast spins and swings and it was sufficient and more than enough.Those were the days, when Marvell just developed their universe and Tom Hiddleston was discovered as Loki for the first time. Didn't have a confusing TV show and had us in ""Hello"". Now it's all complicated and needs to glue and patch to explain movies, theories and other shows that are related to each other.Thor is casted from his home planet and from his coronation. He gets to earth, falls in love, saves the day and eventually will get to be a crucial part of the ""Avengers"". He will get his trilogy and it will get a lot of side movies and TV shows, that wont matter. I've liked raw Thor and fat Thor also, but this is where the Magic begins, with out a lot of actual magic.Pretty banal plot and occurrences for first movie, out of three or even three hundred. Gets the job done and lays the foundations for a lot of movies that will follow his path, as superheroes movies, that are part of the MCU.

Thor Film Review,"Thor! Finally right?Yes! Apparently so. We get a movie experience that we want from an amazing comic book character always believed to be to difficult a character to bring to life.There have been all types of films on the mythical Norse God, most of which are pretty horrible or generally low brow.There are even interpretations in science fiction, like the alien Thor from the planet Asgard in Stargate SG-1.Thor is a beloved character, and Marvel's interpretation has taken that character and brought him down to earth, literally.The film does a great job of humanizing Thor and connecting him to us. I loved the manner in which ""The Warriors Three"" were placed into the film (Hogun, Fandral and Valstagg) which helped in this process. The only issue I had was simply wanting more.The special effects in the film were fantastic and Chris Hemworth did what I thought was not doable without a giant bodybuilder type. He made you feel like he was Thor. A film like this is incredibly difficult to make. To keep in line with Marvel and appease the fans, hit the mainstream and tie it in to a larger story coming next year. So why was it one hour and forty-five minutes long?I think that Hollywood underestimates our attention spans - A.D.D. is what some of us suffer when dealing with boring and tedious subjects. Put a comic book in front of us or a comic book movie and we sit at attention. So why give us a shorter film. This movie could have entertained us more inside of Asgard and given more insight into those characters, Odin and Thor with another forty-five minutes.Perhaps the producers felt it was long enough to tie him into Avengers and wanted to leave other surprises. That's a big ""IF?"", actually it's more like a big ""Perhaps?"" since that is what I typed...Derp.Natalie Portman was great - coming off two other productions from ""Your Highness"" and last years ""Black Swan"" she is amazingly versatile. I remember a lot of rumor and arguments over Idris Elba as Heimdall and the issues of casting someone black for this role. He was awesome. Directed well and utilized in his role appropriately...again - I'm certain the audience wanted more.Lets consider this for a moment. It's not that the movie was a complete two - two and half hour film and we wanted more, simply because it was so awesome. It's that the film was fifteen minutes short of two hours and slowly rushed (if that makes sense) through the storyline.Overall, I still enjoyed it thoroughly as one of my favorite characters came to life. It is an interesting thing to see this character finally in the limelight. Realistically, Thor is one of the most powerful beings in the marvel Universe, he is a God, he is just about as strong as the Hulk, but for all that power he is usually overshadowed by other characters. I feel a little slighted that he didn't get a longer film. He will be key in the ""The Avengers"" next year, but he is also not it's principle character, that falls on Iron Man and Captain America - getting pushed back as the muscle.While that falls in line with the comics, I guess I loved the film so much, I wanted more and felt cheated. I do not want to give plot points out like other reviews. We all know Odin is angered when Thor goes to war against his wishes and due to his recklessness is stripped of his power and cast down to Earth. We all know that S.H.I.E.L.D. finds the hammer and so on. Go watch the film and learn the rest. It's worth the viewing and your eight bucks.There are a few changes from the comic books, but those changes are not bad, and the amount of action given to us is solid with great story lines wrapping around that action. We get to see him kick ass as a man and we get to see him WTFPWN as a God...So I have a thumbs up for the film, it was a great spectacle, even though fleeting and a thumbs down because of that fact. It was shorter than it should have been and slightly rushed in a variety of areas where we wanted more, like Asgard.If you need more of a Thor fix as your excited little hearts can't get enough like mine. Check out the ""Hulk vs Thor"" Animated feature which has an amazing battle between both of the title characters and has some great incite into Baldur, and the other of Thor's comrades.This review was posted on our http://www.facebook.com/gpxgaming Profile.

"A few years ago, i thought this movie couldn't be pulled off.....i was just proved wrong","When word first broke that they were creating an 'Avengers' movie, my initial thought was ""impossible"". And the reasoning behind this though revolved around one central hero, and that is Thor. Granted i have only read a few of the Thor comics, and in my honest opinion, they were a little too boring for my taste. But that's not what concerned me. What concerned me, was how in the world they were going to sell this character on screen. I mean, the guy is the freakin god of thunder. How can you introduce that element and have it revolve around other likable hero's such as Hulk and IronMan? Well, judging from the previews i've seen, they seem to know exactly what they're doing.For starters, the intro is bloody brilliant. It does a great job of establishing the main characters, and immediately encompasses a cloud of likability around Thor. Needless to say, they quickly establish the limitless bounds of his actual power, which is always fun to watch because you have never really seen that in a superhero movie. It always escalates upward to them gaining their power.After this somewhat of an epic start, the movie maintains a pretty good pace. I honestly could have done without the love interest between Thor and Natalie Portman. Yes, i understand that in this case it was necessary. But it felt really weak to me. And it's nothing to blame on the writing or the acting. It felt weak because there were so many awesome things going on, that the love story was really the least of my concerns on screen. It kept jumping back and forth between two and sometimes three different worlds, and incorporate that with battling awesome creatures, who would want to pay attention to any romance the film has to offer? But the main point is that it doesn't take anything away from the character development, it just felt somewhat un-necessary.Now comes the end, which left me slightly disappointed. You have this awesome beginning where Thor is just going crazy with his hammer, you would expect something even more epic for the finale' right? Well, they give you a pretty good finale'......but it didn't burn the eyes out of my skull like i wanted it to. Was it bad?....No.......but it could have been slightly better in my opinion.Bottom Line.......they did a great job of making it fit right in with the other Marvel hero's, which is something that i thought to be 'impossible' a few years ago. It promises a good time, and it gave me just that. Some work could have been in the middle and maybe towards the end, but overall i left the theater feeling very satisfied. Thor has easily established himself as a major badass, and this does nothing but build a bigger bridge towards the Avengers. So, in the realm of Marvel superhero movies, where does this one rank? Well, let's break it down........I didn't like it more than ""IronMan"", but i liked it more than ""Incredible Hulk"" and especially ""Wolverine"". I would rank it up there with maybe the first ""Spiderman"", which isn't bad at all. In fact, i liked it more than the first Spiderman....but that's just me. Even if you disagree with me on that front, you still wont be able to deny that it was a pretty damn fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

But that's to be expected of anything Marvel. Obviously there are some plot holes and as a science major, I felt myself mentally shaking my head at certain parts.

Thor to the world.,"Marvel studio's Thor is an exciting and visually stunning film that introduces audiences to the mighty Norse god and his journey of growth, redemption, and heroism. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the film successfully blends mythology with modern superhero storytelling, bringing one of Marvel's most iconic characters to life. Upon crushing into the New Mexico desert Thor is discovered by scientist Jane Foster and her team. His interactions with humans lead to several humorous and memorable moments, from his confusion over Earthly customs to his famous demand for ""another"" cup of coffee. The exciting battles, emotional character arcs, and stunning world-building make Thor a standout entry in the MCU and an essential watch for fans of superhero cinema. The balance of humor and drama ensures that the film remains engaging and accessible to a wide audience. The perfomances in Thor elevate the film beyond a standard superhero origin story, bringing depth, emotion, and charisma to the characters. Each actor delivers a compelling portrayal that enhances the film's dramatic weight and entertainment value. Chris Hemsworth delivers an outstanding performance as Thor, perfectly embodying the God of Thunder's strenght, arrogance, and eventual humility. Its the best !

Pretty good introduction movie,"Surprisingly enough Thor isn't a disaster of a movie it could have been. It actually is a pretty strong fantasy/sci-fi tale of one of the more outlandish Marvel characters. The strongest parts of the movie happen outside the Earth, in where the movie treats the audience with poetic and majestic imagery of Asgard and frosty Jotunheim.There was a genuine change, that Thor would have turned out ridiculous piece of crap. It has all the element, which in wrong hands would deliver a movie full of campy comedy gold. But instead of that, a seasoned filmer of Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh treats the more fantastical story elements with necessary seriousness and lightness, thus managing to turn the movie into an interesting, yet a bit flawed, introduction of Marvels version of an ancient Nordic deity.As I said before, the most interesting parts of the tale are told outside our fair planet, which serves as a scene of punishment, when Thor is cast away from Asgard, stripped from his powers. The people Thor meets there serve little more else than a path to bring god of Thunder back to Earth in the future Avengers movie. though the banishing of Thor itself is good story.I'd also give a nod to the cast, as the relatively new leads playing Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston) manage to out stage more seasoned Hopkins, who plays their father, Odin. But then again, Earth based characters, such as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) are left very shallow and ultimately uninteresting.On a final note, I saw Thor in 3D and found that to be utterly unnecessary, as while it didn't take anything away, it added very little as well. So if you can, I'd suggest you to see it in regular 2D.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Solid comic book movie,"I suppose any review of *Thor* ought to begin with the reviewer's expectations—if you're expecting a solid comic book/mythology movie with a strong sense of the comics ethos, a solid leading man who thoroughly inhabits all aspects of his character (from bathos to boorishness), a rather one-dimensional villain, and lots of rock 'em-sock 'em action encased in a simple, mediocre plot—then you will probably be satisfied with *Thor.* If you're expecting anything else, you can pass on this one. The best parts of the movie are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's adopted brother and the villain of this film (he's also the villain in *The Avengers,* a film that displays Hiddleston's acting talents to much greater effect). Ironically, the worst parts of the film are the two Oscar winners who inexplicably find themselves in a comic book movie trying to ACT all over the place. I'm talking about Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and the chief god, and Natalie Portman, who is allegedly a scientist/researcher but who turns into a mushy, goofy middle school girl whenever Thor flashes her a smile. Despite these two casting mistakes, the film is an enjoyable diversion, and it works well—as long as you're not expecting it to be something other than what it claims to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A great start for Thor's character arc,"Thor was definitely one of the films in the MCU that helped kick off for what was to come. It has a great story, good characters, and a great character arc for the start of the character Thor. Chris Hemsworth is great in his first outing as Thor and what I love about his portrayal here the most is what he has to go through in this film with learning not only just how to become a responsible leader and by having his powers stripped away from him, but also what it means to protect the innocent and what it really means to be worthy. Tom Hiddleston was literally born to play Loki and it was hard to believe he was almost casted as Thor, but I was so glad they didn't and I think Tom is too. He owns this role in every way possible by being not just charming, but very menacing when it's needed the most. Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a dream casting come true as the king and current ruler of Asgard and is definitely one of the most perfect castings in the MCU. Natalie Portman as Astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster is fantastic and probably my one of my favorite female characters to come to the MCU. Idris Elba as Heimdall is the wisest character of all in the film and one of the standouts that I wished we would of gotten just a little more of in this film. My only cons in this film really are I guess the frost giants could of been just a bit better as I felt they were some of the weakest villains ever in the MCU and how Chris Hemsworth's Thor's eyebrows were a little blonder than they should of been. Overall, Thor is definitely one of the films that helped kick off the MCU as we know today and is a bit underrated in my opinion just for the story alone.

Sit back and enjoy the action,"One of the better action flicks, it had a cohesive story line and good actors that helped bring this tale to life.I especially liked Chris Hemsworth (as Thor), and Natalie Portman (as Jane Foster), and their earthly relationship. It was interesting to see the Norse gods (future spin) and their tale in the modern world action films.Thor the son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), banished from Asgard for disobeying his father's orders. On Earth, he arrives without his powers and learns humility from the earthlings he meets. He falls in love with Jane and helps her regain her research from the government agents trying to steal their discoveries. Back on Asgard, his adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) tries to prove his worth to his father so that he will make him the king. But does this by deceit and betrayal of both his brother and his father.Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, who did a great job bringing theatrical drama to this spectacular action flick.

A great first installment that does everything it needs to do with what it is given.,"This film certainly holds up better than most of the MCU catalogue visually. I was genuinely surprised. Branagh captures the pure essence of the Thor comics and makes Asgard to be the most beautiful it has ever looked throughout the MCU.

Better than I remembered!,"Thinking back on this movie before rewatching it, I remembered so many scenes I thought I hated, but in context actually really enjoyed.

The action was surprisingly mediocre, some interesting effects to say the least some cool spinny flippy tricks here and there. The plot is actually quite good, its a tale of redemption and it works excellently, it hypes the ending and makes it overall more satisfying. Loki as a villain is pretty decent also, he really does a good job of making you hate him in this film, his arc was alright the turns were pretty predictable.

"Thor good, 3D don't bother.","Thor is a good movie not a great movie. Very easy to follow storyline for the kids, plenty of shirtless scenes of Thor for the Mums, plenty of loudness and action scenes for the dads. Should have seen this in 2D rather than 3D as this movie has been converted to and not filmed in 3D. I felt very ripped off and I urge anybody wanting to see any 3D films in future to read the Tech specs at IMDb before you see it. I should have but didn't. Also I think that the cinemas should make it clear in their advertising whether or not the film has been converted to or has been filmed in 3D.

Thor - 3.5 Stars,"""Thor"" is a movie adaptation of a popular comic book that stars good- looking people in the midst of wide spectacles of special effects. We get to see some fighting, flying, shouting, kissing, hammering, and also, a bit of shirtlessness. 150 million dollars was spent to make all of this happen. The season of summer movies has begun.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, ""Thor"" has very little depth and complexity that we saw in Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, or even in ""Spiderman 2"". But so what? It is made with skill, with humor, and it exhibits mighty action sequences that can make Superman jealous. That Thor guy and his heavenly hammer can do some serious damage. This is very fun.The Norse gods are enjoying peace and power in the land of Asgard, which is currently under the rule of its king, Odin, played by the famous Anthony Hopkins. But Odin's son, played by the soon-to-be famous Chris Hemsworth, desires to eliminate the Frost Giants, a race that Odin has a truce with. You see, Thor is arrogant and egotistic, and disobeys his father's orders to stay home. So he travels to Jotunheim, an ice ball the size of a planet, home of the Frost Giants.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/thor/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
an okay movie,"this movie was not as good as i expected. when it came to the action that was okay. but the plot and the dialouge and the ending was terrible. the movie starts out okay but then it,s all down hill from there. i liked the actors and actresses but i did not like the characters. but one things for sure this movie is not the worst movie ever i mean like i said it was okay but there are definitely more worst stuff that i have seen and you can trust me on that. one thing is that the actor that played Thor did a very fine acting job at portraying this character. all i have to say about Thor is it was okay. but one thing it was not was a bad movie so its worth a watchrated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci fi action violence and frightening images1hr 55min/115min**/****",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Mildly Entertaining; Nothing Wow About It,"Out of so many super hero movies that have been released quite lately I somehow find this to be pretty much the most ordinary of all - Very ordinary. Almost nothing here really entertain me. The flick felt empty without proper villain and without anything that is a major wow factor (scenes) to hold my interest too.I have never really care about character Thor in those Mythology stories since his stories has always seem so complicated to care about when I was a little boy, plus I don't really like his power that much –A Hammers with super strength? I never find it to be a ""cool"" superpower.Anyway I don't think those things have that much influence on my thought on the movie. The movie itself does have a solid script and storyline but it still lack many things, as I have mention earlier. There is nothing really to hold on to the movie. Sure they got A. Hopkins, N. Portman, C. Hemsworth and that is a brilliant cast but there are no captivate scene. I almost had forgotten this movie just two week earlier.Otherwise almost all the stuff is great; the actors did pretty decent jobs for their role. The CGI is brilliant and the wardrobe is quite stunning. But the lack of action sequence make this movie seem much slower than it should be. The Destroyer is absolutely stunning, though it only appear for like 3-5 mins.Recommendation: Yes, it is still mildly entertainment. Kids will enjoy it.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A strong set up movie for the Avengers,"Thor is the introduction of the god of thunder with an introduction and expansion for a lot of other big name characters and plot elements featured later in the MCU. With major characters like Stellan Skarsgard as Professor Erik Selvig, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, and Samuel L. Jackson as Agent Nick Fury with the small part by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye as well with various teasers throughout hinting at more to come possibly years later in the MCU too.Story wise this is my least favorite origin film in the MCU including second stage characters like Ant Man, Dr. Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy. When I first felt this film I didn't get the same impact I did from watching Iron Man or Captain America in their first movies in the series. And honestly this movie is very much a bridge movie. This was the last film in the series of origin stories until Avengers came out and this movie just exploded with setting up that film. With Tom Hiddleston's Loki being the main villain and the after credit scene setting up Avengers with showing more of Shield too, a lot more than any other film yet. It feels that the story is almost put on the back burner to get what is considered today to be 'the best team up movie of all time'. Even the romance story between Thor and Jane feels weak and hollow during it compared to Pepper and Tony, and Steve and Peggy.Directing wise, Kenneth Branagh, who's famous for 'The Murder on the Orient Express', 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Directed this film instead of producing and acting like he typically does in cinema's. Overall this film is probably my least favorite film he's directed because of the over use of dutch angles. I don't mind them when their used sparingly but when every other scene or every third scene is on a very dramatic dutch angle it bugs me and honestly gives me a headache. They also feel misused during production of this film. They worked very well in the interrogation scenes and some of the fight scenes early on but when it's just normal dialogue scenes, it gets sickening.Writing wise done by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Don Payne. They did a good job defining the dialogue and making each character feel unique with their sentence choices and feel special and not so generic. The small scenes of comedy comes very strongly too like the Stark jokes throughout and Thor adjusting to Earth are very funny and makes some boring scenes enjoyable and almost memorable. The best performance on the whole movie that was written perfectly for Hiddleston is Loki. He comes off so relatable but so hateable as well and it makes the film so much more enjoyable. And especially with his mixed emotion during various scenes makes the audience really puzzled on what his next moves will be.Acting wise and special effects all look good. It bugs me that they bleached Hemsworth's eyebrows though to stick to the blond while in Avengers and every Thor movie after that they stick to his dirty blonde brows instead. But the costume designs and set designs look amazing, by far the biggest production of the MCU so far and the special effects have a big jump in it too compared to even Captain America which came out roughly 3 months before Thor.This film had a lot of potential and sadly fell short on a few things but gave us a strong bridging movie for the upcoming Avengers that premiered a year after this. It is still a fun movie that has some great characters in it and expands the universe for the MCU.Thor gets a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This drink I like it! ANOTHER!,"""You may criticise the lack of humour, at times the seriousness, at times the CGI. What you cannot deny, are the beautiful shoots, the friendly introduction of Asgard, Thor superpowers, the backstory of Loki -which will determine the MCU's future- and the chemistry between human-god attitudes towards New Mexico's locals. Thor is not a masterpiece but a triumph beyond earth""Before watching the movie, I received so much criticism thereof. Until the point of calling it some of the ""worst projects MCU has ever embraced"". So, as you could see, I was hopeless. Nonetheless, as I wrote before, we are wrong when we believe prejudging is the best way to rate movies. I had to make sure that it was as it was told. Therefore, I wanted to watch it until the last second. My opinion? It was so entertaining I could not stand up from my sit. There are some movies where you do not give a damn and whosoever who interrupts you, you don't feel bothered. However, when I sat down whereas I was watching it, I felt completely concentrated. It is to this point you realise that the movie earned its own merits. The reason? A good continuity where the last movie (Iron Man) left with S.H.I.E.L.D. Perhaps it could have been more dynamic. Yet the fresh performances of Hemsworth and Hiddleston were significantly important. Not to mention Natalie Portman, who was as lovely as most of people wanted to. Perhaps it did not have so much action but the very beginning. Well, it was compensated with the realm and its vast fields. I know, this flick has got also its faults. It sometimes puzzles you wherever the shoot is being taken, it sometimes results boring due to the redundant I-have-never-ever-been-on-earth-before Thor's attitude. Likewise, Thor's gang do not play a key role during the display.Nonetheless, you guys have to give it the credit of the top-notch performances, the sometimes-gorgeously made CGI and a convincing intro of Asgard. Equally, the chemistry between Portman and Hemsworth and their relationship. Nice job MCU! (70/100)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not terrible, but not very mighty either","Thor has a lot of great elements like the visual effects are great, the score by Patrick Doyle is epic, all of the scenes on Asgard are fascinating and written well, some of the acting is great (Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins bring their A game), the action is fun, and the movie is good looking. Where the problems come in is everything on earth sucks. Not only is the comedy there weak, but the characters on earth are boring (and badly acted by Natalie Portman). On top of that, it's the same fish out of water story that is very predictable, the Romance is uninteresting, and the camera work can get annoying with the constant use of Dutch angles in every scene.

A step up for the MCU,"It would have been easy for the fourth entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to collapse in a heap of silliness: the elaborate costumes; the extravagant playland that is Asgard (which somewhat resembles the Emerald City); the complicated retelling of Norse mythology. You need actors with the weight and seriousness of Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba just to bring off the headgear. But this film has everything it needs to hold itself up and extra to boot. Rene Russo, for example, doesn't have nearly enough to do as Thor's mother. Director Kenneth Branagh and his small army of screenplay and story writers structure this as a basic hero's journey, mining culture and legend for little tropes that fit nicely. Thor's gang-of-five recall Robin Hood's Merry Men, except that here one is Jamie Alexander as the fiercely capable Lady Sith. Resonances with some of Shakespeare's history plays are interwoven without being too pointed. Unlike with Marvel's previous two entries, here the characters who remind everyone that ""The Avengers"" is coming aren't distractingly shoehorned in. Mostly, no one forgets to have fun with all this, especially not Chris Hemsworth in the deceptively simple title role. Not only does he look every bit the Man-God he's supposed to be, he hits all the emotional marks the story throws his way with the right mix of humor, arrogance and sincerity, and plays well off the other actors. The film's secret weapon is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, easily Marvel's best villain to date, who connives and deceives with the wit and aplomb you'd expect from a legendary trickster. Hiddleston manages the complicated feat of making Loki both fun to watch and someone to be wary of because of his unpredictability. ""Thor"" doesn't quite reach ""Iron Man""'s heights, but it is a good return to form after two lackluster MCU entries.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor a big dud,"Thor may be the god of thunder, but the movie ""Thor"" is the god of disappointment.The first volley of the summer movie season is a misfire -- a dull dud that fails as a spectacle, an adventure film or even a good movie.What is most shocking is that Kenneth Branagh, a fine actor who has worked wonders with his many cinematic Shakespearean adaptations, directed ""Thor."" Here, he fails to create any sense of excitement or wonder. Nor can he inject some life into any of the characters, with the exception of the villainous Loki.His Thor, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, is an arrogant oaf who, without his hammer, looks more like a sullen Chippendale dancer or a lost member of the Bee Gees rather than the Norse god of thunder.At times it seems Thor's hammer shows more personality than its owner.For more, go to jconline.com and check out the complete review by Journal & Courier movie critic Bob Bloom.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The best MCU movie so far, and first 3D effort","I'm going through the MCU for the first time due to currently being awed by watching movies on the giant isolated virtual screen of Meta Quest 3...especially for 3D! Of course, I felt obligated to do the first three which have no 3D-production: Iron Man 1 was good stuff: 7/10. Hulk was terrible: 3/10. Iron Man 2 middling: 5/10.Thankfully back on track with the first 3D MCU movie: Thor also really ups the fantastic-elements: going off-world introducing us to alien gods, no less! While the CGI-created Asgard looks dated it's still imaginatively designed, and their culture is convincingly portrayed by the three figureheads of Odin, Thor & Loki being played by skilled charismatic actors, armed with a quality script. Drama, thrills & humour all find a nice balance. The nods to actual Norse mythology were fun!Things are a little less convincing, ironically enough, on Earth with Natalie Portman's crew. Especially the romance element didn't feel organic, more like a script shoehorn. I'm not familiar with the comics, but on film the romance doesn't quite convince. The 'final boss' being an Iron Man knock-off also doesn't feel worthy of the Norse gods.Jotunheim & their Frost Giants are engagingly designed, however. Thor's hero's journey, while hardly original, is neatly told. The 3D-effect was fine, tho' nothing spectacular.Thor - the movie - just edges out the more grounded Iron Man 1 as the best MCU film so far.

Lots of Humour... Lots of Drama... & a guy with a BIG hammer!,"I had heard one or two good things about this one before seeing it and so I was looking forward to a nice afternoon's entertainment on a wet Saturday in Yorkshire. It was good, but didn't quite live up to my initial expectations. Instead, I got something with a lot more humour than expected and a lot more drama too, but I guess when you're dealing with the Gods, drama is obligatory.We begin with Thor arriving on Earth and immediately being run over by a vehicle owned by storm chaser, Jane Foster. We then get some explanation of how he ended up there this is quite long and involved, but necessary. In Asgard Thor was war-like and hot headed and, prompted by his brother, Loki, he had defied his father, Odin, and his actions almost caused a war. So Odin took Thor's powers and banished him to Earth. He also sent his hammer with the proviso that it could only be held by someone worthy. Back with Thor, Jane is interested in the 'storm' that brought him to Earth and offers to help him find his hammer if he will tell her about it. Unfortunately, by the time they get to where it's landed, agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. are already there. Back in Asgard Odin falls into a deep sleep and Loki takes over as king, he has his reasons, but I'm not going to tell you what they are here. Believing Thor to be a greater threat to him, he sends the Guardian, a great warrior entity, to destroy him and all those who would oppose it. Can Thor find the humility his father desires to see in him and regain his powers? Will he get the girl at least? All these questions and more are answered in the film I'm not telling you here.As I said at the beginning, there is an awful lot of humour in this film, a lot more than I expected. Of course, Stan Lee gets his little cameo it wouldn't be the same without him. Unfortunately, I found the plot very complicated and there was an awful lot of dialogue explaining everything which tended to get in the way of the story. Having said that, the visuals are quite stunning, the scenes in Asgard and the other worlds are quite breathtaking.Performance wise, everybody did a pretty good job, newcomer Chris Hemsworth was pretty good as Thor, his voice matched the character really well and he had the physical presence too. Natalie Portman, although not at all stretched, did a decent job as Jane Foster. Tom Hiddleston was well cast as Loki, as was Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Honourable mentions go to Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig and Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis.Over all, although I found it a little long and the plot was a little wordy and hard to follow in places, I pretty much enjoyed this film. One teenager was heard to announce to the audience as he was leaving the cinema that he thought it was 'shit', but I'm not going to listen to this budding 'critic'. There were enough good things about this film to make me want to watch it again sometime maybe not for a while, but it certainly wasn't 'shit' Recommended.My Score: 7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Norse version of Crocodile Dundee with hammer and tongs,"An American fantasy adventure; A story about a Norse god who is banished from his mystical realm just as he is about to ascend the throne and uses an earthling for guidance to recover his mystic hammer, though his brother plots his own rise to power. Tom Hiddleston, as the weaker of the two sons who claims power unduly, is effective. Chris Hemsworth makes a good fist of his role, convincing us of his alpha male traits. The visual effects of the distant realm are pleasingly colourful, but they look computer-generated rather than mystical. The fight scenes and use of sound are tremendous. How the film is held together depends on the story, and that is where the film disappears down the wormhole, so to speak. It is essentially a bridging of special effects sequences, and not much is built into the feeling for us to care about. Certainly, there is not enough feeling between the brothers for us to think Thor cares quite as much about his brother by the end. All the fantastical characters are not interesting. They're defined by their attributes, not their personalities. But there is enough in the film to spark the imagination. All in all, it was enjoyable and quite funny.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The MCU spreads its cosmic wings.,"(Full disclosure - Thor was my favorite comic/hero as a kid, so this may get rated higher as a result...or maybe I just think this movie is better than everyone else.)The good - Very strong (and fun) supporting cast. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgård outshine Natalie Portman on Earth, and Jamie Alexander as Sif, with her warriors three, kick ass in Asgard. Throw in Clark Gregg, Jeremy Renner and Idris Elba and you have the deepest (in quality and quantity) of any cast so far in the MCU. Yet, (with the possible exception of the warriors three) I felt they were more than just one dimensional characters.The great - The relationship between Loki and Thor was bang on perfect. I also bought Loki's transition from mischief maker to truly evil. I also bought Thor's transition...his moment at the hammer was powerful. Hemsworth's Thor and Hiddleston's Loki are perfect for me, Loki being the harder role to pull off.The only so-so - As hot as Natalie Portman is, has she ever been able to pull off any on- screen chemistry with her co-stars (Black Swan excluded...hubba hubba)? I half wanted Thor to end up with Darcy!Summary - I really like this movie. It's subject matter is a bit freaky, so it is never going to have the impact of something like Iron Man's redemption story, but it is a fun romp. The movie is very funny at times (with some wonderful physical comedy from Hemsworth) and I found parts of it moving.

"It did deliver, but...","I am not overly a fan of superhero movies, but ""Thor"" wasn't too bad actually.Certainly, the storyline was suffering a bit from being made from a weak broth, because there could have been so much more added to the movie to give it depth and a fuller meaning. It is like the movie just superficially delves into the the different aspects of the story that it is setting out to tell. So it is a bit of a tame, shallow experience.But what the movie lacks in meaningful storytelling it more than makes up for with CGI and effects. Wow! Especially Asgard, now that place looked amazing. There were so many awesome effects and details here, it was pure eye-candy.One thing did puzzle me, though. Taking hold in the Norse mythology, why is there a Japanese guy running around amongst these immortals? That just didn't make any sense at all.The cast in the movie was quite good. Chris Hemsworth (playing Thor) did a good job, and I believe this is the first time I have seen him in a movie. Anthony Hopkins (playing Odin), delivered a good performance, as usual, though he wasn't much on the screen. Now, the two guys that impressed me the most in ""Thor"" was Stellan Skarsgård (playing Erik Selvig) and Idris Elba (playing Heimdall).The costumes and outfits in the movie were off the chart. I loved the Asgardian outfits and suits of armor. They looks awesome and had lots of detail to them.So all in all, ""Thor"" does provide a good evenings worth of entertainment, because there is action from start till end.

Not that good - see it only if you feel like it,"There are two contrasting worlds.

When this is all getting too heavy we move into New Mexico on planet Earth with the rather girlish Natalie Portman for comic relief. Somehow it doesn't quite succeed - it feels schizophrenic. There isn't much chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. He although a bit inexpressive facially does portray an other worldliness but she just seems silly. She wasn't a good choice. The dialog could have been better - it's rather heavy and obvious. Didn't really feel for any of the characters. The only humor comes from Thor being like a bull in a china shop on Earth. It's not very consistent. Overall missable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor - the coolest part is just after the ending!! :),"Wait till after the movie closing credits finish – that's the coolest thing about Thor!!!The biggest thing that everybody misses in Thor is the ending – and by ending, I mean after all the closing credits are rolled out. Remember to stay EVEN after the credits are done. Trust me, that's what everybody misses!!! And that adds an element of intrigue, ""WOW"" and a sense of still more to come to the movie.This is not the first time a Marvel Comics movie had a similarly unexpected ending. I simply loved Iron Man. Tony Stark defied the superhero stereotype by being a womanizing, arrogant and wealthy prick, who lived life king size. And what made the whole movie work is the choice of the charming n charismatic Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. Unlike other superhero movies like Spiderman and Batman where we always used to wait for the scenes where the superhero showed up, in Iron Man, I was just waiting for more scenes with Tony Stark. But one of the coolest Tony Stark scenes is actually not in Iron Man – it's in the ending of another movie, the Hulk.Marvel Comics has been shuffling superhero presences across their various offerings. Not many people noticed, but after the closing credits of Iron Man 2, the movie actually ends with a scene where the SHIELD agent, Agent Coulson, calls up his boss and says, ""Sir, We found it "" and then the movie ends with an image of Thor's hammer!!! (sure, go ahead n check it out :)).The news is that Marvel has one more movie coming out in July this year in Captain America, after which you'll see all the four, i.e, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor and Captain America coming together next year in The Avengers. Thor is an extension of Marvel's strategy to build superhero property out of its comics and monetize them.Thor is the story of a warrior god, who is arrogant and too ballsy for his own good, who gets tamed to then become the King. Interspersed in this story is a hint of love (with Oscar winner Natalie Portman), sibling rivalry between Thor and his god brother Loki, his rocky relation with his father (Antony Hopkins) and all this with some great special effects.An interesting thing about Thor is that even the Gods above agree that life on Earth is hell – so the God King, Thor's father, sends his son god to exile as punishment - to Earth! Thor's scenes on earth where he interacts with humans do provide some comic moments.It's a good movie nevertheless. The way the Heavens have been created with the visuals and costumes is very commendable. The story, even though kinda corny, has been adapted very well to screen. Chris Hemsworth is just right as Thor – the dude has got a body to kill for and in the scene where he tries to lift the hammer from the mud, he looks almost believable as a god. The Oscar winners did a decent job with their parts with Antony Hopkins having more meat to his role. See the ending after credits to know which character really scores.But at the end of the day, Thor is just too goody goody a movie – it's just another regular good movie. Even the finale fights were found wanting. Bottom line is: It's a good movie but it doesn't have the uber coolness of Iron Man or the depth of The Dark Knight.But great fare for the summer. So just get the pop corn and sit back to enjoy!!!And don't forget to stay after the credits!!:)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Two different movies,"This was a decent start to one of the best characters in the whole MCU. What makes this movie difficult to watch, is the sudden switch in tone and theme. All of the scenes on Asgard are truly beautiful, but the scenes on earth are quite boring to be fair. Loki is a good villain in this, but not used to full potential. Jane isn't really one of the best love interests, even though i don't hate her. This movie isn't bad or anything, just a little bit forgettable and boring in some parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a Thor loser,"Thor is exactly what a comic-book movie ought to be – it's packed with action and great effects, it's true to its source material, it gives us characters we actually care about, and it's a tense melodrama with connections to Shakespeare. The entire cast is engaging – and some very nice to look at, depending on your persuasion – and all in all it's a well-told glorious spectacle.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an Asgardian prince, son of King Odin (check your Norse mythology). Hot-headed, impetuous, prone to violence, and quite full of himself, he is nonetheless next in line for the throne. Just before his coronation is complete, however, intruders from Jotunheimm infiltrate Asgard; although they're quickly dispatched, Thor demands revenge, and against his father's explicit orders, he and his friends (including his brother, Loki) travel to Jotunheim to seek answers – and kick butt, if necessary and possible. Odin finds out and saves them, but he strips Thor of his powers – including his great hammer, Mjolnir, and banishes him to Earth to teach him a lesson in humility.This banishment serves to open the door for treachery in Asgard, allowing the Frost Giants of Jotunheim to wage war against the Asgardians. Meanwhile, some of that trouble is spilled toward Earth, where Thor has fallen under the romantic spell of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Suffice to say that bad things come at the populace of a small town in New Mexico, with only a now-mortal Thor able to help them.But this movie is about more than just bad guys plotting to take over the universe; it's about father-son relationships and the rivalry between a favored son and ""the other brother."" There's a lot of Henry V and King Lear afoot, and this is due in no small part to the movie's director, the great Kenneth Branagh. Branagh is not the first person you'd think of to direct a movie based on a comic book, but he manages here to not only keep the expected characterizations and plot fresh but also to instill a sense of classicism and wonderment.The CGI is pretty well utilized (although some of the early scenes in Jotunheim made me realize they WERE computer generated, which is almost the opposite of what you'd want), and what's more it doesn't seem to distract from the plot. In some movies, effects serve as noise to prevent the audience from discovering that the story doesn't make much sense. Branagh isn't subtle in his use of technology, but this isn't a movie that really should be subtle. Thor himself certainly isn't.Hemsworth, a newcomer to the States from Australia, is solid in the title role, much better than, say, Sam Worthington would have been. Hemsworth is sturdy and ripped, so he fits Thor's physical description, but he can also do a little bit of the acting as well. Portman, you may recall, is now an Oscar winner, and she's a delight here in a role similar to Liv Tyler's and Jennifer Connelly's in the two recent Hulk films; the smart femme fatale. In fact, her character reminded me quite a bit of Jodie Foster's character in Contact – a determined, resolved, super-smart researcher determined to find out what in Sam Hill is going on around here.Anthony Hopkins plays Odin as you'd expect Anthony Hopkins to play a king: regally, with a weary toughness. Idris Elba, Kat Denning, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hiddleston, Ray Stevenson, and a couple of uncredited cameos are also well cast.You can expect to see more of Thor and his stories – his Thories? – in the coming years. This movie is a product of Marvel Studios, and upcoming releases will focus on other Marvel Comics' characters, such as Captain America and The Avengers. Plus there are to be reboots of Spider-Man and (maybe) The Hulk. And they'll all tie together, along with Iron Man.So Thor is every bit as entertaining as I thought it'd be. It's classy without being out of reach for the rest of us; it's not some highfalutin Royal Theater production, but neither is it a simple slam-bang cacophony of senseless violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: The God of Thunder,"My father always told me to watch more super heros movies and series. But I always thought that they were boring.When my dad asked me to watch Thor with him, I excepted, but was really questioning the movie.It was AMAZING.The actors did an amazing job, and the costumes were great.It was also really funny, which I love, and they made scary or serious situations into a funny part with jokes.Theres drama, because Thor does something really dum and his father banishes him, so the movie is really into family problems, in all of the movies this happens, the relationship between the brother and the other brother and the sons and there father.I thought it was really good. Go watch it now. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Borderline Good,"Thor is one of those movies that fuels film debates for me, because I cannot decide if it was good or bad.On the good side, it's a very interesting take on a comic book movie. Kenneth Branagh does an excellent job of portraying the very Shakespearean relationship between Thor, Loki, and Odin. He also makes liberal use of dutch angles, which do evoke the comics somewhat. It's also quite fun to watch.But the writing on this is terrible. The plot, really comes down to two things, the relationship between Thor, Loki, and Odin, and Thor needing to prove himself as king. If the whole movie was focused on that and not concerned with the love story or setting up The Avengers, it might have become great. Instead we get a crappy love story crammed between a more interesting one, that makes no sense, with two leads have absolutely zero chemistry.I never once felt bad for Thor or felt like he was facing a credible threat like I did when watching other films in the Marvel series. Maybe it's me. He always felt a little too cartoony for me to take seriously.That said the casting on this film was spot on. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston makes an excellent Loki. Although Marvel would redeem itself with its portrayal of Thor in later movies, for a first effort, this was a pretty terrible vehicle to introduce the character.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good intro for a popular series,"After getting exiled from Asgard as a result of his foolish and disrespectful actions, Thor is sent to Midgard (Earth) as an ordinary man. Seeking to redeem himself in front of his father, the king, he will begin the search for his lost hammer with the help of a local scientist which happens to be investigating the stars right where he landed.It's a fantastic movie which presents the World in which Thor and his friends and foes undergo their adventures. Being faced with this new exiled status, Thor's character must evolve from a spoiled and self-centered boy to a prince worthy of his father's crown. And this is exactly what this movie is about, with a bit of positive and negative help from the inhabitants of earth. The movie is filled with action sequences, which, accompanied by some wonderful CGI, make it a very good watch. The plot is good for this ""introduction"", but nothing extraordinary, with a bit of drama here and there and a bit of suspense, but again, nothing that can wow the viewer in any way. The producers decided to take a quite serious approach regarding this one, with little comedy aspects silently inserted from time to time, very good for changing the mood.As said before, it's an intro movie, designed to present Thor and his fantastic world, clearly leaving plenty of space for future sequels, which is to be seen for its action and CGI, aspects at which it is very good. It is a bit left behind by its plot cannot raise high enough to impress, but makes this film an overall good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Boring and very disappointing,"I came to this movie with high expectations as I as a boy always loved Marvel comics and have really enjoyed the adaptations of Spiderman, The Hulk and Iron Man. Well the experience was not accentuated by the 3D experience. The lead of Thor was some unknown and he was as wooden as balsam wood and the fish out of water scenario has been done too many times. Anthony Hopkins mailed in this performance I think he is taking over from Micheal Caine for the I will do anything for a buck prestige actor and reigning Oscar winner Natalie Portman must have done this to add to her Q rating and to have people say that they have seen her in a movie besides her art-house genre. The action was sporadic to me and just went on like Chinese water torture..The only good part no presence of Samuel L Jackson for this upcoming Avengers movie orelse i would have had to give this movie a 0",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Nonsensical comic book yarn, carrying itself with a serious tone that it doesn't warrant","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThor (Chris Hemworth), who in ancient Greek mythology was the God of Thunder, finds himself banished from his home planet by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) after disobeying him and nearly starting a war with the 'ice killers' (or something like that.) Anyway, he crash lands on earth, where he happens upon young researcher Jane (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) who are having their own problems with some local government bureaucrats, which makes him come in handy when he forms a friendship with them after they teach him about earth ways and customs. Meanwhile, back on his home planet, his jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assumes the throne when Odin dies, setting Thor on a course to return home and begin a battle to the death that will encompass both planets.Kenneth Branagh is a name that appears to have disappeared to the sidelines in the movie art form, with me last hearing of his name in his initial home of the theatre in some production he was doing there. Here, he appears to have done a bit of a Clint Eastwood and stayed out of view behind the camera, where he's graced this production with his particular style of pomp and grandiose directing. Within the medium of the comic book film, from the iconic Marvel chain line and borrowing from the ancient Greek mythical character, he is in his element, with all the right ingredients to make this the marvellous romp it could have been. Something just falls flat with Thor, though, never coming to life or working as the great fun it could have been.Even by comic book film standards, this is complete nonsense, not helped by a distinctly humourless streak and a camera man who can't seem to hold it at a straight angle at various important shots in the film. As the titular Thor, Hemsworth carries the role decently enough, with a dashing arrogance that the role requires, whilst Hopkins invests an energy and gusto into his role that doesn't really fit the material. None of the supporting cast, from Portman to Skarsgard, are bad, either, it's just this is one big, lumbering mess of a film, with a bone headed steak that is the biggest surprise of all from the refined Branagh. **",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Thor, the god of thunder",There is something so nostalgic about this movie.

Onward For Asgard !!,"Nice production of a difficult character to bring to live screen. The story compresses lot of elements from the comic into a 97 minutes movie, and they did a very good job of it.The story succeeds in picking out the best elements from the comic, and puts it into one fine movie. The Odin sleep, the Destroyer, Loki, Sif. The lavish production really succeeds in capturing the godliness of the characters, and magnificent design of Asgard. I really loved the story, and the excitement. I hope they'll do a sequel with Ulik the troll, and Mangog.The movie really captures the essence of Thor in his bravery, nobility along his friends from Asgard. Not to mention his awesome power.Sif drawn by Jack Kirby to me was the most beautiful and noble woman ever to be seen in Comics. I grew up thinking that I'd meet a lady like her one of these days, and it hasn't happened yet.One thing that caught my eye was that there was an Asian character dining in Asgard. It's politically correct, but having Asians in the kingdom of Norse gods is kind of a reverse discrimination.A+ production and a fine movie to watch !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Nutshell Review: Thor,"One of the main issues with the ambitious Avengers film is the introduction of the less than scientific, reality based elements of the Marvel films and characters to date, where radiation is root cause for the creation of The Hulk, Fantastic Four and Spider-man, and technology behind the likes of Tony Stark's Iron Man, meaning they're not too far fetched if you're a fan of science fiction. Even gene mutation still falls within the boundaries of believability. But with Thor comes something from the magical and fantasy realm, which undoubtedly will open the door to more powerful villains not bounded by the laws of physics at least, but still with the villain possessing incredible powers, unless the story is compelling, we're going to find ourselves stuck with a massively powerful hero, what more when he's a god?Which is what made Thor somewhat a refreshing change in the way comic book heroes are portrayed in recent years, whether DC (who will have its hands full with Superman, sharing the same pain points), or Marvel. Enter Kenneth Branagh to try and make Thor more palatable to the reality so far in the Marvel film base, hitting it off where Iron Man 2 had hinted at its ending, before introducing us to a brief history of Asgard and Odin (Anthony Hopkins), together with his sons Thor and Loki and that aged old feud with the Frost Giants. In fact the story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich is already found in the theatrical trailers, with the arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) being cast from his would be throne and onto Earth, and finding himself to be quite the mortal without his mythical hammer Mjolnir which he has to find with the help of scientists Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kate Dennings).AS I mentioned earlier, the story is purely functional at this stage, going from scene to scene in quite the fish out of water fashion where the Nordic god of thunder finds himself caught up in poor slapstick comedy (how many times can he be hit by a vehicle?). Redemption doesn't come easy for the big guy even as he's made to feel guilty for his misdeeds when on Asgard that his brother never failed to remind him of, making Loki (Tom Hiddleston) chief villain just because he's looking toward being the favoured son of Odin. Yes the main villain of the story uses more of his brains than brawn, but is no pushover when the situation calls for a more physical response.And the battle sequences impressed, which is kind of a surprise since I never associated Branagh as one who can film kinetically charged action for the big screen. With Thor's magical prowess brought about by Mjolnir, the CG here lives up in crafting the kind of extravaganza and incredible spectacle when Thor wields his trusty hammer into battle, twirling, throwing, flying and calling in some mean looking, bad weather associated reinforcements. A film like this couldn't possibly be done years ago, and technology coupled with an artistic team's imagination and reference from Thor's source material, made the big battle sequences interesting. But I will add that one should steer clear of 3D since it's converted in post production, with nothing that truly stood out to justify the viewing in 3D.Chris Hemsworth was a relatively unknown Australian, but I guess like Hugh Jackman this could be his ticket into the big league, having to look the part of the hero and portray him to a T with that streak of arrogance that required a lesson in humility and about the sanctity of life. Yes although it doesn't call for tremendous acting chops, I suppose looking the part and playing it convincingly with those rippling muscles, is already half the battle won. Anthony Hopkins lends that bucket load of gravitas as Odin (just as how Liam Neeson's Zeus in the Clash of the Titans remake was welcomed), while Tom Hiddleston as Loki provided that conflicting villain who's an excellent liar corrupted by power.While it has the benefit of Hollywood It Girl Natalie Portman counted amongst its ranks as the main squeeze that Thor falls for, the romance here is a little bit stretched as well, since the two hardly spend quality time together to develop genuine feelings, with Jane sealing the deal just because Thor looks good when he got his groove back, armour, weapon and all, together with that sparkle in those blue eyes surrounded by those golden facial locks. The characterization of Jane Foster is wafer thin, and the love story lacked any real emotional depth, relying on a mere summary of someone else's narration than to come from pure feelings, but I guess having her around lends star appeal to the film.And as for cameos (look away now if you choose not to be spoilt), well, look out for Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye who saved all nuances of action for Avengers, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury making his much ado about nothing appearance in the coda after the film proper, although in Thor's case it turned out to be a little bit weaker since it's supposed to tease into Avengers directly, and well, expecting something really does take the fun out of anything.Thor the film did what it had to, and successfully introduced the character to film audiences in anticipation of a huge ensemble in The Avengers. It's getting crowded, but here's a feather in the cap for Marvel in having to chalk up another expected blockbuster and hopefully boosting comic book sales as well. Highly recommended, and I can't wait for the rest of the slated Marvel heroes to appear on the big screen in weeks to come!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I continue the Marvel series and Thor is a different pleasure (7.2),"Thor is a mystical god and watching his story gives it a separate pleasure because the subject is interesting we travel to different universes and planets. It is more enjoyable to watch than other Marvel films.I think the visual effects were successful, the subject was nice, but the action is not enough.
There are ridiculous scenes and it sounded like total integrity could not be achieved, I would have expected the end of the movie better.

A good old fun Super-hero flick!,"There was something different about ""Thor"". Whilst not being the best super-hero film in the world, it was a great one and the best one since ""The Dark Knight"". However it was the first one in a while where it was a full on fantasy super-hero film where there are no possibilities and their powers are shown in a great way. There was a great balance of how much the Asgardian world was shown and how Earth was shown. Chris Hemsworth played the arrogant turned humble god Thor, however i think the star of the film was Tom Middleston for his acting had more depth expected from a super-hero film. Natalie Portman was OK, nothing amazing but nothing awful. Overall a good cast to bring to life a great film. Also the amazing thing worth noting is that there is no sexual scenes or strong language! See, you can have no swear words or rude scenes and you can still enjoy a great film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Dumb byt Fun Superhero Flick,"Marvel Comics has released a great number of films in the past few years. Some like Iron Man and Spider Man 2 have been downright awesome. Others, like Elektra and The Hulk, have sucked dishwater. Their latest offering, Thor falls somewhere in between, but is closer to a blockbuster than a bomb.The basic story is that Thor (Chris Hemsworth), heir to the throne of Asgard, is banished to Earth by his father Odin for breaking a truce with the frost giants. Stripped of his powers, he must come to terms with life in the mortal realm, and his own limitations. More importantly, with help from astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) he must find a way home and stop the machinations of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddlesto. The story is mostly faithful to his comic book origin story, although there have been some major simplifications.Purists may complain about the ease with which the destroyer armor is defeated or the reimagining of Bifrost Bridge, and I'm not sure why they made Hiemdal the gatekeeper black, except that they figured the movie needed a black guy. I also think that Asgard's visual look is too shiny and futuristic. I'd rather see a city of stone towers and battlements, and grand halls and longhouses. This Asgard looks more like the home of space aliens than Norse gods.More serious is that even with the simplifications that have been made to the storyline, there's still too much material packed into the two-hour running time. An extra half hour, or maybe even an hour should have been added so that the movie didn't feel so rushed, and to provide more time for character development. And while we're on the movie's weaknesses, I must say that I doubt a government agency would free a man who had broken into a secure facility just because a local scientist vouched for him. Then again, this is a thriller, adapted from a comic book, so I should be expecting a fair amount of improbabilities.What saves the film in large part is its excellent casting. Natalie Portman is charming and intelligent as always, although I felt her character wasn't given enough to do. Hiddleston is highly convincing as the scheming Loki, and I liked Anthony Hopkins as Odin, though I'm sure this was a walk in the park for an actor of his talent. It's Hemsworth who makes the biggest impression though. Thor is the role that he was born to play. Not only does he look the part, with his beard and his bulging muscles, but he perfectly captures Thor's earnestness and vitality, as well as his arrogance and stubbornness.Which brings me to another of the film's strengths. These days, movies are filled with protagonists who suffer self doubt, or must let loose and trust their emotions. Now 'following your heart' and 'believing in yourself' aren't necessarily bad things, but they've become clichés in contemporary film. Thor has exactly the opposite problem. He far too self assured, and would rather take names and crack heads than step back and look at things rationally. He's cocky, he's reckless, and he gives no thought to the consequences of his actions. He reminds me of some guys I knew on the high-school football team. If he wants to save the people he cares about and claim his birthright, he'll have to learn humility, discretion, and mercy.Another strong point is comic relief. The opening scene, in which the scientists run into, and tazer Thor, is hysterical. And I loved the part where the local hicks compete to see who can lift his enchanted hammer, while onlookers grill and knock back some brews. The action is also very good, especially the battle with the frost giants. And Stan Lee's obligatory cameo is perfectly timed.
Thor isn't as awesome as it could, and perhaps should, have been, but as a summer adventure flick, it works. I had a good time, and if Thor is any indication, I'm definitely looking forward to next year's Avengers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: move ur hammer a bit more!!!,"I was waiting for this movie for a long time. Had very vague idea about THOR, only read in mythology about him and then knew that there is comic strip about him. So, I was very much excited and eager for this movie.3D: It was in 3D and that sucks. Most of the close-ups have not 3D effect. I know because I watched half of the movie without the 3D specs! It might be my cinema hall or the movie, but at the same theater I had watched ""Megamind"" which had some average 3D. Thor is bad 3D. Watch it in 2D medium only. Would cost you less and would not have to keep the heavy glass on your nose for 2 hours.Story: I had a faint idea about story. Its the beginning of Thor,so more explanation and less action. I did not come across one movie which handled a superhero beginning movie with balanced story and action; SpiderMan1 and Batman begins are such perfect movies to name. IN short Thor is long, and story is hurried.Direction and acting: Well he had nothing to do exceptional. Not much emotional scene. Only one scene of conflict with Loki and Odin, where Odin said nothing and Tom Hiddleston as Loki did good. Natalie Portman...obviously she signed this movie before ""Black Swan"" else she would have never accepted it. Has a hairline role, half of the time she is shouting to SHIELD personnel or her colleagues. Rest of the crew was average, nothing much to do apart from gasping...something landed(Thor)!!!...something landed again(hammer)!!!somethings(Thor's friends) landed again....something(that robot) landed again... see lotsa moments for gasping!!! That too I've not mentioned about when they launch to sky...Action: I'm disappointed here. A superhero movie to me is full of action and demise of villain. Isn't that the only reason we have superheroes?!!! Am I asking too much? To beat some police personnel we have Statham here who always becomes a baddie and beats the sh1t out of police guys in all his movies. If u bring a hero, give him a worthy opponent, else his greatness is shadowed...Editing: The length is too much and actions are far between. Should have been short. How long? Well, its 114 min and has less action than ""Iron Man 2"" Dialog: Few witty and funny lines and most of corny and clichéd lines.Summary: Watch it in 2D and have patience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most boring movie,Plot as advertised seems interesting but is a pure bore as nothing as expected happens and I just kept waiting throughout the movie that something good is about to happen. Thor was expected to be a hero on earth but he hardly did anything heroic. Don't know what the actress was doing in it. And the other punks with him also looked awful and not able to fight at all. Plot was as such taken from the marvel comic character but it hardly did anything new. So it seems you wanna hear some more.

One of the best marvel properties yet,"Thor is easily one of marvels hardest properties to bring to the big screen and could have turned out for the worst with being received as corny, cheesy, or just too hard to understand, but leave it to the folks at marvel to get it right. After seeing this movie having to know nothing about Thor, I have to say this is the best marvel film yet and was told in the best way possible that a story like this could be told. The people behind the making of this film do a great job of taking the source material of the comic and reshaping it enough that it stays true to the comic, but also making it have a sense of realism to it so that the audience can relate to it. They make the actors feel like GODS when they need to, but sprinkle a bit of emotion that makes them feel human in a way. The director does a great job with what is given to him and does a good job of making the audience believe what is going on during the movie (jumping from different universes and such). The pacing of the movie adds a little extra to the story line because it gives away small doses of who these characters are and the world they are from so the viewer won't be blown away with all the things being portrayed. The production team really ups the bar with the amount of sci fiction this film has over the ground things we are accustom to seeing. They did this so well that it has the feel of a star wars movie with the whole travel the universe in a way with a dash of lord of rings attributes because of the present mid age vibe and the two element blend very well to creature the genre of film. I also have to say the acting from the characters in this movie were a lot better than performances people put on it passed marvel film or many other film in general. Every person does an amazing great at the role given to them; whether they had little screen time or a major role to play. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston do an amazing job portraying these two iconic characters and bring them to life. With both actors never really having a big role in a movie before they command their screen time very well and give a break out performances. Also Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman do a great job as always making it easy I'm sure for the first time actors. The director captures the audience also with some of the best visual CGI that I have seen in many movies that it is front lining the visual displayed in Avatar. This film has a lot of funny lines drop throughout it that makes it feel very relaxed at times where it could of felt kind of forced and misplaced. On top of that it has fresh story that was well written and not polluted with dull moments that could draw away from what's going on in the film. This is a great film that could branch out and headlight future cosmic non earth bound movies for the future of films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Strong Origin Story,"This a good movie specifically Thor's journey and Loki's descent is done expertly done and is the highlight of this movie.Thor begins the movie as irresponsible and arrogant and throughout the movie and the obstacles he faces he learns humility and sacrifice. He also works as an excellent foil to Loki's story throughout the movie.However characters outside of Thor, Loki, and Oden aren't that memorable which is sad considering a lot of Thor's growth comes from learning to be less selfish and think of others besides himself and his desires.Overall that is a small negative of this otherwise great film and while the side characters can be kind of forgettable Thor's character growth stills feel earned.

"By Odin's Command, See this One!","The folks at Marvel Studios have good business sense, and have put a lot of effort into building a Marvel movie universe populated by popular Marvel Comics characters. Iron Man 2 closed with a secret teaser ending, showing the discovery of Thor's hammer Mjolnr, and introducing an important piece of the Marvel movie universe puzzle.Thor is a staggering achievement, filled with imaginative energy and crackling with excitement, but the greatest weapon this warrior wields is its strong plot. Director Branagh brings his Shakespearian senses to the fore, stirring elements such as the Cain-and-Abel tussle between Thor and Loki, the star-crossed romance between Thor and Jane and also the friction between Thor and his disapproving father Odin into the cinematic pot.Branagh proves that he is no pushover when it comes to action sequences and wide panoramic vistas either. He has a keen eye for what looks good to excitement-hungry moviegoers, and this movie is packed with fantastic and beautiful visuals. From the sparkling spires of Asgard to the desolate wasteland of Jotunheim, this is a ten-course feast for the eyes – especially when given the 3D treatment.Chris Hemsworth proves himself as a charming and charismatic leading man. Thor is portrayed here as a skilled but reckless and headstrong warrior prince, and Hemsworth takes the audience along as Thor learns humility and finds love on Earth, even as he experiences some hilarious moments of culture shock. He also does well in the fight sequences, having trained and gained 20 pounds of pure muscle for the role.The supporting cast hits all the right notes as well, Anthony Hopkins imbuing Odin with thundering authority, Tom Hiddleston always possessing a malicious glint in his eye as Loki and Natalie Portman at her most normal and girlish as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Stellan Skarsgard grounds the film as Foster's level-headed mentor, and Kat Dennings is well-cast and very funny as the comic relief sidekick, usually a male role.An all-round movie-going experience, Thor is the explosive and substantial summer movie season opener everyone has been hoping for, and is unmissable on this and any other of the eight known realms.

"Good story, but weak graphics","So I got to the first movie about the mighty thunder God Thor. To read it I decided, oddly enough, after watching ""Dark World"". And at first this movie I liked the first, but about it later. To me personally, the first ""Thor"" seemed boring, but at the same time interesting. The plot and motivation of the characters spelled out very well, but otherwise the film is very lame. Asgard is drawn very poorly, I can not believe that you see a real huge world. Also extremely crumpled redemption and awareness of the Thor, as well as too spontaneous development of the relationship with Jane Foster. Very weak, though not bad, villain. Let's go through the characters.
Thor (Chris Hemsworth) played well. He is arrogant, arrogant and proud, as befits an almost omnipotent God. But, suddenly deprived of his strength in the face of danger because of his ego, he gradually re-educates himself, finds his love and proves the right to be worthy of his strength.
Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is a controversial character for me. On the one hand, I really like Natalie as an actress. On the other, the character does not cling, and the relationship with Thor, as I said, it's too spontaneous.
Chief, for me, plus this movie-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He's very motivated. He had a little envy for my brother, so it is also One lied to all my life! And although his plan to seize power in Asgard, to put it mildly, strange, charisma and great game Tom cover everything.

Thor Like a box of chocolates...,"You just don't know what part of Thor is good, and not so good. An average feel surrounds the film. Up until now the Marvel universe has kept us within the confines of Earth, but this latest foray into the other 9 realms really does leave it open to opinion....I love a fantasy type film, and if done right can be a legendary movie. I did not feel the same vibe from this movie, yet felt like saying 'ok, it was a nice try'...magical and mystical powers being condensed through a hammer isn't exactly what a superhero entails for me, but somehow fits in well with the fantasy element of the movie. Again, some of the powers of the frost men and other magical characters are too much, and as my friend Mazza would say...""over the top""The appearances and characters get a thumbs up though... seeing a Handsome blonde blue eyed muscular man reminded me of myself, and it's always nice to relate to a character like that. The appearance of Natalie Portman is always welcome, and bumps up the review rating. With Shield becoming more of a presence with each Marvel film, the general marvel storyline is coming together nicely.The back and forth yo-yo effect of the storyline can leave the watcher confused, with me thinking countless times about what actually Thor was trying to achieve, or what the bad guy was trying to achieve?!

A story nicely told...,"The best thing about 'Thor' is its story-telling, the quality of which, more often than not, gets scarce in super-hero movies. The part I loved the most about this movie is how the descent of 'Thor' to the earth is handled. Being new to earth he does not start to act all stupid and clunky, but retains his 'cool' as a god. The humor here has been nicely placed and smartly carried out, keeping it subtle enough not to make it cheesy.The portrayal of Asgard is breathtakingly serene, and so were the action scenes directed.All in all, a great Marvel movie. I do recommend it to all the comic-lovers!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not the worst, not the best","I enjoy watching this movie every now and then, its funny, it is fun to watch the beginning of Thor, and a start to the thor we know. Obviously this is not the best, not the worst, just kinda below average, but Thor is pretty cool and is just a average fun to watch kind of movie. But to marvel fans and me, this means a lot for its the start of Thor Odinson!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Easily the best Thor movie,"This was the perfect balance of intensity and humor. You really felt the stakes, in ways that neither Ragnarok, nor Love & Thunder, came close to achieving. And this film had some of the best cinematography of Phase One; some of the shots were worthy of being framed!Perfect setup for the first Avengers film as well. And though the MCU will never again be able to achieve the feeling of inaugurating otherworldly beings, this installment solidly stands the test of time. Everyone I've ever shown this movie has loved it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, Funny Nonsense - No Proper End",Its fun silly & deliberately comic entertainment. I'm not a very big Fan of Superhero Films . I find they often take themselves to seriously & use a to realistic styling for there Fantasy World. THOR is about right in these respects. I like the central Character & as Marvel type Superheroes go much more interesting than most. I think he's the best Character in 'Marvel Avengers Assemble'Natalie Portman is gorgeous & I watch anything with her in it. But she's not best for an action Film.BUT...BUT the Film (at least the version 'cut') I've seen does not have a proper ending. Just a lot of bits hinting at things we do not see. It ends with an extended trailer for the next THOR FilmGo look THOR up on Wikipedia. The quantity & extent of the commercial exploitation of the whole THOR 'Thing' is extraordinary. The makers lost a lot that should be in THIS film for greed & impatience for other releases. I know there is the tradition in Comic books for each episode to end with leads for the next. But this is a Film not a Comic book. @@@,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Godworthy,"Thor (1:55, PG-13, 3-D) — fantasy: comics & pulps, biggie, crossover""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!""This advice may well have applied to Bill Murray or Dan Aykroyd, but Sigourney Weaver's Zuul would never have even thot to ask it of Chris Hemsworth, who is so obviously a deity that the question would never have arisen.There's probably a casting hall of fame somewhere in self-congratulatory Hollywood. In it you will undoubtedly find Madonna as Evita, Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier, Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, and, on a plinth in the grand lobby, Christopher Reeve as Superman. Save a spot for young Mr. Hemsworth, because he is every ell the incarnation of the Norse thunder god Thor.If there's a like mecca for production design, seek not there for the shabby, Holiday Inn Olympus of Percy Jackson or Clash of the Titans. But Thor's Asgard truly deserves recognition. It is a proper home for the gods, grand, sweeping, and awe-inspiring. Not at all claustrophobic, it uses SPACE. This is what 3-D was made for. Regrettably, the sole Imax theater in my city was already committed to Born To Be Wild, so I didn't get its added benefit, but I would have leapt at the opportunity.If you've been following along in the series of films set in the Marvel comic-book universe, you know that Col. Nick Fury of SHIELD (Samuel L. Jackson) has been assembling a team of super-heroes to meet the recurring existential threats to humanity. SHIELD's top field agent, Clark Gregg's Coulson (or ""son of Coul"", as Thor calls him) keeps turning up on the periphery of Iron Man, Hulk, etc. Here he has a larger role as the AIC investigating the overnight appearance in the New Mexico desert of an impressively heavy artifact fallen from the skies. This is Mjolnir, the thunder hammer, forged from the heart of a star and wieldable only by one worthy of its might and power.First on the scene of its appearance is a trio of anomaly trackers, led by researcher Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and including mentor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and brilliant grad assistant Darcy Lewis (the scene-stealing Kat Dennings). The SHIELD guys, arriving shortly thereafter, confiscate all of their research notes, but not before they've already encountered the quirky, tall, handsome, muscular blond guy who says he OWNS the artifact. They decide to join forces with him so everybody can get their goodies back.OK, it must be admitted up front that Natalie Portman, Oscar fresh in hand, is not going to displace anybody's idea of a top female astrophysicist. That will always be Jodie Foster's Ellie Arroway from Contact. But Portman isn't called on to do much astrophysicking here, and she's properly heroic, winsome, capable, flustered, and imaginative as required. She's an ideal foil for Hemsworth's Thor, who is undergoing a crisis of integrity, thrown out of Asgard by all-father (and HIS father) Odin after leading an ill-conceived, if daring, raid of retribution against the frost giants of Jodenheim. ""A wise king never seeks out war,"" intones Odin (a regal Anthony Hopkins), ""but he must be ready for it!""The action alternates between the realms of the gods and the mortals, with occasional side excursions to Jodenheim. The interstate highway of the heavens begins on the rainbow bridge, Bifrost, at the far end of which is the giant rotary spherical zapper that can propel the gods halfway across known space; it's guarded by the taciturn but totally impressive swordsman Heimdall (Idris Elba).Thor's fellow godlings are a worthy bunch, and Rene Russo's few appearances as Odin's consort Frigga leave a much bigger impression than their brevity would normally warrant. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's ""brother"" Loki is highly effective, and his role is particularly well written, abounding in ambiguity and plausible motivation.While I've concentrated on the grandiose (as does the movie), there's plenty of nitty-gritty realism, including mud, blood, pain, and grief; PG-13-level romance; and no small amount of humor. The film does a good job of portraying Thor's time on Earth as a large-living odd duck out of his normal pond without making him seem overbearing; if this part had gone on too long, it would have irritated, but it doesn't, primarily because our hero (for who could doubt that he is?) is a quick study and innately a noble protector of the underdog.And so another piece in the larger puzzle slips into place. Next up: That super-soldier from WW2. Is HE still around? We may have to wait nearly until August to find out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
not bad....,"I liked Thor...the visuals were stunning and the action was great. But I do have some problems with this movie. I have liked most of the superhero genre movies so far. A few exceptions of course but majority wise I am a fan. This movie was one of my least fav of the good super hero movies made. The biggest thing that bugged me was the love interest they plugged in for absolutely no reason....her character(portman) just annoyed me and there romance seemed forced and unbelievable. The action was great, visuals great, modern day dialog mashed with comic book dialog wonderful, storyline decent, villain awesome, love story...?why?. Its a great cinematic adventure!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A hell of a start to the 2011 summer season,"We all know that in 2012 we should be getting the ultimate superhero film, The Avengers, being set up by Marvel Studios. But they have to set it up first, starting with Iron Man in 2008. Now Marvel have to turned to another on of their properties, Thor, and again made another entertaining superhero film.In 970 A.D. there was epic war between the Asgardians lead by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the frost giants, who want to conquer Earth. Years later Odin makes his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) his heir but a group of frost giants attempt to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters. Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), convicts Thor and his companions to go to war against the Frost Giants, against their father's orders. As punishment Thor is banished to Earth with his powers and hammer, Mjolnir taken away from him. On Earth Thor befriends a young scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her companions Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skargard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings). Thor sets out to receive his hammer from SHIELD whilst in Asgard Loki continues his plotting ways to take control.Thor is Marvel's interpretation of Norse mythology and he is a God, with powers to much. A problem could have been that Thor would have too powerful so would not be in an real danger, but the writers were able to counter at it in two ways. First is Thor does have powerful adversaries, who can match or at least give him a good run for his money. The other idea was that Thor's powers were taken away from him and he become not more then a physically fit man who was fallible. Thor has to earn his powers back and prove himself, that is the core of the story.Marvel has made bold choices when picking their directors: Jon Favreau was an actor before turning into a family-comedy director and Louis Leterrier was a full on action director. Kenneth Branagh is known for making Shakespeare adaptation and films about classic stories, so it was interesting choice for both the director and the studio. Whether or not you like Branagh's movies there is no denying he has a grand visual style and a perfect fit for bringing all these different worlds to life: the bright fantasy world of Asgard, the dark cold world of Jotunheim and Earth looking like it does in Iron Man. Thor itself is a strange mix of fantasy and science-fiction, trying to combine the two. The special effects were of a high standard and the action was good, with Hemsworth being particularly convincing as a fighter, beating his way through SHIELD. I'm sure if Branagh returns for a sequel his action direction will improve. Branagh ensured that there was a health mix of action, drama, romance and comedy, all the ingredients needed for a fun at the cinema. They are obviously trying to be like Iron Man, having a prologue then showing the set-up and matching its tone.There is a great cast in the film, I expect Hemsworth will be a big star. He was really convincing as a young warrior who is impulsive and defiant and has to learn to be responsible. Hiddleston is wonderfully weasel like, a power hunger individual who manipulates everyone around him, he is a complex character, the opposite of Thor. Loki lacks strength but is cunning and his character was similar to Commodus in Gladiator and Wormtongue in Lord in the Rings. Portman and Hemsworth have excellent chemistry together and I expect Jane's knowledge will be of use later on in the series. Skargard's character was basically in the film to arch Vikings myths to the characters, but it was done effectively. And Thor is easily Anthony Hopkins' best performance in a film for a long time.I do have criticise that Thor did rely a little too much on comic relief. Of course a film like this does need a little comedy, but the Dracy character was only in the film so all her lines can be jokes and wisecracks.For comic book fans there are little references for you, including a cameo by Jeremy Remner as Hawkeye. I would to have like to seen a little news footage showing the events of Iron Man 2, because they were going on at the same time as Thor. And everyone needs to stay behind for the post-credit scene because it will be important for later films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Generic Action Film With a Superhero Coat of Paint,"Thor's 77% on Rotten Tomatoes is the #1 reason why I don't try out Marvel movies. I'm willing to see popcorn-only films, but Thor is so average, the action doesn't cover up the bland characters and pandering plot.The deepest characters are barely two dimensional. You never get to sense Loki's deep envy of Thor, and Thor's only defining trait is arrogance. There is potential for Thor to grow up, but he never matures. He is punished for breaking the peace...but is forgiven for being heroic, a trait he never lacked. This is not how character arcs work!And they're the most developed characters of the film. Anthony Hopkins literally sleeps through most of the movie. Sif and ""The Warriors Three"" are one dimensional, forgettable, wastes of time. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s inclusion is pointless, and the trio of human characters Thor hangs out with only subtract from the film. Kat Dennings only delivers ""funny"" quips, and the romantic subplot with Thor and Natalie Portman's character is as forced as they get. There's more romantic chemistry in Marley and Me. The only character I could get behind was Heimdall. Idris Elba keeps ending up as the strongest actor in character-weak films. But Heimdall serves little purpose beyond his role as gatekeeper.If you really like comic books, I suppose the action is okay, but I was never amazed, nor amused by camp. I can't believe it doesn't get called out for its terrible script more often. Its just another Hollywood action flick that doesn't even pull of the tropes well. We deserve better than this.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"THOR {3-D} (Kenneth Branagh, 2011) ***","This is as solid a Marvel Comics superhero flick as we have come to expect. While I cannot say to have been much enthused when it was first announced (in view of my unfamiliarity with lead Chris Hemsworth), I kept the faith given the involvement of director Branagh – which is not too surprising since he treats the larger-than-life proceedings as if they were a Shakespearean tragedy (which made his reputation to begin with) and, in any case, he had already dabbled in fantasy with the interesting if overblown MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (1994). In hindsight, this proved almost as refreshing as IRON MAN (2008) where, similarly, the human element had emerged in spite of the predictable barrage of action (notably a battle sequence early on) and special effects (the look of Asgard is impressive alright, yet the 3-D is – as ever – sparingly adopted throughout, thus not justifying the ticket-price increase!).Though the lead looks nothing like the cartoon character I used to watch as a kid, he manages most of the aspects pertaining to this legendary Scandinavian deity – his pride, his passion, his confidence, his charm and, of course, his strength (augmented by Hemsworth's physically-fit appearance). Thor's family circle includes Anthony Hopkins as Odin, his father (who can always be relied upon for such grandiose types, especially since he plays through much of this one-eyed), Rene Russo as the latter's wife (who, however, has precious little to do) and Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki who, discovering to be something other than what he had been led to believe, eventually becomes the hero's sworn enemy (even if his horn-fitted head-gear was, in itself, a giveaway to his true nature!). Also on hand are Thor's warrior companions (a mixed bunch of sexes, ethnicities and personalities, with the girl among them obviously having a yen for our hero!) who even follow the protagonist to Earth when Odin banishes him (stripped of his powers!) for disobeying his orders of keeping the peace with a neighboring (and, effectively made-up, vaguely monstrous) tribe.On Earth, we get the usual initial misunderstanding and clash of cultures, as Thor's fall from the heavens coincides with heroine Natalie Portman and crew's study of an atmospheric phenomena – they even run him over twice with their van (the comedy relief, especially as delivered by Portman's brainy-but-cute pal Kat Dennings, is quite endearing)! Before long, romance blossoms (believably), bureaucracy intervenes (in the form of SHIELD, the Superhero league which has been appearing intermittently throughout the Marvel Comics adaptations, getting its most sizeable part so far here – with not only a cameo by Jeremy Renner but the by-now-trademark appearance from Samuel L. Jackson, meeting up with Portman's elder associate Stellan Skarsgard, in the post-credits teaser: this one is quite intriguing and there is even an announcement that ""Thor will return in THE AVENGERS""!), while Loki usurps the throne and visits Thor to tell him their father is dead (which he is not, but this only increases the protagonist's guilt complex!).Anyway, Thor learns the truth from his friends and also sees Loki for what he really is. The hulking but wise Guardian of the passage between the two worlds also gets in on the action, though he is obviously no match for Loki; later, we also get a robot being sent to Earth to cause havoc (another fine set-piece) but, just then, Odin sees that Thor has learned his lesson and gives him back his powers (incidentally, he could not even dislodge his mighty hammer from where it fell and which had been appropriated by SHIELD along with Portman's personal notes!). In the end, Thor assures Portman he will returnbut the afore-mentioned bridge has to be destroyed during his showdown back home with Loki, in order to eradicate the latter, so Thor cannot keep his promise after all (though the scriptwriters are sure to find a way to resolve this issue and get them together again by the time the inevitable sequel comes along!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

god of Thunder,"Thor was my least anticipated film, but boy was it good. Bragnah knew that Thor needed to be Shakespearean and stylized. Asgard looks beautiful and the costumes are fantastic. Hemsworth and Hopkins give such great performances in their titular roles. Hemsworth is just so likeable and charming, he really made me care for the character who used to be my least favorite avenger. Hiddleston is also fantastic and he really knew how to craft Loki into a mischievous villain while also being sly and weasly. So Asgard is great, Thor's great, the effects are great. What could be bad? Well the scenes on earth are actually kind of meh. Nothing against Portman, Dennings, and Skarsgård they perform well, it's just after seeing the world of Asgard we are thrust to a bland Earth in a New Mexico dessert of all places. The story is well crafted however, and there is so much character development for everyone, but the origin story and the plot (mainly Earth scenes) feel less epic and more or less unwanted, but they needed it for the story so you can't really complain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This about Thor  the god of thunder and his arrogance  the makes his father banish   him to earth to find out what it takes  to become a leader.,"My summer of the superhero kicked off this week with the god of Thunder Thor.I was a little skeptical they could pull it off with Thor not being a well know character. I have to say they pulled it off very well. This action adventure drama starring Chris Hems worth ( Thor), Natalie Portman( Jane foster) the always entertaining Sir Anthony Hopkins as(Odin king of Asgard) and Kat Dennings(Darcy Lewis)for just the right amount of comic relief . Thor runs for 114 minutes and is directed by Kenneth Branagh.The story line surrounds Thor and his arrogance and recklessness by disobeying his father Odin. Thor decides to confront the frost Giants after they attack the castle while Thor's coronation is talking place. In doing do Thor reignite's an accent war among the frost giants from before he was born. In doing so Odin takes away Thor powers and banishes him to earth so he can learn the true meaning of leadership.I enjoyed the story line around this film, because he is not a real well known superhero unless you are a comic book geek.They didn't take the whole idea very seriously to the point of overdoing it. The acting was very well done. I was glad to see they brought in some talented actors to help build the story around. They added just the right amount of humor to the story about Thor and his quest to learn on earth what he needs to ascend to the throne of Asgard.Thor goes onto a local dinner has breakfast with Jane and drinks a cup of coffee and say's I like this drink I want more and smashes it like the a Viking. Thor walks into a pet store and demands a horse to go in search of his hammer, and the store keeper looks up with a look like how much have you had to drink. I thought the scenery of New Mexico was great choice because that where they found Thor's hammer in the end of iron man 2 .The design and special effects of Asgard was amazing. Anthony Hopkins looked very comfortable in his role as the King of Asgard.The biggest thing that stood out was how they built Asgard. That was amazing scenery how they built the world of Asgard, the city bridge going to earth and the 9 realms. Tom Hiddleston added just the right touch of evil as Loki. He didn't take his role to serious to the point it might have been considered over acting. The one thing I noticed was the only tie into the avengers in 2012 was Erick Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) made a reference to a scientist he worked with who was studying the effects of gamma radiation. I was kind of hoping for an appearance of one of the other avengers. They seemed to realize what they had to do bring the mythological god of thunder to the big screen. They accomplished it very well with the cast, scenery and the script.I think Kenneth Branagh did a commendable job pulling this story together and giving the movie going public a very enjoyable 114 minutes.I definitely give it 3 stars.My blog is http://www.thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
From someone barely familiar with Thor...,"The sum total of my knowledge about Thor came from reading the backs of Marvel cards in the early to mid-90's. His bio said he was really powerful and had an awesome hammer, and that was about all I remembered. So going into the movie I was just looking for good special FX and a decent enough story not to aggravate me, ala Transformers 2.As it turns out Thor was pretty good. I'd say the reviews that equate it to being about on par with The Incredible Hulk are almost accurate - they're missing a big part of Thor's final score when they tally it. Ready...Thor is an unfamiliar, untested, and in most cases brand new character in the pantheon of Marvel movies - and yet, it is pretty freaking enjoyable. Believable acting. Strong story. God action and FX. And don't forget that Thor's box office performance so far, while not stellar seems appears better than such an unknown pseudo-newbie would merit. It did better in it's 2nd weekend than either The Incredible Hulk or X-Men Origins: Wolverine.So jump don't be the last loser on on your block to try Thor, everybody else's doing it.

"""God, there's no acting required here, is there?"" (A.

It relies almost entirely on high-budget production, special effects, and celebrities, and if stripped of all those fancy clothes, there's not much left to enjoy. above mentioned celebrities are Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Clark Gregg, Idris Elba, and Rene Russo.

"OK, but they could do more with this","Thor is the fourth MCU movie, coming after Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2. It's about gods, so you would think this would be incredibly epic, but it's not really. The story doesn't feel big at all and barely affects anything, so it feels like it only exists to introduce us to the character.It's not bad, it's enjoyable, it's entertaining, well shot, visually pretty impressive, pretty funny at times and they nailed the casting once again. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect choice for Thor just like Robert Downey Jr. for Iron Man. But the one who really stole the show for me is Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki. He is the best villain MCU ever had so far and I think it will remain that way. He fits the role perfectly and he also seems to have a lot of fun playing it. Kenneth Branagh is the director this time and this is probably one of the most well directed MCU movies. Also, visually the movie is beautiful, one of the best looking MCU movies.So, what went wrong? Once again, I'm saying the movie is pretty okay, but this isn't supposed to be just okay. I think they could have done a lot more with the story. It has a good character arc and everything, but it just doesn't feel big. Even tho there were some emotional parts, it still just doesn't help. It remains just kinda okay, but nothing more. And there should have been more.This way it feels like this movie's only purpose is to introduce us to some new characters and it shouldn't be that way.

The main actor is good, the side characters are tolerable, the plot is easy to follow but pretty much sticks to the source material (not being a comic reader--my comic buff fiancée watched it and wasn't distressed by any changes), the CGI is really nice, especially for the city of Asgard, and the sound is fantastic, it's really realistic and has a strong impact without actually being loud. There's the general swords and sorcery battling, but no gore, no sex, no real violence or scary scenes, it's just good clean cool-guy-with- powers-doing-cool-stuff and the scenes in the human world are actually quite amusing without being painfully awkward or overdone.Summary: 7/10, because it did everything it should as a superhero movie but didn't go above and beyond in any way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I've Waited 30 Years For This Movie; Absolutely Spectacular!,"I'm a professional in my 30's. As a young boy, I'd read Thor comics and so many times, I had visualized the other realms created by the minds of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. I've waited 30 years for a film to present the fantastic universe that I imagined so many years ago. Not only did Thor exceed all of my expectations, it did it in a way that brought back those wonderful moments of my youth. It also allowed me to share those moments with my son, age 9. There is not a single thing about this movie that could have been done better. Despite my high expectations, Marvel has produced a masterpiece that exceeds anything they've done so far.VISUALLY SPECTACULAR. The images of heroes hurtling through space and time, the battle-scenes of unleashing otherworldly, God-like power, and the panoramic images of the supernatural universe were utterly breathtaking. I have not stopped talking about this move for more than 3 days now. I had the expectation that this would be just a story about Thor falling to earth and doing human things. Somehow I just expected that the trillions of worlds explored by Thor and his companions could never make it onto the big screen. Boy, was I wrong. I can't say more without spoiling the film, but I will just say that the special effects were truly MIND BOGGLING. I will be seeing this movie a 2nd time... and I never watch movies more than once.MUST BE SEEN in 3D IMAX I've seen 3D movies that didn't quite work in 3D. In recent years, 3D has gotten better and better, but I feel that no other movie has taken full advantage of 3D like this one. Even Avatar- for all its brilliance- does not hold a candle to the way Thor immerses viewers in scenes that can truly only be called epic. And by epic, I don't mean the overused internet version of the word, but in the classic sense of the word. Thor in IMAX 3D has to be the most visually stunning film I've ever seen.CLEAN ENOUGH DESPITE PG-13 *** I tend to be super conservative about what I let my kids watch. Thor never once made me squirm. Although the battle scenes were powerful (our seats were shaking and rumbling) there was no gratuitous violence. If nothing else, only the previews were objectionable for kids under 13.FINAL VERDICT I'd say this is the best movie I've seen in more than a decade. If I can make any suggestions, it would simply be to make sure you see the IMAX 3D version, as anything less would not do it justice.10 out of 10!

Up there with Avatar in story and FX,"I remember thinking when I was watching this movie that if someone asks me how I liked it I would tell them, ""I loved every minute of it."" And I did except for 3 minutes when toward the climax it became a little confusing. You'll know what I mean when you see it.I have appreciated Kenneth Branagh's talent as an actor and director since I saw Henry V in the 80's. He has a way of telling a story that is huge and complex in a very human and personal way. And it is just like that in Thor. The images of the Heavens match the beauty that we saw in Avatar. Beautiful with deep, rich colors and scope of focus and never losing us in its sweep. The relationships that Thor has with his family are just like that with human ones. He catches Thor at the cusp of his becoming a man and ready to be knighted as king of the heavens. And like many of that age he falters and his weaknesses overcome him. But through adversity and temptation his spirit is tried and purified.When Thor arrives at Earth, Kenneth Branagh gives us quite the humorous look at the interaction of god and beautiful woman and her colleagues. The movie has humor in abundance which is such a rarity for movies of this sort.I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars because in so many ways it was nearly perfect.

Thor,"Well, I must say leading up to the release of Thor, I wasn't excited at all and was trying all I could do to avoid it. Reason being, I was never a fan of Thor when I was younger. My 1st encounter with the character was when he was featured in an episode of the Incredible Hulk series back in the 80's. And I remember I was not impressed at all with the outfit & mythology that surrounded his Character. Thor the film however changed my mind. Its amazing how an adaptation can go so far and actually emulate the kind of imagination the creators actually had for this Character and his universe. I congratulate the Director & all involved in this movie for making it such an awesome experience in the cinema as the visual effects were outstanding & nailed to the core. The story itself was an absolute gem. Yes, we may have stumbled across similar story lines elsewhere. But the writers did a brilliant job to make this their own. All the Characters were built up well throughout & I don't say this often, but the acting was probably one of the best you will see in a Marvel movie adaptation. Thor is actually a masterpiece. And should go on to claim to be this years greatest blockbuster. DC comics have the new Batman flying its flag. Marvel have, The Iron Man, Thor & possibly Captain America & the Avengers. Its exiting times to be a comic fan, with films like Thor laying a new benchmark in story telling & it could only be justice to us fans to wait for a second Thor movie. I for one, will be extremely anxious to what will happen next. One thing though,.... do watch Thor in 3D. Truly amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Boring story, boring 3D, boring effects...","You have an estimated $150 million at you disposal. You have effects teams, writers, good actors, 3D, and basically the entire Norse mythology to explore and use. And this movie is all you can do?I expected a lot of this movie. There are a lot of nice stories and effects to be made exploring Thor, the god of thunder. This movie basically doesn't. If you read the studio's description of what the movie is about, you can almost figure out the entire main story line beforehand - it really is that unimaginative.The 3D use is on the level of ""oh, look, that postbox is closer to me than the supporting cast in the background, but everything else is flat"", which really isn't impressive - or even worth the money to see the movie at a 3D cinema. Even the computer animated stuff looks flat - like it was projected on a surface at a particular depth.There's a reason this movie premiered in Australia, Sweden and a select other European countries before the US - the studio hopes to at least be able to call it a ""success in Europe"" or post some favorable review from one of the perhaps more easily impressed countries.If you have nothing else to do, this might be a DVD to buy in a year, but unless you are easily impressed by anything that says ""3D"", or have a serious crush on Natalie Portman or Anthony Hopkins, see something else.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much more than a special effects movie,"At first... when my boyfriends asked me to go to see this movie, both of us though ''I think is just another action, special effects and so on movie, but at least, it'd be entertaining''. Then, our theory broke down... I mean the sightseeing of Asgard it's not just effects, it's WOW! Then the story starts... normally, with a ''supposly to be'' hero, his kingdom, then he's taken to Earth... and you think is just a strange guy on a strange place... but is not just like that. We have a lot of funny things here, the guy is not just ''bad and arrogant and period'', he's more complex, like a person is. This is what a lot of heroes movie don't have. The bad guy is not only bad, and is not only a matter of revenge what takes him out of control. There's a lot of facts that makes him do what he does. CHARACTERS: 7 So... the characters are deeper than any hero character, and they have more than 1 simple and chic-heed explanation to do everything the do, and to feel everything they feel. EFFECTS: 9 So impressive, gorgeous, outstanding...!! I won't spoil it for you... it has no sense if you don't see it... STORYLINE: 7 Quite good for a hero standard movie, deep characters, good fight scenes, action, fluent relation lazes... believable story. Magic and imagination... epic love... tension...

No Thor-prizes,"Pretty straightforward adaptation of the comic book from the House of Marvel, Chris Hemsworth is suitably young, dumb and full of bravado as the Mighty Thor and there is a good performance from Tom Hiddlestone as the scheming Loki. Anthony Hopkins is effortlessly god-like as Odin, but Natalie Portman's role is off-the-shelf action heroine - which she could do in her sleep I'm sure. The presence of Stellan Skarsgard is reassuring as is Clark Gregg's return as Agent Couslon, and a brief cameo by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, the last two being preludes to great things to come (we hope). There is clunkiness to some passages of dialogue, but there are also many nice touches. Asgard is beautifully rendered; the juxtaposition of the different modes of speech works nicely and Stan the Man makes his habitual Hitchcockian appearance. Kenneth Brannagh makes a great job all round including generating a feeling of great distance between Earth and Asgard. The Earth-bound scenes seem narrow in scope, but that's a minor quibble, in the end it's all good comic book fun and whets the appetite for the main event – 98 days and counting!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Marvel film so far,"It was always going to be a challenge to make a live action version of the fantasy hero Thor, but I think Kenneth Branagh has achieved it.Chris Hemsworth was impressive as the god of thunder banished from Asgard and all the main actors also were well acted. Tom Hiddleston was great as Loki, Thor's evil brother and while the connections to the other Avengers were in the film, it wasn't as blatant as Iron Man 2.Overall definitely worth watching on the big screen and make sure you stay to watch the bit after the credits.The bar has been set, next up is Captain America and how they will fit Thor, Hulk, Captain America and Iron Man into one film will be interesting to see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mid 6/10,"This movie is outdated, the character of Thor is way different, and the story isn't now relevant. But when this movie came out, it was pretty good. And with that hindsight, you would see the film's positives, which isn't a lot. Thor and Loki are entirely different characters, and rewatching it leaves you feeling awkward. The positive thing about Thor is it has a lovely story of the humility of a hero. Overall, the film's central problem is it is outdated but a bit enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty darn great!,"I have really enjoyed the recent ""Avenger"" movies. I am very excited for these to come together especially sense the characters that are playing the parts of the super heroes are doing an amazing job. Chris Hemsworth does not disappoint. He plays the role of Thor, and plays it well. It is not just Chris Hemsworth though. Anthony Hopkins(Odin), Natalie Portman(Jane Foster) and the lesser known to me, Tom Hiddleston(Loki) all played their parts flawlessly. Idris Elba Plays ,Heimdal, the guardian to the gates of Asgard. I am hoping he as a role in the up coming Avengers movie because I really like the part he played. Just at looking on IMDb though does not look like he is in the filming for it.There is plenty of action that is evenly spaced out so its not to the point where the action is repetitive or its not to slow. I thought going into Thor that it probably wasn't going to be an amazing movie but it was pretty darn close. I wouldn't hesitate in seeing it again.Just an FYI at the end of the credits of Thor there is a scene that we will see in the up and coming ""Avenger"" movies.

Thor: A mix of Mythology and Science Fiction,"This movie is like a weird mix of Mythology and sci-fi, though it is very entertaining. Since 2008, Marvel has improved it's story telling since the past years.The part where Thor meets the humans, you know... It would be weird... But the director manages to do it very superbly... Though it has taken some mythological references, even though not accurate (and definitely not, if you are looking for learning anything about Norse mythology from it), you should at least give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Utter Nonsense, but loads of fun","I have not read the Thor comics, nor do I no much about the marvel incarnation other than the fact that he has a hammer. So I really am taking this film as it comes, I'm taking it as a fan of science fiction and superheroes. In my opinion the major leader in the comic book movie world is Batman, and mainly the most recent Dark Knight. I've always found some of the marvel stories a bit harder to swallow, and Thor is no exception to this. In a way Thors back story is probably the most far fetched, I'd even go as far to say its utterly ridiculous, however that almost added to the fun of it.Thor keeps it light all the way through to its conclusion, and the drama is always in the melodrama making it all the more likable. It has epic and outlandish action sequences and even louder costumes than its special effects. The romance between Natalie Portmans scientist and Thor is laughable, misconstrued and cheesier than the old Stilton in my fridge. But for some strange reason this film works. It is so very entertaining, and really very funny. It has an almost self aware attitude that lends itself very well to this particular story. Other films of this genre could have taken a leaf out of its book, choosing spectacle and comedy instead of heavy drama and characterisation made Thor far more pleasant than its rivals.Take a film like spider-man, that is almost as stupid, but attempts to make it more grounded.When it attempts go for laughs its very false and Peter Parker never raised much of a smile out of me. Thor on the other hand is beautifully humorous and a fairly flawed hero. On a more negative note, though funny, Thor at times experiences some turbulence when it comes to its actors. No one really knows quite how to play the supporting roles. Thors allies are to often a bit serious and self conscious for the pantomime that there leader puts on. Kat Dennings was an obvious standout and Portman was once again great, even if her performance doesn't quite match Black Swan, but was it ever going to match that performance.All in all I believe Thor is a very enjoyable ride. Non science fiction fans will undoubtedly hate this so steer clear if you're not. But generally if you like Marvel movies this will not put you off. Its got me very much in the mood for Xmen: First Class.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What was wrong with the original manuscript?,"So, I decide to see the movie Thor, but with some hesitation. This is my own culture as a Scandinavian, so maybe I am not supposed to write a review, maybe I will just spoil it all. I will of course be critical.When I grew up I read the Edda, so I know the stories of Norse Mythology well. This is also my first question, when you read the real stories, as they were taken down by my distant ancestors, what is it that make the writers and directors change them when making the movie? Is it because they were not good enough? The movie Thor reads like a five year old who was told the real stories but decides to vulgarize them. Or maybe it was due to bad memory, maybe it was on purpose.The fact remains, they have taken a beautiful story and ripped it to pieces. It makes me sad because when people hear ""Thor"" they will recall all the wrong images. Sure, some ideas have been preserved, like some of the names and places, but just as many are made up and the whole conflict with the ""Jotuns"" have been turned into a simplistic black and white world. It makes you wonder, was this done because movie makers think that viewers cannot understand the real story, that it would be too complicated?And then the whole connection with the present, it turns the figure of Thor into a freak-show. And the sword associations to King Arthur with the sword stuck in the ground. Can't Hollywood tell a story without mixing it with Anglo Saxon familiarities? When Jackson made the Ring at least he tried to follow the original book. It's difficult to understand how Branagh could put his name to this lot. It's all very embarrassing, from story to acting.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dramatic yet FUN, Very Well Done!","Thor works on so many levels. It meets its toughest challenge and that is to make its super powerful blond godlike lead character relatable and spark a connection to the audience. For all the action extravagance and adventure, a surprising and pleasant amount of time is devoted to character establishment and development. This certainly isn't some wild video game popcorn flick. It also packs the perfect amount of comedy, with most of the jokes at Thor's expense. Cutting a god down to size, is important for two reasons. One, the story itself is about Thor learning humility and two, it makes the character more believable and more relatable. It's what Marvel does best, give us heroes with flaws.A lot of this film takes place in the modern era on contemporary Earth and that was absolutely the right way to present the film. That's not to say that there aren't fantastical element, Asgard is breathtaking and incredible. Still, they manage to be dramatic and serious most of the time but balance it with a sense of humor. Thor finds the right mix similar to the way Iron Man did back in 2008. The film never becomes too self-important or portentous but still is dramatic and fun. The most fun outside of the incredible action sequences is when the consequences of the culture clash is played up. That is something to savor and enjoy. The fish-out-of-water angle is played up perfectly. They take a ""hero"" or wannabe hero who is arrogant by temperament and used to having his own way and place him in a position where he has to grow. All the while using comic friction as a great tool to advance the plot and the development. Thor tries to continue to live his own reality because in his mind, he's still prince of Asgard. It's both fun and interesting to watch him come to grips with his situation. As he is humbled and out of place, audiences enjoy recognizing his human traits. Sure, viewers are thrilled by his powers, but we relate to his emotions and his flaws. Add some intense sibling rivalry, great action and romantic entanglements and Thor may just be the best movie of the summer.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mix of 'epic' and 'average comedy',"This movie has extreme highs and lows. Some scenes, especially in the beginning and ending, were pretty awesome to watch. Everything in-between sometimes felt a bit off. I definitely see what they tried doing here and it worked for some parts, but others felt a bit rushed. Just feels like 'Okay, they didn't matter much about this scene or didn't make the very best out of it.'I think the character 'Thor' has very cool potential which he already showed in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A couple of bad casting decisions aside, not bad.","Thor is an interesting film, but I'm not sure whether to say its worth seeing or not. There is a lot that is good about this film and a lot that sank to the bottom of the barrel. The special effects are decent for the most part except that the Frost Giants' facial make-up looks like ass and the multiple Loki illusion scene looks like it was thrown together with a bad video editor at the last minute.The plot revolves around Thor being banished to Earth in order to teach him humility and self-control in the face of conflict. The best parts of the film are those that derive themselves from the whole ""alien in a strange land"" motif that lends itself from '3rd Rock from the Sun' and 'Mork and Mindy'. Unfortunately the film lacks any kind of serious introspection that the aforementioned series each had that would bring about this kind of change that Thor needed. Instead we get emotional conflict and bonding that varies consistently between totally forced and half-assed.The most solid performance in this film is the role of Heimdall, played by Idris Elba, because he's the only Asgardian who isn't treated like a happy-go-lucky dork. Volstagg is the only one who should really stand out as a happy-go-lucky dork because that's who he is. Loki wasn't bad either, but it was difficult to follow his emotional turmoil as his goals and manipulations change throughout the film.Worst performance easily goes to Natalie Portman, who has absolutely NO chemistry with Chris Hemsworth and whose character does just mind-bogglingly stupid things throughout the film (think Lois Lane without the journalistic integrity). Another odd choice was Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Not that he didn't do his job relatively well, but only a few times, while watching Odin on screen, did I think to myself that I was watching a character other than Anthony Hopkins (in truth, his staff commanded more presence on screen).Overall Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another stepping stone for Marvel,"Against his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s wish, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) goes to battle the Frost Giants with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Sif, Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. He is cast out of Asgard by Odin. Astrophysicists Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) with assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) are tracking spatial anomalies when they find a disoriented Thor.This is simply setting up for Marvel. They have laid out a series of movie that led to the Avengers and beyond. Kenneth Branagh directs this introduction to Thor. Chris has some work behind him, but this is his international breakout. It lays the groundwork for the world of Asgard and introduces other important characters like Loki. It's not completely compelling. There is a lot of history expositions. The Asgard world is very golden, and the frost giants live on an ice world. The movie goes into a long section in the Alien worlds at the beginning. It's a lot of CGI to slog through. The wonderment of it all wears thin. The love story is rather stiff. Natalie Portman's chemistry with Chris Hemsworth is fair but it could much better. It's a fair introduction and continuation for the grander universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty good superhero movie, just wasn't all that great.","This is a pretty good superhero movie, but I just didn't think it was amazing like a lot of critics were claiming. Just from watching the trailer I knew what I am going to get out of this movie, which really wasn't a super high expectation. And I got basically the exact amount of it, the direction of the movie is alright and has a bit of the comic book feel to it. And although when I first heard the announcement for this movie I thought it was going to suck. Mainly because I didn't expect a movie about a marvel hero that didn't really stand out all that much and didn't have enough in his character to make a movie out of and actually be good. But overall it did a pretty good job and the movie was entertaining with some good CGI fight sequences. The comic relief part seemed slightly forced but that isn't really anything to complain about and for the most part it works. The chemistry in this movie seemed to work but there wasn't enough development in the characters. The plot isn't anything special either nor did it really grab my attention or had anything really gripping or even exciting. This is far from being a bad superhero movie and has some good aspects to it, even if it has it's flaws it had some entertaining parts.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantasy action at it's absolute best.,"Speaking of movies, I saw 'Thor' last week. It's the story of the title character: Thor (played by the annoyingly-good looking Aussie Chris Hemsworth), God of thunder, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and prince of the magical realm of Asgard. Thor is a powerful warrior who wields 'Mjolnir' the enchanted hammer and one of the most powerful weapons in the universe. He is also, however, arrogant and foolish. After going against his father's orders by towelling up an army of frost giants and reigniting an age old war, Odin strips him of his power and of his hammer and banishes him to Earth to live among the Earthlings. This is where the real fun begins.The Thunder-God's interactions with the lowly mortals and his efforts to deal with his fall from grace provide bucket loads of chuckles and even a few LOL's. It's here that he meets astro-physicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her team. Natalie Portman is just delightful. Really, I think she may be my new favourite, or at least equal with Katy Perry, obviously for different reasons. Katy has the curvy figure and the sex appeal market cornered, but Natalie is just so pretty. She has that 'take home to meet mum' old fashioned goodness about her. You'd love to just cuddle her, and not just 'special' cuddles either. She'd also be perfect for 'picnic' cuddles, 'beach' cuddles, 'romantic movie' cuddles, or if you are a freaky old German 'abduct and keep hidden in your basement dungeon' cuddles. Seriously, she is worth the price of admission alone.Anyway, the movie is just huge. Huge on special effects. Huge on epic battles. Huge on awesomeness. Plus Chris Hemsworth is huge. I may have to look up the diet he was on to prepare for the role. I assume that by eating the food he ate and doing zero exercise I will look equally as good with no shirt on after three months.The movie gallops along at a lively pace for the whole 2 or so hours. If you go to the movies to kick back, not think a lot, and just enjoy yourself this is the movie for you. As far as action/ fantasy/ blockbuster films go this one is hard to beat. I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. The other great thing about it is that Marvel studios is tying it in with its other big movies 'Ironman 1 & 2', 'The Incredible Hulk', and the soon to be released 'Captain America' to make a massive 'Avengers' movie which will feature all of them fighting together. How awesome will that be??!! It's pure fan boy comic book fantasy.And on another side note, Thor would kick the absolute crap out of Superman. Seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Continuing in the footsteps of Iron Man,"I first saw it when it came out and I liked it, and it's still good 10 years later as I'm going through my MCU marathon. Just like Iron Man did a few years prior, Thor is paving the way for everything that comes after with the Avengers saga, and while it may not be as polished as Iron Man was, it still did a great job at creating an interesting origin story with characters that are well written, and develop throughout the movie while still having a lot of room to grow for potential sequels, which proved to be a fantastic set up for what followed!

The cosmic and epic tone of the film isn't enough to make it stand out when everything else fails.,"Thor is an entertaining film thanks to its mediocrity. When the epic and Shakespearean influence don't take over, comedy does, and the result is a boring mess that only starts excelling by the end of the film, where the acting and the dramatic beauty it promises since the beggining do really flourish, but by then, it may already be too late.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As Exciting and Thrilling as a Two Hour Wrestling Match,"I know that Kenneth Branagh is one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of our time. For this reason, I imagine that this film was an experiment on his part. The experiment was to have everybody act as if they were 12 year olds doing their first Junior High Shakespeare play with a gym teacher doing the direction. In others words, have the acting be so awful that there is not one believable line delivered or one scene that is not aimed at the twentieth row in the balcony. Make it so broad that even six years old could not miss every nuance. Since his movies with brilliant acting, like ""Othello"" did terrible at the box office, his theory was that if he had his actors did the worst possible acting, the movie would be a success. He was right.Besides the bottom of the barrel acting, there should be a warning label about the writing. Lines like ""Magic is just science and science is just magic"" are guaranteed to subtract I.Q. points as fast as watching Fox News.The movie is such a mishmash of clichés from science fiction, comic books superheroes, and Norse mythology, that one is hardly surprised to see a Transformers Robot in the middle of an homage/rip-off of a Scene from Superman II.The special effects are about on a par with the 1980's children's television series, ""The Power Rangers.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Thor with His Mighty Hammer does Wonders, I wished it had more fights.","THOR - CATCH IT ( A- ) I've been eagerly waiting for Thor, ever since Chris Hemsworth has been set to play the role of God of Thunder. Unfortunately, just like all summer movies, I wasn't able to watch Thor in cinemas. But now it's out on DVD and I got my hands on it. Wow the movie starts with the Bang, the director doesn't shy away from throwing Thor right into our faces. Though, Thor is not The most popular Comic Book Icon and Chris Hemsworth is a complete newcomer. The director Kenneth Branagh presented the Asgard world with so much conviction that it didn't look strange at all. Thor with his giant Hammer is something to watch. The charisma and arrogance Mr. Hemsworth carries is Commendable. Marvel got the Perfect Thor and Loki. On one side Thor is perfect God of Thunder, Loki is a perfect mischief Child. Tom Hiddleston did a fantastic job in playing Loki. I was completely stunned by his honest emotional and devious portray. Natalie Portman is delightful; it feels good to see a girl in a movie. Who you really adore, that totally boosts up the screen. After winning an Oscar, Natalie Portman is on heights. And this role added an additional Blockbuster in to her lap. I hope she returns for Thor 2, because only then it will be more convincing to see Thor coming back for Jane. Though apparently, Thor will return to earth in ""The Avengers"" with all other Marvel Heroes. So, it'll be interesting to see how it all set up together. Kat Denning did make me laugh with her on liners. Besides them Jaimie Alexander did stood out as she looked Stunning as Sif. Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Jean Russo, Idris Alba, Clark Gregg and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye are really good. With all perfect casting, performances, CGI, the only thing lacking in the end was Big Earthly Action Sequence. The town looked too small and fake to be real. There were barley few people when they though Loki send a Robotic thing to destroy them, it was little unconvincing. So, overall, Thor almost Lives up to expectation and I can't wait to see Thor 2 and Thor in ""The Avengers"" movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst of all Thor movies by far,"Thor lands squarely in the realm of average superhero fare. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, this Marvel film introduces the God of Thunder to the cinematic universe but falls short of reaching the heights achieved by its Marvel counterparts.Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor is charismatic, but the character's journey from arrogant prince to humbled hero feels somewhat formulaic. The fish-out-of-water trope, as Thor finds himself on Earth, adds moments of humor but doesn't bring much innovation to the superhero origin story.The Asgardian visuals are visually striking, showcasing the grandeur of the mythical realm. However, the juxtaposition of Asgard and the more mundane Earth settings sometimes feels jarring and fails to establish a seamless narrative flow.Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is a capable scientist, but the romantic subplot between her and Thor lacks depth and often feels forced. The chemistry between the leads doesn't quite elevate the love story to a memorable level, making it one of the film's weaker aspects.The action sequences are serviceable, with Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, providing some visually engaging moments. Yet, they lack the innovative flair seen in later Marvel films. The film's antagonist, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, stands out as a highlight, injecting complexity and intrigue into the narrative.While this movie is a necessary piece in the Marvel puzzle, it doesn't quite reach the heights of excitement and storytelling innovation seen in subsequent MCU entries. It falls into a comfortable mediocrity, delivering a standard superhero origin story without venturing too far beyond established tropes. In the grand tapestry of Marvel films, Thor holds its place as a decent introduction to a character but doesn't leave a lasting impact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Requires an Applause,I've always loved Marvel movies. Kenneth Branagh directing a superhero flick could have been risky but surprisingly Thor comes out to be big and great. There is no moment in the whole movie where you'll feel like skipping. Moreover After so much time I've seen a movie without skipping forward. Chris Hemsworth has done a terrific job as Thor. His dialogs are great and are the only hints of good humor throughout the movie. I've always loved Natalie Portman. Tom and Anthony are good as well. The action scenes are pretty good and must have been great in 3D. Thor with a beard might look odd for the comic fans but it served well to me. Well yeah do wait for the end of the credits as there is another sequence just like Hulk and Iron Man. It seems they are all set for a grand plot for Avengers. Anyways the movie was very good for me. Scope for betterment surely remains but its a must watch. Great job done there.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mixed bag,"I went into Thor with high expectations, and i thought it was an enjoyable movie and a decent start to this summer movie lineup, however, Thor could have been much much better. It was sort of a mixed bag, a mishmash of positives and negatives. the acting for one was not perfect by most of the cast, apart from Anthony Hopkins who plays his role to perfection. the rest of the cast including Natalie Portman were average at best. I was specially surprised at Natalie Portman's character, which was very shallow and had no strong or solid presence on the plot or on screen.speaking of Natalie Portman, i thought her romance with Thor was rushed and did not sink in for me, i really did not feel the passion. the relationship between them was clichéd and typical. Did they really just add her to the cast for marketing purposes ? shame, shame !! Most characters did not develop enough, probably there were too many characters to go through in the movie's short running time, all felt rushed. I specially did not feel any emotions towards Thor friends, they were like strangers to me !!!the plot was simple, and moved in a some what good pace, though i did feel it dragged a bit midway, probably felt more during those supposedly romantic moments between Portman and Thor.the movie started with a big Roar, some very awesome action scenes with amazing special effects and sound effects, which made me think that i was in for an amazing ride for the rest of the movie, which was a false thought. but i gotta say, i was very impressed with that opening action sequence.I won't say too much about the ending, let's just say, it did not satisfy me, it lacked the big climax feelings and in action. the whole movie felt lacking in action, i mean other than that opening action sequence, action was minimal. which really made me feel like the movie was missing something, like it was a bit empty.So overall, it was worth the admission ticket for sure, some decent performances and decent plot, mixed with some very enjoyable moments and top notch special effects and big budget sets and CGI. but lacked in character development and had it's share of some cliché moments. watch it and judge yourself, but don't expect a perfect movie or a master piece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Marvel success,"When it comes to Marvel Studios, they really know how to put well made movies together. Better yet they know how to adapt them from their source material and make them into entertaining, humorous, and action packed movies. They started with surprisingly great Iron Man, then went on to make an improved Incredible Hulk movie than the 2003 Ang Lee version, and last year they put out, the not quite as good as the first but still enjoyable, Iron Man 2. Now this year we get to Thor, and in July Captain America.Thor might not be as well known as Spider-man or even Iron Man, but once audiences check out his movie he will definitely be known. He is the God of thunder, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and he's played by Australian actor Chris Hemsworth. When his father banishes him to Earth he meets a girl named Jane (Natalie Portman) and her research team which consists of Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard. While on Earth, his father falls into a deep coma allowing his brother Loki (Tom Hiddelston) to be King and force his ways on everyone in Asgard. All the while Thor must find his mighty hammer, for it holds great power.Throughout the movie we get lots of action sequences, some laugh out loud moments, and even some well played out drama that works mainly because of the chemistry between Hemsowrth and Portman. Kenneth Branagh has put together a movie most thought wouldn't work well or fit in well with the other characters in the Avengers since Thor is a Norse God and isn't from Earth. So it's a good thing they were able to make such an enjoyable movie out of his character otherwise he could have brought down the Avengers in a way.One of the problems a lot of people had with Iron Man 2 was the fact that they tried way too hard to put in little hints at the Avengers whenever they could. In the end it felt it was just too many and the majority were not needed. With Thor, they handle all the Avengers mentions quite well. Other than a scene after the credits with Samuel L. Jackson back as Nick Fury, we also get Jeremy Renner showing us a little of his character Hawkeye who will be in the Avengers, as well as Clark Gregg back as Agent Coulson who works for S.H.I.E.L.D.All in all I would say definitely go out and see Thor while it's in the theater. It's a great summer popcorn film that the whole family should be able to enjoy.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Action Flic, BUT...","This movie is really good on a lot of levels, from the buff, good-looking Hemsworth to the charming Portman. The Audience is transported to another world to see where Odin lives and it's believable. But I was looking for a little more depth of character from the God of thunder. We know as the hero, he is supposed to save the day, but his concern and instant love for all humanity almost seem to come from nowhere as he transitions from the headstrong reckless God of war, to a hero who suddenly loves the entire planet.Portman's portrayal of Jane is good, but I believe she didn't have much to work with by way of script and much of their interaction seemed rushed. Though we are left looking forward to a sequel in the Avengers, I still wished we could have seen, just a little more depth to the people involved here before moving on to the avengers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth Seeing,"This movie is not as good as the comic but that is the case for almost every comic book based movie that I have ever seen. The main problem I have is with the main battle sequence that should have been the highlight of the whole movie and I guess it was but it really should have been a lot bigger and better, in the comic it was just mindblowing but it did not translate it to the big screen very well, it was not as action packed or mind blowing. The acting was pretty good for a movie like this. A lot of people thought it was stupid but I think this movie is intended more for fans of the comic like me, if you aren't familiar with the comic you will probably just think it is stupid, but why go see it if you think Thor is stupid anyway?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Superhero Magic: Deity Entertainment,"Marvel's most recent Avenger's prequel is about one of the most interesting superheroes. Director Kenneth Branagh's (better known as an actor, Valkyrie) Thor bridges the gap between mythology and the comic book superhero genre with action and mystical CGI. The film could have done without the third dimension (3D) and it needed better script writing, but in the end Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek) successfully brings the god alive alongside big name actresses Natalie Portman (Black Swan) and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist). The film begins where Iron Man 2 left off with a supernatural storm landing Thor in the middle of New Mexico. There, scientist Jane Foster (Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Dennings) and Doctor Erik Selvig (Stellen Skarsgard, Pirates of the Caribbean) accidentally hit him with their vehicle wondering where he came from. How did the all mighty Thor end up in the middle of New Mexico? Thor was on the brink of becoming king of his father Odin's (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs) realm Asgard. However, after the Frost Giants from the realm of Jotunheim interrupt the ceremony, Thor leads his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) with a small group of companions to Jotunheim without his father's permission. An epic battle scene unfolds and as the Frost Giant's leader Laufey (Colm Feore, Changeling) fights Thor off, Odin intervenes and banishes Thor to earth for his disobedience stripping him of all his powers. Thor is forced to embark on a journey to regain his honor on earth as he falls for Jane Foster while evading the mysterious organization SHIELD whose intentions come with Furry.Thor is everything a summer superhero blockbuster should be: funny, visually spectacular, action packed and most importantly entertaining. The film is uniquely shot, moving between the mystical realm of Asgard and the Earthly world intertwining the two almost perfectly. Hemsworth, Portman, and Skarsgard were all worthy cast members mending the shoddy script they were given. Hemsworth was definitely big enough for his role, while Portman balances his might as his petite, fragile love interest, and Skarsgard's multidimensional mentor figure. These three still aren't the best part of the film because of a surprise cameo that may not be very obvious, but if you know what is happening you may freak out.The film's visuals are very impressive, however, the 3D is completely unnecessary. Everything seems blurred, dark and cramped because the 3D picture takes away from the beauty of each realm. While this may not be as noticeable to some viewers the script has evident dialogue mishaps creating an underwhelming cinematic opening to the film. Script problems are subdued as the film progresses as the magic of cinema takes hold, but the script may also be to blame for the insertion of Dennings's character in the film; a character without a purpose.Director Branagh does his part in bringing the latest of the Avengers to life in grandiose fashion by creating comic book mythology. The film is everything that the Clash of the Titans remake wishes it was with a side of earthly superhero magic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simple yet highly enjoyable early MCU entry,"Let me start off by saying this: though I consider myself to be a very big MCU fan, there are still a handful of movies that I somehow never got around to seeing. That includes the first two ""Thor"" movies. So what better time to get around to watching them than now!""Thor"" is an admittedly simple yet undeniably enjoyable movie. Heavy with action and excitement yet lacking the emotional weight and character depth of later MCU entries, it's a fun but ultimately forgettable film. The plot is extremely straightforward: Thor is an arrogant Asgardian who is exiled to Earth after starting a war with the frost giants. There, he must find a way to become worthy of his title once more while unintentionally falling in love and combatting the schemes of his usurping brother, Loki.The plot is what I believe ""Thor's"" weakest element is. Though the characters we are introduced to are fun and absolutely enjoyable to watch, the extremely straightforward nature of the plot means that little time is given for character development. Though I had a fun time watching ""Thor"", in the end I found that I didn't feel any differently towards any of the characters except Thor and Loki.Now, that's not to say I think ""Thor"" is a bad movie. Like I've said, I enjoyed it. It's solid entertainment and, in all honestly, that's what early MCU movies were intended to be. Later films and miniseries pack more of an emotional punch, but in my eyes that just makes them more developed than the earlier entries, which is understandable considering that they have had much more time to flesh out characters than films like ""Thor"" (which was the 4th out of 24 movies that have been released so far) had.So all in all, I enjoyed ""Thor""! I wouldn't say it struck me as particularly memorable or intricate, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
By the might of Asgard!,"Who'd have thought the - not particularly well-known - Marvel comic book hero, Thor, would have transferred so well to the big screen? Most people are pretty familiar with Superman, Batman etc, but it takes a little more digging to know about the 'God of Thunder.' He's the son of king Odin and, on the day he is destined to ascend to the throne himself, sets off a chain of events which sees him banished to - guess where - Earth! There, he must learn to not act like quite such an insufferable oaf and sort his head out.And, watching him do so is damn good fun. The film's main brilliance is Thor (or Christ Hemsworth) himself. He plays someone who is way too big for his God-like boots. However, despite being a bit of a puffed-up idiot, he remains likable at all times. You'll root for him whether he's wiping out Frost Giants, or getting in touch with his sensitive side while wooing the unfeasibly-attractive scientist he meets on Earth (hello, Natalie Portman).If you like action, if you like adventure, or if you just want a brilliantly silly film to rest your mind to, this one is it. If you have a sense of fun, whether you know about the 'Marvel Universe' or not, you really should find something you like here.Also, kudos to director Kenneth Brannah for getting involved with this - he's clearly more than just a thespian actor in tights!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best at the bookends when it embraces opera,"Finally, a good movie from Marvel, and most people don't seem to like it very much.I love about 50 minutes of this movie, the first thirty minutes and the last twenty. Everything in between those bookmarks of operatic emotion and design is somewhere between functional and pretty good.The film opens with three people in a van in the middle of the desert looking to the sky at night. Some strange formation of clouds and light forms in the sky, they race towards it, and they find a man who shouldn't be there. I'm not a huge fan of this tendency to start a movie after the story has started as some sort of teaser, but I think it works quite well here based on what follows. The opening couple of minutes is designed to ease the audience into the film and inform them that things are about to get weird.And weird do they get, and it is glorious. We fly across the cosmos to Asgard, a realm full of giant ostentation and seems to be built on a dual plane instead of a spherical celestial body. Sets are huge and covered in gold. The emotions the characters subscribe to are bold and large. The acting fits so appropriately, and we are in this cosmic opera, wallowing in its luscious details for a solid half hour and I love it. Odin, king of Asgard, tells us of Asgard's place in the cosmos as protector and their chief antagonist, the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, another planet. He tells of Asgard's subjugation of Jotunheim, and we see him with his two sons Thor and Loki. At the ceremony to mark Thor's ascendance to the Asgardian throne to replace Odin, the Frost Giants sneak into the Asgardian weapons vault and are promptly killed by the defenses.Thor is furious and demands that they travel to Jotunheim to punish the Frost Giants for their act of war. Odin bites back with fervor. I swear, Anthony Hopkins as Odin is one of my favorite things about these movies so far. He balances the large delivery of big emotions so well, creating an atmosphere that allows for others to operate at the same level of emotion. His two major rebukes of Thor are absolutely wonderful. Thor, of course, goes to Jotunheim with Loki and some pals, cause some havoc, and need to be rescued by Odin. Odin, as punishment for Thor's senseless actions that threaten to ignite war between the two worlds, casts Thor out of Asgard and to Earth. This scene between father and son as Odin calls his oldest a ""vain, greedy, cruel boy"" is probably my favorite scene in Marvel.Then the movie loses a bit of its step as its action comes to Earth. Jane Foster and her two pals guide Thor through a cute (but not too cute) fish out of water tale. Thor throws a coffee mug violently on the ground to express his approval of the drink. He walks into a pet shop to demand a horse or at least a dog large enough to ride. It's cute. The plot turns when Thor learns that his hammer, the mythical Mjolnir, is just a few miles down the road, and he needs to get it back in order to return to Asgard. The organization SHIELD has set up a perimeter and Thor easily cuts through their defenses to reach Mjolnir but he can't lift it from the ground because he is not worthy. He cries and gives up before Jane's older professor colleague, Dr. Erik Selvig, gives a story that SHIELD doesn't believe. They let Thor go in order to follow and potentially learn.Back in Asgard, Odin has fallen into the Odinsleep (which, I assume, is some sort of hibernation that he must go through in order to extend his long life) and Loki has consolidated power through default. He works to keep out Thor from coming back. I don't think Loki was ever as good again as he was in this movie. He learns that he's actually a Frost Giant, and he's deeply wounded by the fact that Odin hid that from him. On top of that, he sees Thor for the brash man who would be a disaster as king and works to undermine him in the eyes of their father. His motives are strong, Tom Hiddleston plays him really well, especially in his big moments with Odin in that first glorious half hour, and he's smart. He's the first antagonist in this series worthy of the name. No wonder they can't let him go through the rest of the series.Anyway, Loki sends the giant terminator like machine to kill Thor back on Earth. Thor sacrifices himself to save his friends, and at that moment, Mjolnir comes alive at Thor's worthiness, flying into his hand and giving him his old clothes back because, sure why not? The Asgardians make it back to Asgard and the movie turns kind of great again. It's all operatic all the time again. Brother against brother. Giant light bridge of rainbow light. Huge emotions as Thor crushes it and prevents him from ever going back to Earth to see Jane Foster again (yeah, right). When Odin awakes and Loki sees the disappointment in his father's eyes for his actions, Loki just gives up, and it's shockingly sad. Loki's just so great.So, yeah, I glossed over Jane Foster and her little gang of misfits. They kind of don't matter. They're entertaining to a degree (Selvig is the best of them), but they don't really affect Thor's core arc very much. Thor is humbled by his brother, and redeemed by his own sacrifice against the Terminator machine. The puny humans provide some room for Thor to demonstrate his lowered ego, but they don't drive it. They tend to drive lighter comedy bits, but they simply don't work as well as the big operatic beginning and end of the film.Visually, the movie is really good beyond the design of Asgard. Kenneth Branaugh is a quality director who gets good performances from his actors (I want to see him direct Anthony Hopkins as King Lear), and he uses the visual language of the medium intelligently. His use of Dutch angles is either done to achieve interesting compositions or to imply that reality has been skewed. So we see these tilted camera angles when Jane Foster gets introduced to the world of magic through Thor but also when we just want a good shot of the warriors three standing in a line up some steps. The color pallete is alternatively vivid like in Asgard and with the rainbow bridge, dark and blue like at Jotunheim, or light brown and dry like in New Mexico.Overall, it's a solid film that looks great and works best at the bookends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Hemsworth's hunky Thundergod plays 2nd fiddle to Tom Hiddleston's delightfully devious Loki,"Marvel does fantasy and fish-out-of-water with Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor,"" a superhero film that film that explores different realms to engaging results. While the film tests the burgeoning Marvel cinematic universe's mettle by moving back and forth between contemporary Earth and fantastic kingdoms, two decidedly different narrative and cinematic landscapes, the work appeals with its larger-than-life characters and classic themes. It is a strong and swift action outing.When Chris Hemsworth's Thor, son of Odin, is cast from his home of Asgard and into southwestern wilds of Earth, the god-prince finds himself tested by old enemies and dangerous, new forces. This premise sets up a classic hero quest; but the narrative movement between the fantastic and the Earth-bound can be jarring. The two sides of the plot are both robust, but there is little easy connection between them. Still, the operatic Asgard moments somehow bolster the comparatively simple New Mexico segments. The story packs surprisingly potent romance, exhilarating heroism, and invigorating world-building into its mix of old-world and contemporary mythology.Branagh weds the two sides of the narrative, steeping each in effective designs and visual styles of its own. Asgard is colorful and royal, while Earth is suitably genuine. The production gleams, and action beats are sturdy and thrilling. The cast is inspired, and Hemsworth makes a mighty addition to the canon but Tom Hiddlestons, mischievous Loki completely steals the show. Branagh's steady directorial hand balances tones, mythologies, and aesthetics while keeping a focus on the film's characters, story beats, and spectacle.""Thor"" could have easily taken a torn toward camp based on its very nature, but it is able to allow its disparate sides to coexist without lapsing into silliness. Thanks to its direction, cast, and committed sense of self, the film succeeds. ""Thor"" proves the viability of the Marvel cinematic universe's ability to take stylistic and narrative risks, and it all makes for an rousing, entertaining experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A comic book movie that is entertaining but far from satisfying...,"Having read / watched several reviews for this movie I went in with great hopes for this movie. What I was given was satisfactory but did not sate the expectations I had for this movie.The Plot: Thor, son of Odin (king of a race of gods called the Aesir). Is sent to earth to learn a lesson on humility, for causing a possible breach on an already brittle relationship between the Aesir and the Frost Giants.The Writing: I thought this was a weaker part of the movie. The portrayal of Thor was good but asides Odin and Heimdall the rest of the Aesir were something left to be desired. They managed to change quite possibly one of the most campy characters from the Marvel universe to a remedially serious one. However the whole movie has a twist that completely hinges on your knowledge of Norse mythology (I have read bull finches mythology book) and the whole movie seemed kind of pointless and kind of silly if one knows about the positions of the Aesir. Do not read the next bracket if you do not want a weak twist to be spoiled (Loki is the God of mischief and trickery). I thought they were unable to give the full breadth of Thor's powers as I felt ambiguously about the strength of Thor, this also applied to Heimdall as everyone seem to treat him with reverence but we do not really see why.There were also some plot holes that were never explained e.g. What is the Odin's sleep? (I know, but others who are not familiar with Norse mythology may find it hard to accept).The character Kat Dennings played also seemed to have no place in the plot and the deadpan humor she attempted to convey seemed to fall flat for me due to weak writing. What the movie does succeed in is turning a relatively enraging plot (putting an ""alien"" into our society and see him interact with it) to an entertaining spectacle. The director also made the dialogue believable and some of the quotes spoken by Anthony Hopkins warrants the viewing of this movie. (2/5)The Acting: Most of the actors portray their characters very well in this movie and convey the right amount of charisma and or subtlety for their respective characters. Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Sarsgard, and Idris Elba give a great energy to this movie but it is Idris Elba's subtle yet commanding Heimdall that really caught my eye. (4/5)The Cinematography: This one was a relatively mixed bag, the scenes during the battle with the Frost Giants were very weak and lazily edited having all the Aesir and Frost Gaint (asides Odin) copy pasted several thousand times with a very lackluster set (that continuous in this set throughout the movie) of the Frost Giant's home world. Thor's abilities and the Rainbow Bridge were done very well and really brought a spectacle to be watched. The monsters were relatively mixed, some being detailed others being lazily edited. (3/5)The Score: Nothing special, some scenes in the Aesir's world were filled with some dramatic and energetic music. (3/5)Thor to the average person is quite enjoyable and I would definitely recommend on a lazy afternoon, but with if you are searching a movie that is remotely edifying you will not find anything of substance here.Final Score = 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertainment at its best,"I watched this film in 2d, and have been a Thor character fan since childhood (in the 1960's). I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.After the Iron man films (The first was really good, and the second a big let down), I didn't really know what to expect from Thor.I think the whole concept was really carried out perfectly as an introduction to the character for those that were not familiar with the comics. I must admit to being quite surprised at some of the negative comments that have been written about this film. It was by far the best superhero adaptation that I have seen.Some people have said that the character development was inadequate, I don't agree. This type of film, people go to see because of the action and the larger than life stories. The film is nearly 2 hours long, if more character development was added the either it would be longer (and many will say its too long) or some of the action sequences would have to go. You can't have it all ways.I stopped reading these comics over forty years ago, and have not kept up with any of the updates, but I think the updated occupations compared to the silver age comics were well carried out.To me it was really just like reading a really good Thor comic, and that is all I expected. As a good Thor comic it was a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This Thor won't go into Valhalla (tv),"As soon as the movie starts, I could feel this adaptation was another Marvel failure (following the Spidey reboot, Daredevil, Hulk, the Xmen or Iron man sequels).It's a pity because they had everything needed for a great movie (an original character, a solid cast). They just couldn't grasp the vision of Nordic mythology and Stan Lee's genius.Here, the CGI production is disastrous as they stupidly enhance the Asgard sets with highly golden colorization to pass for gold! Next, as the heroes goes into the frozen realm, the effects are rather bad. Then, as Thor arrives to earth, his landing isn't NYC but American southwest, thus that is to say nothing except rock and desert landscapes. His Midgard adventure has no deepness except a good fight against his nemesis, the Destructor. This disappointment is also felt with Natalie's performance (who was my main motivation to watch this flick) as she just brought her friendly smile to an empty character.I don't know what other Marvel fans think about it but we are very far away here from Simonson's, Claremont or Romita's territories. In conclusion, Marvel has always the nose to get the real man or woman for the role but they never understand that a comic adaptation needs more. Instead of having Stan the man doing funny cameos in each movie, they should give him the script as well as his ideas totally revolution the medium!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More than just a superhero flick,"Released in 2011, ""Thor"" is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).THE PLOT (minor plot SPOILER): Odin the ""Allfather"" is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse?Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney. Yet the movie isn't about their mythology but about the actual Asgardians, who are very real in this story.""Thor"" works so well because it's more than just a bunch mindless superhero mumbo jumbo and exciting action/CGI. The deep themes include the pitfalls of arrogance, juvenile rebellion, jealousy, rivalry and deceit, as well as the universal nobility of humility, repentance, courage and sacrificial love. Then there's the ""fish out of water"" element of Thor exiled to earth and the curious things he does. On top of all this, we get a complex and interesting villain for a change. Sure the movie has a comic booky vibe, but that's what ""Thor"" is based on. To dismiss it as a campy superhero flick is grossly inaccurate.The film runs 115 minutes and the Earth episodes were shot in New Mexico.The DVD features 4 deleted scenes, a ""Road to the Avengers"" featurette, a director's commentary and a few trailers.FINAL WORD: I don't think you could ask for a better film adaption of the Thor comic and the thunder god's adventures in Asgard, Earth and elsewhere.

Surprisingly good,"I admit, I had low expectations, however, those were exceeded, bravo.Thinking about this movie always left me confused. Here you have a demi-god that carries a big hammer around. It's not exactly the same appeal as a sword or battle axe. As a kid I never really understood Thor.The art direction was great, the costumes were pretty cool and many scenes were very well executed in terms of visual style. I give the effects a solid ten, overall they were very well done, some of the best I've seen.There are a few funny moments scattered throughout as well, though it could have used a few more as the story progressed, just to keep my brain going. As things went on the story began to trudge a bit. Branagh managed to introduce some drama.I give this 9 out of 10 because of how it relates to the genre, a genre with a very low bar IMHO. Even judging it as a pure action movie however I'd give it a solid 8. It's a good flick that is accessible and entertaining even if you haven't a clue why a god carries a hammer around.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie version of Thor was quite an exciting movie to watch,"Just watched Thor in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and while I admit I fell asleep during some of the beginning parts, by the time the title character's brother Loki reveals his intentions, I was riveted the rest of the picture. Kenneth Branagh is fine directing the dialogue and action sequences and the one picked to play Thor is quite charismatic especially when talking to the mortal Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. I wish I had managed to stay awake for the whole thing but still, this was a highly enjoyable movie to watch in a cinema.

Scandinavian mythology put to Marvel,"""Thor"" tells a story about Thor, Norse god of thunder, whose arrogance and hot head results in his castout of the fantastic realm of Asgard to Earth. Here he must redeem himself by learning to be humble and controlling his rash emotions. Meanwhile in Asgard things are not going to according to what one might expect at start.I can honestly say that this is one of the better superhero (and action) films around. The story is very good (i've never read the comics though) and i found it astonishing how well they've incorporated and linked actual Scandinavian mythology into the film (again, maybe it's in the graphic novels too). Thor himself is an interesting and original character. Coming from a different dimension and not being genetically mutated or having unlimited resources, his powers come from his hammer Mjöllnir and being a warrior back in Asgard. Also, he is not your usual blue-eyed character, fighting for justice, the poor and against crime, but has his own motives and ambitions for impressing everyone around him, thus it is interesting to watch how his personality is portrayed throughout the film.Visuals are outstanding, the whole realm of Asgard, the space and the city are done spectacularly. Effects are quite unbelievable, the fighting scenes and traveling through different dimensions. That's a standard we've grown to expect from these kind of movies, and Thor delivers. Nothing bad to say about the plot either. Cast is beyond great. Chris Hemsworth is a real gem, his portrayal of Thor is everything one might expect, i was really impressed with him. Might reckon we'll see him in other major roles in the near future. Tom Hiddlestone does well as Loki too, a character who is growing bitter for his own reasons. Anthony Hopkins (who plays Odin) in a fatherly role and Natalie Portman as Jane provide more of an experienced heavyweight support and are great in their respective roles, as one might expect from Academy Award winners.All in all, Thor is one of the best comic book adaptations to date, an outstanding visual and a film that keeps you in the seat absorbed to this fascinating world. Again, look out for the after the end credits clip, which links together different parts for the Avengers build-up. Honestly, Thor was this good that we'll do well to be waiting anxiously for the sequel and the Avengers before that. Two thumbs up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Whoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""","Remember the post-credit scenes in ""Iron Man 2,"" where the Shield agents discover a mysterious hammer-like object in the desert? Well, they finally made a movie all around that concept. ""Thor"" throws us into a world where Norse myth collides with the science-fiction Marvel universe in a surprisingly sublime fashion. With this clever setup, we are introduced to the title character, who battles giants and mortal men alike with thunderous force. There is plenty of action throughout this flick, and lots of beautiful special effects. Even when Thor isn't bashing the hell out of things, there's enough character-driven drama to keep it strong. And of course, nothing's more amusing than watching an archaic deity walking among modern man; there are a few funny moments throughout. It's maybe not as action-packed as some of the other Marvel films, but ""Thor"" met my expectations perfectly.The story's a little predictable, especially if you're already familiar with the comics or Norse myth. But it is well-presented, and presents enough decent characterization to keep it fresh. I do believe that something is missing; Thor never seems to learn much when he's on Earth. But he does learn something, and when the climax comes it makes good enough sense.The film has good photography for the most part. The frost-giant battle shows some rather jittery cameramanship and editing, but afterwards it's all solid. Some shots have some really funky crooked angles, but I think it's cool. Acting is great; I loved Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman in their roles, and Anthony Hopkins is a naturally good choice for Odin. Writing is not terribly sophisticated, but it gets the job done. Production value is phenomenal, with loads of excellent sets, props, costumes, and some very imaginative settings. It's especially impressive how the designers have adopted Norse myth into the story and designs to fit into a sci-fi niche, and still make sense. The music score is not bad.Recommended! 4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly good.,"First off I am not a Thor fan nor i am a comic book fan. I went into this movie with no expectations, expecting another popcorn fest along the lines of the Ironman movies. Therefore I was quite pleasantly surprised by Thor. Whereas most comic book movies lack plot or storyline, Thor actually engages the viewer with the classic tale of loving father and the wayward son finding his way along with all the typical action requirements of a comic book movie. I can't vouch for Thor's faithfulness to the comic of course but that it still managed to entertain this none-fan is a testament to the movie. Whilst not perfect it's certainly more entertaining than that other popcorn flick, Battle LA which deserves a Razzy award.If you know nothing of Thor, go watch this movie and be entertained as Thor certainly does. The only issue I may like to mention is the poor use of 3D. The cinema I went to only had 3D for Thor and I was thus forced to watch it in 3D. Having previously being wowed by TRON LEGACY in 3D I can say that the 3D work on Thor was quite lacking. Also I feel that 3D is been unnecessarily pushed onto EVERY movie with the slightest amount of action, and Thor's problem is many of it's action scenes don't need the 3D treatment. My advice is watch this in normal 2D and save yourself some money.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
nice try but very boring,"this movie was so overrated and may i ask one question how can eny one like this piece of crap it was boring i fell asleep in the theatres and trust me i was not missing enything i rewatched it on DVD and it was still very bad i have heard that a sequel is in the works why? it will be another 2 hour piece of crap that will again be over hyped thor was not a very interesting comic book character to begin with so why make a move i mean iron man was not either but the iron man movies are done so much better it there was three words to describe this movie here they are boring,sucks,crap do your self a favor and watch thor in the avengers thor is some what better in the avengers then he is in this mess of a movie",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Superhero Thrill Ride Thank God For Marvel!,Thor has to be one of Marvels best superhero flicks you will have a great time throughout the movie plus there are some great performances. Thor follows the god of thunder as he is cast out of his fathers kingdom and things start to go a lot worse from there onwards. There are also some great scenes with SHIELD and many if you listen hard enough there are some great mentions to other hero's in the Avengers movie for next year. Thor is a must see for any action fan or a Marvel Comics fan although it doesn't reach The Heights Of The Dark Knight it is entertaining and maybe paying the extra for 3D is worth it for some scenes. There are also some great battle scenes which will blow you away bring on 2012 bring on The Avengers.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor Soars,"In the climactic battle of brother against brother, Loki (amazing Tom Hiddleston) confesses to Thor (commanding Chris Hemsworth), ""I never wanted to be King. I only wanted to be your equal!"" That arc captures the surprising greatness and ambition of Director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"". Branagh, who is known more for his Shakespearean adaptations, is an unlikely candidate for ""Thor"", based on the beloved Marvel superhero. However, here Branagh's Shakespearean sensibilities well serve ""Thor"". ""Thor"" is mesmerizing as it retells the Norse Mythology of Odin and Asgard. ""Thor"" tells the timeless story of sons vying for their father's love, and betrayal. ""Thor"" at its summit is classic Greek Tragedy, like the best comic book heroes. This is so unexpected given the numerous screen and story writers involved: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski, and Mark Potosevich. The source material is the comic book by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby.""Thor"" is defiantly engrossing. It is also so well acted with Academy Award Winners Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as intrepid scientist Jane Foster. Both command gravitas, especially Hopkins. Rene Russo strongly plays Odin's wife devoted Frigga. Tom Hiddleston virtually steals the movie as the duplicitous Loki. He brilliantly balances villainy and tragedy. Idris Elba is powerful and noble as gold armored Gatekeeper Heimdall. Newcomer Chris Hemsworth is charismatic and surprisingly charming and funny. The dude is classically handsome with blonde mane and chiseled body. I had read how he trained for ""Thor""-- he looks amazing. He is a great action guy as he dispatches S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents like nothing. More impressive than his ripped abs, is his screen presence, and he holds his own with Hopkins. He and Hopkins have a visceral chemistry. In a touching scene Thor admits to his Father Odin, ""Someday perhaps, I shall make you proud"" In that moment I was reminded of Hopkins and Brad Pitt in ""Meet Joe Black"".In ""Thor"", Thor (Hemsworth) is a reckless, vain, and arrogant warrior and god. He is Odin's favorite son, and that wounds the very soul of his brother Loki (Hiddleston). Thor is next in line to King Odin. We learn from Norse mythology that Asgard maintains a truce with their mortal enemies the Frost Giants, lead by malevolent King Laufey (darkly seething Colm Feore), following a legendary battle with Odin. Outraged by terrorist interruption of his ascension Thor leads his loyal group of warriors along with Loki to engage the Frost Giants. His rashness threatens all out war in the Realms. Odin says, ""You are a vain greedy, cruel boy."" Thor strikes back, ""You are an old man, and a fool!"" Odin banishes his son Thor to Earth. His mighty hammer Mjollnir also plummets to the deserts of New Mexico—as we recall from ""Iron Man 2"". Only the one deserving to wield the power of Thor can raise the hammer. Scattered genius Dr. Jane Foster (Portman) literally crashes into earth bound Thor. Jane and her team, Erik (Stellen Skarsgard) and Darcy (funny Kat Dennings), have been tracking repeated cosmic disturbances in the desert.Geeky and klutzy Jane resists her attraction to the hunky Thor. Shocking. At the same time, the Government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Coulson (deft straight man Clark Gregg) isolate Thor's hammer in a covert operation of grave national security. They also confiscate all of Jane's research. There is some funny fish out of water humor at Thor's expense. As much as Erik does not want to admit, all things point to the Norse God of Thunder. Thor gives his Viking word of honor to Jane, knowing that he endangers them both.Back in Asgard, the conflicted Loki is both beholding to and jealous of his brother. He so fiercely desires the love and approval of his father. Loki confirms the tragic betrayal from Odin, who then falls gravely ill. Hiddleston is powerful as Loki perpetuates a lie. He dearly loves his brother, but he cannot forgive his perceived betrayal. In this ""Thor"" soars. The weakness in ""Thor"" resides in the Earth bound story. Granted ""Thor"" is a predictable transformation and surrender of courage and humility. However, the love story of Thor and Jane is the least evolved. I think in the classic story of the Hero, Director Branagh intended this to be a source of power, but perhaps this got lost in the editing. What remains is still great and compelling. ""Thor"" is heroic tragedy with its tale of a Father's love, and brother's betrayal. Hopkins, Hemsworth, and Hiddleston are awesome in Branagh's Shakespearean rendering of ""Thor"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Behold the Mighty Start of the Summer!,"Thor was the Marvel property that, at first blush, I thought was a dumb idea to make into a movie. A Norse God becomes a superhero? To a novice comic follower like myself, it sounded ridiculous. But what do you know? Marvel Studios shut me up again like when they released the first Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk reboot. Behold the mighty Thor in all his glory!Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an arrogant warrior from beyond the stars trying to prove himself to his wise father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in their home realm of Asgard. Thor and his band of warriors assault a realm filled with ice giants (just go with it, it totally works) after a few giants infiltrated Asgard to steal a powerful weapon. For Thor's brazen foolishness, he is banished by Odin to the realm of Earth and stripped of his godlike powers. When Thor slams down to Earth, he is greeted by young astronomer, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has questions of her own of the stars. But Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has some dark plans now that Thor is exiled from Asgard.The plot's a little complex, but it's easier to see on the big screen. The film is split between telling the epic and chaotic war on Asgard and the classic fish-out-of-water story on Earth. Some people (comic fanboys) were concerned that the whole film would be focused on the Earth side story, which is not at all the case. The goofy Earth stuff you see in the trailer is all there, but surprisingly, that's all there was to the goofiness. A good portion of the film is dedicated to Thor getting back his powers and learning humility while his time on Earth. Thanks in no small part to Natalie Portman, but if you were getting checked out by someone like her you'd be damn sure to reform any of your character flaws.From this setup, Kenneth Branagh directs his actors to say Shakespearean-like dialogue with such gusto that it almost seems believable. When Thor is speaking in such a way in Asgard, you never laugh because his and others dialogue feels natural in this setting. It's when he arrives on Earth that Thor's mannerisms and speech become funny, but that's how it usually seemed to me in the shows I've seen with Thor. All the actors turn in solid performances with a great script that manages to balance humor and adventure into a nice package.Then there's the action and wow does it work. Branagh, who's only versed in directing Shakespearean films, shows a little knack for making epic fight sequences between Thor and his various enemies. They feel immense and awe-inspiring, with the computer-generated images never bothering you for a second. Everything just feels right and amazing. You want to see a fun, summer adventure film? You'll find it right here.My only complaints are small ones. The beginning dragged a bit for the first ten minutes, but when it picks up, it gets going to the very end. The other problem I had was with Loki. While Tom Hiddleston does a fine job with what he's given, Loki never feels like a great threat to Thor. While I'm happy to see they gave some dimension to his character by giving him valid reasons for his actions, he still comes across as a sniveling weasel. For setting up Thor's origin story, he works, but I'm left wanting more from the villain department.So is Thor worth checking out? That's a resounding, thunderous yes. It's an epic adventure with the right amount of humor and pathos to make this an entertaining summer blockbuster. What's more, it paves the way for the larger-than-life Avengers film coming next summer and shows that no hero under Marvel's control is not good enough for the big screen. Watch it and enjoy the beginning the summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The God Of Thunder.,"So I saw Thor yesterday. And I liked it, quite a bit. First things first, casting Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a stroke of genius. His voice alone could be considered his most powerful tool in his portrayal as the All-Father. His presence also instills a certain serious tone, which is just what this movie needed, it being about a comic-book superhero who happens to be based on the Norse God of thunder.Chris Hemsworth is another example of good casting.I've always preferred somewhat unknown actors in larger roles, it gives the actor the opportunity to boost his career and the director more creative freedom. Hemsworth does a marvelous job. Aside from his physique he carries himself with just the right amount of charm, pride and vigor to make Thor a lovable character.The action sequences are amazing and breathtaking to say the least. I can't even remember half of what happened during those scenes, I just remember that my popcorn was running really low really fast. It's certainly a feast for the eyes.Which brings us to the story. The story is quite straight-forward, aside from it happening in the realm of Asgard. An arrogant and young Thor is stripped of his powers by his father in order for him to learn the value of his life and life in general before he can take his father's place. There is more going on, but I would rather not spoil it.So in short, Thor is the perfect start for the summer season. A light fast-paced character-driven comic-book movie, upholding the old notion that we have to learn the lesson, of not knowing all the answers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
High Expectations - Does it Disappoint?,"With a budget in excess of $150,000,000 and a stellar cast behind it, I went into Thor will high expectations, and hoped not to be disappointed. Over the past few years we have been treated to numerous superhero films from the Marvel franchise, and I think it would be fair to say many of them have been good, but not always lived up to the high expectations cinema-goers set for them.Thor is not the traditional superhero film in the true sense of what we have come to expect from the genre – you will not see anyone prancing around in a lycra suit, chasing down a villain dressed as a clown here. Rather the film is based on a mysterious and legendary tale and in particular the Norse God Thor. An interesting theory is bought up with how modern day science is the equivalent ofancient magic, and this provides an effective link from the universe of Thor back to the universe we live in today. The film is focused around two brothers – Loki and Thor – and their rise/attempted rise to the throne of Asgard and the battles that need to be fought along the way. I won't give away too many details within this review, as I don't want to spoil the film, but let's just say they both do not tend to see eye to eye.As a director Kenneth Branagh excels in what many will consider an unfamiliar genre for his direction. Branagh has long been associated with the stigma of being a director of drama (in particular Shakespeare) something well deserved as he does it so well, but it would be unfair to not give him credit for the work he has done with Thor. The fight scenes throughout the movie has obviously been well planned out, and all translate onto screen effectively under Branagh's direction. Humour is abundant as Thor is forced out of his comfort zone into the 'modern realm' – there is an particularly hilarious scene involving a cup early on in the movie – something that reminded me of a true life incident involving the girl sitting next to me in the cinema! These humorous moments really add to the movie, especially as they offer some light relief from what could have been continuous action sequences, whilst at the same time not taking away from the action too much.One of the strongest points of this film are the characters themselves and the talented actors that portray them. As the lead Chris Hemsworth shines remarkably as Thor, bringing life to the character with just the right amount of cockiness and wit. Natalie Portman makes up for her terrible outing in Your Highness with an impeccable display as the love interest and modern day scientist, and it would be unfair to forget to mention her partners Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings who compliment her character perfectly. I thought Dennings in particular is an unsung hero in this movie and I look forward to seeing her career continue to blossom in the future. Veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot be faulted in his role as King Odin, and one cannot not compliment Tom Hiddleston who puts in perhaps the best performance of the whole film as Loki. He nails the character down to a tee, and it would be difficult to imagine anyone else taking up the role and the character being played in any other way. Tom Hiddleston is definitely another one to watch in the future.The main issue I had with Thor is that the plot was sometimes slightly too far fetched and leaky. Too much of the film is used to set up for The Avengers next year, particularly with the presence of Shield (the government agency) who also made an appearance in Iron Man 2 last year. I also found the movie to be awfully predictable and it was easy to tell what was coming next, and how it was all going to play out at the end. That being said there was a few things I was slightly surprised over (I won't go into too much detail here) but this was a negative as I though parts were missing that could have been nicely tied up. The film does set up nicely for The Avengers movie, and of course the inevitable sequel of Thor 2 that I expect we shall see in Cinemas within the next two/three years at the latest.Overall, not a bad outing from Marvel in the slightest. The cast really make this movie what is is, and the action doesn't disappoint. If the story has just been a little bit stronger and I hadn't been made to feel I was simply watching a 114 minute long build up trailer for The Avengers this film would have got a full ten stars from me. Still worth going to watch however, and this looked especially good on the big screen in 3D.Visit my blog at StevieNight.com for more of my reviews.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Well acted, fun ride, but cuts may have hurt pacing","In a town with a population of 5588 the midnight 2D showing was almost packed to capacity. There was also a 3D showing. I asked how sales were for each and got a vague reply that seemed to indicate most were opting for 2D tickets. I saw a guy with 3D tickets walk right by the long 2D line and enter his theater. Don't know if that means anything, but Thor may not get a huge boost from 3D if this is typical. He'll have to earn the money the old-fashioned way I guess.Really had a good time once it got rolling. But felt like something was cut during the early parts of the movie. Things felt rushed. Supposedly 15-20 minutes was cut from the film at the last minute. That may be where the extra 15 minutes was supposed to be. So a guy in a suit somewhere probably stuck his hand in where it didn't belong. The proper ""Thor geek moments"" were all there....and they worked on screen really well. I...kinda want that hammer. Thor as a character is a true bad-ass. More action than the Iron Man movies. More than most super hero movies to be honest. The crowd really seemed to enjoy the movie. At first I wondered if this was biased because the midnight showing was packed with fan-boys who were predisposed to like it. But then the ending credit popped up and over half the theater got up and left! This crowd was clearly not fan-boys. I have to question if many of them have internet connections.The cast was really good. Hemsworth is great as Thor. The guy has a likability factor that can't be bought and can't be taught. When he smiles you almost have to like him....cannot wait to see him and RDJ trade barbs in The Avengers. Hopkins was magnificent as Odin....""regal"" is the proper word. Hiddleston was also great as Loki. He brought layers to a character that is supposed to have layers. There is a scene between he and Hemsoworth on Earth that is as poignant as any scene I've seen in a super hero movie ever. The ""warriors 3"" were underwhelming though...though Alexander was really good as Lady Sif. Portman was better than I thought she would be. I'm not a huge fan of hers. I like her but don't get all the praise she often gets. But here she made some lines that could have been cheesy work very well. The history of female leads in super hero movies is not good....Portman puts a notch in the ""good female lead' side of the ledger. Dennings did not irritate me like I expected and even made me laugh a couple of times.I'll give it a 8/10 for the moment. Not quite up to Iron Man level, but better than most super hero movies I've seen. Would probably be in my top 10. Something tells me the directors cut will have a higher score for me. That cut footage hurts it a little. It didn't have a ""left the audience wanting more"" feel...it had a ""left the audience needing more"" feeling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awful.,"I am, and always will be a huge fan of Marvel, however, this is possibly the worse movie i have ever seen. There is more character development in any one of the Thor comics, than this movie. How it has managed to score 7/10 on IMDB beggars belief. Who can possibly like such a meaningless and dull movie. I cannot believe that J. Michael Straczynski actually gave his name to this, let alone that he was responsible for the script. I was expecting something memorable and intelligent, after all J.Michael Straczynski's writing for Marvel's Thor Comic run in 2007 was nothing short of a game changer, intelligent, humorous and memorable. But this movie ! Movies these days have to have some character development so that the characters aren't completely 2 dimensional. This movie was like an explosion in a special effects studio. One CGI scene after another with some pretty bad acting sequences in between. The Marvel Thor comics have always been quite clever at incorporating Norse mythology into the stories. Wasn't Dr Donald Blake meant to be Thor when he originally found the hammer? Here we have Natalie Portman as Jane saying her ex was Dr Donald Blake and gurning. What was all that about? Then we have the 'blink and you've missed it' scene where Thor transforms from a war mongering selfish oaf, to Odin's favourite son again. What was the dramatic sequence of events to cause such a transformation, because i think i missed them? The characters were the embodiments of a cliched am dram production. The simpering stormchasing Jane who has a thing for buff men. The old scientist dude who says 'no' to everything. The geeky character who says geeky things. Please. Marvel, please treat your viewers with a little more intelligence than this. Do yourself a favour. If you like Thor, read the comic. I can't believe Sir Kenneth Branagh was involved in this either. The beautifully executed Wallander series, with minimalist acting and subtle imagery and emotional acting and dramatic tension. How can this be the same person? Maybe the film started off as a clever and witty idea, but became a movie by numbers that was executed by a committee and whose target audience was aimed at children who will buy merchandise?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The God of Thunder,"Open up the heavens and let the thunder come, because Thor will unleash his wrath upon the planets and the galaxy. I really wasn't supposed to see this movie, but I'm glad I did because it was pretty awesome. I actually learned something: don't mess with the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth played the title role beautifully, Natalie Portman, she's great in any movie, but the wonderful Sir Anthony Hopkins – no one can compare to him, he is a god among men.Kenneth Branagh, 9 years ago played Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets, did an excellent in the director's chair of Thor. I don't know what else to say about this movie, but it was really good and I was on the edge of my seat waiting for thunder to strike. As they say, thunder strikes twice in the same place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't mess with the God of Thunder!,"I have never been very familiar with Thor the Marvel Hero, so I can't say that I was very enthusiastic about a movie with Thor in it at first; having seen screen shots with long-haired men in shiny armor, I feared for something unintentionally ridiculous like Catwoman. When I heard that Ken Branagh was taking the directorial duties, I was somewhat reassured that they would at least make a serious attempt to get something good out of it. But, this being a movie about gods with super powers, I was still less than convinced that they could make something out of it that was both entertaining and engaging.When the reviews came in quite positively, I decided to give Thor a chance, and I am glad to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Mixing fantasy with reality in a believable, non-corny way is no small feat, but Branagh and his team pulled it off greatly.The start was shaky at best, though. The narrated prologue was quite hectic, throwing in vague concepts and weird creatures in a train of fast-cut, badly lit and shaky action scenes, making it hard to make any heads or tails from it, either story-wise or visually. However, then the story slows down considerably and things start to make sense. The rest of the movie is well-balanced between a story of a troubled and arrogant young warrior who has to find his place and prove himself worthy, and some energetic action scenes where you CAN discern what happens, who hits who and what explodes. The feeling I had after seeing the first Iron Man movie certainly comes to mind.Even though I make the comparison with Iron Man, I also should point out that Thor will require a bigger part of your imagination. The flying suit in Iron Man also needs some stretch of the mind, but it is still basically very advanced technology. Thor requires that you accept the existence of immortal superior beings within our world, edging much more into the realm of fantasy. As I said, I was curious if Branagh could handle this 'clash' between reality and mythology without becoming either too serious or too campy, but he succeeds, by using these situations to great comical effect, again balancing it skillfully against the dramatic moments.He has some excellent actors to thank as well. Chris Hemsworth does a great job as a superhero who has to be tough, cocky, but at times fragile and funny as well. Same goes for Tom Hiddleston, who is both devious and likable, making for a convincing bad guy. And last but not least, sir Anthony Hopkins in a part that requires his greatness, divinity and fatherly strictness for a change; all too often, he seems to be cast just to give movies some British stage class and grandeur, but here he is the right man for the part.The 3D presentation of this movie doesn't really add that much; it makes for some nice action scenes, but the 3D rendering has the unfortunate adverse effect of considerably darkening scenes, which was problematic in the prologue and some more scenes that are already dark in themselves. So I'll be looking forward to the 2D BluRay version.So I certainly recommend seeing this movie, and I even suggest that you sit out the end-credits for the traditional Marvel productions post-credit scene, the best so far in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This one has adrenaline rushing action all through the movie and really good 3D graphics and the superb quality. It has got a great mixture of action, magic(the science not understood to man ""as the movie calls it""), and some mix of star-gate and the Greek mythology.

Here for the jokes,"Thor is a mediocre and flat movie but offers good visuals and an interesting setting. I expected it to be just a bunch of silly action scenes and flamboyant effects, but they even tried to put some plot and setting in it. I just wished the writing was not so sappy and naive, did they hire a thirteen-year-old to do the script? Thor's relationship with Jane and the other human characters is so forced and simplistic, all characters are one-dimensional and add no value to the movie. It does not look like their affection grew through the experiences they shared together; they just spend a night under the stars to realize they are soulmates. I guess the whole thing is supposed to be about Thor's growth as a character, but again there is no development whatsoever: the arrogant and reckless kid suddenly changes into a big-hearted superhero, just because the story requires him to. Wait, maybe finding true love is what changed him all of a sudden? Please. Him trying to adapt to the human world was kind of fun though.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
If you like Marvel then you will like this.,"Firstly I want to point out that I am giving this film 8 out of 10 on the basis that it is a Marvel super hero action film. To review it any other way would be unfair. It doesn't take itself seriously, sticks to the comic book characters well and also links in well with the other Avenger stories / SHIELD i.e Iron man, Hulk and probably Captain America.It contains everything needed to make it fun and entertaining with lots of action, great special effects, a few laughs and then topped off with more action.My only issue was that I went to see it in 3D and felt it really didn't need it. In fact I thought it was more of a distraction than anything else when it was used and that didn't seem to be very often, therefore you watch the majority of the film slightly blurred for only a few minutes of real 3D. If I could rewind time I would probably have preferred just to go and watch the 2D version.All in all though it was just a good film and if you do go and see it just remember what your going to watch, a film adaptation from a comic book, not a serious drama or some artsy fartsy garbage.

Thor (2011),"I'm a big comicbook movie fan and a moderate comicbook fan. I've never really been too familiar with the character of Thor, other than his appearance in an Incredible Hulk TV movie. I knew he was arrogant, confused, and a great warrior. I've also seen him in a few animated movies too. Like many fans, I await the arrival of The Avengers, but at the same time I hoped this wouldn't turn into a suppressive prequel like Iron Man 2.This was one of the most enjoyable film experiences in quite some time. It nailed everything that a summer blockbuster adventure movie should have. Action, comedy, romance (even if a tad forced), and great set pieces and supporting characters. Hemsworth plays Thor, as an arrogant tool. He thinks he knows it all, and can do it all. After being banished from his realm, a beautifully constructed Asgard that mixes CGI with more traditional set design, he arrives on earth with no powers. While his mischievous brother assumes control of Asgard.Thor, as a movie, has a lot to do. It has to kick start its own franchise, follow into The Avengers, all the while, mixing the world of Gods and magic, with our human world. It was never going to be an easy task so Branagh was the perfect choice. With his time in Shakespeare, he can do the classical, the drama, the tragedy, and the comedy. All of which is present and has plenty of space to breathe. The humour is difficult to get right, as this is Fish-out-of-water stuff. It's easy to make Thor seem stupid, but Branagh and the writers make him a traveller of worlds. He expects earth to be different, and knows he must at least try and fit in. By the time Thor's friends arrive in a Masters of the Universe fashion, it's clear this film has its tongue in cheek.On the acting front we get a great bunch. Hemsworth is everything he needs to be and more. His emotional screaming is just as satisfactory as his charm and humour. Hiddleston is the breakout star here. He plays Loki with many layers of complexity, which gradually evolves his frustrated pranks into more devilish acts. Portman is a love interest, and a smart one at that, at least she is able to help the hero in some way. Hopkins is his grand self, and Dennings is a nice if unnecessary addition, which gives her comedic duties allowing Portman and others to focus on the story.The action sequences are very well handled, although Thor's flying is usually kept at a distance. They never seem too long or too short (looking at you Iron Man 2). This is a great blockbuster and does what it should.

I can't take it seriously,"Thor is arguably the one Marvel superhero I just cannot take seriously, no matter how hard I try. That has most likely something to do with the fact that I'm Norwegian, and so I take the mythology very seriously. If there is one thing the MCU doesn't need, it's the whole Asgard thing. It feels out of place to put mythology into a superhero franchise, and on top of that, I really didn't like how it looked in this film. The locations and outfits all look ridiculous, and it took a lot of enjoyment away. I also think that the story itself is rather bland. The performances are great, and the characters are alright, but it's in service of such a mindless story that is doesn't help much. The final fight towards the end also feels meaningless and unimpactful. This is definietly one of the weaker MCU movies, which I doubt I will think much about again",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fast-paced and powerful super-god film!,"This is a fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping Marvel film featuring the super god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who was cast out of his home on Planet Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) for his arrogance and sent to live on Earth with the humans. He tries to blend in and meets scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), learning the lessons of humanity from her and falling in love - all the while dealing with a super villain from his homeland that has come to wreck havoc on Earth.Thor is nonstop action, from the mighty warrior fighting the Frost Giants on his home planet to him joining forces with his warrior comrades - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) - to battle the super villain on Earth. This movie is also nonstop suspense, from U.S. government agents poking around investigating Thor's weapon and presence on Earth to Odin delivering some family drama in the story.There is plenty of decent and spectacular special effects to highlight the tension in the plot, as well as a good dose of comic relief where appropriate, though, some was overdone at certain points, courtesy of the blabbermouth Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings).The movie is a little too high on the CGI, but, the graphics were beautiful and blends in well with the visual effects at least.

Above average.,"I was quite surprised at how effective this ""Marvel Comics"" superhero move is. ""Thor"" works because it keep the plot quite simple and therefore, avoiding any unnecessary subplots. The story goes something like this: The Mighty Thor is banished from his own world by his viking father (Anthony Hopkins) and is sent to the modern day world. Upon Thor's arrival, his trademark hammer has been embedded into the ground and no one but Thor can retrieve it. Thor befriends a group of archeologists who have been excavating in the same area where the hammer lays. There is a strong feeling of vulnerability about Thor. For all his bravery and fighting skills, he is rather overwhelmed and bemused by his surroundings. The man cast as the superhero is OK but no actor. Anthony Hopkins does well as Thor's father Odin. The rest of the cast are tolerable. I enjoy this film more than I thought I would.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Dutch angles ruin this movie,"Yes, the Dutch angles are so distracting. Seriously, there are so many Dutch angle shots in this movie, and it's not necessary at all.Anyways, the movie is kinda boring. When Thor is in Asgard, the movie is fine. In fact, more than fine. The setting of Asgard is beautiful, with breathtaking shots and the designs of the people in this world.But once Thor is in the real world, it goes down hill. The desert is ugly, dull, and boring. The fish out of water sequences are enjoyable, but after that, nothing else.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fails with certain things, but still highly entertaining!","First thing i need to say is that i'm not very familiar with Thor as a character. I heard of the comic books and everything, but i've never actually read one. With that being said, i can't say whether the movie is faithful to it's original material, but i can say that as a movie it works. It's got that fine line between science fiction and fantasy that in a way makes it stand out from all the other 'SUPER-HERO' movies i've seen. I like all the mythology behind it and all the interesting perspectives of looking at, or at least comparing science to magic. And even though i think that the beginning is too sword and sorcery like as far as the dialogue goes, the rest of the movie works fine in that matter. There are even some good jokes made of it when Thor comes to earth.As surprising and admirable as it is that Kenneth Branagh, who is considered a highly artistic director, directed this movie, i must say that i think that it was the wrong choice. I just don't think he has an eye for action or for a spectacle as some directors like Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer and Zack Snyder do. I'm not saying that directing is bad, i just think that certain action sequences could've been done way more exciting and simply more cool, which would fit this kind of movie. However, i also think that he brought some goods to the movie as well. And also, now that i think of it, i'm not so surprised that he decided to direct this movie. It has that Shakespearean quality about it. All the family like friendship's and family relationships and betrayals, which were quite predictable by the way, give this movie that tragic undertone which Shakespeares work always had.That is one of the main problem's i had with the movie, it's too predictable and certain things just don't work and are very poorly done. Like for instance, the relationship between Thor and Jane. It happens so quickly and so structurally bad that it's barely noticeable. Don't be surprised if by the end of the movie you ask your self, when did these two fall in love!?! The two characters were not given enough time with each other, or they did even too much but none of it being a romantic time, and even though they were seeing each other through out the movie i never, not once, had a feeling that they took it to another level or that they were even about to. Well, the camp fire scene near the end looked like they were about to, but guess what, they didn't! Another thing i didn't like is that the only character in the entire movie that is somewhat characterized is Thor. All the other characters are completely ignored and barely anything that happens has anything to do with them. That stands especially for characters from earth.I'd recommend the movie, but with a note that if the things i mentioned were done better, the movie would've been a lot better. Very interesting and entertaining, but....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

That's more like it!,"Out of all the Marvel superhero movies, this was probably the least likely one to succeed. Not only does it feature a fairly unknown superhero, it also had a pretty unusual cast and crew involved. None of the sings were very promising really but as it turns out, the movie is actually one of the better, modern, superhero flicks out there!Kenneth Branagh isn't exactly a director who is known for his action- or big budgeted movies. He's a director who is more fond of direction Shakespeare- and Shakespeare type of movies. This approach and style however also proofed to be very effective for this movie. It suits the story, everything that is happening in it and its characters and dialog all very well.It also doesn't necessarily feature a typical superhero movie cast. For Thor, the unknown Chris Hemsworth got cast, who turned out to be a great choice. As a love interest, it has Natalie Portman, which doesn't sound very likely but then again, she is no usual love interest. It's a very solid character on its own, who just happens to fall for the God of thunder. It's surprising how basically everybody in this movie suits their roles so extremely well. Really, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings, Colm Feore, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, there is not one bad casting choice in this movie, though it all still might sound a bit as an unusual cast list on paper. I would also especially like to mention Tom Hiddleston, who was perfect, in the role of the main villain Loki.It's a movie in which everything comes together surprisingly well. It's being a great mixture of several elements, such as storytelling and spectacle. It besides manages to find a great balance between the scenes that are taking place on Earth and the ones taking place at Asgard. Both are completely different from each other, with each different 'rules' and visual styles. Yet it all blends in with each other perfectly and the movie feels like one big whole.It's a surprising spectacular movie, which is also really thanks to its vivid visuals. Asgard looks fantastic and the so do all of the movie its other effects. It's a real special effects heavy movie but the effects often are not necessarily just there to impress but also to help to tell its story and create a wonderful atmosphere for the movie.Besides, the movie is also being a very classy one. It has some great cinematography and it's obvious that often the emphasis of the filmmakers got put on its actors and their performances and delivery of their lines. It results in often some great dialog and performances by its cast, that help to keep the movie going and great, fun and compelling enough to watch, at all times.Really not much wrong with this movie and it quite honestly is among the best and also most surprising superhero movies of recent years.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Marvel's first big 'risk' project turned out well in their favor,"This was arguably Marvel Studios' first big 'risk' project. There was a major possibility that this film could've ended up being an extremely cheesy and laughable affair. And yet that's not what happened. Under the direction of Kenneth Branagh, known for his many adaptations of Shakespeare plays, the film does carry a solid atmosphere with strong Shakespearean themes which help keep the film from being too campy. Chris Hemsworth shines in the role of Thor as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother (and the film's main villain) Loki, though the latter would truly start to stand-out in future MCU films. Some may take issue with the film primarily taking place on Earth but I think it works out pretty well. We see Thor struggle to adapt to human life while also becoming more of a noble hero, which is a pretty great arc for the character. And as for the film's use of humor, I actually think it worked pretty well too, at least when it came to how Thor goes about while on Earth (e.g. ""This drink. I like it... Another!! (*smashes glass*)). It may not be the absolute best of the MCU but I still think very fondly of this film and it once again proved that Marvel could make quality films centered around 'B-level' characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Way Up North,"I have been dragged through the Marvel milieu by my son. Contrary to my snobbish initial prejudices, I have enjoyed these quite a bit. This one, of course, sets the stage for the appearance of Thor, the hammer-wielding hunk, who is striving top prove himself worthy of becoming king in the upper-world, possibly displacing Anthony Hopkins' Odin at some point. The fly in the ointment (actually there are several) is his sort of half brother, Loki, whose face reminds me of a hybrid of Brent Spiner and Pee Wee Herman. He is really full of the Dickens and totally amoral, especially after finding out a secret which I will not divulge. The strength of this film is that it does a very nice job of storytelling, despite it's ignorance of real Norse mythology. Nobody cares. We understand the powers of the characters, we like the romance between mortal and demi-god, the main character is charming though violent, and the movie has a sense of humor, where we can be allowed to take a breath at times. And there are unanswered questions, which have us waiting for the next adventure. Unfortunately for me, I've seen these things all out of order, so I try to evaluate them on their individual merits. I had a nice time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Slightly funny, but disappointing Marvel film","I wanted to watch this movie to see all the Marvel films chronologically. Unfortunately, Thor didn't live up to expectations. The dialogues are badly written, with very obvious, flat jokes and the plot line is very thin. Character development happens overnight and once again, a few hours together means that the main characters fall in love and end up preparing breakfast together. There are some funny one-liners, but they are overshadowed by the rest of the script. I may be biased, but compared to, for example, the first Iron Man, the movie falls short of the wit, humor and plot that I've seen in other (not all ;) ) Marvel films. On its own, the movie is just not enough, so I'd only watch it if you want to complete the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As Mighty as Asgard.,"Marvel had been putting together a string of very unmemorable not so good films years ago with Ghostrider, Daredevil, and spiderman 2 and 3. However as of late there have been some great Marvel Films and Thor is one of them.Thor is to be the ruler of Asgard but has himself banished to Earth without his powers due to him going behind his fathers back and starting a war. His mighty Hammer is also sent to Earth and only he can ever possess the ability to use it again some day, but first must prove himself to his father Oden. Thors brother Loki plots to rule Asgard himself after learning secrets about his past.A major reason for this film being so good is the acting. The cast is phenomenal. Chris Hemsworth plays a very good Thor, I really bought his performance as the God of Thunder. Natalie Portman is great as always and Anthony Hopkins is always legendary, one of the best actors ever in my opinion.The story was also good. It starts with a flashback explanation on how Thor got to where he was. Very well done. Also there was a lot of funny parts that I found entertaining. NOthing too lame or anything so that was good.I also really liked the Villain, Loki. He was also well portrayed for his screen adaptation. And Destroyer was also really cool, even if the effects for his laser were really loud.Action was pretty good, Thor could have battled more when he was actually in control of his god like powers. However I am sure he will get to do more in his next films.This was very good film. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Taking one of the seven basic plots, but making it apply to comic books, the real world, and beyond...","I feel that the sequel to this movie is almost destined to flop, if a deal can't be agreed that sees Kenneth Branagh return to direct.... Initially I thought handing him the job was a mistake, but after judging on the merits of the entire film, I'm confident that I totally understand the choice... Both he and one of his stars (Anthony Hopkins) know how to sell bombastic speeches and make them inspirational rather than hyperbolic. Some people don't understand the intrinsic link between Shakespeare and comic-books (numerous academics have stated that if Shakespeare were alive today, then in their opinion he would be writing serials/soap operas... )If they don't get someone in charge who knows how to grace age-old themes with a light touch, then Thor 2 could well sink like a stone...This is an epic in the truest sense of the word, just with CGI to fill in the story pockets that exist around the basic accomplishment of goals... If the technology had existed to create awe-inspiring sights using machinery, then it's not unreasonable to think that the storytellers of their time would have used them... Good old fashioned grand conflict never changes, though, and Branagh seems to have an instinctive understanding of this principle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A hero who to non Marvel fans was relatively unheard and unknown of compared to the likes of Spiderman and Hulk.

When I saw this in the cinema I was blown away! On par with the standards of Iron Man and X men 2!Chris Hemsworth brings us a hero we love, root for and most of all believe in. On both acting and physique he makes the perfect Thor. Hiddleston is a wise choice for Loki and taking on Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a genius move. Whilst Kenneth Brannagh seemed a dangerous choice to direct a superhero film he delivers on all aspects and his knowledge of all elements of film are taken on board and used with some scenes almost Shakespearean.To this point Thor remains my favourite Marvel release yet. 10 stars from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"So this is why that girl from ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987) loved Thor so much?","If you've seen the popular 1987 comedy ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" then you don't need to know what the title of that comment means. But I'm going to tell you anyway: I have to give the little girl in that movie some credit because she's got some original tastes - rather than idolizing something obvious like Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, she chose the lesser-known Marvel Comics superhero Thor.Thor, or The Mighty Thor, is not one of my favorite superheroes. While I consider myself a Marvel Comics reader more than any other comic book publisher - readers familiar of my reviews will note that I'm an avid Spider-Man fan - Thor is nonetheless an interesting Marvel Comics character to me because he's so different from other comic book superheroes, for one simple fact: he's a god. And not just any god, he's the God of Thunder in Norse mythology - re-interpreted as a comic book superhero. His comic book equals could possibly be Superman (of DC Comics, Marvel Comics' chief rival) or even the Silver Surfer (another popular Marvel Comics superhero) - although astute comic book readers will note that Superman and the Silver Surfer are actually aliens, not gods, but are still quite just as powerful (it'll be interesting to see a fight between the three, though).Stan Lee, his brother Larry Lieber and the legendary, late, great Jack Kirby were the trio of well-known Marvel Comics personalities who brought Thor to life in 1962, debuting in the issue ""Journey into Mystery #83."" 49 years later, that British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh brought The Mighty Thor to life in his own movie, ""Thor,"" to add the mighty Norse god to the current crop of special effects-laden superhero movies.For the most part, Branagh succeeds. Marvel's superheroes were always noteworthy for being outsiders, freaks and misfits, so where does The Mighty Thor - a god, remember - fit into that mold? Well, the movie does a good job of representing his origins: the mighty God of Thunder (played by Australian newbie Chris Hemsworth), is exiled from his home-world of Asgard to planet Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that his son will learn a lesson in humility. (I'll just go ahead and say that Stan Lee chose his character's flaws rather well: he's one of the first superheroes whose personal dilemma is to learn a lesson and not just any lesson, but a lesson in power and responsibility.) It goes without saying that Thor is arrogant and reckless, nearly bringing Asgard to war with the neighboring realm of the Frost Giants, Jutenheim.Arriving on Earth stripped of his powers, he must now learn what it truly takes to be a hero and to be responsible for his actions. He's discovered by a trio of scientists in the New Mexico desert - Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, hot off her Oscar-win for ""Black Swan""), Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) - and they befriend him. It is through his encounters with them that Thor develops a deep fondness and admiration for the human race (in particularly Jane, his would-be love interest) and once he regains his powers - granted to him mostly by the mighty hammer Mjornir - he must eventually combat his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who seeks the throne of Asgard for himself.I'll say that ""Thor,"" like most blockbuster superhero movies of late, is a breathtaking wall-to-wall action flick. If anything else, this movie also got me interested in learning more about Thor and the world he lives in. Although the movie starts off rather slowly and alternates a lot between Earth and Asgard (thereby creating an unwelcome case of vertigo at times), it keeps your attention throughout. While also not too deep or intelligent as it could be (as it should be), Chris Hemsworth proves to be a capable God of Thunder. Stripped of his abilities and forced to learn that ages-old Marvel adage (""With great power, there must also come great responsibility"") - and also making an unusually quick adjustment to life on Earth (one of the film's key weaknesses, I feel) - only then can he once again become The Mighty Thor!Newly-minted Oscar-winner Natalie Portman is serviceable as Jane Foster (she did go to Harvard, after all), but I do feel that she is somewhat under-used, as is Stellan Skarsgard, whose Eric Selvig is also quite familiar with the legends of the classic Thor from his childhood. Thor's close friends and fellow Asgardians - his homeboys Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Joshua Dalls), and home-girl Sif (Jaimie Alexander) - also provide Thor with some much-needed back-up on Earth when Loki's forces threaten our planet. And speaking of Loki, I believe that it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the film's most complex and emotional performance as the son desperate to earn his father's love and respect, even if he has to wipe out all life on two worlds to make it so. So in that regard, he seems like such a worthy opponent to Thor.I enjoyed ""Thor"" for what it was, a worthy summer blockbuster comic book superhero adaptation. Even if it wasn't as deep or as involving as it could have been, it does serve as a build-up, yet another piece of the puzzle that will eventually lead to 2012's all-out superhero-fest ""The Avengers.""8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm a Major Thor supporter.,"I think if the mcu wasn't a connected movie series Thor would have been so much better. It would have been more in dept, emotion, better sets and it wouldn't feel rushed.
It would have given you a Lord of The Rings feel.Thor 1 is great for its time and for its attempt. Compare Thor 1 to Hobbit, Lord of the Rings or even World Of War Craft. Thor 1 looks like cheap plastic.The whole story was rushed just for Avengers 1.Thor loses his power after killing an army which was caused by his brother and Thor only gets 1 day punishment after learning so fast?
(Thor has the same problem that Dr. Strange had. Too fast pacing)
It was a slap on the wrist.The fight scenes were minor. The first fight in ice land was great. The earth fight was too quick. The final with his brother wasn't bad.Overall, Chris has become my most notable actors after Thor. He has done a great job with the character.

Another Marvel Delight!,"In the road leading up to the Avengers, Marvel continues to release above-average superhero films and ones with mighty hearts. Thor continues that trend because it's a really good movie. There are great visuals, great characters to relate to, and just a good time.Kenneth Branagh's film is about a God of Thunder, Thor who is cast away from Asgard with no powers because of his arrogance. He meets Jane and her scientist friends and teams up with them so he can find his way back home. But there is a certain Loki who just might try to stop that...Chris Hemsworth plays a really good Thor in his first leading role in film. He plays the arrogant part very well. Loki is not the meanest villain out there but he is still effective as the villain trying to look innocent in the eyes of his people. This movie has such an impressive cast for the kind of film it is.Overall, this is another good superhero film that has good action and very good visual effects/production design. Now, I do not like to call critics out especially Roger Ebert since he is my favorite. But, I have no idea why he was so outspoken against this film. I thought this is a very good film that has me really excited for the sequel and the Avengers. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great Marvel film,"We just got to see this tonight at the Riverview Theater (the best $3 cinema in town, with stadium seating and great popcorn). They packed in a huge crowd, and all had a good time. I have no idea why people have called it a second-tier Marvel movie. I think it's very well done with excellent characters, a terrific sense of humor and good special effects. The plot is rather simple and could stand to be complectified in places, but the characters are complicated and interesting, especially the main antagonist, Thor's brother Loki. Tom Hiddleston (a British actor I've never seen before) plays the trickster god with a wonderful blend of sympathy, pathos and madness. He is a perfect foil to Chris Hemsworth, who does a really good job of playing Thor as a hothead who nevertheless has a heart and is not quite the dumb jock he seems to be. Anthony Hopkins adds gravitas as Odin, and the frost giants are very cool and evil. And the mythology of Asgard is very nicely presented and fleshed out along with wonderful visuals.So while I wanted a bit more story than I got, I still came away very satisfied and hopeful that the well-constructed mythology we got in this movie will be put to good use in many sequels.

Excellent Introduction to the Expansive Marvel Lore,"I have to say that Thor is my current favorite of Marvel's movies, though tied with Iron Man at the moment. I absolutely loved every single moment of it.While I love Thor, I have to admit I don't really know too much about him. Like Iron Man before, I knew of him and some basics about the character but not enough to know much going into the movie. I watched the Hulk vs Thor animated video and his few appearances on animated series. While I am learning and reading more about him, I certainly didn't know him like I do Spider-Man, the X-Men, or Batman. Like Iron Man, this movie really makes me want to learn more about his history and read his comics. Perhaps my inexperience with him made me more open to the movie.I loved how it was a superhero origin story that wasn't just like every other single origin story. It isn't the usual ""man discovers powers, man learns powers, man uses powers to become hero."" Thor's already the hero with powers. He has to learn to use them wisely. Thor's whole story arc was terrific. I especially love the moment when Mjolnir returns to Thor. It was especially powerful and people were even cheering at that.The cast was perfect from top to bottom. Not a single miscast actor or badly delivered line. These characters could easily come off cheesy, especially if they started spouting out too many thee's, thou's and verily's. Instead they're seriously done interpretations of how they would interact in the modern world.The characterizations were wonderful. I loved Thor in every scene. From his arrogance in Asgard to his fish-out-of- water on Earth. Loki was the best and most dynamic villain since X-Men's Magneto. It's hard to tell whether the God of Mischief is sincere or just plotting his plans. Even the smaller parts were wonderful.Of anything, Kenneth Branagh and Thor were made for each other. His sensibilities derived from his Shakespeare works combined perfectly with the style that Jon Favreau started with the universe. He had an excellent combination of action and humor without any one element overwhelming the others.I thought the 3D was very effective. It was spectacular in the Asgard and Jotunheim sequences. Though I also thought it looked good in the Earth scenes. 3D can easily get gimmicky with things popping out into the audience, or it can be completely unnecessary and a distraction. Thor does neither. It really helps to project the majesty of Asgard, the dark looming of Jotunheim, and the expansiveness of New Mexico.The music was one of the best I have heard in quite some time. I went purchased the soundtrack as soon as I could find it. It perfectly blends the epicness of the battle sequences with the more subtle moments between two charactersI have only two things I don't like about the film. First, was that Hawkeye was basically a waste and completely unnecessary. It seemed to be in there just to have an obligatory cameo than anything else. Two, that they didn't expand on the Thor and Sif love story like they should have. She's supposed to be Thor's love interest since childhood. I read one comic where she was very jealous of Amora and Brunnhilde. But there's not one shot or mention of her reacting to Jane and Thor's relationship.Like Iron Man, the movie was so much fun and enjoyable that I easily overlooked any flaws. It helped to set up The Avengers without focusing too much on it, like what happened to Iron Man 2. I certainly look forward to more.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Odin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Thor. Really liked the first 30 minutes. Brilliant. As in most Marvel films, Stan Lee, who created the characters, has a cameo roles.

Anthony Hopkins played a great role of the God Odin, Ruler of Asgard. Chris Hemsworth, a relative newcomer to Hollywood. I, for one, had never seen or heard of him and only just found out he played Captain George Kirk in the 2009 Star Trek film. Of course, you can not have Thor and Odin without the mischievous Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston also a relative newcomer to Hollywood films. Also, all three of these top roles were played by an Englishmen, a Welshman and an Australian. Sounds like the beginning of a joke. But this film was far from it.The Special Effects are just amazing. Could not ask for more. Acting, including those previously mentioned...superb. Also could not ask for more. This is truly one of the best films of 2011 and I can not wait for Thor to return in The Avengers and Thor 2. To be released in 2012 and 2013. Amazing film, a definite watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining. Good. Natalie's splendid innocent performance!,"It's of late that I started fancying superhero movies. In contrast to the introduction of superheroes and their emergence as perceived before in movies like spider-man, the new genre of superhero movies are indeed admirable. The characters blend well to the current trend.Natalie's a sweetheart. Her amazing screen presence is something to die for here. Innocent wonderful here as opposed to enigmatic troubled in black swan.The casting is really great, Chris Hemsworth looks like a Greek god himself! The script is entertaining and will take you through the movie, can't wait for avengers!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining.,All I ask for in a film is to be entertained somehow. Thor provides it. Good film that i recommend you watch. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are well cast as Thor and Loki. Kenneth Branagh really does put a good film together here.In this whole Avengers project that has been put in place i would place this film 3rd after the Avengers film itself and the first Iron Man Film.Truly well worth watching and a must before you get to see The Avengers film. While Capt America and Hulk films are not necessary essential viewing before you watch The Avengers i feel this is.In summary - Enjoyed the film. Highly Recommended.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I found myself laughing, yet it isn't a comedy.","I enjoyed Iron Man, I found the two Hulk movies in 5 years laughable but okay. I'm sorry but it's just hard to enjoy a movie with obvious CGI that looks completely unrealistic. So coming into Thor I had no expectations. I knew going in that it and probably Captain America were both movies that were only produced to set up an Avengers movie. While watching the movie I found myself laughing. Dialogue was completely predictable as well as was everything else in the movie. There was little heart and no character depth. This movie had a good director, a suburb cast and obviously a large budget. There was no reason for it to have been this bad other than the lack of a script. In my opinion it's a thrown together, forced movie that never needed to be made. The only perk of this movie was a couple of good battle scenes. The best of which started the movie off, which left the ending to be anti-climatic to say the least. I know a lot of people enjoyed this movie but I just can't understand why. I blame everyone who signed up to do this paycheck of a movie for it's existence.3 of 10 - A very fair rating in my opinion. If you like movies like, Priest, Legion, Hulk, The Incredible Hulk, Jonah Hex etc... with lots of action and little else then you may like this movie. Otherwise save your money.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Bridge Onwards or A Piece of Cinematic Genius?,"The question above reminds me of many other questions; To be strong or to be weak? To have £10 or to have £5? The answer is always going to be the first one. Of course this is multiple choice and so is whether or not you should go and see Thor, especially in 2011's comic-book movie summer...The film opens with an exciting, albeit short set piece on Earth introducing us to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) an Astro Physicist out in the middle of know where waiting for a storm. The tension builds up, as even I in the audience became sceptical on anything happening... Until BOOM!! Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives with only one question on everyone's mind ""where did he come from?"" Firstly this is a fantastic introduction, it denies the audience any over complexities with the narrative by setting it up so well. As expected it goes on to explain the origins of Thor with a noisy, special effects filled prologue that essentially isn't needed. It seemed almost a duplicate to a Lord of the Rings style battle scene, without a Peter Jackson stab at making it jump of the screen. That's not to say Kenneth Branagh doesn't do a good job. He makes the years of comic book mythology so comprehensive in order to set up the movie and 3D or not he makes Asgard jump of the screen with its beauty.Hemsworth really makes a believable Thor, his flamboyant antics only help to symbolise this better. Although Thor's written too narrowly for my taste, his arrogance is conveyed too simply and his romance with Jane Foster is far too spur-of-the-moment stuff. The acting from both Portman and Hemsworth however, allowed me to ignore this and the movie just became more and more intriguing. Tension builds as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) moves further towards the films antagonist. I really got the feeling of a medieval ""who shall be king"" battle going on in modern day New Mexico which is a lot of compelling fun to watch. Odin (Antony Hopkins) gives the film stability and understanding as his sons rivalry grows. Expect great effects, great acting and a great story, but don't expect a piece of cinematic genius.Thor was always going to be the risk in the Avengers lead up movies. It does what it has to in order for the Avengers to be born in 2012 and it does no more, no less. There will be plenty of teases tying it into this ever growing Marvel universe (incidentally stay after the credits if you want to see more of that) and for fans this will be a blast. But fan or not this is a great film just don't expect anything more than a prequel to the Avengers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor....less thunder...more spectacle....,"Saw it this morning and as excited I was for this movie it did not deliver to the expectations. They tried to make it a bit funnier like Iron Man but not every superhero movie can me made like that. The special effects in the movie were undoubtedly spectacular however, the movie was moving too quick. The lead characters for Thor and Loki were perfect in their characters but the script was somehow not able to justify their characters better. I hope they do not repeat it in the next Thor franchise and end up doing multiple Hulk like mistakes. This movie could have been a bit better if the script could have allowed the character to settle down like they did it for Iron Man. Let's hope for the best for the rest of the Marvel movies coming out this year.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Summer has begin!!,"I like to call this summer ""The Summer of the Comic Book Movies"" it's a long title I know but it's what this summer consist of. Thor is the first one.Thor the comic books is based on the God of thunder in Norse mythology, for all you non comic book reading people. The movie explains how there is other realms consisting of different races and how one realm called Asgard protects them all. Odin played by Anthony Hopkins is the king and is about to place his son Thor played by Chris Hemsworth as king. The ceremony gets interrupted when an old enemy attacks the palace and Thor wants to go and punish them. Odin forbids him and Thor with his friends goes to the enemy's realm and causes havoc. Odin punishes him by banning him to Earth and stripping him of his powers and hammer. There he meets Natalie Portman and her crew of astrophysics and together they help each other fight of a malevolent force.The film is well acted by its leads which are Hemsworth and Portman and they do have good chemistry but it just mostly appears as two very attractive people hooking up. Everybody fits the cliché role of any other superhero flick. Stellan Skarsgard plays the older mentor and always giving out advice and he was like a father to Portman's character how many times I heard that before. Clark Gregg plays the regular agent that appears in every comic book movie and when he comes out the special effects comes out. For comic relief we have Thor sidekicks and I have something to say. Why is Kat Dennings in this movie she played Portman's assistant she provided nothing in the movie matter of fact she looked homeless and wandered on set and they didn't tell her to leave out of kindness. Where the film shines is in its special effects and action sequences which are pretty impressive. The film was directed by Kenneth Branagh whose experience is mostly directing Shakespeare's plays. He does a pretty good job for not being an action director.The only thing that prevented the movie from getting a higher rating was that the movie has no pathos. Other better comic book superhero films has true pathos ranging from psychological, egos, vanity, insecurity and much more. Thor is just one big fun movie during the summer.Thor might be lacking in depth but it's still a lot of fun at the movies.MP 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A really good and fun movie,"I really enjoyed this movie because of the story and the acting of the ""god"" characters. Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor and he really develops the character properly throughout the film. The action was great, the scenery was beautiful, and the sets were appropriate.There was some bad language (no ""F"" word), everyone was appropriately dressed and especially modest, considering Hollywood standards, but there is a significant amount of bloodless violence. All thumbs up in my book.A few critiques: 1. It was a little predictable... enjoy it! It's fun.2. I didn't like Natalie Portman's swooning. Yeah, Thor's a good looking guy, but I guess I didn't get the connection. (I'm a guy, but I've rarely seen girls swoon that much for eye candy.)3. They tried to do too much science. Sure they threw around some theories, and it might get some kids to look up those topics. But the topics are highly theoretical and out of reach for most of us. I can't really see N.Portman as a relative physicist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie cannot be enjoyed if you have a brain.,"When I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared to enjoy it. I like superhero movies, and I heard a lot of good reviews. I don't agree with any of the critics I listened to before watching.The beginning is actually ok. The visual effects are good and the action is partially decent (at least at the beginning). The only reason I enjoyed this movie was because I was laughing so hard. Not at any ""jokes"" though. I was laughing more at this movie's incompetence. If you are one of the surprisingly numerous people who enjoyed this nonsense, I'd appreciate it if you actually read my points on why this movie is terrible.-The romance takes place over the course of about a day, and during most of that time Thor and Natalie Portman are nowhere near each other. Like, she runs him over with his car, they have a few brief conversations, then all of a sudden Thor is crying over the possibility of never seeing her again. It feels stupid and rushed.-Thor doesn't really do anything to deserve the hammer. Like the stupid love story, this character arc (I was told it was supposed to be one) feels incredibly rushed. What they could've done instead of what they did is have Thor live on Earth for at least a month. They could've shown Thor learning how to live among humans, slowly realize the errors of his ways, and come to regret what he did. Loki's attack could've something that took a while to do and by the time he got around to it Thor could've been ready to defend humans because he actually cared for the species. There could still be the big dumb boring action scene at the end, but at least him getting back the hammer would be deserved. I'm not saying that this would be perfect, but it would be a hell of a lot better then what they went with.-There's a lot of continuity errors. The shots themselves are good, but when they come one after another - not so much. It kinda takes you out of the movie when it goes from broad daylight to night to sunset and back to day over the span of a few sentences.-Nothing makes any sense because nothing is ever explained. Powers/abilities aren't explained. None of the technology is explained (and by technology I mean the alien stuff not human technology - though there is some stuff with Natalie's cellphone that makes little sense but that has more to do with how stupid the characters are). Fight scenes have little tension and aren't fun not only because the characters are unrelatable and the fights themselves are poorly choreographed, but because you don't know what the characters can DO.-The pacing is weird and a very simple plot is made difficult to follow through a very bizarre narrative.-All the government officials are stupid. I get that the doctors were stupid as a joke (I think it was supposed to be a joke) but SHEILD is supposed to be a group of elite government officials. Why is everyone working for them dumber than a sack of bricks?-There are so many plot holes concerning Loki that it makes my head hurt. Just try to think about his plan, and when various pieces of information are revealed to him. IT MAKES NO SENSE.-Thor's friends are all stupid (literally) and underdeveloped. All the characters are underdeveloped, but Thor's friends are practically caricatures. They're annoying and they shouldn't affect the plot as much as they do. Also, ALL the characters are stupid. Everything in this movie is incredibly dumbed down to the point where nothing makes any sense.I don't know a lot about how this movie was made, but everything feels very rushed. This movie could've been decent with an extra half hour of run time, better actors, and an editor who understands editing. The only people who seemed to know what they were doing were the camera people and whoever was in costumes/makeup/effects.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An intelligent teaser for the Avengers,"It's a well done movie with proper acting (and even better by some) though I can honestly say that Rene Russo is being wasted here. It doesn't really need 3D apart from the Asgard Scenes. And it corresponds nicely with the Marvel original including some nice Donald Blake jokes. But I kept on feeling it was stoping short of its full potential, as if all it was here for is setting the ground for the big Avengers movie - and the movie had its fair share of hints aimed at that specific future production. It was nice but could have been so much better that eventually I'm a bit disappointed. So much more room for dramatic development that was left untapped it's simply a shame.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wrath of the God!!,"Having just seen the excitement and the anticipation this movie created, Thor pulls something new to the standard superhero genre. It takes no time to create the same intensity as other superhero movies do but unlike other superhero movies who were creations of science, Thor was a hammer-wielding God in the Norse mythology.Now apart from the historical facts, Thor is an outstanding effort by the Director Kenneth Branagh. It's a classic drama feature with straight to the point moves and an action-packed epic storyline. The film is about Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a powerful but an arrogant warrior whose immature acts ignite an ancient war. Thor is then cast down to Earth from the realm of Asgard to live among humans and to experience what it takes to be a real superhero when the darkest forces of Asgard invades Earth.The feel of the film is very artistic and is presented superbly. The plot of the film is grippy with like able characters and the pace of the film is just too good and doesn't disturb the plot from start to finish. However, Thor does not deliver that much action but it has a story that works well and shows more fantasy than action at times. The giants and mythical scores made this flick a typical fantasy premiere but it's not an ordinary superhero movie, it has a deep storyline and the storytelling made this movie even more interesting and entertaining. Offering stunning visuals and performances made this film a decent flick.Overall, an engrossing feature with strong scale and screenplay and is definitely a must watch!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Was expecting worse, but was surprised, worth of Norse Mythology","I was not expecting much of Thor. Only personification I saw was in a TV Movie about Hulk with the late Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno and was pretty bad and static. Other one that was acceptable was a Thor-like guy in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" where one of the children was a Thor fan...Well, put some Shakespeare into Norse Mythology in a Marvel setting, along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents (including agent Coulson, which we see more here...) and you get this movie.Chris Hemsworth, though a bit static, gives a good performance as Thor, though we don't see him perform much, but give credit to Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, as well as Stellan Skarsgard quips and you got a good mix here. Kudos to Natalie Portman here as well who helps out Thor get acquainted to our world, so different from Asgard.Hoping Thor will be better in action in the upcoming ""The Avengers""...And Stan Lee has his moment, which is funny....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It helps if you are hammered ,,,","THOR (The God of Thunder) is the latest 3D comic book super-hero roll-out from the Marvel stables – Directed by KENNETH BRANAGH (Wallander, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the film tells the story of the enigmatic, powerful, but ultimately flawed warrior godAfter peace has reigned for millennia between Asgard and the Frost Giants after a brutal war, there is an attempt made to try to steal back the Frost Giants source of power from Asgard – this ignites the fury of Thor and his buddies (the Warriors Three and Sif), who take it upon themselves to teach the Frost Giants a lesson (much against Odin's warnings)  and it all goes horribly wrongOdin is incensed by these actions and Thor is cast out of the mythical realm of Asgard by his father and sent to live in punishment amongst humans on Earth without his super powers for his recklessness in re-igniting the ancient feudal war against the Frost Giants.Once on Earth, Thor realizes that he has lost his super-powers – and meanwhile in Asgard, Thor's adopted half-brother Loki schemes to take control of Asgard from Odin by covertly teaming up with the Frost GiantsUnknown to Thor, his most dangerous adversary is much closer to home than he thinksCHRIS HEMSWORTH (Star Trek, Home and Away (TV)) plays the title role, he should be a hit with the ladies – but his acting is a bit woodenThe only real acting of any note is by ANTHONY HOPKINS (who else?) who plays Odin the ruler of Asgard, father of Thor and his adopted brother (and nemesis) Loki (played menacingly well by TOM HIDDLESTON), and IDRIS ELBA who plays Heimdall the defender of Asgard and the Bifrost (Rainbow Bridge) is also pretty awesomeRENE RUSSO plays Frigga wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, and NATALIE PORTMAN plays Jane Foster an Astrophysist and is the love interest – apparently Natalie had accepted the role before reading the script – and that doesn't say a lot about her judgementAlthough it's not in the same league and certainly doesn't have the same gravitas as the recent Batman movies, THOR is basically a bit of fun ... there is no real story line of any note to worry about  it has some good effects, some comic moments, some bad acting and some of the 3D stuff works to make things interesting  so, as long as you are content to switch off thinking for a couple of hours it's a pleasant enough way to pass the timeI think THOR ""should"" be successful (even just for the kids toys and merchandise) and It looks very much like there will be a sequel or two in the offing – it has potential  so hopefully when they get a better story line (and maybe a different director) then this franchise may be worth revisitingTHOR was originally shot in 2D format but has since had some 3D enhancements added, and some of the 7.1 Surround Sound Dolby effects are very good.THOR is 114mins long, is an PG-13 certificate and will be on general release from Friday 6th May, 2010",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A very good comic book translation,"After suffering through a slew of generally horrible superhero movies (the old 1992 version of Captain America, Superman 4 and whichever one had Richard Pryor in it, Catwoman, Elektra, the so-bad-they're-great Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk movies, etc), we're finally getting some great superhero flicks! I was very worried that Thor, a favorite of mine since I was a kid, would be ripped from my childhood memories and slaughtered before my eyes - this happened twice before, with Transformers and G.I. Joe - but the end result was quite good. Thor is no Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago. It won't be remembered in 30 years as an epic that changed movie history. However, for a guy who was just hoping for a fun flick that made me forget about real life for a couple hours, Thor really came through.The action and effects were tremendous. I am not at all a fan of 3D (it's more distracting than anything, especially when things are up close), but I didn't let that affect my rating.The acting won't win any awards, but all of the actors were believable. I really felt that this was the Thor from the comic books. I wasn't too sure about the comedy bits (you've seen the taser bit from the commercials, I'm sure), but after seeing the movie as a whole, it turns out that these funny parts were actually quite memorable.In all, Thor is right up there with the Iron Man movies (mindless entertainment that is true to the comic series) and is a perfect lead-up to the Avengers movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Winner for the Marvel Universe.,"The Marvel movies of the past years have had only one disappointment, and that was with ""Hulk"" which starred Eric Bana. Thor can be added to the past Marvel films that have made a mark on the cinematic world. I am not a hardcore fan when it comes to the Thor Comic books, but I know him well enough to know what the film version should include.While there is much to work with for the film I was still wary as to how they would pursue the film version and make Thor as successful as Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and so on; but they did it splendidly and the end result is a fantastic movie experience with amazing stunts and graphics.The storyline was solid moving from the Asgard to Earth made the movie much more interesting then having it set in one world. The sets were elaborate, beautiful, and very appropriate for the Norse Gods; and on top of that the futuristic style of the costumes added more to the sets and really brought the characters to life. Another aspect that made the movie was beside the heavyweight actors such as Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Anthonly Hopkins, brought relatively unknown actors to the big screen which added a sense a mystery as to what the audience can expect from the cast.Chris Hemsworth was fantastic, i'm eager to see him in the Avengers; the performances from his friends (Sif,Loki...)complimented his performance brilliantly. But I believe the film to be complete with Darcy (Kat Dennings) she made the movie funny in all the right places.With that I give this movie a 9/10 because as great as the movie was, it was not perfect some small flaws were, and I know that this is mean, but Natalie actually bugged me at times with her performance. I felt that she was too serious an actress to do this type of film, but as stated it wasn't a horrible performance from her just momentary instances where I was like ""oh my god."" But like anything else its a matter of opinion and preference to which everyone is entitled to. But enjoy the movie for it is a fun and wild ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Looks great but in the end doesn't really deliver,"The sets, special effects are just what you would expect form a major Hollywood movie. It looks great. In particular I loved the ice giants they were the best thing in the movie.What I struggled with was a mythical god-like being, if not actually a god, who grins a lot, is rather polite and lacks all presence apart from his muscular development which on its own doesn't carry it. I don't think it is because Helmsworth can't act. But the fellow is meant to be Thor, that is THOR!!!!! Not someone who might ask if you want fries with that.A little bit of grimness, perhaps a little bit of age might have helped. Shouldn't he be a few thousand years old at least? He does start off a bit rash but his big character change occurs, seemingly, because he had a single beer with a fellow of Scandinavian origin. Certainly there was nothing in the Natalie Portman relationship that engendered any interest of need to reassess his approach to life. In fact the gorgeous Natalie was rather irrelevant.The Asgardians themselves were good whilst in Asgard but out of that context they looked rather ridiculous and with entirety of the Earth action all taking place in what looked like a back lot we really needed to get back to Asgard asap.So yes it looks great (mostly) and there is plenty of action, if that's what you want but when it was finished I was not looking forward to the sequel. I really didn't care although if they bring back the frost giants I'd watch them. In fact secretly I was cheering for them all along. They had the menaces and gravitas that Thor lacked.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent film. Not one dull moment,"I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. Their haven't been many good hero films lately (apart from iron man), with the latest spider man film (released a few years ago) being fairly garbage. Thor turned the tables bringing this hard to bring character to life. The graphics were amazing, the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat and it was the introduction to the other superhero movies (and the new justice avengers released next year). If you want a good action movie without having to know the in-depth background of the Asgard Gods, then I highly recommend this movie. Worth every penny of the admission fee to the Cinemas!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Really good!,"I'll just cut to the chase and say that Thor was very enjoyable and entertaining. Kenneth Branagh directed this film well. The casting was superb also. Of course we all know that superhero films are pretty predictable....and half-way through the movie you will figure out who the main villain is, however, the villain's intentions are the mystery and what make the story go. Chris Hemsworth is really good as Thor and captures the character well. Natalie Portman is good and actually has a purpose as a love interest, which is saying something from me since she usually annoys me. Hemsworth is good as Thor in that you see real character development! Rare in a comic book based movie! The romance element is typical, but not to the point in were it is distracting or annoying. The special effects were really good and just overall well done. You won't be wasting your money if you go see this. 9/10 stars :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good start to the series,"I have never read any of the Thor comic books, I have only played as him in the video game Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 & 2. So I thought this movie was gonna be cheesy and stupid, but this movie blew my mind. Chris Hemsworth was a very talented actor in this movie, and it left his mark in Hollywood in my opinion.Thor is the son of Odin who was about to be crowned king of Asgard, but after an attack on the frost giants homeland gets banished to earth by Odin (Anthony Hopkins). He meets a group of scientific researchers one of them being Natalie Portman's character who he falls in love with later. While he is absent from Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) takes over the kingdom and plans to destroy the Frost Giants homeland.This movie delivers action, romance, and some comedy that makes it good to watch and a good start to this series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
THOR Holds His Mighty Hammer Strong,"I will admit after seeing all the trailer and TV spots for Kenneth Branagh's THOR, I found myself a little disappointed as what to expect in theaters. After seeing this film on the weekend, I can't help but praise it, as it was a entertaining, action packed, mystical and even had some great comedic humor to compliment it. Branagh's takes on a mystical adventure with THOR and really seems to find the perfect balance between that mystical world and earth, while also lending to plenty of witty humor for the audience.This really isn't like all the other MARVEL films you have seen in the past and really separates itself because of it's originality of the story and the tremendous acting that accompanies it. Casting was done extremely well and the mix of British, Australian and American actors all blended in perfectly with their characters. Anthony Hopkins was picture perfect as Odin, King Of Asgard, Chris Hemsworth shows his charisma and powerful personality portraying THOR perfectly, and Natalie Portman does a great job as the beautiful love interest in Jane Foster in the film. Tom Hiddelston was also fantastic as the evil Loki, and all the other supporting cast members including Stellan Skarsgard and Idris Elba played their roles up to par.Kenneth Branagh really impressed me with his directing in this film. Firstly for a guy not known to do big blockbuster films he definitely hit it out of the park on his first swing. The pace was perfect and everything was very visible to see even trough intense and shaky battle scenes. His direction of the film allowed for an entertaining, hilarious and captivating film for the audience. He also did an amazing job of tying in the realms of Asgard and Earth together, making an almost perfect balance of romance, action and intruge on both planets.Thor get's an A- in my books simply because my expectations were exceeded above and beyond what I though I was walking into. With it's solid screenplay, acting, visual affects, humor and a tremendous action punch to go with it, THOR is everything you look for in an entertaining super hero filled movie. If you haven't go to a theater near you to check it out then I suggest you do soon, as this movie should entertain and suffice most looking for a journey of adventure, mysticism and creativity. I would also recommend you stay in your seat until the credits roll on through, as a small clip at the very end of them divulges some key infomation to the next installment, The Avengers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Strange,"Went to see Thor last night with some high expectations, after reading some of the reviews here. And, as much as i would have liked to enjoy the movie, i did not. Don't get me wrong, using comic heroes and comic book plots in films proved to be successful. That's why the whole world knows about Superman and Batman. But now, we've got a group of lesser known superheroes aiming at our money. One of them is mighty Thor with his deadly super-hammer weapon. I am not going to write about the plot, and character development, although Thor is very well developed (gimme the same stuff the actor was eating to get that body in just SIX months!). We want visuals from this type of films, and screw the rest. Producers, directors, actors and all others involved in this multimillion dollar project realize that viewers want entertainment, but do they deliver? Well, they do, most of the time. I only have a couple of questions: 1) Why did they spend money on expensive stars in secondary roles (A. Hopkins and N.Portman) instead of making better visual FX? 2) Why the computer drawn villains are so primitive (all ice giants look the same, and that ironman mummy is unimaginative)? 3) When will producers realize, that shaky camera in fighting scenes makes people dizzy? 4) Did they use Transformers to model some of the characters armor? I guess the answers to these questions will be more clear after you've seen the movie. But don't expect anything epic. It's just an action film about people running around, killing things and destroying stuff for no particular reason. And it doesn't even matter if you will not like Thor, because he'll be back!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good humor is present and it will make you laugh quite a few times.But be careful with the sequel, because the only thing that tint this movie bad is love relationship, which is again being portrayed without any substance that will provide some feedback from the audience, it is flat and uninteresting.If you could keep it simple please.

The only exposure I had to the comic book ""Thor"" was as a kid I received the free copies from my dentist office. I think it was ""Thor vs. the Cavity Creeps"" or some lame knock-off like that. When I heard that Thor the God of Thunder was making the transition from comic book to his own big screen movie I was cautious. Who wants to see some guy swing his hammer and speak in Old Norse for two hours? I am man enough to admit when I am wrong (I am also the same guy that doubted ""Ironman"" would be a huge success). I was wrong for questioning that stage and screen expert Kenneth Branagh (""Henry V,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"""") would not deliver a stellar movie. Branagh has the ability to pull a strong performance from his cast without forcing them to over act. He also has the ability to create a supernatural world, Asgard, where Thor and his family of gods reign. Branagh and his art production team present Asgard as a tangible place for gods to live.In the first few minutes we begin our story in Norway and discover how the Frost Giants come to earth to destroy humans. King Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his army defeat the Frost Giants. We are soon attending a beautiful ceremony where Odin's son Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is about to be crowned king of Asgard. Due to a breach in security the ceremony is cut short. Out of anger and vanity Thor gathers his friends to break a truce with the Frost Giants and launches an attack. After Odin discovers what has happened, he furiously banishes his son to Earth, along with Thor's famous hammer, Mjolnir.Thor crash-lands on earth where he is no longer the once powerful god; he is just a regular guy (a regular guy who looks like he's been doing P90X since puberty). A scientist, Jane (played by Natalie Portman) and her team literally runs into Thor. Jane is trying to discover a wormhole between our world and others in the universe. The two soon realize that they each have what the other one wants and soon become allies.This is the part where you should start paying close attention. Not because you get a history lesson on Norse mythology but because Marvel Studios is combining their super heroes to make an ""Avengers"" movie in 2012. Thor will be one of the Avengers and there are quite a few references of these heroes and characters from the Marvel Universe - Hawkeye, Ironman, Phil Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D., etc.Thor, now without his powers, must be reunited with his mighty hammer, which as fate would have is only 50 miles from him. While Thor is fighting to win back his hammer and return to Asgard, his brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), the God of Mischief, is stirring up trouble between the Frost Giants and Asgard. The entire story climaxes in a way that you would imagine with any comic book movie; good vs. evil, cocky hero learns a valuable lesson, several awesome fight scenes, that whole thing.Should you see this movie? Yes. It's has action, humor and some outstanding art direction to develop the mythical worlds. Do you need to see it in 3D? Not necessarily. The 3D was too dark in some of the action scenes at night and didn't add much to the day time scenes. As a stand alone story ""Thor"" can hold the audience's attention even if they aren't avid fans of the comic book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mix of a Superhero movie with subtlies of a Romcom movies!,"I did not expect this movie to be anything great. 1.) Thor is a very nerdy type of superhero with the complications Asgard and the mortal world, there's barely a relatable side in the comics that ordinary movie goers could follow easily 2.) Chris Hemsworth I had major doubts about him, his looks and his acting ability 3.) The design where abit metalic and very modern for an old ancient fabled myth. But it all work! Once I heard Chris Hemsworth voice I was like yeah this is THOR! It was very commanding,not Gerard Butler loud but very commanding! The movie is well written with a strong mix of Heroic-ness and ROM-COM bits in to it as well. Chris Hemsworth held his own in the movie despite with Hollywood heavyweights like Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. I didn't think they could pull off complexities in comics like Asgard, the heroic side and Earth which is the rom-com side. Well mixed together I doubt they can make a sequel that's well written like this but I really hope they can!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Marvel movie since first Ironman,"My 12 and 14 yr old sons (and this 50 year old geezer!) loved this movie, much better than I was expecting, it had almost everything you could ask for it in it; action +++, heroic struggles, redemption, the very obvious baddies, the occasional twists, good looking woman, good looking men, lots and lots of explosions, big set pieces, unexpected humour, giant killer robots and references to the Avengers, what else could any red blooded male ask for - except maybe a light sabre or two, it was fun, is NEVER going to win any Oscars or awards for acting or direction but if this was Kenneth Branagh's first Marvel directing job then he did an excellent job of it, go see it on a big screen, we saw it in 2D and not 3D and THOROUGHLY enjoyed it, the kids want to go again and am tempted, best Marvel movie since first Ironman !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Superheroes don't incite wars,"I'm a great fan of superhero movies and I always go out and watch them on the big screen. This week, Thor was released in India a week before it's release in the USA and I dropped everything to go and see it. I wasn't disappointed. Though Thor is not as famous as Spiderman, Bat man, and I don't recall reading the comic, he is a Nordic God, so that makes him pretty big in the scheme of things right? As it shifts back and forth between earth and Thor's planet in another constellation, the movie uses 3D to great effect, much better than I've seen it used in recent movies like Tron. Chris Hensworth, last seen in The Perfect Getaway, makes for an charmingly adorable Norse God and Anthony Hopkins lends great presence in the role of his father, Odin. Shakespearean actor/director Kenneth Branagh adds lots of theatrical floorish to the proceedings, especially in the relationship between Odin and his two sons. The talented women in this film, Natalie Portman (Thor's would-be lady love), Rene Rousso (thor's mother), don't have much to do. Very little time is given to the romance between Thor and earthling scientist and I think it could possibly have been dispensed with totally (a movie without a love angle? why not?). The running theme of the movie is that good kings (and good superheroes) never incite wars, though they must be prepared for it when there is no other course of action. But it takes the protagonists a while to get this, and there's lots of battle in between.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfectly decent superhero flick,"Marvel re-uses its Iron Man strategy by throwing far too much talent at a comic book movie. The results are, much like with Iron Man, actually pretty good, though quite far from great. Chris Hemsworth stars as the Norse god. The story takes place in both Asgard and Midgard (Earth). In Asgard, Thor has led an attack against the Frost Giants. Odin, his father (Anthony Hopkins), banishes Thor to Earth and gives his kingdom over to Thor's scheming brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The other gods (including a black and Asian one, although, who cares, they're played by Idris Elba and Tadanobu Asano!) are suspicious of Loki and plan to get Thor back. On Earth, Thor is now a mortal. A big dude, still, but he finds that little things like getting hit by cars to be quite painful. He's discovered by a team of astrophysicists (Natalie Portman, in her third movie of 2011, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings). Portman thinks that Thor might know something about the weird atmospheric disturbances she's been documenting lately. It's a fun movie. Although it's mostly just CGI, Asgard is always great to look at. When they do use sets, they're cool. And the costume design, while a tad silly, is wonderful to look at. The Earth sequences would probably be a lot less fun, but the writers have a great sense of humor. The fish-out-of-water stuff is very funny, especially the scene where Thor enters a pet store and demands a horse. The actors mostly do a good job. Hemsworth, a relative newcomer, looks like he might be a mindless hunk or a wrestler-turned-actor, but he does a good job. He has a certain charm which most people who look like underwear models don't. Portman kind of fails, but the script is mostly to blame. There's very little time for a romantic angle, but they've shoved it in anyway, and it's pretty unconvincing. My favorite performances were from Hiddleston, who perhaps has the most complexly written character in the movie, and Elba, whom I didn't recognize at first past his costume and glowing yellow eyes. He's definitely the coolest character in the movie. Kat Dennings is really funny with her scene-stealing role as a political science student who is only working with Portman for the college credits. Dennings is a star in the making (check her out in the excellent Defendor) and probably should already be bigger than she is. One could complain that there's too much setting up of the Avengers movie, due out next year, but I generally don't mind that. I like the connectedness of the Marvel films (this one calls out Iron Man and the Hulk). A couple of the Avengers preview sequences are somewhat confusing, though. Like that guy who looks a little like Jeremy Renner (played by Jeremy Renner) who is ordered to snipe Thor but then picks up a bow and arrow, or the completely baffling post-credits sequence with Samuel L. Jackson (seriously, I couldn't make any sense of what was going on there).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
entertainment for the...what masses,"No one in their right mind would ever go through the first 10 minutes of this movie not wondering w-t-f...nothing works, the plot is thin, the cast is having a junk-night-out instead of a great-steak-night, the effects are funny at best and the referential - a joke.Yet, it's entertainment. the same way a stupid reality-show is. Only for me it wasn't, but I hate reality-shows. And so do the people I tried (real hard) to see the movie with.Maybe in a 3D version. Again, not for me.

Awesome,"I don't know if this is the first time I've given a movie 10/10, but this does deserve every point. It's got a decent plot, the graphics are pretty damned awesome, and you can tell a lot of thought and money went into making this. It wasn't even cheesy, which a lot of movie conversions tend to suffer with. Marvel did a really good job at converting this comic book tale into a movie.I'm not going to complain about the use of mixed races in the movie, the actors all did a very good job at playing their roles and they really fitted in very well. And the ending was just perfect. I've seen too many ""and they all lived happily ever after"" type endings, so the ending to this was just right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Best Marvel film, second best superhero film I've ever seen","Marvel really have outdone themselves this time with their independent films, creating a mind-blowing motion picture with Thor, the Viking God of thunder, that I consider to be the best superhero film behind The Dark Knight I've ever seen. It's rare that I get this kind of excitement out of watching a film; it's even rarer that I go to see a film twice in the theatre, but Thor has brought about these phenomenons.These are easily some of the greatest visuals if not the best visuals to date, and for me it trumped Avatar in the special effects department. Yeah, I said it. But it's so much more than just the spectacle that Avatar was (that's all Avatar was to me, Yeah I said it), the action is fantastic, the characters are endlessly entertaining (especially the Viking God on Earth) and both story and script are tight and well-paced, no slow points.An interesting thing is that one of the things I really liked about Thor, but that possibly kept it from being even better, was it's focus of narrative. It is simply about a super-powered God finding his way, that's it. About as deep as it gets. And that's exactly what I love; you awe at the entertainment the characters, action and the thrill of experiencing it provide, without delving into extreme darkness or emotion that a lot films tend toward nowadays; the notion of 'gritty' and 'realistic'. This is why I compare it to the The Dark Knight; Nolan did the realistic thing extremely well to great success, yet Thor is the opposite - a completely outlandish tale involving Gods and magic that, although while dealing with some of Thor's personal problems, never goes too deep, that keeps you entertained, not shocked or moved.You'll know the best part in this film when you see it, and it just childishly excites to a level that I have never felt with any of the previous Marvel films. My favourite Marvel film was Iron Man, but this makes Iron Man look dated.Overall I highly, highly recommend this film and if you haven't seen it yet, DO. ASAP. AND THEN BUY IT ON BLU-RAY.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the most inspired superhero movies to come out in recent years.,"Since the Summer movie season is officially upon us, I'm very glad that it has started off with a bang with the release of the latest superhero movie Thor. Forgive me if I sound somewhat geeky during my review, because I just happened to really, really like this movie.It stars Chris Hemsworth as the powerful, but arrogant god of thunder Thor, a man who resides in the fantastic realm of Asgard ruled by his father, Odin (Played by Anthony Hopkins), who always seems to favor Thor over his more subdued brother Loki (Played with wry subtlety by Tom Hiddleston). After going against his father's wishes and unleashing a brief attack on an enemy colony (Including a virtually unrecognizable Colm Feore in fantastic makeup), he is banished from Asgard and sent to earth, where he's discovered by a team of scientists lead by the persistent Jane Foster (Played convincingly by Natalie Portman), and with her help seeks to reclaim his sacred hammer which holds his power, and return to his home.If you're familiar with his previous directorial pedigree, you'd swear that an action film based on a Marvel comic centered on Norse mythology would be the last project Shakespearean thespian Kenneth Branagh would be attached to, but thank God for this man. This movie is every bit as much a breath of fresh air as 2008's Iron Man.As you would expect, the film is exciting and quite funny, but what I find most fascinating is how Branagh establishes his own take on the superhero genre through his pacing and the direction of his cast. It's a bit hammy to be certain, but in a rather delightful way, because you can detect the doses of Shakespearean undertones that he infuses into the film. His cast is terrific, they're fully fleshed out, and they never take the film more seriously than it needs to be.The movie is also impeccably designed, boasting fantastic sets and costumes, marvelous visual effects, and inventive sound design by Richard King, fresh off an Oscar win for Inception, and hopefully on his way to another nomination.It is worth noting that the romance subplot is not always great, and there's a couple lines that unnecessarily provide further levity than need be, but I must commend Branagh for committing to this project, and for creating a movie that is entirely sure of itself, and entirely entertaining. Just be sure to stay for a special scene at the very end of the credits if seeing Jeremy Renner in a brief cameo as Hawkeye isn't enough to brace you for the upcoming Avengers feature in 2012.I give Thor *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Return To Form For Marvel,"An absolute breathtaking movie a true blockbuster. I opted to see this in the 2D version and it did not disappoint. I was slightly weary of Kenneth Branagh directing, there is a lot to get through as Thor is an actual god with awe-inspiring powers and a rich back story. This is the sort of material that has to be handled with care and Branagh does it justice and more.This is by far the biggest thing Marvel has attempted, its fantasy on a cosmic scale. With a pre-credit stint in New Mexico to a 30 minute sequence in Asgard where we meet all the major players Thor, his brother Loki and their father Odin (a superb Anthony Hopkins). With vast tracking shots through the stunning Asgardian landscapes and unbelievable battle sequences with a race of Frost Giants, its hard to see any other super hero film match this.Chris Hemsworth plays Thor amazingly, once banished to Earth this is when he comes into his own. Adding new layers of humility and humour to his blustering God of Thunder, the fish out of water works like a charm. Hemsworth emerges a true star, adept at action and good with comedy.The film leaves you with intrigue at seeing Hemsworth on screen with Downey Jr. and Chris Evans in next years The Avengers. On that note I would say watch after the end credits for a cameo tie-in to The Avengers.I recommend this to anyone and dare you not to like it kids and adults alike. Everyone has to see this spectacle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I dunno yet....,"I dunno yet, Thor is a mighty god (of lightning) and he is very powerful. After seeing many commercials on Nickelodeon about this movie it makes me worry this movie can not live up to the hype. This movie in my opinion should try to be along with Clash of the Titans. A lot of action, some violence in the fight scenes to make them look a little better. Then again the main reason a movie can be redeemed as good is by having a great story line. I hope to see them focus a bit on the actual mythology of Thor, teach you a little bit about him. Some movies tend to skip the most important thing which is telling the audience Thor is a god, how he came to be, what his purpose is, and what exactly he is fighting for and why Thor for that particular reason.

Splendid medieval and fantasy undercurrent,"This film illustrates a fantasy and sci-fi combination, difficult to fit smoothly into the MCU genre; but assuredly this is a tour de force. It has Kenneth Branagh written all over it. Anthony Hopkins presents a narration of the history of Asgard, and we are swept into an historical fiction novel of Arthurian proportions. This has the feel of an ancient tale fully equipped with dragons, knights, and wizards. It is a mythos full of symbols, accounts of heroes, chivalry, giants, damsels in distress, and of course demigods. Huzzah for the exhibition.This is a nice little gem of film, transporting us back and forth through time, and setting the stage for Thor, Odin, Loki, and all this greatness that is a relevant and necessary addition to the MCU. The science and techno stuff is scattered throughout, and the action is slightly lacking, but the story is full of enchantment, and danger, sprinkled with a little romance. It was a very enjoyable experience, and I will be looking forward to my fifth viewing in a couple years. The Hamdel (Idris Elba) gate scene was so stellar, nothing else compares.Chris Hemsworth as Thor = perfect specimen, perfect casting. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster is wonderful. Her expressions, and silly scientist nerd blunders were spot on. Anthony Hopkins is the only choice for Odin, hands down. I'd never seen Tom Hiddleston prior to this, and was pleasantly surprised at his portrayal of Loki. I believe he was THE most phenomenal casting selection, as important as Hemsworth, and even as crucial as Robert Downey Jr. For the role of Iron Man. Kat Dennings as the comic relief - priceless. We were introduced to Jeremy Renner also (uncredited).This was my most anticipated MCU addition because when I was 12 and up I was a huge Thor comic fan. I started collecting as many as I could get my grubby little hands on. But it was difficult to get a hold of all the good stuff, because at the time I lived in a third world country. My favorites were Thor and Spiderman, and third was probably X-Men, then Iron Man.Frost giants, can you say White Walkers? This is so similar it's eerie to be sure. The epic battle scenes of the army of Asgard vs the frost giants is way too similar to Game of Thrones' battles with the white walkers. The writing is very rich and full of great color and vibrant history. The first 20 minutes of this is absolutely breathtaking, and I was really enjoying this backstory of Thor's roots and how he lost his claim to the throne of Asgard because of his impetuous and warmongering nature. I wish they had made a Thor movie that was entirely about his back story, including a complete exploration of his relationships with his close comrades over millennia.9.0 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Excellent fantasy epic and a nice final piece of The Avengers puzzle,"In the magical and mystical realms of Asguard where Norse legends and myths are told, a brave but arrogant warrior named Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has caused a ruckus on another realm thus making his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) very upset. Indeed, so mad that he takes Thor's powers, strength and Hammer away from him as he casts him out onto Earth where he will be a mortal and learn humility as his his punishment. Odin even sends the mighty hammer down to Earth on a stone in a ""Sword in the Stone"" kind of situation where only one worthy person can pull the hammer from the stone, Thor falls in love with a scientist named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where she teaches him things that he will learn to understand. His half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleson) has plans of his own like terrorizing some of the people on Earth and taking over Asguard as their new king, Thor's 4 pals (Ray Stevenson, Tanabou Asandu, Jamie Alexander and Josh Dallas) hear about this as they head to Earth to warn Thor but can the god of thunder learn what it takes to be a true hero to get his powers back?An outstanding and worthy companion in The Avengers linking story movie saga that leads to the main event which actually begins with the prequel to the saga ""Captain America"" then on to ""Iron Man"" then ""Incredible Hulk"" then Iron Man 2"" and finally this. This movie is a nice fantasy epic in the tradition of 80s fantasy classics like ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Excalibur"", ""Willow"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Conan 1 & 2"" and others of that era as it's sword and sorcery meets superheros. I like how it stays true to it's comic book roots despite no Donald Blake, the performances are good and so is the direction from Kenneth Braghn who does a Shakespearian job of bringing a comic character and mythological figure to life.

God-darn fun,"Thor's a great example of a superhero movie - good acting, good action, and all around good fun. I very much enjoyed Thor, and it's my second-favourite ""Avengers prelude"" movie (the first being Iron Man).Despite being a prelude, however, I think Thor stands on its own with the likes of Spider-Man and Batman Begins. The special effects in this movie are very good, and I really enjoyed seeing Asgard and the Frost Giant world, because they were beautifully created. I thought the lore behind Asgard was all very well done and I was really interested in it.The action was well-directed, and it really made Thor seem as though he was a powerful warrior. Speaking of Thor, I thought Chris Hemsworth did a great job with his portrayal, as did the other actors and actresses. Tom Hiddleston, especially, stood out as Thor's brother, Loki.I did have a few minor problems with Thor, which deterred me from giving it a 9/10, and it mainly had to do with the supporting characters. Kat Dennings's character, Darcy Lewis, (who, of course was funny), I felt was pretty much unneeded. It's not like I didn't like her, it just seemed like she was there because of comic relief. Basically, if she was left out of the movie, I don't think it would've been any worse (or better).Also, I wanted to see more of Thor's friends - the Warrior's Three and Sif. I thought they were really interesting - overall, I wanted to see more of Asgard in general. However, Thor learning how Earth customs work made for some great humour.So, I would definitely recommend Thor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but lacks the style of dialog of the comic","While the special effects representing the abode of the Norse gods known as Asgard and the Bifrost bridge are extremely impressive, the storyline is less so. At the start of the story, Thor is depicted as an impulsive, emotional god that must be reigned in by the reigning god, the wise Odin. Thor's behavior is so out of line that Odin banishes him to New Mexico with no godlike powers and without the ability to control his mighty hammer known as Mjolnir,. Although he is still tough as nails and capable of physically defeating nearly all human males, he can still be whipped up on.
When a small team of astronomical researchers encounter the deposed Thor when he is hit by their van, a relationship between them is begun. Thor's mighty hammer also lands near where Thor did, and it defies all attempts by humans to move it. There is a great cameo by Stan Lee in that sequence of actions. A massive team of U. S. government agents (S. H. I. E. L. D.) swarms in and begins the study of the hammer, yet despite the highest of technologies at their disposal, they learn very little about it.
Meanwhile, Thor's brother Loki learns that while Thor is Odin's true offspring, he was in fact adopted by Odin. This leads to a great deal of resentment and Loki engaging in a great deal of underhanded machinations in trying to ascend to the Asgardian throne. Since Thor rekindled the hostilities between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants and they are plotting to recover the source of their power from Asgard, Thor's absence gives the Frost Giants an advantage. Since he is the spawn of the Frost Giants and the Asgardian throne is at stake, Loki does not hesitate to align himself with the leader of the Frost Giants.
The weakness of the movie is that the events on Earth sometimes come across as forced and uncertain. The S. H. I. E. L. D. agents are arrogant, ignoring the laws regarding search and seizure and some of the action scenes are played with needless destruction by the killer robot known as Destroyer. It is a fun movie, but the dialog does not have the charming Shakespearean quality of the comic book character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor marks a significant entry into Marvel Cinematic universe,"Released in 2011, _Thor_ marks a significant entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), directed by Kenneth Branagh. The film introduces audiences to the Norse god of thunder, Thor, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, blending action, mythology, and humor in a captivating narrative. This review explores the film's strengths, thematic depth, and character development. Thor_ follows the journey of its titular character, who is exiled from Asgard, the realm of gods, to Earth as punishment for his reckless actions. Stripped of his powers, Thor must navigate the human world while learning humility and responsibility. The plot thickens with the threat of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who seeks to claim the throne of Asgard. The film gracefully intertwines Thor's personal growth with epic battles, providing a rich narrative .One of the film's standout elements is its character development. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor is charismatic and layered, capturing the essence of a fierce warrior with a heart. Thor's evolution from arrogance to humility is both believable and engaging. His interactions with Natalie Portman's character, Jane Foster, provide depth and a touch of romance, showcasing his struggle to understand love and sacrifice. Tom Hiddleston delivers a phenomenal performance as Loki, bringing complexity to the character. Loki's internal conflict-between his desire for acceptance and the darker impulses that drive him-adds depth to the narrative. The film brilliantly explores the themes of jealousy, betrayal, and the quest for identity through Loki's journey. Visually, _Thor_ is a triumph. The film's depiction of Asgard is breathtaking, filled with stunning landscapes, intricate architecture, and vibrant colors that bring the mythical realm to life. The visual effects team deserves commendation for their work, especially in the action sequences, which are both thrilling and well-executed. The design of Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, is iconic, effectively symbolizing his power and responsibility. Kenneth Branagh's direction is particularly noteworthy. His background in theater shines through in the film's dramatic moments, elevating the dialogue and character interactions. Branagh strikes a balance between humor and seriousness, creating a tone that feels both epic and relatable. The film's pacing ensures that the audience remains engaged, with each scene contributing to character arcs and the overarching narrative._Thor_ is rich with themes that resonate with audiences. The film explores the concept of redemption as Thor must earn back his godly powers through acts of bravery and selflessness. Additionally, the theme of family dynamics plays a crucial role, particularly the complex relationship between Thor and Loki. The film raises questions about loyalty, power, and the consequences of one's actions, making it a thoughtful exploration of mythology _Thor_ (2011) successfully blends action, humor, and heart, establishing a strong foundation for the character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With exceptional performances, stunning visuals, and a compelling narrative, the film not only entertains but also invites reflection on deeper themes of identity, redemption, and family. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston shine in their roles, bringing depth to their characters and setting the stage for future MCU installments. As the first film to introduce Thor to a broader audience, it remains a beloved entry in the superhero genre and a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
#Movie Review,"Chris Hemsworth does a wonderful job as Thor, the movie attempts to follow a multi-layered plot by following 2 realms: the supernatural : Asgard and Earth. This concept seems appealing at first but after a while you can get this feeling of discontinuity where many things happen one after another in these 2 realms to the point where things don't blend in too well. Thor is presented at first as an arrogant unwise man. As the story unfolds you can observe the well integrated character development. Meticulously positioned jokes that may give you a laugh or 2 are also included + you can connect emotionally with the movie.The thing that bothers me is the fact that the action happening on Earth can seem a bit shacky at times as the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster feels unsurprisingly way too convenient and unrealistic just so the story can continue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor could have been SO MUCH MORE!,"This movie had the potential to be, for lack of better word, epic. But it was not. The movie was good, but it could have been extraordinary. The story moves along much too quickly for the audience to develop any real connection with the characters. But there are a great deal of action shots, especially towards the first half of the movie that most people are going to really enjoy. The use of storyline from Asgard and the nine worlds is brilliant. This movie has the potential to make so many different categories of viewers happy because of the choice of story and actors, but I don't know why the director and writers failed to develop it fully? If you're going to spend that kind of money on the movie, why not push for serious completion? The movie felt seriously rushed. Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed, because I had high hopes. Nonetheless, I would watch it again for sheer brute fighting scenes. The movie does manage to get your heart pumping with adrenaline, which is a good sign. The 3D was well incorporated into majestic and powerful scenes, so kudos to the digital artists for that one! THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where *did* this come from?,"Because of his being too headstrong, Thor, the god of thunder, is banished to the worst place imaginable... Earth. He is stripped of his powers, immortality and Mjolnir. And when the mischievous Loki(a surprisingly deep role, and played to perfection with manipulation) learns a secret, more trouble comes his way. The evil Ice Giants of Jotunheim, who have had dealings with the duo's father Odin, are part of it. Perhaps I should make it clear that I'm not a fan of the comics, although I love the Norse myth. It was strange to hear that Branagh was going to make this, and I suppose what happened is really what we should all have realized would. He tried to do it as Shakespeare(hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it), and some will be surprised to find that it works out really well. The focus is on the family drama between the three aforementioned and the father/son conflict, and it's incredibly easy to relate to. In addition, this is a classic adventure tale, the young, brash boy who has to get by in the outside world before he can return home and claim his father's place. Note that we don't see a lot of the titular deity using his abilities(and thankfully he doesn't don that silly helmet much) in this, and he is mortal for the majority of it. This does a magnificent job of setting up the strength of these beings, and still making us feel scared for them. The action tends to be great(apart from the all-human martial arts, that are awkwardly shot and edited for some reason... maybe to hide the stunt performer, I don't know), if the very best of it is at the very start. You also have to wonder why we see less than a dozen Asgardians... well, no, the answer is of course that they had to juggle the two worlds(and it does well, we never lose track), and ours is the grounding factor. On that note, their realm is indeed awe-inspiring, beautifully animated and captured, and the 3D only adds to the epic scope of it(worth the price of admission in my book). Bifrost is nice, even if it is evidently made from the same material as the sidewalk from Billie Jean. While the love story is not the strongest aspect, it works OK(Hemsworth is sufficiently charming). The acting is fine, with a few standout performances(Hiddle and Hopkins, especially). We get some ""fish out of water"" stuff, and it's adequately balanced to not be annoying. The Marvel-verse cameos are cool. This tries to be funny *a lot*, and thankfully, it does tend to work(it is forced at other times). The script has a few hiccups, and the characters aren't as memorable as they could be. Stay after the credits, for your own sake(if you're at all into these). Since we see it really early on, I can comment on the Destroyer... it's as bland as its name(also, The Day The Earth Stood Still called, it wants Gort back), honestly, you have this cornucopia of fascinating creatures and you come up with a shiny robot with halitosis? All in all, definitely a fun ride, largely satisfying and it works well. I recommend this to anyone who likes the titular ruiner of Summer days, regardless of where you know him from. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"The film, of course, is far from a masterpiece, but in its own way it is very charming and most likely pleasant impressions are guaranteed to you when watching. More like a comedy than a drama or thriller) it was shot funny, with humor, the picture is beautiful, the Top is a sight, sometimes everything is silly, but it's even nice that there are no special attempts at plausibility and significance of what is happening.

Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sickeningly boring and predictable.,"Thor has never been one of my favorite ""superheroes"", but I still respect his character. This movie spit in the face of Marvel, Thor, and comic books in general. This movie was definitely one of the absolute WORST comic book movies I've ever seen. The plot was boring, predictable, and poorly written. No suspense or captivation whatsoever. In my opinion, all of the actors were bad for their roles, and offered nothing to the movie. There was really no story at all, just bad CGI, pathetic ""lovie-dovie"" B.S. and random, unnecessary action scenes. After seeing the highly successful Iron Man movies, I had high hopes for this film, but I was sadly sadly disappointed. Now I have no hopes for The Avengers.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Super good,"This movie basically introduced me to the Marvel universe. First of all, I was impressed by the plot of the picture, which allowed me to relax while watching it, but at the same time made me think about the history of the Marvel world. So much so that I began to eagerly look for other series not only about the history of Thor, but also about other participants in the universe. A lot of time was spent to unravel this tangle and friends who turned out to be much more experienced than me helped here. Thank you Marvel for doing this. I hope that this story will delight its audience for many more years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
He be worthy,"By Odin's beard! Verily, yon mighty picture house of Marvel doth demonstrate the courage of a warrior battling a rampaging Bilgesnipe to tell the tale of Thor. Metal men and monsters of medicine? Aye, but ye literal Gods of Olde, told with nary a snicker? Forsooth! But hark - they who doth dare to scorn know not the Lord Kenneth of Branagh, whose soothsaying doth be as pure as his heart. He approacheth the lore of Asgard with the eloquence of yon Bard of Olde, but addeth the slow-motion and explosions of yon Michael Bay. Zounds. And lo - though it be the first foray into fantasy outright for yon kingdom of Marvel, Thor abideth the test of time - robust, clear-headed, and, verily, as fun as it be mighty.Too ridiculous an opening paragraph for you? Thankfully, Marvel and Branagh are, quite wisely, on your side. Here, the Thor comic's characteristic Stan Lee swipes at 'Olde Englishe' are as absent as his feathery helmet (that is to say, restricted to cameo status). Branagh is cognizant of this potential for silliness, and works hard to carve out familiar, safe ground, opening with a contextual prologue that leans on Lord of the Rings tropes so extensively, it's almost a shock not to see Cate Blanchett pop up.* Still, Branagh proves as adept at blockbuster filmmaking as he is at gilding classical wordplay, and, after a few cliché-courting opening moments in the (cool but fairly wobbly CGI) realm of Asgard, it only takes moments to be swept up in Thor's brisk pacing, crisp action interludes (excessive slow-mo notwithstanding), and ready levity, all skepticism receding to a dull ebb.Instead, Marvel's challenge of selling Norse mythology as hip, blockbuster entertainment provides a intriguing opportunity to repackage the rote, superhero 'learning powers/coming of age' tropes as something altogether more mature. Unlike the average hero, the arrogant Thor begins his titular film at peak power, and the film's biggest action blowout is in its first act, where he lets loose with all the thrilling, trailer-stinger hammer-'n-lightning blowout moments against an army of frost giants in the tundra wastelands of Jotunheim. Soon afterwards, however, we're grounded in New Mexico, where our fish-out-of-water deity is, begrudgingly, forced to learn humility through nonviolent valour. Here, Branagh slows down to a crawl, with more talk of astrophysics, governmental investigations/Avengers world-building (including a happily extensive hangout with Clark Gregg's adorably deadpan Agent Coulson), and the comedic schtick of Kat Dennings (who is just funny enough to not feel flagrantly out of place) than punching and kicking. In his downtime, he stokes a romantic subplot, with flirtations housed in constellations, conflating science and magic, and pop tarts. No one could ever accuse Thor of being unambitious.If the initial premise itself heralded perilous camp potential, this forced juxtaposition is doubly so. Thankfully, Branagh meets the silliness head on with a cheerful twinkle in his eye. Ample amounts of Thor's gregarious, out-of-place posturing (""I need a horse!"" and ""This drink - I like it. Another!"" can face off for the film's biggest laugh) and physical slapstick help take the sting out of the Asgardian brooding, while keeping the film accessible and fun. This, in turn, carves out breathing room for Branagh's Shakespearian credentials to work their magic on the larger-than-life melodrama, helping terse, booming confrontation scenes between a golden bondage pirate and a Gothic teenager with ibex horns breathe as surprisingly natural, sombre and resonant, without hammering it home (ha). Amazingly, before you can shake a sceptre, it's all coalesced in a din of flamboyant opposites that (somehow) achieve thrilling counterpoint, woven together by the strains of Patrick Doyle's handsomely heroic musical score. By the time we're swept away to climactic battles with a gigantic Day the Earth Stood Still robot and a god vs. god beatdown on a CGI rainbow bridge (keep your Mario Kart jokes to yourself), we, like Thor, feel we've earned the catharsis of the CGI-bloated action, and are too invested not to cheer in the face of the raw jubilance of it all.Still, Branagh's careful balancing act would be nothing without the exceptional casting of Chris Hemsworth as the titular god of thunder. Bringing an impeccable comedic timing, and boisterous charisma as colossal as his dazzling physique, Hemsworth commits to his performance with such enormous, brazenly sincerity that his fall from grace and reclamation of honour are somehow as primally resonant and compelling as any high melodrama. Similarly, Tom Hiddleston attacks the inherent underdog pathos of Thor's seedy sibling Loki with such ferocious nuance and presence that he's nearly as commanding, sympathetic, and beguiling as his titular brother, even in the midst of committing unspeakably despicable villainy. Natalie Portman may struggle to fish comparable depth out of her quirky love interest/dubious astrophysicist, but she's neurotically adorable enough to make her rushed romance with Hemsworth surprisingly sweet. Anthony Hopkins lends Odin the requisite thunderous gravitas while largely resisting the expected sleepiness and impulse to phone it in, while Stellan Skarsgård is unreasonably entertaining as the resident 'straight-man scientist,' fishing perennial incredulous humour out of the chaos with practiced ease. Finally, Rene Russo, Jaimie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Josh Dallas, and (especially) Idris Elba all find their moments to lend humour and class as fellow Asgardians, despite functioning more as endearing action figures than fleshed-out characters.Despite, on paper, sounding like the superhero genre's most absurd entry, Thor excels as one of its most straightforward, breezy, deceptively intimate and character-driven, and invigoratingly enjoyable. We've believed a man can fly; now we can believe a god can fall, and capture our hearts all the while. In the words of Odin, Thor is worthy.-8.5/10*Or apparently she's just been biding her time for six years. Stay tuned for Ragnarok!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic movie,"The film's narrative is expertly balanced, blending humor and drama seamlessly. Hemsworth shines as Thor, bringing his signature wit and charm to the role. Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster, now wielding Mjolnir as the Mighty Thor, adds a fresh dynamic to the story. Christian Bale's villainous Gorr the God Butcher brings depth and complexity to the narrative. The film's visuals are stunning, with breathtaking cinematography and impressive CGI work. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, making for an immersive viewing experience. Waititi's direction is impeccable, infusing the film with his signature quirky humor and style. The movie's themes of love, loss, and self-discovery are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Oh.....my.....God!,"Thor was simple thrust out by the studio to make a quick buck and establish the character before the release of The Avengers. And boy, does it really show here! The first half of the movie, set on Planet Asgard, was generally interesting, even if Anthony Hopkins was sleep walking through his performance. The Frost Giants of Jotunheim presented pretty scary villains and if the film had the courage to keep the setting there, with the Frost Giants as the main antagonists, they would of made the film all the better (I know the comic takes place on Earth, but c'mon, we've seen the superhero comes to earth and saves the day a million times! Try something new!)Just like The Green Lantern (which is still much worse), my biggest criticism is that they don't spend enough time in the foreign landscape of Asgard (Oa in GL), and head to dull old planet Earth in no time. The first time this was done (on screen, of course) in 1978's Superman, it was a refreshing take on the fish-out-of-water story. Here it acts like a poorly done comedy, throwing the tone of the whole first act off. There is a few laughs to be had (as when he wanders into a pet shop), but really felt forced for the most part.Then there's the love story. Look, I realize films like these aren't too concentrated on developing character bonds like a (much superior) film such as Before Sunrise would, but at least show us why the two are in love! I, of course, speak of Natalie Portman's character and Thor, and the inevitable attraction that grows between them. First off, and I know other reviewers have stated it before, but Natalie Portman is horribly miscast here. Either that, or she's giving one of the worst paycheck-performances I've seen in some time (there's one line reading in particular near the end that is so excruciating, it might as well of been nails on a chalkboard). But all the 'romance' consists of is Natale Portman giving Thor an awkward, teenage-crush like smile, for maybe a scene or two. In the climatic fight (no spoilers here), Thor takes a fall, and Portman's character rushes over to help him - in which I don't know how she doesn't get killed, but this movie's logic is not exactly present. They have a moment where we get those Natalie Portman tears and her eyebrows scrunch up (as they always do when she cries, in like EVERY single movie she's ever been in.) As the audience, we're suppose to feel an emotion connection to the two that just doesn't exist. They both could of been killed right then and there, the credits roll up, and I wouldn't of felt the least bit unsatisfied. Of course that doesn't happen, as you can surely guess what the outcome is, which only irritated me more.Tom Hiddleston is an up-and-coming actor I have high hopes for. He was great as F. Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris and one of the best parts in War Horse, but here is given nothing to do here in the role of Loki. It's no surprise he'll become the villain, as it's hinted at constantly in the film. But when he does become the main antagonist, his motivations are very askewed. Is he an outright villain? Is he a sympathetic villain? Is he even a villain at all? The film doesn't seem to know how to handle these questions. One scene he'll act one way, the next scene he'll be a completely new person. It'll be like if the Joker from the Dark Knight tries to kill Batman, then a minute later saves his life and buys him a beer. Is character continuity that difficult of a concept?Stellan Skarsgard, one of the most unappreciated actors working today, also isn't given a chance to really make anything of his character. There's an assistant scientist, played by Kate Dennings, who doesn't really add anything to film and is only there for 'comedic' relief (I use the term very loosely.) Chris Hemsworth is a pretty good Thor, he comes off as very arrogant and strong-willed. But when he's asked to handle more dramatic scenes, well, I'll just says he's no Brando.I'm sure this movie isn't directed at me (I usually prefer, you know, movies with a brain and pulse), so I'm sure this will make money and produce needless sequels. But, for my money, I think the material could of been handled a lot better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't skip this one!,"A must watch - do not skip - Marvel movie for those working up to the Avengers, those who have never seen, or those trying to introduce people to the MCU Franchise.I've read all too much criticism of this movie in relation to the rest of the Marvel movie universe. Much of it negatively highlighting the very cornerstones of why this movie is so great!Thor (2011) - is complete. It has a balanced start to finish ensemble of drama, dialogue, character development, action/fight scenes, and yes, even a hint of romance built in.I find that for a general audience - some of the Marvel movies lack this balance in favor of sci fi cgi to fight scenes , rinse, repeat. While pretty much all the Marvel movies are great - all of them are not balanced and, again, that is where Thor ""1"" shines.If you are trying to get someone hesitant on the plethora of MCU films 'into' them -- It wouldn't be a bad idea to start with this one.

Suprisingly enjoyable,"Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an alien humanoid, for lack of better terminology. He is a prince on the planet Asgard, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), the ruler of Asgard, and brother of Loki (Tom Hiddleston - did I spell his surname correctly?).
I started watching this movie with great trepidation as I'm not big on aliens, so wasn't sure how this movie would go.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's an excellent movie!
There is some violence, but it's actually pretty tame compared to other films. In fact, there was hardly any violence at all.
There is plenty of humour and Thor is actually a rather light, family-friendly film. There is plenty of twists and turns and it's a mixture of science and fantasy with no clear distinction between the two. In the movie, science and ""magic"" are one and the same. And I actually enjoyed that perspective. It's not really magic as such - more odd forms of superior technology on the part of the Asgardians. There's different alien colonies - the Asgardians who resemble humans and are the good guys who help Earth out. Then there's the Forest Giants - the evil alien life forms.
There are others, but we don't see them and their names are not mentioned.
In the movie Thor, the filmmakers drew a lot from the legends from Norse mythology and made it into an enjoyable sci-fi movie.
The animation is really great! Especially with the shots we see of Asgard. This film is a visual splendor.
There is plenty of exciting action scenes that are somewhat preposterous at times, but they are a lot of fun and enjoyable.
Chris Hemsworth is a marvelous actor! He is really good at bringing his character to life. He portrays the arrogant, reckless, self-righteous guy really well. When Thor ends up on Earth, he is a real fish out of water. Hemsworth does it excellently and I was laughing so hard watching Thor trying to understand Earth and the way we do things.
Tom Hiddleston is great as Loki, Thor's adoptive brother and the villain of the movie. He is very likeable despite having evil intentions. Loki is a very complicated character and there's more to him than meets the eye. Hiddleston does his role excellently.
Natalie Portman is great as Jane, a scientist and Thor's love interest. She does the socially awkward scientist role really well. Idris Elba is awesome and can be quite comic at times and is a great actor. Ray Stevenson is good and provides lots of comic relief. I really liked how the Asgardians, while technologically superior to us humans, talk old style and dress like ancient warriors. It provided lots of laughs.
Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin, Thor and Loki's father and the old wise king. I also love the romantic subplot between Jane and Thor. It was handled very well.
You could argue that some parts are cheesy and cliched. While that might possibly be true, it's an enjoyable cheesy. It's still a lot of fun and I love the 'cheesy' parts - they are handled very well. This certainly isn't a film for everybody. Not everyone will like it and that's okay. That's them and their tastes and preferences. But this is me and my tastes and preferences. I love it. You may not and that's totally fine as well. We're all different.
It's a really great movie with a great and relevant message. Plenty of twists and turns and has great character development. Everything is handled marvellously. It is well-written and well executed. I totally enjoy this movie - it's not meant to be realistic, just a lot of fun and excitement. Great animation, great acting.

as far as a comic book could get,"Thor was the last in a series of comic books brought to screen i've seen within a relatively short time frame. It turned out to be among the best of them and the reason might be Kenneth Branagh directing it. Not that the movie breaks the mold of the genre, it just has a good atmosphere when dealing with the inhabitants of Asgard and supernatural creatures they're fighting.However, Kenneth Branagh didn't have a particularly demanding task. When depicting Asgard and the realms of the other side, he heavily relied on his Shakespearean background. The scenes on this Earth are a mixture of thriller and action movies. And as every such movie Thor needs a large fight, similar to the end of a level in any video game, if you know what i mean. Thus, Thor confronts a large monster as seen in numerous Japanese monster movies or even in Beastie Boys' video for Intergalactic.The cast deliver a solid performance, with Chris Hemsworth being a prefect choice for arrogant and blunt Thor.

No better recommendation than that. This film is especially enjoyable for it's story telling. The warrior Prince who needs to learn a little compassion and the Shakespearean feel, to me, make it entertaining. I confess I watched this film again today after seeing Avengers:Endgame to refresh my memory as to why I loved this character. And to see Thor grow over 3 films, plus the Avengers movies, was great, until Endgame. In that film we see the boy Thor as a slovenly 1 joke Big Lebowski (Iron Man's name) who was anything but worthy. Chris Hemsworth is a great actor in my opinion and handled the comedy in that film well.

Thor,"I don't know it is only in China or not, the English version is 2D only here, the 3D version is exclusively Chinese-dubbed, I cannot figure out whether this maneuver is supposed to promote the 3D or 2D (a quite stupid one though), but I had no hesitation to choose the non- dubbed version (latter I would got some delightful news that the so-called 3D version is not worth the pennies).As the starter of the summer Hollywood blockbusters here in China, Thor intricately possesses a singular trait, the actor-turned-director Kenneth Branagh had remained to be an odd option since he was announced as the man behind-the-wheel the this heavy-budgeted vehicle for all cinephiles. How the Shakespeare-addicted Kenneth could on earth create a marvel-labelled popcorn picture? Now the wait is officially over, I must say the outcome of this incompatible combo tastes quite bland.Compared with other superhero-studded peers, Thor does look a bit shabby, the setting of the land of all Gods is mainly covered in a monochrome dark hue, which is nothing near splendid and in lack of any virtual existence, lavish but kitsch (3D glasses also cannot help). The earth set, on the other hand, the seediness is ubiquitously, no spectacular scene to satisfy my eyes, everything happens in a tiny desert town with a dozen of extras, running and screaming.The essential bedrock of the film centers on the father-son battle, which is Kenneth's stunt, but in a cartoonish way unfortunately, Kenneth may have exerted himself fully to balance the duel between money and art, however, in my opinion, he failed to achieve both.As for the cast, Just as I expected, nothing noteworthy, the only two exceptions, alongside Sir Anthony Hopkins is Tom Hiddleston, who unexpectedly devoted a feminine but not campy existence as the villain Loki, however, this film surely doesn't worth their talent.

Thor: A Mighty Marvel Masterpiece,"Kenneth Branagh's 2011 blockbuster, Thor, marked a pivotal moment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This fantastical adventure not only introduced the god of thunder to the big screen but also laid the groundwork for the Avengers franchise. With its richly detailed world-building, memorable characters, and epic action sequences, Thor remains an electrifying and entertaining ride.From the outset, Thor's visual grandeur is awe-inspiring. The realms of Asgard, Jotunheim, and Earth are meticulously crafted, with stunning production design and impressive visual effects. The cinematography is equally impressive, capturing the majesty of Asgard's golden spires and the gritty realism of small-town New Mexico.Chris Hemsworth shines as the titular hero, bringing a perfect blend of humor, arrogance, and vulnerability to the role. His Thor is a lovable, if slightly entitled, prince who must confront the consequences of his actions. Hemsworth's chemistry with co-stars Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is undeniable, adding depth and warmth to the story.Speaking of Loki, Hiddleston's portrayal of the god of mischief is a masterclass in complexity and nuance. His character's motivations are expertly woven throughout the narrative, making his eventual betrayal both shocking and heartbreaking.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Anthony Hopkins (Odin), Idris Elba (Heimdall), and Clark Gregg (Phil Coulson). The film's humor is well-balanced, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments courtesy of Thor's fish-out-of-water experiences on Earth.Thor's action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, showcasing the hero's incredible strength and combat prowess.

Thor,"Australia's Chris Hemsworth - great
Natalie Portman - great (and stunningly beautiful, as always)
Anthony Hopkins - great
Tom Hiddlestone - greatI could go on and on. I won't, but I will say this: Thor is a great movie. And I'm by no means a comic book guy. Far from it, in fact. I just enjoy entertaining (and sometimes dumb) movies.Kenneth Branagh's entry into the Marvel universe is a winner from beginning to end. Great special effects but also a good story. Hemsworth's Thor changes from beginning to end. His work in the ""fish out of water"" scenes on Earth are genuinely funny stuff, and he is one half of a good romantic pairing with Natalie Portman's Dr Jane Foster.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What I love about the movie thor,"Personally LOVE the Marvel movies, I have seen all of them multiple times and enjoyed all of them. There are quite a few too watch and I think if you really can't watch all of them you should try watching Thor, Thor the Dark world.. ( But there ones that you have to watch, some of them are even regarded as some of the best movies ever and are definitely my favorite. I recommend watching all of them because then everything will make a lot more sense but in my unqualified opinion my favorite MCU projects that you should watch is this one ...the first Thor movie ....if you watch this one then try other movies after this one following dark world....love and thunder u get a better understanding of how it is going💯💯",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Story needs to be better,"After his son THOR (Chris Hemsworth) storms Yodenheim -- the realm that the Norse gods' native Asgard has been in an uncertain peace with for eons -- because of an unexpected attack from the Frost Giants, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) banishes him and his hammer to Earth. There, Thor literally runs into an astrophysicist (Natalie Portman) who impresses him; he also learns humility and grace. Meanwhile, Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has risen to power as Odin lies in a restless sleep. The Frost Giants are out for revenge, and everywhere, including Earth, is in peril.On Earth, Thor is rescued by a team of scientists (led by Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgård), and he is almost childlike in his ability to cause trouble without trying. He speaks in incongruously formal King's English (""I need sustenance!""). Yet the movie, though it's often a very funny god-out-of-water origin comedy, has a stirring emotional core as well. It keeps returning to Asgard, where Branagh stages the political-familial infighting - centered on Thor's treacherous brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - like an intergalactic Gladiator. The director also proves an unexpected maestro of digital effects (a crystal bridge, a race of scaly blue gargoyles who can turn anyone they touch into ice). On our planet, the film doesn't have much of a plot: Thor must retrieve his weighty hammer (the focus of a government security crackdown), and he does battle with a grand, fire-shooting metal monster. Yet Thor turns its hero's confusion - about who he is, where he belongs, and why he has these..feelings for Portman's feisty Jane Foster - into touchingly overscaled coming-of-age kicks. It's not art, but it's mighty fun.I think the story needs to be better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Asgard Come To Life,"Its been a few years since I picked up a Thor Comic but I'm more than familiar with his background and stories having read many Marvel Comics and Avengers was one of them with the occasional story arc in Thor. I thought this movie was better than I could have ever expected more than that my partner who never read a comic beyond say Superman was totally into it and thought it was great. When I heard Kenneth Branagh was directing again my thoughts were two fold who better to handle the ins and outs of Asgard and Odin than a Shakespearean Actor/Director. Then Anthony Hopkins it just kept getting better so my hopes were high by the time it premiered. Engaging special FX, I might even say Brilliant the Rainbow bridge come to life in a way so unexpected the attention to details was to me Amazing and gratifying.

A film of two halves,"Whoever thought Kenneth Branagh, the man who once gave us a 4-hour long 70mm adaptation of Hamlet, would take a stab at a comic-book movie? I've never read a Thor comic in my life, nor have I been exposed to any other Thor material, so walking into this movie was my introduction to the character. As an outsider to this side of the Marvel universe, I have to admit that the opening 20 minutes are very hard to follow. But as soon as Thor is banished from Asgaard and dumped on Earth, things pick up considerably.There's plenty of fun to be had (in the vein of Crocodile Dundee) as Thor bumbles his way through human life, encountering the underused and sort-of miscast Natalie Portman, the awesome Stellan Skarsgard, and the cute Kat Dennings. But any time the film cuts back to Asgaard it stops dead. The conspiracy involving the Frost Giants was boring and nearly incomprehensible. I'm disappointed that this is the best story they could come up with to carry the movie. It just didn't hook me.I'm growing tired of comic-book movies, but at least Thor didn't have to go down the old 'origin story' path, it gets a few extra points for that. But I'm afraid the fun of the Earth-bound half of the film is crippled by the dull Asgaard plot.And the converted 3D is awful too. Stick with the 2D version people, you'll save yourself a headache.

Thor's transformation from a self-centered warrior to a hero who values sacrifice and compassion is poignant. The film explores the idea that true strength lies not in brute force but in humility and the willingness to protect others.The relationship between Thor and Loki serves as a powerful exploration of sibling rivalry and the quest for identity.

Great Movie,"I really didn't have any expectations before seeing this movie. A lot of these comic based films are really just a blend of special affects and action.However, this film was actually really good. The characters and their relationships are complex, including the bad guy, who is very inconsistent in his badness and even inspires pity.The story is very well written and the acting excellent. This movie even carries a message about pride and being a good leader and a good person. Something that is lacking in many of the shallow action flicks for kids these days.I also like how the romance in the film stayed innocent yet the love interest added to the plot at the same time, without becoming too overdone.I liked this film so much that looked forward to seeing ""The Avengers"". Unfortunately ""The Avengers"" was very disappointing for me. For me, that movie was pretty much like watching someone playing a video game. Endless special effects + action, with very little acting or intelligent dialog. I wondered how the Avengers could be so different so I looked up both movies here in IMDb and realized that they had different directors.The director of Thor, Kenneth Charles Branagh, is also the director of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"". Both of those are movies I really like as well. So that makes sense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
THOR: darkness at the end of the tunnel; SATYAVAN and SAVITRI.,"THOR in the comic universe is from the previous century called God of Thunder. The comic book universe with SCOTT MCLOUD is with art in sequence from a graphic novel to the end. The comic universe is with Savitri or Satyavan, the characters of an epic poem in verse because we have failed reading comics like Reader's Digest which is found easily in the subcontinent. Adding to Thor being HEMSWORTH is the third dimensional dilemma of speaking softly or loud often because THOR is highly decorated physically but power in the dimension of Bharatha munni for instance is 'dancing' or natya with SHASHTRA.
Together we hold back 'NATYASHASHTRA.' Reading BHARATHA munni is not a waste of time and watching THOR: darkness at the end of the tunnel; SATYAVAN and SAVITRI is not.

Technology ?,"I find technology is a double edge sword. Technology has finally caught up to making believable Superhero movies, but at the same time story telling has suffered. I would tell the directors of the new digital age, not to let special effect replace a good story. Thor was visually pleasing (and a bit loud) movie, but I found the story simple and unimaginative. Thor so far is the weakest of the Avenger movie prequels. The disappointing story was shocking due to the caliber of actors assembled for this movie.

Thor and Natalie Portman's downfall,"Perhaps the best way to start this review is with an observation about a very talented actor's career. Natalie Portman demonstrated with her spellbinding performance as Nina in ""Black Swan"" that she can act really well, but then she went on to act in three terrible films, ""No Strings Attached,"" ""Your Highness"" and now ""Thor."" In ""Thor,"" Portman is simply miscast. She is not a warm actor meant to play in romantic films(that is more Amy Adams' vocation), but instead a cold and efficient actor who is more suited to roles where she is expected to play a villain or someone socially awkward (if not anti-social) or a gifted prodigy with inner demons. Yet director Kenneth Branaugh and the producers put her in this film where she is expected to play a romantic lead -- something that she never did very well throughout her two-decades long career. As a result, every romantic scene with Portman looks forced from the flirtation to the laughing to the kissing scene. She does all these scenes with professional efficiency, but that unfortunately is the problem. There is nothing professional or efficient about love. Love is this irrational, emotionally charged and fantastic thing. If anyone experiences love the same way Natalie Portman's Jane Foster character did, then perhaps they should reevaluate their relationship and find someone else.But that is not the only problem with ""Thor."" This movie fails at the screenplay stage. There are so many wall-to-wall special effects and blasting soundtracks (Hollywood frequently confuses loudness with good music) that there's no room for a plot or for character development. Moreover what little story line there is was taken out of dozens of movies which exhausted these plot gimmicks. Chris Hemsworth plays the ""Thor"" character in the same spirit as Dustin Claire played Gannicus in the second season of Spartacus, except that Claire's character evolved beyond the caricature of the muscular cool guy at the gym who is loved by all women. Hemsworth's Thor, by contrast, has not even lived up to the caricature, because the plot allows for no character development. Or take how Jane Foster (Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) react to the appearance of the muscular Thor. Those scenes of women enamoured with Thor's manliness are essentially a page taken out of a less than memorable scene in Cecil B. Demille's ""The Ten Commandments,"" when muscular Moses (Charleton Heston) crosses the desert and happens upon a small farm with an elderly farmer and his daughters. The daughters are thrilled because they see a muscular, heroic man. In other words, ""Thor"" is really the product of wall to wall special effects and recycled story lines. The immediate impression I got was that the producers decided to go with the first draft of the screenplay rather than telling their writers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. The result is mind numbing entertainment.As a final comment, the villains in this picture are not compelling. The frosty giants do not do anything except turn other people into frost or get knocked down in record numbers. This, of course, is boring because we have known for more than ten years that computers can create fake armies battling each other. Moreover this film does not have the guts, the imagination and the intelligence to show how brutal and dehumanizing violence and war really are (even though there are two battles on screen). Instead the violence appears to come out of several mindless video games. Something mildly interesting was done with the villain Loki, who may not have seemed as bad as the other villains, but even then Loki's character was so limited and oversimplified that he just wasn't interesting. I was stunned to see IMDb.com awarding this terrible film 7.4/10. It goes to show how easy it is convince the viewing public that they're not watching junk. I think 3/10 is more suitable.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
pretty enjoyable,"I'm positively surprised. But I want to react to some reviews which bear to consideration some of creators of this movie and their links to ""comics"" movies. This is not comics. And I believe, that people who don't know pre-Christian German mythology and never read at least some stories of Edda will not really understand. Story is surprisingly good and this is what I value. The choice of actors is questionable, especially Hopkins and Portman but it is question of personal taste maybe. If there was less Hollywood chliches and more work on details, it would be almost unforgettable. These flaws make this movie - I have to admit - some kind of comics - this is shame.

Mostly good,"Having been a reader of Marvel comics back in their 60's golden age it's nice, as it was with Tolkien's books, to see them finally coming to life on the screen. This is a serviceable entry in the growing Marvel catalog. Casting is always a strong point in Marvel pics, this being no exception with the well-sculptured Thor, Hopkins as Odin and Loki masterfully underplayed, as well as the impressive Heimdall, guardian of the Rainbow Bridge. There is one scene where we get to look from behind Heimdall on his view of the universe that was just SPECTACULAR, they should have found an excuse to drag it out longer even if it won't transfer to the smaller screen.

This movie will make you feel its thunder.,"Thor. He's one of the most powerful and famous super heroes in the history of Marvel comics. It is said that super heroes are basically modern day interpretations of ancient mythology. Thor is unique becomes he comes almost straight out of mythology and has since left an impact on the world, especially with his involvement with the Avengers, so the movie has quite a bit to live up to. Thankfully, it fails to disappoint. How so? Let's take a look.Long ago, Odin the ruler of Asgard defeated the Frost Giants, led by their king Laufey, who tried to take over Earth (or Midgard as they call it). He later has two sons, Thor the god of thunder and Loki the god of mischief, and they soon grow up to be great Asgardians. But when Thor's arrogance as left Asgard on the brink of war with the Frost Giants, his father Odin banishes him to Earth where he develops a bond with a few local scientists, especially Jane Foster. When Odin enters his so called Odin Sleep and the cunning Loki takes over, Thor must prove himself worthy of the title hero in order to save both Asgard and the Earth.The execution of this film is excellent. Thor lives up to his reputation as a warrior as the the action scenes are pretty awesome and the forces of good and evil go about beating each other up back and forth. There are a lot of cool moments throughout the action like when Thor rallies some lightning. Equally great is his interactions in the modern world which is just full of hilarious moments. I also love the other elements of the film like the SHIELD agents and a familiar-looking hero that make further connections to the upcoming Avengers movie.The other characters are a load of fun to. Anthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as the wise and all-powerful Odin, living up to practically every single quality of the character. Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) are great supporting characters and so are the scientists like love interest Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. This film's version of Loki is very interesting as he is surprisingly complex. While his villainous acts make him truly despicable, you really do feel sorry for him for he does have some decent qualities, which really moved me a little. The other villains are cool too, Laufey being cool and threatening and the Destroyer Armor being awesome and powerful as hell.I give this movie a thunderous applause. Extremely well done, though I would have like for the final battle to be a little longer. I give this movie an electrifying 8 for entertainment value and an extra point for all the subtleties throughout the film. This movie is worth every penny, so check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor Is Electrifyingly Terrific!,"The god of thunder just had to get his own movie and I'm glad he did. This is a fantastic addition to the MCU and I'm not just talking about the movie here.

kind of a good bad movie,"This movie feels like another attempt to capitalize on the super-hero movie craze. After the first 10 minutes of watching it I was sure it was destined to be a 4 out of 10 star movie. The acting was mediocre, the plot and dialog rather uninspired, and the movie definitely seemed to be falling down the Hollywood trap of overly relying on special effects to sell itself as entertainment.However, then something happened. Humor. (not really spoilers ahead but just a little divulging of why the movie is funny 20 minutes in).Thor lands on earth and he starts walking around acting like a god without the power of one. This part of the movie is comic genius. Of course it ends and the movie goes back to being a little above mediocre super hero flick but for awhile there it broke my expectations in a good way. In fact, its a shame that other parts of this movie were not done better. With a more inspired script, bad guy, acting, etc...this could have been a fun winner like Iron Man. Maybe not something powerful like the Batman trilogy but at least solid entertainment. Instead it just hints at its potential while keeping you entertained enough that you'll finish the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great movie, but Asgard is my favorite part","As one of the first of the live action marvel movies I think thor did a great job bringing Asgard into the universe, honestly I would've liked it better if the whole movie was there. They couldve ended it on modern day earth like they do with other movies but maybe because Captain America is like that they wanted to avoid a similar storyline. Their war against the frost giants was very cool as was the CGI heavy fights! I know alot of people complain about CGI but I think this movie did it well, althought alot of the beginning is going to be a dark lit film lol. Not only is Chris Hemsworth made for the role but so are much of this entire cast, the end battle in the small desert town was the only part that the movie started to lose me in. But I still love to give this one a rewatch with my brothers, Thor is my little brothers favorite marvel superhero and this is prolly my 2nd favorite Thor movie. (I rank them 3rd, 1st, 2nd, 4th. (Even tho 2 gets alot of hate I love those actors and that movie in general.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definition of mediocre.,"This movie is the textbook definition of *meh it's ok i guess* . It took me like 4 times to actually finish the movie and it was very underwhelming. That being said i wouldn't call it bad. There are worse MCU or superhero movies in general out there. This one just doesn't stand out. Asgard looks great but earth looks boring. Thor is a good character who gets developed, but i couldn't care less about his love interest or his friends. Loki is an ok villain (here, as a whole in the MCU he's great), but the frost giants are... whatever. It's a relatively fun movie but it can be very boring at times and the dialogue and directing are unimpressive, as is the plot which is just ok. All in all, you're not gonna regret watching this movie, but you're not really gonna wanna see it again either. 5/10 from me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Chris Hemsworth shines as Thor, capturing both the godly bravado and the vulnerability of a hero learning humility. The chemistry between the cast, especially between Thor and Jane Foster, adds depth to the narrative. The action sequences are thrilling, and the scenes in Asgard are a visual feast.

Pretty good for a mythical film,It's exciting and certainly all-around entertaining for a comic book adaptation.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The 'God of Thunder' equals big big screen entertainment!,"'THOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fourth Marvel comics 'Avengers' film (following two 'IRON MAN' films and an 'INCREDIBLE HULK' flick, all leading up to the 2012 ensemble piece based on the combined team of the 'Avengers'). This one focuses on the popular comic book superhero version of the mythical Germanic paganism God known as Thor who first appeared in Marvel comics in the 60's. In this film he's played by Chris Hemsworth (probably most well known for playing James T. Kirk's dad George in the 2009 'STAR TREK' redo film). The film co-stars Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard, Anthony Hopkins, Kat Dennings and Clark Gregg (reprising his role from the other 'Avengers' films as Agent Coulson). It's written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich and directed by none other than Kenneth Branagh. I never read the comic regularly (or much at all for that matter) but I've heard the film is a pretty faithful adaptation. As far as pure cinema goes it's grade A classic popcorn fare all around, what the big screen was made for.The film takes place on modern day Earth after Thor is banished there by his father King Odin (Hopkins). He was set to take over the throne of Asgard when creatures known as Frost Giants broke into their kingdom and attempted to steal back the Casket of Ancient Winters which Odin took from them in battle in 965 A.D.. Thor believed Asgard must retaliate, against his father's wishes, and broke the long standing truce with the Frost Giants by attacking them in their homeland. For his arrogance Odin exiled Thor to Earth and sent his magical hammer with him, placing a spell on it so that only someone worthy of it's powers could use it. Thor lands in New Mexico where he's found by three scientists including Jane Foster (Portman). The S.H.I.E.L.D. agency finds his hammer, which no one is able to remove from the ground where it lands. Thor finds himself stranded in this land while his mischievous brother Loki (Hiddleston) plots to take over the kingdom of Asgard back home.The 'Thor' comic character has been said to be the most trickiest of the 'Avengers' to adapt to the big screen, by many, and prior to seeing the film I would have agreed but after watching it I actually disagree. The story is somewhat timeless and the themes involving brother rivalry and fatherly approval are classic as well. The legend of 'Thor' and the comic story actually lend themselves to cinema form very easily and that's why the film really works. It's thrilling big spectacle entertainment and at the same time it never takes itself too seriously; it has fun with itself and plays out somewhat tongue in cheek at times. The 'fish out of water' material is played to it's ultimate comic effect and at the same time never over done. Branagh's directing is perfectly fitting and despite the number of writers used the script is well written and beautifully timed. Hemsworth is probably about as fitting an actor as the filmmakers could have found to play the title character and although his performance is nothing close to anything award worthy it's just what the film needed. The supporting cast is all more than adequate as well, especially Portman who's once again doing material that is far beneath her talents but still gives it all she's got and it's kind of fun seeing her play such a sweet giddy character with a big schoolgirl crush on the film's hero (which is pretty against type for her as of late). The movie just hits all the right notes and plays out exactly like a movie of it's type should. The perfect summer comic book action movie blockbuster, not the best of it's type but it's definitely among them.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7A8qHI10rk",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Well paced, fantastic score.","Watching all of infinity saga with my kids after really seeing all these movies in cinemas as one-offs. Never thought much of this one and obviously is a completely different (and strict to canon) take than where ragnarok (which I absolutely love) took the Thor narrative. Even though Natalie Portman is painfully miscast, this film runs like a live action stage play with a surprisingly uplifting score that repeats throughout the film (but never gets annoying), varies its pace to change the tone and generate change in emotional response of the viewer. It's never going to be Iron Man but it doesn't need to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice and not bad!,"Easily one of the best looking Marvel movies so far. I was never a big Thor fan in the comics but this movie had me locked in. Overall i think this movie shines thanks to the cast. Some people may feel that Nat was showing her emotions a little bit more.Otherwise, the chemistry b/w Chris and Nat made me to have feelings for her!I think the script writers tried to show that Earth is a place where is a place to correct your attitude. And ATTITUDE is 100 (add the letters!). The only grey area seems that the last action scenes(bi-frost) was looking artificial and SFX a bit blurry. It takes its place among the top super hero films Marvel has done now that they are in control.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Still the best Thor movie, and one of the best superhero films ever","Just rewatched Thor on video after a few years' gap and I still enjoy the heck out of it. This made stars of Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, and my god the extra star power? Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgaard, Idris Elba, Rene Russo (underused), and Anthony Hopkins for goodness' sake. And for the MCU, our first real glimpses at Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) who would carry those roles onward. The biggest key of all, though, was putting Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair and giving him room to work.One thing I liked that followed on from that decision was to take this story seriously and play it straight. Norse gods, Asgard, and Frost Giants? Really? Marvel apparently saw Thor as a big risk, this soon in the unfolding of MCU, but that was exactly the right way to play it. We're invited right from the start to buy in to that outlook, and boy it works. In the later Thor and Avengers movies, Thor got turned into something of a clown and played for jokes, which mostly leaves a bad taste in the mouth. That does a serious disservice to the character.Extra kudos here go to Patrick Doyle's magnificent musical score, which has a grandeur and intensity that no later Marvel film has matched (yes, including Avengers Endgame. I mean it.) It baffles me why it wasn't used more in the later films. The big payoff scene with Thor's (apparent) death and resurrection, when I first saw it in the theater all those years ago, was electrifying. There he is, riding the storm and taking on the invincible Destroyer (who by the way was comic-book accurate, beautifully rendered). It worked so well, first because the victory was earned (we've watched hero mature and become someone truly worthy of wielding Mjolnir), next because of the striking visuals, and next because of that pulsing music. There's little else in the Marvel movies that equals this scene, except maybe the inspired rendition of that rainbow Bifrost bridge. And Asgard as a whole.I downgrade my rating just a little to a mainly because the three sidekicks Fandral, Hogun, and Volstagg aren't terribly well used (and they are similarly kind of useless in the Thor comics too). Sif (Jaimie Alexander) has a lot more promise, but was repeatedly underused here and in the later films (in the real Norse mythology, Sif is Thor's wife -- that was too much to swallow, I guess).Amyway - enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Still my favorite Thor movie, and The best movie in the Thor series IMO","Upon revisiting Thor, a childhood classic of mines directed by Kenneth Branagh, I find it mesmerizing how this film not only launched the beloved Norse god into the Marvel Cinematic Universe but also set a distinct tone and style that has largely influenced my perception of the character ever since. As a film that I fondly remember watching in theaters as a seven-year-old, it has slowly matured into one of my favorite entries in the MCU.One of the standout features of Thor is its impeccable soundtrack by Patrick Doyle. The score is grand and sweeping, embodying the epic nature of Thor's journey while perfectly enhancing the film's emotional beats. It's orchestral and rich, capturing the majesty of Asgard and the weightiness of Thor's personal growth. It is the kind of music that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.Branagh's direction deeply resonates throughout the film, adopting a Shakespearean style that elevates the narrative. The more mature and serious tone sets it apart from other MCU films, lending a gravity to Thor's internal conflicts and familial relationships. Anthony Hopkins delivers a masterful performance as Odin, encapsulating the complexity of a father who is both protective and authoritative. His portrayal brings a gravitas that adds layers to the film's dynamics.Tom Hiddleston shines in his role as Loki, showcasing a natural charm and charisma that steals scenes effortlessly. His performance is multifaceted, mixing earnestness with mischief, making the God of Mischief one of the most compelling characters in the MCU. The chemistry between Thor and Loki is palpable, giving a rich backstory that resonates throughout the series.The visuals of Asgard are absolutely stunning, allowing viewers to be enthralled by the majestic landscapes and impressive architecture that reflect the mythic tales of Norse mythology. Each scene transported me to this otherworldly realm, making Asgard feel alive and inviting.One of the most unique aspects of the film is Thor's poetic style of speaking, which sets him apart from his MCU counterparts. His dialogue feels imbued with a sense of duty and nobility that enriches his character's journey from arrogance to humility.However, a minor downside pertains to the depiction of Thor's banishment to Earth. I wish there had been more scenes dedicated to Thor's exploration and understanding of human life. The opportunity for transformation is heavily present but feels underexplored. As a viewer, I wanted to see Thor engage in a more intimate way with Earth, fostering a deeper love and understanding of the world that he ultimately chose to protect.Overall, Thor holds a special place in my heart and stands as a testament to what could have been for the character in future films. Branagh's Shakespearean and Norse-inspired direction established a mature tone that I believe should have been the guiding principle for all subsequent Thor films. This film's blend of grandeur, depth, and heart ensures its place among my favorite MCU films, and it continues to resonate with me, shaping my perspective on this iconic character. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I loved it with a few exceptions.,"I did really like this movie, and appreciate the actors and the story. It's the first of the. Marvel universe that I watched, and I did not grow up reading the comics. Overall, it was an interesting story and gave a great background to Thor's and Loki's relationship. The reason for giving it an 8 is that Natalie Portman and that child who played ""Darcy"" were pretty bad. Jane was relevant to the movie, but it didn't come across as a major role because Portman is not strong. I've see her in the Star Wars movies and I can't watch them again because of her. I loved her when she was younger, but now she just sleepwalks through her parts. As for that Darcy character, she was totally irrelevant and could have or should have been left out. I hated that child's voice, her smirky face, her stupid comments that she thought were funny. So basically, she was a thorn in the side of this. It was even more disturbing to see that girl in the Dark World, just a waste of dialogue and camera presence.

"Keep the camera straight, Kenneth.","Kenneth Branagh is a good director, but the acclaimed thespian probably wasn't the best choice to direct Marvel's 'Thor'. His choice to have almost every single shot on a canted angle is extremely annoying and it gives the film a monotonous feeling. If every shot is tilted, none of them are. The bland screenplay and characters don't help either, as they are the thing that really makes this film boring. The attempts at humour fall flat, yet the film is unintentionally funny on several occasions due to how some serious moments are over-done to the point of feeling parody-like. Saying that, the film isn't terrible; there are some enjoyable action sequences, the score by Patrick Doyle is pretty catchy and the overall message of the film is a good one, even if it is a bit poorly handled. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than it had the right to be...,"3D Blu-Review... Marvel has given us a plethora of great entertainment the last few years leading up to the ""The Avengers"" last summer, part of that was introducing us to Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger the year before that. Both movies are available in 3-D, and the films actually both good as far as movies go, differ in the 3-D arena drastically. Thor tells us the story of the Norse god himself, living in Asgard, a beautiful world ran by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) father, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and protected by Thor, his friends, and Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). After a break in to the kingdom by what appears to be their old foes the Frost Giants, Thor and his entourage seek revenge for the invasion. Odin thwarts war just in time, and in turn banishes Thor to Earth, hoping he may learn a thing or two about becoming a King, and earn his rightful place on the throne. In the meantime Loki seems to be responsible for the events and is stirring up trouble behind the scenes, leading to Odin falling into a coma, and Loki taking the throne of Asgard.On Earth Thor keeps running into a few scientists, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who were chasing a storm that seemed to include Thor inside. Thor's friends start to smell something foul and question Loki, and try to find their friend on Earth. The climax ramps up and the action is well paced. Director Kenneth Branagh does good with the ""Aquaman"" of the Marvel Universe. I never felt Thor needed his own film, but it works.What doesn't work so well in this film is the 3-D. It is very difficult to make out anything in any of the darker scenes. Some scenes work, but for the most part the 3-D presentation is lackluster at best.

Best actor among Oscar winners:  Stan the Man !,"This forgettable piece of junk had one bright moment - the ebullient Stan Lee in a cameo as a truck driver. Now on to the bad stuff: everything else.STORY: Probably solid as conceived by J Michael Straczynski. Definitely ruined by the credited scripters. Because ...SCRIPT: Anyone who talks or writes knows to get your point across in as few words as necessary. Early on, Odin instructs his sons that although they do not seek war, ""we have to be ready for it"". A more regal, adult response would have been: ""we have to be prepared"". Odin words sounded like they were written by (or for) 10-year-olds. Sorry if this sounds nitpicky, but it was an indicator of the wretched mess of dialogue for the next two hours.ACTING: Tom Hiddleston(Loki) seemed to try a bit; everyone else phoned it in. There is not a drop of emotion in evidence anywhere.ART DIRECTION: Fake-looking all around - from the New Mexico town to Asgard and beyond. The Frost Giants and Destroyer were no better executed than what you find in a movie-of-the-week on the ScyFy Channel, maybe worse. And whose idea was it to make Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, a pavement of fiber-optic Lucite?!! Unbelievably bad. Only one person can take credit for that, and he is ...KENNETH BRANAUGH (DIRECTOR): He has to be the weak link here. Too bad because he seems like a nice guy.FINAL COMMENT: The story draws on Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's origin of THOR (Marvel version, of course) from 1968 - issues #158 and #159. The two comic greats had applied their cookie-cutter morality play to THOR, as they had to their other creations - Spiderman, Iron Man, Dr Strange to name a few - that of a self-absorbed individual gaining a conscience and becoming a hero. As usual, it was done to perfection every time. I still get a lump in my throat every time I re-read Spiderman's or Thor's origin. (And all done in 20-pages or less!)

Thor (2011),"This film takes viewers on a thrilling ride through both Asgard and Earth, with breathtaking visual effects that bring the ancient, fantastical world of Asgard to life. The contrast between the majestic landscapes of Asgard and the grounded, everyday setting of Earth creates a dynamic backdrop for the action. Hemsworth's Thor, banished to Earth as a mortal, must navigate a world unfamiliar to him while learning critical lessons about responsibility, sacrifice, and the importance of teamwork.Natalie Portman's performance as Jane Foster adds emotional depth, providing Thor with a human connection that further grounds his character. The supporting cast, including Tom Hiddleston as the enigmatic Loki, adds layers of complexity to the story, with performances that enhance the film's central themes of family, loyalty, and destiny. Branagh's direction expertly balances moments of humor, drama, and spectacle, creating a well-rounded superhero film that feels both grand and intimate.The action sequences are visually impressive, particularly the thrilling moments when Thor wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir. But beyond the spectacle, the movie's heart lies in Thor's character evolution, which makes him a hero we can root for.

Thor - 7.7/10,"1. Overall Plot - 10/10
I love the idea of Thor losing everything he has and becoming mortal. I think it is a great way to have an arrogant, full of himself, wanna be king. To becoming a true hero who really cares about people and would do anything to save them. I also love the story about Thor's family and his relationship with them.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 7/10
There is a reason that this movie is under two hours. But in this case, I think it's a good thing. If it was longer, it would get boring. But it's not longer. So it keeps you entertained throughout.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 9/10
I think the emotion portrayed in this movie is very good. It shows Thor's relationships and love to other characters. You really feel for Thor as he grows and develops as a character.This movie does a good job making you invested in the outcome. It makes you want to actually care about the characters and how they turn out.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 8/10
This movie could have lots of good themes. But I think it is about becoming a worthy and great leader for your people. And this fits very well for Thor's character as he is about to become king of Asgard.This movie is super deep. It goes into the backstory of Thor, Odin, and Loki, and their relationships with people. It gives each character a great introduction and depth to them.5. Characters - 8/10
I love all the characters in this. The choice of main and side characters are very good.Thor's character development is very, very good. I love how he goes from an obnoxious, full of himself, kid, to becoming a real king for his people. He learns humility, and humanity. Loki's character development and establishment is also very good. You understand and learn how he acts, and what his relationships are like. We learn why he choices to do the things he does, and why he feels the way he does.I like the inclusion of more Shield characters as well. Like Agent Coulson some more, and the introduction of Clint Barton.I don't really like the Jane Foster character though. She is what is stopping this from being a ten. She just seems like the usual love interest. There is nothing that really makes me like the character. And same with Darcy. She is just annoying all the time.6. Acting / Writing - 7/10
Nothing extraordinary. But still pretty good. Chris Hemsworth is very good to be Thor. He looks just like the character, and plays him very well in a way that shows how Thor really feels about things.I do really like the writing of all the dialog with Odin and other characters. The way he talks to Thor and Loki is cool, and he truly seems like Odin, protector of the nine realms. Natalie Portman isn't the best at acting in this. She either seems to always either be over or under acting. But it isn't too bad.7. Cinematography - 3/10
I do not like the cinematography in this movie. For whatever reason, anytime it's a closeup, or a wide shot, it's completely diagonal. The whole shot is just filmed super diagonal, almost sideways. I really don't see why they did this at all, but it's terrible to watch.On a few shots the do almost a quick zoom in on characters, that doesn't look good either. It is almost filmed like an animation or anime is. And I don't like that at all.8. Score - 4/10
I couldn't even tell you how the music goes in this movie, right after watching it. Nothing crazy while watching it either. But don't get me wrong, it wasn't super bad, just nothing cool or special.9. Editing / Pace - 7/10
The editing is nothing crazy or memorable. I do like the wide shots that aren't diagonal though. I think the establishing shots of Asgard, that show the whole place are very cool.This movie is paced very well. It is a shorter movie with less than a two hour run time, but I think it's the perfect length. Any longer it would be too slow and boring a movie. But with the pacing it has, it keeps you engaged between the action and slower dialog parts.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 7/10
The effects in this movie are pretty good. The CGI is very good and looks very real. Some of the practical effects when mixed with some CGI is kinda cheesy. What stood out to me the most as cheesy is the frost giants.Average Score:
7/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
7.7/10
I really, really love the idea of Thor becoming mortal and having to learn to be humble. I think it is very cool to show how he is learning to become the king of Asgard. And his relationship with his family is shown well. I love how Loki stays true to his character, and shows jealousy, and just wants to be the king of Asgard also.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Awesomeness!,"By far one of the best movies I've ever seen. Very fun, the visuals and effects are INCREDIBLE, the casting is perfect, and I laughed quite a bit. I saw this three times in the theater! I never do that! Can't wait for the Avengers!I love how, at the end of the credits, they always have a small glimpse into the next movie! In Captain America, they gave the first preview for The Avengers. Really looking forward to all of those awesome characters coming together! I'm not sure which is my absolute favorite, Iron Man is a genius, Thor is just....... awesome, Captain America is a wonderful person. I'm going to have to do a Marvel marathon before I see The Avengers!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor's debut is huge.,"I was a big comic book fan when I was growing up. My years covered from about 1974 to 1992. I was about seven years old when I started my collection, so I feel I have a good perspective on Thor. From his start in 1962 and for most of the 60s and 70s Thor seemed like a character that couldn't find his footing. He even had a rocky start. His first 45 issues were in a comic that didn't even include his name in the title, although the last 20 issues did say, ""with the Mighty Thor"". Many fans and critics had weird theories that he was a snob, or a hippy or even gay, because of the long hair. He was even mocked by various characters in the comics, being called Goldilocks or having characters, like Spiderman, make fun of his Norse dialect. I mean, come on, he is the God of Thunder. He is the Marvel version of Superman in some ways. This guy deserved respect. He would finally get a face lift in the 80s when legendary comic book creator Walt Simonson revolutionized his character and made him cool and since the 80s he has gone through more face lifts, reboots and upgrades that made him more appealing to a wider audience.Now that Marvel has finally figured out how to bring their characters to the silver screen, here in the 21st century, it is Thor's turn. In the early days of Thor the character was actually a human male named Donald Blake, who stumbles across an ancient cane, that when tapped on the ground turns him into the God of Thunder. That is a major part of the character that has been changed in these reboots of the past few decades. There is no Donald Blake anymore, just Thor, but one other character that has stood the test of times, along with Thor, is Blake's/Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, and this is where the film begins.Jane (Natalie Portman) is a scientist studying astro-anomalies in the New Mexico desert when, what looks like a wormhole opens up and drops in her lap the God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth), or at least, the mortal version of him. We are then treated to a flashback, of sorts, of how Thor got to Earth, which opens up depicting Thor in his native Asgard, being crowned as the successor to the King's throne, by his father Lord Odin (Anthony Hopkins), but danger lurks in the form of the bad guys led by Thor's conniving brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). As tensions mount, Thor disobeys his father's orders and is banished to Earth. It is here where we see the convergence of the two worlds and the two plot lines. Thor begins to learn the lessons that all mortals do, while Loki conspires to destroy him back in Asgard.Director, Kenneth Branagh spins a wonderful film that is very loyal to the comic book mythos of Thor, while not keying in on the glints of silliness that turned some fans off from the character throughout his 50 year evolution. Chris Hemsworth does an excellent job following Branagh's direction. The story is nicely built and the action and comic book styling is top notch. The character development creates a wonderful connection between Odin and his two sons. What I have really enjoyed about the Marvel movies are two things. First off, it is always fun to watch a Marvel film, especially in the past decade, because everybody in the theater hangs around through the entire final credits, patiently waiting for a tiny scene at the end of the credits, depicting either a tease of a possible sequel situation or some kind of finality associated with the film's plot. The other thing I love about the Marvel movies is their desire to bring their characters together as quickly as possible. Marvel never had the fear of crossing their characters over in the comics, from issue to issue, title to title and creating more of a universe than just a bunch of story lines. DC Comics relied more heavily on self contained titles and stories.This film and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), ends one giant plot arc. A plot arc that started back in 2008's Iron Man and ended with Joss Whedon's super team film, the Avengers (2012). Anyway, Thor is a standup film and mimics why the Marvel Universe is the best. It gives you that jolt of fantasy, while still holding on to reality, or at least, the closest thing to reality that a comic book could provide. I also was impressed with Hiddleston's depiction of Loki and I could watch Natalie Portman all day. The character development is quite good and the spots of humor are sprinkled in quite nicely. A nice edition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.8.6 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Epic Adventure Filled with Action and Humor,"If you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then you won't want to miss ""Thor."" This epic adventure follows the powerful Norse god as he battles to save his home world of Asgard from destruction.Chris Hemsworth delivers a standout performance as Thor, exuding both strength and vulnerability as he grapples with his own identity and struggles to prove his worthiness to wield his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir. Tom Hiddleston also shines as Loki, Thor's mischievous and complex brother.But what really sets ""Thor"" apart is its perfect blend of action and humor. Director Kenneth Branagh expertly balances intense fight scenes with witty one-liners and comedic moments, making for a truly enjoyable movie-going experience.The stunning visuals and impressive special effects only add to the film's appeal, transporting viewers to the fantastical world of Asgard and beyond.Overall, ""Thor"" is a must-see for Marvel fans and anyone who loves a good action-adventure movie. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you wanting more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Now I remember why I despise fantasy films,"So why do I hate this film? Let me count the ways:1- the most ridiculous love relationship I've seen: Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman - he is a big massive brute and she is an unconvincing Astrophysicist (or whatever) - it is more likely that Homer Simpson would be a scientist than this twit. She and Chris Hemsworth were ridiculous together2- Anthony Hopkins!!! Please say it ain't so! The actor who is the brilliant Hannibal Lechter sporting an eye patch (how is it held on by the way - bubble gum?) and delivering scintillating lines like - to Thor (after he has impetuously and ill advisedly bulled his way thru every situation) - Hopkins: ""You'll be a wise KIng!"" Are you kidding? - have you been asleep? Are you on drugs? - a wise King? I laughed out loud. Anthony you should be ashamed - maybe you needed the money3- Actually this is the one reason I liked the movie - Thor's brother Loki wears headgear that is a dead ringer for the big bunny in Donnie Darko. It is hilarious - now if they had only done it on purpose (I can only dream)check it out: google ""Donnie Darko bunny mask""4- Loki's laser sword - which shot bolts of something - but I have to remember this is fantasy & that kind of thing happens all the time (wonder if his lance is listed on the USML?)So what did I like? (after all I gave it a 2) 1- The giant destroyer sent to eliminate this unfortunate town and Thor - was pretty cool - not even a lance through the neck slowed him down 2- Heimdall is a cool guy, although not very good at his job - people are going thru the gate like terrorists through the metal detector in the opening of Airplane - and Heimdall barely has a clue - but he is coolSo why did I even watch this? Our church has film clips right before the sermon - and Heimdall in Thor: The Dark World was on the clip. For those of you who have seen it, it is the scene where he senses the invisible ships getting past the gate & he leaps into the air to spear the invisible ship. (I know, you had to have seen it to appreciate it.) But it was pretty good - and made me think maybe I would like this series. And then I saw Thor 1.I can only hope that I will be a ""wise King"" and stay away from Thor 2. Pray for me. DonB",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lots and Lots of Action,"This movie is all about action, and the writers did a fine job, I have to say, including tons of action in a way that draws your mind away from all your troubles. There is a light love theme, which I feel is very nice, just the right amount. The movie starts out very well, with a slight flash of the future. I was, I admit, a little disappointed that there was only one enemy, but this movie is not just about the ""almighty Thor"" battling enemies, which would have made the movie extremely dumb. As I recall my memories of the movie, for some reason, I don't know where the action was, aside from the battle with Thor and an Iron Giant, and Thor and his friends against the Ice Giants. The way the producers made the show is incredible, squeezing so much action into an hour and fifteen minute film, and make it interesting. This movie is incredibly fast-paced, and some people might have a hard time following it, but I'll give you a hint, this show is a movie that you really have to relax, and not think about anything in order to understand it. Because it's fast-paced, you probably won't remember your questions anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Quick and Fun Marvel Entertainment,","Thor is a brilliant movie with a great storyline and a very talented cast that all suit their characters perfectly.It isn't Marvel's greatest work,but I found it nowhere near disappointing,Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice for Thor,and I also really liked Natalie Portman,a very attractive and talented actress,and Tom Hiddleston performance as Loki is very inspired.I really liked the references to other Marvel character references,especially the scene where Agent Coulson is asked if a machine was 'one of Stark's guys' and he replies that Tony Stark never tells him anything,and I also liked Stan Lee and Samuel L Jackson's cameo.Thor is a must see for all Marvel fans.After causing a war on his planet Asgard,Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent away by his powerful father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).His brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) takes over the throne Thor was meant to have,only to go mad with his power and go against his family and friends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Whosoever holds this hammer...,"Growing up, I was a huge Thor fan. It was my favorite comic book. I never came across anybody else who liked it that much though. Over the years as more comic movies started being made, I held out hope maybe one day Thor would be brought to the big screen in a respectable movie. Finally that happened with Kenneth Branagh's Thor. This is an excellent movie with drama, romance, humor, and action. It's quite simply one of the best Marvel has put out so far and a personal favorite of mine. For comic fans, yes they change a few things but they keep the heart of the story and characters intact. As one lifelong Thor fan, I have no complaints. He's a character many said for years would be impossible to sell a movie about. But those people have been proved wrong. There's not much else I can add except to echo the sentiments of many other reviewers that the cast is great, the special effects are solid, and the story is smart and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Scandinavian outerspace.,"Thor introduce us a weird vision of the universe and its history. The main story seems too simple, however, the movie works and it does because of the incredible personification of Thor, provided by Chris Hemsworth. Now though, there are no epic battles,and there were no sense of climax. The cast could have been better, since I hated Natalie Portman perform and Stellan Skasgård does terrible, and Anthony Hopkins is boring. And come on we are talking about scandinavian culture, vikings, you can't put an asian face as one of them. Thor does not succeed on becoming a great hero movie, but the enchanting Thor might get you watching it to the end.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Childish He-Man gets scolded by daddy...,"...and loses his privileges and favourite toy.There starts the saga of one of the most boring Marvel characters, and a very mediocre movie.Disney-Marvel surprises me everytime, with those empty movies that people adore but that I see as two hours (and sometimes more) long nu metal videoclips for a braindead audience.How do people enjoy this?Thor was bland, savourless, with sub-par technique. Nathalie Portmanteau was even able to be worst an actress than in Star Wars, and THAT was something. Chris Hemsworthnaught is equal to himself, showing muscles and looking like a surfer, but nothing worth calling acting.There's little to no plot, the montage seems like straight from the Adventures of Hercules, the music is pretty much the same that in every supe movie...That mess was, of course, a big success and spawned two sequels.I hope that, someday, Disney-Marvel will have to answer for what they do to cinema.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining Superhero Escapism,"Kenneth Branagh directed this badboy and some may know him for his more Shakespearian fare but this is mainstream cinema through and through. This story begins with a man falling to Earth and being found by Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) an ambitious scientist and her co-scientists Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgård) & Darcy Lewis(Kat Dennings). We then go back in time to find out how this event came about as we are transported to the wonderful looking world of Asgard, a realm in space where super beings live and who were once honoured as gods by us mere humans. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) dishonours his father Odin(Anthony Hopkins) by breaking the fragile peace that is held with an old enemy through his ignorance, pride and thirst for a fight. He is then banished to Earth without his powers.The beings from Asgard live what we would describe as a more traditional ancient life with appropriate customs and the clash of these realities creates several humorous results which is part of the charm of this film. A solid cast with a script that isn't overcomplicated and provides some laughs combined with acting that could have easily been overdone and some amazingly lavish special affects notably the realm of Asgard create a movie that will keep you entertained for it's duration. What we got here is a beautiful leading man and leading lady so eye candy is provided here for all plus an entertaining and visually rich film. This is by no means unmissable fare but seriously how many movies really are?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor🔥,"This is a very captivating blend of action, humor, and heartfelt moments that introduces audiences to the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth delivers a powerful performance, perfectly capturing Thor's journey from arrogance to humility. The stunning visuals and epic battles are complemented by a rich mythology, making Asgard a truly enchanting realm. The supporting cast, including Natalie Portman and Tom Hiddleston, adds depth to the story, enhancing the emotional stakes. Director Kenneth Branagh masterfully balances drama and comedy, resulting in a film that's both entertaining and thought provoking. A must watch for Marvel fans and newcomers alike!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Save your popcorn,"This movie is less a saga than a facile riddle scrawled by a child's crayon across the dignity of ancient cultures. Its most redeeming feature is that it raises the credibility and watch-worthiness of such gods-and-humans flicks a ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief."" The humans, including Natalie Portman, who is capable of SO much better work, were meek and unconvincing even when shrieking, or proclaiming their commitment to saving each other (or the planet). There was more real emotion in Anthony Hopkins' single tear than in the remaining 99.8% of the movie.That said, this film is eye candy of the most obvious sort and it gets its points for prettiness. The Rainbow Bridge mechanism verges on Steampunk, a plus in my book. Good gods live in golden halls (and have blond hair), while bad monsters live in bleak, dark worlds and have gray/black skin (or dark hair). It's symbolism with a sledgehammer here, folks, and surprisingly lacking in subtlety for a director like Kenneth Branagh.Branagh's credit helps explain the mishmash of Shakespearean and Greek tropes imperfectly overlaid on the Norse mythology, like melted milk chocolate drizzled on a grilled trout.Yeah - not worth watching unless you really, truly, have nothing better to do.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
