"2,5 hours of good entertainment.","I've read the book, and the movie's not so bad. Obviously there are many things I'd do different, but in the end it's 2,5 hours of good entertainment, and isn't that what the ratings are all about? Personally I think Tom Hanks wasn't passionate enough for Robert Langdon. That's why it's not a 9 for me.A lot of people are too harsh on this one. Mostly because they know the book and have very high expectations. I have to see my first book-to-film where the film is better.Also, you're not going to hell for watching this movie or reading the book. It's based on a novel, which is based on a few loose theories, but in the end all it wants to do is to entertain. And that is exactly what both the book and the movie did for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Da Vinci Unworthy of Negative Hype,"Last Tuesday, when The Da Vinci Code premiered at the Cannes Film festival, it was met with a chilly reception from the reviewing elite. It has been called ""plodding,"" ""stale,"" and ""uninspired,"" thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....First, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.Having said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.If you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called ""overly-long exposition"" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.Critics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.I think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.In short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the ""truth"", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.If you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.The bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.My advice: go see for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
better than many critics have given it credit for,"From the way the critics have gone after ""The Da Vinci Code,"" you'd think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.As a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"" certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they've paid good money to receive.It would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since ""Gone With the Wind."" Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man's granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.Despite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say ""unprecedented"" - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn't being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer's 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.The movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a ""Golly, gee, could it mean_______?"" attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it's the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.Tom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.The religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn't have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.The rest of us can appreciate ""The Da Vinci Code"" for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the ""Gone With the Wind"" of whodunits.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Actually a clever film, flawed it is, but it is criticised way too unfairly","This was much better than I expected, and it is far from the worst film ever made. My dad loved the book, and he thinks the film did it justice, and at 17 I liked it. Though with all the different views on Christianity and the complicated plot, it is confusing and convoluted. The dialogue is a little clunky, the violence like the whipping quite disturbing, and the direction perhaps too leisurely. But this is compensated by the splendid locations, especially Paris itself, and the music by Hans Zimmer was very nice, if not his best work. The acting was pretty decent, though all have given better performances, and this includes Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou in the leads. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany are pretty solid, but it is Ian McKellan, who is a great actor and rarely disappoints in anything he's in, who gives the best performance of the film. All in all, a good film, though it could have been better. It was cleverly constructed though confusing, and it is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The standard 'not as good as the book' applies here.,"I can't say I was blown away by The Da Vinci Code - as is often the  case, the book was far superior. I generally like Tom Hanks in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  Robert Langdon should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to Hanks occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.  The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - Paul  Bettany is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  Silas to utter perfection. Sir Ian McKellan too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  Audrey Tautou is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played Bezu Fache - Jean Reno was made for the role.  As you'd expect from a Ron Howard Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. Langdon's ""Godspeed"" caused me to  awake in the night sweating!   I am a fairly harsh marker on the IMDb, so don't be put off by a 6 out  of 10 - I did enjoy the movie, but my anticipation was so great with  this film, that it could never live up to my expectation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sorry but I liked it.,"People seem to hate this movie for some reason, and I remember when it came out, it was really controversial in that it got many bad reviews.However, years later around three years ago I caught it for the first time on basic cable, and I honestly didn't see what all the criticism was for. Not only was it immersive and intriguing, for the most part, but it had a pretty powerful ending and reveal at the end. It isn't great, so maybe the hype was what triggered so many negative reviews, but it also isn't bad.I never read the whole book, but understood the premise. If you really want to enjoy this film, you probably should set the book aside and set beside any offense you may take as to the religious conjecture, and just view it as a mystery movie in and of itself. I really enjoyed the ending- the whole final fifteen minutes or so.7.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The reviews were right...,"As much as I love conspiracies, Hans Zimmer and the usual ... It's hard to give this movie a score beyond 5 or 6. I understand what they tried to do, but the delivery didn't cut it. There is a mismatch between the level required to produce such a movie, and the level used by the production. I was skeptical about the reviews at first, but they were right. From the first few dialogues, we notice the incoherence, weakness and predictability of the script. Honestly it's borderline cringy. The same goes for the story. It's just too predictable and too simplistic. The protagonists find all the clues effortlessly and solve them too easily. All in all, the viewer does not get attached the any of the characters and has trouble being immersed into the movie...Sigh. Too bad. I'll just give it a 6 because it did leave us with a controversy at the end that is not forgotten to this day. Even if this stuff isn't real, it could have been done much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's time to crack the code,"Exceptional effort by Tom Hanks, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a real gem, a mystery of the best kind that deserves all the accolades that has been bestowed upon it.A long film that could be described as an epic, the action is non stop and seems crazy to be two and a half hours in length, when it feels much-much quicker and shorter; that is testament to its quality, that such a long runtime seems nowhere near that.The acting is good across the board, the best of which is Hanks who shows his acting chops brilliantly, and he is surrounded by an accomplished cast where there isn't a single weak link between them.Books that are adapted into the film medium can sometimes be a bit hit and miss, and sometimes shaky, but this adaptation of Dan Brown's hit has translated wonderfully onto film and is probably better than the book itself, something that doesn't happen too often.""The Da Vinci Code"" is the first in a trilogy of films based on Dan Brown's books, and I must say the best of the three, easily (the other two being ""Angels & Demons"" and ""Inferno"").",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best movie critic is YOU,"So I suggest not writing this off as a Hollywood hack film, simply because it's the bandwagon thing to do. Before you go and see The Da Vinci Code, let all the negative and positive hype surrounding this production cancel each other out, clear your mind, and judge this film fairly. Do NOT judge it on its usually weak director, do NOT judge it entirely on the source material and do NOT judge it on your religious beliefs. All this will be rewarding.I have not read the book so I will not attempt any kind of comparison.Plot essentially goes like this: In the middle of the night, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned as an expert to a crime scene in Le Louvre where a terrible murder has been committed. The victim's body is self-placed in such a bizarre, symbolic way next to one of the world's most famous paintings that the investigation gradually unlocks age-old mysteries that many do not wish to be unlocked.The Da Vinci Code is a chilling, thrilling and well-sewn together mystery thriller that often keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast do not disappoint either. Paul Bettany is genuinely creepy as Silas and thereby reinforces the stereotype that all albinos are evil. While Audrey Tatou is annoyingly frail as Sophie Neveu, she is captivating and lovely and is able to project both charisma and presence on screen in this film. However, Tom Hanks did not at all feel like the protagonist in the story and I am unaware whether that was intentional or not but I'm guessing no, in which case Hanks definitely fails in both attracting and keeping our interest.So the cast usually perform well (with the exception of Hanks) and the story is also facilitated by some very striking visuals. A big plus for this film which elevates it slightly above generic formula is its beautiful locations often seen through epic aerial shots. Good call, Howard! Another big plus is its distinctly Euro-centric feel in both style and substance. This surprised me since it is Tom Hanks and Ron Howard in the same film, but they do manage to keep the overblown Hollywood clichés to a minimum. This is even apparent in the score by Hans Zimmer; it is not overblown, but subtle and appropriate in the scenes to which it was scored. Similarly, Frenchmen do not speak English with a French accent when they were alone together, but speak in French. That said, the plot does unfold in a somewhat Hollywood fashion -- and the plot happens to be thinner than an Olsen twin.To counter the good parts, two big minuses in The Da Vinci Code are its wooden and sometimes even placeholder dialogue and its distinct lack of humor. I felt the actors were much too serious for this kind of film, which is first and foremost an adventure story, fast-paced and constantly unlocking new mysteries. The issues in the film were serious enough and needed more comedy to balance them.As I write this review, more and more bad points about it spring to mind. This is strange, since I remember sitting in the cinema with my friends just a few hours ago and being thoroughly entertained and captivated by the whole thing. So, never mind the occasionally insultingly far-fetched plot and plot-twists by Dan Brown; The Da Vinci Code is a nicely done and very entertaining film in which nothing feels missing or incomplete.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Da Vinci Code,"The controversy surrounding The Da Vinci Code hardly needs to be introduced. It seemed that very few people were actually going to give the film the benefit of the doubt, while most would criticize it before seeing it. Of course, many more of these critics had not read the book either, and so were pleasantly ignored by the 60 million and more people who went out and bought the book.When I read the book, I accepted it for what it was  a pulp novel. The kind of book you take on holiday to read while you're at the airport. It wasn't wholly convincing, but I thought it was great fun to read, and very cinematic in style. The writing wasn't classic, but the pace of the novel was such that these points could be overlooked. It wasn't surprising that a film would be made given the book's success and despite initial critical reaction what we are given is, while not perfect, a solid adaptation of the book that will at least give the audience plenty of food for thought.This is no National Treasure though. If you're looking for adventure and daring action then look to that film. This is a different beast, instead preferring the slow build up approach to story-telling - it is to the mystery/thriller genre what V for Vendetta is to the action genre. Most of the important parts of the book are when the characters are sat around a table talking. This immediately doesn't sound like it could translate to the screen that effectively, but there are enough nice touches to keep the audience interested.First of all, the story itself, whilst not necessarily historically accurate, it is still absorbing and it genuinely makes you wonder about the truth behind the religion. There are also some nice visual flairs, including some well shot flashbacks, and the way Robert Langdon (Hanks) visualises the unscrambling of the codes is a great way to show the inner workings of is mind. At first it may seem silly but there is very little choice as to how to portray someone thinking. Hanks himself is passable in the role, but is not really given anything meaty to do. However, the same can be said of a lot of the cast, and this is purely down to the fact that the plot is moving too fast, and giving out too much information, to be able to dive into character exposition. Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing is wonderful as a slightly eccentric English Grail expert, and gives a lively performance, which helps considerably given that most of his role is to explain everything to Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Tautou). Paul Bettany plays against type to play the murderous monk Silas, and he will make you wince with his self-flagellation scenes. The other cast members are all satisfactory but nothing special, again because of the speed of the story.There are a couple of chase scenes which are supposed to be tense, but they turn out rather lacklustre, and one scene near the end comes off as daft (no spoilers, but people get saved by a pigeon, of all things!). The plot may be hard to follow at times, especially if you haven't read the book, so full attention will be needed; however, if you have read the book, the film sticks very closely to the story, omitting some parts for timing reasons, and it is now that we realise why the Da Vinci Code is how it is  the film-makers couldn't do much else with it, as the tone and content of the book has to be retained for it to be a faithful translation: what suffers in the book suffers in the film.Overall, The Da Vinci Code is worth seeing, if only to see what all the fuss was about. If I was the Catholic Church, though, I would be more concerned with the religious violence portrayed in the film than with the outcome of the plot, which can try all it likes to challenge established dogma but most likely won't succeed because people know the book and film are fiction. Keep that it mind when you see it  don't take it literally and chances are you will enjoy it that much more. At two and a half hours it is a tad too long, and can be confusing to first time viewers, but it is definitely thought provoking, and a mostly worthy adaptation of the book.Rated: 7/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could have been better... Should have been better.,"If you take the most popular book in recent years, you should have the most popular movie since The Lord of the Rings, right? Wrong. Though the film was hotly debated, its cinematic quality and popularity aren't nearly as high as one would expect. Amid protests, pending lawsuits, and outright denouncements by Catholic officials, Ron Howard released his adaptation of Dan Brown's novel, The Da Vinci Code.American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) are on a trans-European quest to solve riddles left by Louvre curator, Langdon's hero and Neveu's grandfather, Jacques Saunier, as he lay dying. The riddles and subsequent quest allegedly lead to the true identity and whereabouts of the famed Holy Grail. Hot in pursuit of the thinking man's Bonnie and Clyde is Javert-ian French police captain Bezu Feche (Jean Reno), intent on pinning the murder of Suanier on Langdon and Neveu, and albino monk, Silas (Paul Bettany) under the command of a mysterious telephone voice known only as The Teacher.With a pedigree such as the most popular book in the world, two Academy Award winners (Hanks, Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman), French film superstars (Tautou and Reno) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen), you'd wonder how such a film could fail.Well, how about the miscast of Howard as director. Howard lacks the vision to properly adapt the novel and bring it to life. Some of the blame does go to his Cinderella Man scribe Akiva Goldsman for not writing a fitting script. But Howard's awkwardness is more prominent. If we were going to pick name directors for this film, Steven Spielberg would have been better choice, but I think David Fincher (Se7en and Fight Club) would have been perfect.The whole production felt rushed. Having just read the book, a lot of plot points were fresh in my mind, and that may have clouded the comprehension of certain things, which I think Howard and Goldsman were counting on. Looking back on it, the first 30-45 minutes were very rushed, and I don't think things were adequately explained. They were still referenced and used in the movie, but not explained well. It suffered from the, what I call, Godfather syndrome: referencing things from the book at the wrong time. They could have taken their time with the film, and it would have told the same story, and been a lot better.Hanks was out of place as Landon, our hero. He doesn't have or project the same presence about him that Langdon should have. Might I suggest seasoned conspiracy theory veteran David Duchovny? As with Mission:Impossible:III, the supporting cast was impeccably put together, and the one true weakness of the cast is unfortunately the keystone (maybe it's just a bad year for actors named Tom).Slightly better than your average summer fair, but still doesn't hold up when put against the equally action oriented yet wholly more insightful X-Men franchise.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"A case of ""if you want the best experience, read the book""","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA curator is murdered in Paris's revered Louvre Museum. The French police, headed by Leutenant Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) call on the expertise of Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert in Pagan Symbols, when mysterious, blood-drenched patterns are found all over the body. However, Fache's suspicions of Robert have already been aroused and, unbeknownst to the professor, he's slipped a tracking device on him. Then Agent Nevu (Audrey Tautou) intervenes, springs him from the museum and begins a wild chase around Paris full of wild twists and turns. Robert learns the curator was Nevu's grand-father and was involved with a religious sect called The Priory of Sion. It all leads to a monk, Silas (Paul Bettany) sent by the religious sect of Opus Dei and the ultimate re-writing of history.There's nothing like controversy to get something talked about, and it seems the best results are when that controversy involves religion. Dan Brown's much talked about novel The Da Vinci Code set off much consternation by basically re-writing the bible- and now that controversy has been adapted to the big screen.The book suffered from trite dialogue but still managed to be a relentless page turner that fired at you with interesting fact after interesting fact and kept you on the edge of your seat till the last page. The film adaptation, then, is as good as can be expected. It's well cast. Tom Hanks is just the kind of lead you need for this kind of thing, but he's not at his best here. Jean Reno also has appeal as Captain Fache (strangely, though, I'd always pictured Michael Gambon in the role!) Tautou and Bettany are also very engaging in support but it's Ian McKellen who steals the show here as eccentric old grail enthusiast Sir Leigh Leabing, delivering the most spirited and compelling performance. And it has a reliable director in Ron Howard. But if you've read the book, the film offers little in the way of it's own variation on the story and pretty much just plays it like it was in the book, making it a bit of a dull and unsurprising thing after a while. If you haven't read the book, do so, it'll be much more rewarding. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: The Da Vinci Code,"This movie is becoming as controversial as the book. Since the day it was announced that it's gonna be made, there were protests against it being done, and it has escalated to calls for boycotting, or banning the movie altogether. I'll not waste time and go into its controversies, nor discuss what's real and what's not. Neither will I explain in detail the plot, as I believe most of you readers would already have some vague idea of what it's about, or have read the book, since it's on the bestsellers list for months.Rather, I'll evaluate the movie as it is, on how well it entertains. Those who wish to preach in my comment box, prepare to have those comments deleted, at my discretion. This is the stand I shall take, that this movie is entirely fictional, based on events which are used loosely, for the sole purpose of weaving a storyline that tries to be believable. I think some have already mentioned it's too successful in doing that, and may mislead people into thinking its theories presented, are real. However, don't take it too seriously, and if you wish to, use another proper platform to debunk the myths, not my movie review blog.The structure of the movie, is exactly the same as the book. There is no change to the ending, despite some rumours that it will be different. Naturally, some of the detailed explanation that's given in the book, especially many three-way dialogue between Sophie- Robert-Leigh, have to be summarized in order to pace this movie into 2 1/2 hours. Herein lies the challenges. For those who've read the book, the movie offers nothing new, other than the gratification of watching events and characters play out on the big screen. For those who haven't read the book, the movie version should be decent enough to make you want to pick up the novel and read more into the controversial theories explained.However, having being familiar with the plot and how the story unfolds, red herrings, character motivations, twists and all, it may leave those who've read the novel, a page-turner in every sense of the word, a bit wanting, that the pace could've been improved. Undoubtedly the pacing sags when it's time for some dialogue heavy moments, but I suppose that is unavoidable when you're revisiting material.However, its presentation of these controversial dialogue moments coupled with special effects, that will make you go wow. Truly, the technique is nothing original, and some of the visuals used looked like Return of the King and Kingdom of Heaven rejects, but as a whole, combined with the narrative, it helps to present the controversies in a more palatable manner.Casting, I felt, was spot on. Tom Hanks makes Robert Langdon pretty accessible, given Hanks' everyman demeanor, and Audrey Tautou makes a believable Sophie Neveu. Ian McKellen, probably THE actor with 2 summer blockbusters back to back (the other being X- Men 3), is convincing as the rich grail hunter Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany is chilling as the albino killer Silas, and Jean Reno and Alfred Molina round up the star studded cast as the detective Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa.Much is said about the haunting soundtrack, but as far as I'm aware, there's nothing scary about it. Silas, in his scene of self-cleansing, is horrid enough though, as are some scenes of unexpected on screen violence that hit like a sack of potatoes falling from the sky.In the end, in spite of all the controversies, perhaps Robert Langdon's line is poignant - if given a chance, would you rather destroy faith, or renew it? The book and the movie have provided an opportunity for the faith to renew itself, to debunk the myths and theories (which were developed loosely to make the story flow of course), and to generally point the curious to the direction and light the faith wants to show.Otherwise, this Ron Howard movie makes a good summer popcorn flick, with the usual thrills and spills you'd come to expect with its superb production values.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Misunderstood movie,"As Tom Hanks explained, ""The Da Vinci Code"" isn't a serious claim that catholicism is all made up through some dark conspiracy. It's merely a fun popcorn movie that's pointing out some interesting facts and intrigues with weird theories. A lot of people took it all way too seriously, when ""The Da Vinci Code"" is really only supposed to be entertaining. Then there's been talk that audiences at Cannes laughed at the movie's climax and thought it was ridiculous. Well, that's hardly Ron Howard's fault, is it? He could only stick to the existing novel. What did you expect? If you don't like the book, you're going to despise the movie even more.Now, that we've gotten this out of the way, let's talk about ""The Da Vinci Code"" as the nice little thriller it is. The movie has its shortcomings, that's undeniable. Even if you haven't read the book you'll notice that things seem a bit rushed. Screenwriters must have had a hard time cramming the most important facts of this rather thick novel into a movie with only 150 minutes running time. Most of the time characters blabber as if they had swallowed a lexicon. The whole cast does the best job possible, but lines like those can't be delivered naturally. Especially in the beginning the movie is slowed down by this blabbering until you are used to it and accept it.And yes, one has to say that the story is pretty unbelievable and almost laughable at times. It's not even hard to figure out the ending about half way through. Still, there are other movies in this genre that are a lot worse and just as far fetched (some John Grisham flicks come to mind). The problem is that people have been so hyped up, they expect something HUGE and exceptional, which this movie wasn't aimed for in the first place. If you just accept the fact, that this is not going to change your perception of life, then you're in for a very thrilling ride. Two and a half hours of pleasant entertainment, that's all there is to it.There's nothing special about ""The Da Vinci Code"": not the acting, not the story, certainly not the direction. If you hope for something mind blowing, you're searching in the wrong place. If you're offended by the movie's conspiracy theories, you're no better than Islamic fundamentalist threatening with violence because of some meaningless Mohammed cartoons. If none of this applies, you should have a good time with this motion picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great Movie... For Intelligent, Unbiased People","First off, I'd just like to say that this movie is based on a fictional story. FICTION. Why people need to express hatred over this because of their religious beliefs is so mind-boggling. No one is saying that Christianity is wrong, and that this story is right. The book is classified as FICTION, not THEOLOGY! I should also note that my extremely religious Christian friends don't find this movie at all ""disturbing"" or ""wrong"". The fact is that if you believe in something, nothing -- including a movie, or story -- should be able to deter you from that belief. If you feel threatened by this movie or any other story like this, you have serious problems regarding the foundations in which you believe.Now, to the review... I'm not here to give you any spoilers or story info, since that's all been done in the other reviews.I have never read the book. I went to see the movie with my boyfriend, who read the book recently, and some friends (one of whom has read the book at least twice, and is so into the story that he has researched the symbols and meanings thoroughly and participates in Da Vinci Code games, forums, etc). So we actually had at least 3 differing perspectives here.I really loved the film. Having no story to compare it to, I didn't feel like I had to have read the book to understand the story. Nothing felt missing or incomplete. I came out of the theater ready to add this list to my favorites, and wanting to read the book to compare it to the movie.My boyfriend also thought the film was great. He said they did a great job adapting the book to film, and although not everything was there, they did the best that they could with the time they had, and he was impressed.My friend was so excited throughout the movie, he kept wanting to talk to us about it. He pointed out some things from the book that weren't there as well, but he understood it couldn't all be there. He also said that watching the film put a new perspective for him on the movie, since he imagined things looking and feeling different in his head. Seeing the movie allowed him to look at it differently, which made it exciting all over again.So, in summary, this seems to be a great movie no matter how deep you are into the Da Vinci Code. I normally wait for movies to go on DVD to rent, but this is one that I'd recommend you see in the theater... the atmosphere makes it more fun and also you can talk about this with others after seeing it, instead of catching up to everyone later and possibly getting spoilers before you watch. Again, I highly recommend this movie! A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
References to England,"I live in England, and couldn't help notice every time we see a street shot of Hanks, in London, there's a big red phone box. Shortly before a big red bus drives past. Obviously, this is for the American audience, who believe we still use huge red phone boxes, and all us Brits talk like the queen. But seriously, haven't used a big red phone box in about 50 years!!!!As the film goes, I enjoyed it. A little cheesy, but that was expected. Not nearly as bad as the guys over at Cannes made it out to be. Paul Bettany was excellent as Silas. Really convincing role. Hanks, despite a lot of criticism for not being right for the part, in my opinion gave a great performance. When I originally read the book, I pictured Hanks as Langdon. It seems i'm the only one!!!Decent film. Few flaws. But lets be honest it was never going to live up to the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great film!,"I realize that this probably isn't your every-day film, but I find it intriguing. The multiple uses of symbols throughout history is also very interesting. I should probably research more into this, but I don't have that kind of time right now. All that aside, I really like Tom Hanks in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A major disappointment......,"Screened overnight for Australian media.Four words - wrong star, wrong director.Hanks and Howards best work, both together or separately, have been when they embrace intrinsically American values in their films. All their most memorable movies have involved individuals overcoming hardship through an unshakable belief in love and courage, usually set against an outwardly US-centric interpretation of events. Think Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, Cinderella Man, Saving Private Ryan - all fine films, all centred on an American hero rising above their circumstance.What is conspicuously absent from either man's resume is a European-set, religious-themed mystery thriller. Having sat through their arduous, laborious adaptation of Dan Brown's novel, I can now see why.The plot is total bunkum - a hodgepodge of ""what ifs"" and ""oh my god"" moments spun on the ludicrous premise that Leonardo Da Vinci had some sort of insight into the life of Christ - but loopy story lines have not stopped many films from being enjoyable.What makes The Da Vinci Code so deathly dull is the heavy-handed, oh-so-serious approach Howard applies to the material. Combining with his cinematographer to give the film a sleepy nocturnal feel (not so clever given the 150min running time), Howard's film is just a constant flow of expository clues that fail to create any tension or engender his leads with any human qualities. Even for those that haven't read the book, a couple of obligatory 'big twists' in the story are very obvious from early-on.Hanks (looking more like Jim Belushi than ever) and McKellen blather on and on and on about knights and saints and symbols and God as if they were giving a lecture at some Ivy-league school for the supernatural; Audrey Tautou is lovely but has little to do in a role that is plot- not character-driven. Jean Reno ambles thru another of his token French cop parts (he was better in the Pink Panther); Paul Bettany's evil albino Silas at least got some audience reaction, though giggles and guffaws were probably not what he was hoping for.Whatever sense of fun and excitement the book provided is fully-drained from this adaptation. Come credit time, I had the realisation that all this hokey, airport-novel religious hooey and B-movie plotting would've made for a great X-files episode in that series heyday. As the end-product of a publishing phenomenon and carrying the tag ""Years Most-Anticipated"", its a boring dud.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Reasonable Adaptation,"While in Paris for a lecture, the specialist in symbols, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), is called on to the Louvre by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) to help the investigation of the murder of the curator Jacques Saunière (Jean-Pierre Marielle). Before dying, Saunière wrote codes, symbols, a pentagram and a Fibonacci number sequence inclusive using his own blood. Sooner Saunière's granddaughter, the cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) arrives with a message to Langdon, advising him that he is in danger and suspect for the murder of Saunière. Langdon and Sophie join their knowledge and follow leads to one of the greatest secrets of mankind history, the descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.The novel and bestseller of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I had read about a couple of years ago. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of this complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable, with beautiful locations and a total lack of emotions. The cast uses great names, but first of all the physical appearances of Robert Langdon, the ""red haired"" Sophie Neveu and the ""strong black"" Bezu Fache do not correspond with the description of the characters in the novel. Further, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou do not show any chemistry, but the always excellent Paul Bettany is perfect performing Silas. Of course there are simplifications in the story, it would be impossible to translate all the subplots to the screenplay, but I still found the movie quite confused and presenting too much information to be followed by a viewer that has not read the book. In the end, ""The Da Vinci Code"" frustrated my expectations. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Código Da Vinci"" (""The Da Vinci Code"")",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved the book? It's hard not to love this.,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the book - it had me hooked more than Harry Potter - and that's saying something (and no I'm not a 10 year old child)! After hearing about the critics' mainly negative views of the film, I approached it without high expectations, and for that, I was rewarded. What I got was an action-packed film that didn't let up until the dying minutes. This film is incredibly faithful to the book (I'm looking at you, Girl With a Pearl Earring!!) to the point where hardly anything is left out, and only minor things have been changed. The visuals are stunning, the acting of Hanks and Tautou is great - and contrary to certain critics opinions - I felt the emotional connection between them. As always, McKlellan is fun to watch, effortlessly bringing Teabing to life, and Reno suffices as Fache. Bettany is fantastic as Silas. The musical score was as good as the visual look of the film - it paired perfectly with the storytelling. Overall, I left the cinema feeling satisfied, because a great book had been turned into a really good film. Approach this film with little expectation, and you will enjoy the ride. Bravo Ron Howard, for doing such a good job.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An OK chase movie,"There's been so much hype about The DaVinci Code... That itself usually puts me off, but my friends prevailed, and we went to see it today on its opening day.I've never read ""The DaVinci Code"". However, years ago, I'd read the books which were the subject of the lawsuit against Dan Brown (""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail"", ""The Messianic Legacy""), so I am certainly familiar with the concepts upon which it was built.The movie's hype extended to TV news coverage today - exit polls at the cinema... And all said, ""It was very faithful to the book"", which may have been comforting to those who read it, but meant nothing to me.In watching the film, it took quite some time to figure out what was what, who was who, though some things in the plot were rather predictable.Audrey Tatou was wonderful and Jean Reno is always great to watch. Tom Hanks, however, in my opinion, was miscast. He was less an adventurous ""Indiana Jones"" type, than he was like the TV character, ""Monk"". There was no real intensity there, and the way he would wince uncomfortably when placed in a confined space, did indeed remind me of Adrian Monk when faced with germs.I found ""The DaVinci Code"" to be an OK ""chase"" movie, which is essentially what it was, but it was a butt-numbing 2 1/2 hours long (and those seats aren't as comfortable as they used to be!). I have very definitive views about religion and the church, but this movie didn't really arouse anything in me for the first 2 hours or so.One thing I found offensive was the 'dumbing down' of the lead female character, Sophie. I know that she (and her ignorance) was used as a device to let the audience know what was going on, but it demeaned the character, just as what was allegedly done to Mary Magdalene. Ironic.Had I known then, when I booked ahead at $14.50 a seat, what I know now, I would've waited for the DVD (I guess I'm also annoyed at myself for getting sucked into the hype).I rate this film ""Three Wristwatches"", because that's how many times I checked my watch while watching the film. Not a compliment.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An entertaining, yet not spectacular movie about the book that made the World talk.","I just watched the film, and even though I liked it, I must confess, I too expected more. I can't precisely point out what was missing and what I was expecting, but some it has some details that weren't there, some small imprecisions, some little things could have been better.Nevertheless, a pleasant movie to watch. I confess I need to see it again, since I saw it from 3 to 6 am, with very few hours of sleep on the night before. I suggest the ones who read the book to re-read it before they go see it - to add a little bit more perspective. To those who haven't, I wish you a lovely time at the movies - it really is pleasant to see.Praise to Audrey Tautou, a beautiful splendid actress, and all the other actors that don't need any more praise, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Tom Hanks, who I didn't see fit the part at first, but who grew on me half-way through the movie, if not sooner. A huge praise to Paul Bettany too, for his astonishing and disturbing performance as Silas.I give it an 8, because it's one of the first movies made from books that did not make me go 'Oh, this was not like this in the book' every five seconds. I never saw Ron Howard as the ideal director for this movie - but he pulled it off decently, though a bolder choice would have been in order.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
People are too hard on this movie.,"People are being way too critical of this movie. I have to admit I expected a little better but it's still decent. It is fairly entertaining.The movie is more entertaining then the book but not as good as it obviously cannot obtain quite as much depth. It is not as good a book franchise adaption as the Harry Potter movies.The best way to describe this movie is a shorter, somewhat more rushed version of the book. People who describe this movie as too boring and dialogue heavy obviously haven't bothered with the book. The movie succeeds fairly well in terms of acting performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is SO BAD,"OK, I read the book like everyone else and loved it! I had the pleasure (or so I thought) of going to see a staff screening of the film with my friend this morning and I had to say I was very very very disappointed! I know films are never as good as the books they are based on but this just wound me up the wrong way completely. I never felt like there was much ""code breaking"" or deep thought involved by any of the characters and It annoyed me the way that things were illuminated as Tom hanks concentrated on them. It felt like it was for idiots to identify where he came up with his conclusions. The acting was very good in regards to all characters but I did feel that Jean Reno was underused and Paul Bettany as Silas wasn't as great as the media have lead us to believe. Sure the monk was misguided but it didn't feel like he really cared that much about finding the keystone/grail...whatever. I felt that everything in the movie was a bit rushed, and the differences in the story from that of the book, just didn't feel right. It kinda went off on a tangent at the end and I felt like a lot of questions went unanswered. The grail guardians also didn't look like they'd stand up to much with the majority of them a few years short of zimmer frames. Overall I'd give this movie 4 out of 10 and it annoys me greatly that It's going to make millions riding on the popularity of the book. If this was an unknown film with another name It would be quickly forgotten.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Da Vinci Review,"People have gone on and on about this is fact this is fiction, and have come up with silly reasons to deny the book and Dan Brown. Well let me start off by saying that he is a brilliant writer, and this movie was brilliant.Let me say that Tom wasn't exactly my first choice for Mr Langdon, and whats up with that hair? Well he actually in my surprise, pulled it off. He had a nice look (not that I'm gay :D), he was a wonderful actor, once again, and I felt that he pulled Langdon off very well.The other actors were very well also, including Ian Mkellen, Paul Bettany and others. They all fit there part is what i'm trying to say.Director Ron Howard made the movie feel like the book, and it was directed wonderfully. It had nice settings including Mona Lisa, the Last Supper paintings, and nice scenery. The movie followed the book very well, nothing important was left out, and everything was explained very well.So i would definitely give this movie a 10/10, and go see this movie, enjoy it, and maybe go make yourself a cool treasure hunt.

Anagrams and Symbols,"Da Vinci Code when viewed strictly on its own merit worked flawlessly as a well-executed mystery thriller. There's mind-boggling suspense, unexplained theories and unresolved mysteries within the span of the film's 150 minutes.However, when it comes to the subject material, staunch Christians were riled no end by Dan Brown's fiction, calling them blasphemous lies. The published book certainly didn't quite create a stir back in 2003. Yes, the thing is, in a bid to confine the movie to a reasonable 150 minutes on screen, part of the intriguing plot in print was left out, making viewers who haven't read the book beforehand guess more than they should.Dan Brown's postulations were taken too seriously by some quarters. He never really claimed that they were true but merely conjectures based on his research or understanding of the faith.Now, the acting. I am generally pleased with the performances by the cast despite criticisms that Tom Hanks didn't look the part of the character David Langdon in the book. Well, I thought he did well. After all, Hanks gives the character of the symbologist his own flavor, his facial expressions conveyed a sense of urgency in solving the mystery and clearing his name.Audrey Tautou who plays professional cryptographer Sophie Neuve is perhaps the only likable character throughout the show. The role might not demand much of her as the sidekick of Hanks' Langdon but Tautou gives an adequate performance coming to terms with her grandfather's death and discovering her true identity.Ian McKellen's over-zealous Sir Leigh Teabing adds to the mystery when Langdon and Neuve turns up at his door seeking for help to unravel the hidden truth. McKellen's acting prowess is undoubtedly splendid.Paul Bettany's in his role as the obsessed and self-mutilating-in-the-name-of-god Silas was scene-stealing (he was almost unrecognizable). The conviction in his eyes and behaviour would be one of the highs of the movie as he seeks to further the cause of the religion.My only disappointment was with Jean Reno. But again, his role was severely limited so we could only see his Opus Dei character Captain Fache pull a long face and all the stops at trying to foil Langdon's and Neuve's plans at every juncture.No one should really complain at the adequacy of The Da Vinci Code as a functioning thriller despite some of Dan Brown's more ludicrous assertions. After all, we must remember this is fiction not theology. The way to enjoy the Da Vinci Code on screen is to watch it with a free and unprejudiced mind. (B+)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
these reviews are stupid,"At first, im not an english speaker so sorry if i make mistakes.I have to clarify that my rating it's an 8/10 because i feel that the performances are no bad, but they could be better. I didn't read the book, but i think it's basic knowledge that MOVIES AND BOOKS ARE FICTION, i don't watch a movie for learn something, sorry but that's from a 10 years old, so if you're criticizing the film for not being fully in line with reality you're missing some things.The only flaw I find is that an old man after being shot cannot move, write those clues and draw the star on his chest.The movie is entertaining so it fulfills its promise. The shots of the suspense scenes are well done and transmit, which is the most important thing. The characters are good, they are not the best I saw, but they are concise. I liked that they didn't get carried away with the cliché of the main characters falling in love and that there is a closed second ending.I loved this movie, it keeps me focus for the 2,5 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Neither bad nor great, just entertaining...","Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" quickly became a best seller not only because of its easy-to-read narrative and its thrilling plot of conspiracies and riddles, it received notoriety due to the criticism it makes to the Catholic church and the harsh portrait it makes of the Opus Dei. While the only real fact in ""The Da Vinci Code"" may be its status as an entertaining and well-written work of fiction, it is more than enough to make the transition to film and it is in writer Akiva Goldsman and director Ron Howard's hands to make it possible.The now well-known plot starts with Professor Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) being killed in one of the halls of Louvre museum by the mysterious Silas (Paul Bettany), a religious man with dark purposes. Before dying, Sauniere leaves a series of clues that only his granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) will understand, but she'll need the aid of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), famous historian, to solve the puzzle. A race to solve the code begins as Silas seems decided to make them stop in their quest and the french police is after them.Ron Howard makes a competent adaptation following faithfully the book making the movie almost as entertaining as the source novel. Just like in the book, the plot unfolds smoothly and the film never gets boring or tiresome. While his loyalty to the source novel is really appreciated, Howard's film is overall bland and never takes full advantage of its source. The works of art that Brown describes with great detail in the book are rarely appreciated in the movie and visually the film ends up looking as any other TV crime drama. Brown's novel is definitely not a literature classic, but it deserved a more creative development in film.Writer Akiva Goldsman takes an straight-forward take on the novel and surprisingly make it follow the book to the letter. Fans of the novel won't find anything missing, however, it is fair to point out that some changes were made although the plot is relatively intact. The only major change was that Sophie's character was considerably diminished, something odd considering that Dan Brown's novel has feminism as its most important value and thus she is a character as skilled and competent as Langdon.Howard's regular Tom Hanks is surprisingly good as Langdon and while at times his age becomes apparent, his portrait of the everyman makes him a good choice for the role. Audrey Tautou is also good, but her character was nowhere as developed as in the book, making her just a simple sidekick for Hank's character. The one who really stands out is Sir Ian McKellen, who plays Langdon old friend Sir Leigh Teabing; McKellen completely makes the character his own and steals every scene he is in, displaying his domain of the stage and his great talent as an actor. Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina complete the cast and give their respective characters depth and dignity.""The Da Vinci Code"" is a very well-done film, but still it feels like a missed opportunity of making something really epic. Howard's uninspired take at times makes the film feel too simple for its original ambitions and may leave fans of the novel expecting a little extra effort in making Brown's story come alive. A bit more of creativity would had helped to make the movie a classic thriller instead of the simple mystery film we got.Despite its problems; the novel's thrilling plot, the great acting and the superb score (by Hans Zimmer) make the movie an enjoyable experience, and while it definitely could had been a lot better, it is a movie worth watching at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's Easy to Unlock This ""Da Vinci Code"": Ron Howard's Film Is a Winner!","Dan Brown's international bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" has enjoyed phenomenal success because it taps into a wellspring of so many different and fascinating topics. The novel touches upon the early history of Christianity, the mysteries of the medieval Knights Templar society, numerology, and, above all, the archetype of the Grail Quest. The strength of Ron Howard's film lies in its integrity of striving to be faithful to Dan Brown's novel. The fidelity is apparent in each of the following areas:SCREENPLAY: Akiva Goldsman's script includes nearly all of the major scenes from the novel. To his credit, Goldsman provides dialogue on the Knights Templar, Mary Magdelene, Leonardo's ""Last Supper"" mural and other details from the novel.DIRECTION: Ron Howard's stylish approach to the film includes interesting camera angles, especially in the aerial shots of such great location sites as the Louvre in the Paris and the Rosslyn chapel in Scotland. It was clear that Howard wanted not merely an action picture, but a leisurely paced retelling of Dan Brown's story. There was also the thoughtful use of close-ups in the more intimate moments with a brilliant analytical scene dissecting the controversial ""chalice"" apparent in Leonardo's ""Last Supper.""CINEMATOGRAPHY: Overall, the film was appropriately dark and moody. The flashback sequences were shot in a grainy style that contrasted with the action-packed story of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Salvatore Totino deserves the highest praise for his tasteful yet imaginative camera work.ACTING: Tom Hanks was not overly charismatic as Robert Langdon. But that is precisely the bookish Everyman who is the protagonist of Dan Brown's novel. As Sophie, Audrey Tatou was more dynamic than Robert, as appropriate to her character as well; there was a sparking and even radiant quality to this young performer. The supporting cast was solid with Jean Reno especially successful in developing multiple layers of characterization in the morally conflicted detective Bezu Fache. Perhaps most memorably, Ian McKellen delivers a star turn as the scholar Leigh Teabing.Over twenty years ago, Umberto Eco's novel ""The Name of the Rose"" was the equivalent in its time of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code."" The subsequent film version of Eco's story was a disappointment in its attempt to equal the success of the novel version of ""The Name of the Rose."" In the case of Ron Howard's film version of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" however, not only does the film do justice to the novel, but in many respects it is better!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I personally prefer the novel to the movie.,"I read the novel about two years ago so I had some ambiguous and blurry images of the story that's why I decided to watch the movie. I somehow thought that the movie can be much more alluring and gaudier, however, in this case I was apparently mistaken.The story is about some religious mystery that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) , who is an experienced person in the ancient symbols, tries to solve it.
In my opinion the movie failed to show the gothic aesthetic of Europe , it is as though the story was more focused on indicating the modern aspect of the cities.When the main actor is Tom Hanks along with the music composer Hans Zimmer, we have to hold our judgments in abeyance, so did I. I think the movie could've been much more interesting and still I stand by my choice that the movie had room for progress.I did enjoy the movie, however, reading the novel was more delightful and pleasurable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cobblers, but no-one will bother listening","So the over-hyped film of the over-hyped book of the long-discredited theory is here. And since the movie's reached some sort of untouchable-by-critics status, because you're considered a leper if you're somehow not part of the mania, then I suspect it won't matter if it's utter tripe because people will be drawn to it with the inevitability of rubberneckers to a car crash.And what a car-crash. I don't have enough room to write about Tom Hanks' ridiculous haircut (Professor of symbology? Media studies, more like) or the non-existent chemistry between him and his French sidekick - whose character, somewhat ridiculously, has to be portrayed as completely clueless in order for the film to spoon-feed lessons to the audience to make sure they're up on the plot.It all makes me glad I didn't pay to go and see this, a small consolation given that I'd already been drawn into wading through Dan Brown's book (for heaven's sake, man, overexcited schoolboy prose does NOT a novel make).Poor Ron Howard had an unenviable task to turn this scrag-mutton into something watchable and, to be fair, the end result of this film-making-by-numbers would probably have been passable - if only we hadn't been led to believe we'd all be going straight to hell drenched in petrol if we didn't agree that this twist on The Greatest Story Ever Told was, er, the greatest story ever told.Of course, writing this is probably a waste of time. Those of you who think the story, for all its well-publicised flaws, is still a fantastic yarn will stick two fingers up at the rest of us and spend your money regardless. Those of us who wish Dan Brown had done his research better, hadn't made so many authenticity claims for something which clearly wasn't, and had managed not to make such a bland and horribly tough-to-swallow spaghetti from such potentially rich ingredients won't be rushing to make him any richer.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
OK... but only if you haven't read the book!,"I had heard that this film was bad before I watched it, but I tried to view it with an open mind...My conclusion is that it's an OK film, but only if you haven't read the book. Firstly, because you constantly know what's coming round the corner, so there are no real surprises...Secondly, because they've condensed a very long book into a 2 hour movie, so they obviously had to miss out several elements of the story... so some things remain unexplained, which is irritating to me since I felt like some details were pretty essential, plus I can imagine it'd be annoying to someone who hasn't read the book, as the story/characters lack the true depth they should have...And finally, because they change certain elements of the story (for no reason, as far as I can see) which seems a bit stupid since so many people have read the book and will be expecting things to progress in a certain way...Also there are a few little inconsistencies in the languages used at certain points and I found Tom Hanks' acting quite irritating (but that might just be a personal thing!)

"The Da Vinci Code could invite debate, but it prefers to sell itself as a mere distraction. There is no ""code"" to be unveiled, everything is very obvious, explicit and direct","The Da Vinci Code can serve as an excellent literary pastime, but its transposition into cinema fails in many ways. It was natural for a phenomenon like this to land on the big screen right away. And if the book has its problems there - the simplistic vocabulary and the rambling and unlikely plot are repeatedly remembered - at least it has some merits, such as the dizzying start, which holds attention, and the fact that it poses intriguing questions for discussion. In other words, it is a pop phenomenon, and that is impossible to deny. Now, these same qualities of literary material are absent in its cinematographic version. So how can you not be disappointed?
The adaptation script was under the responsibility of Akiva Goldsman, who is an artist with many ups and downs in his career. What we have in Goldsman's script is a proliferation of references, controversial theories, pertinent questions, but everything is left to chance at random, without development or even a more in-depth focus. Behavior that empties the possibility of any discussion, or, mainly, reflection on what is seen on the screen. Without a doubt, it is one of the most thought-provoking texts an author could work with, and a competent screenwriter would have a chance to improve / perfect the source material, further exploring the symbolism, mysteries and existential questions, taking everything to another level., making it more believable and memorable. The Da Vinci Code could invite debate, but it prefers to sell itself as a mere distraction. There is no ""code"" to be unveiled, everything is very obvious, explicit and direct. Each new mystery presented is solved in seconds, in a practical and instinctive way. In the end, the conclusion seems pathetic, it is so absurd and ""casual"".Each work must be independent. The cinematographic adaptation proves to be a long-winded and confused production that is likely to pose a particular challenge for the poor spectators who enter the screening room without any prior knowledge of the original material. Fired almost randomly throughout the projection, Brown's ideas sound confused and fragile, since Goldsman does not even bother to tie the loose ends of his adaptation, creating holes that did not exist in the book and, therefore, weaken the film (how did Sophie Neveu (Tautou) discover that she should go to the Louvre at the beginning of the story?). And, even though he is correct in simplifying certain elements (such as ignoring the second cryptex), the screenwriter maintains several passages that should have been discarded in the first treatment, such as the conversation between Langdon (Hanks) and Sir Leigh (McKellen) through the intercom - precious minutes that could have been invested in other areas of history.In addition to that, director Ron Howard's heavy hand does not help, and the almost three hours of projection never seem to end. Without knowing how to deal with such a script full of dialogues, Howard tries to compensate the hype with the specific action sequences, but even these turn out to be bureaucratic and unimaginative, limited to the old car chases and shots that pass by scraping by the heads of the heroes. At times, the filmmaker's desperation to give some agility to the long exposure scenes arouses pity: observe, for example, how Tom Hanks gets up during a conversation and goes to the corner of the room for no reason except to allow some movement occurs on the screen. In contrast, Howard is right to reuse some of the visual tricks he used in A Beautiful Mind to illustrate his protagonist's reasoning and explanations, such as highlighting letters in a sentence or adding figures from the past at the bottom of the picture. In the same way, editors Daniel Hanley and Mike Hill (regular collaborators of the director) try to give some rhythm to the narrative through flashbacks that appear almost as flashes during the projection, offering, in a few seconds, information that aims to make the characters more complex. However, the most they can do is create an unfortunate visual pollution, since the countless flashbacks (unsaturated and grainy) cross the film in disorder without reaching their goal, since they are too synthetic to fulfill their purposes.However, the big problem with The Da Vinci Code is the excess of explanations: every character that appears on the scene seems to open his mouth just to provide more data for the viewer. There are no casual conversations that allow for greater psychological development of those figures - and, consequently, these never become real people, but only databases. Who is Robert Langdon, for example? With the exception of his claustrophobia, the hero does not exhibit any particular trait that turns him into an individual, and with that, Tom Hanks (although always charismatic) becomes unable to do his usual beautiful character-building work. Meanwhile, Audrey Tautou is further hampered by the nature of her Sophie, who ends up being forced to assume the role of liaison between the plot and the viewer, asking the questions he would ask in that situation (and most of his lines are embarrassingly artificial, such as when you ask: ""Do you have photographic memory?""). And although Ian McKellen has a lot of fun like the eccentric Sir Leigh, the only member of the cast who can really create a character with more complex traits is Paul Bettany, whose Silas becomes a tragic figure in his unrestrained faith.Added to this is the lack of feeling. At no time do we care about the characters and we are not even presented with a convincing background to understand their motivations in the work - a problem that does not exist in the book. Comparing the book to the film again, in the first one we have everything so detailed that it would be too much for the screens, of course, but the adaptation is flawed because it does not capture the feelings necessary for the perfect understanding of the message of the film. The altered ending is unforgivable, because in addition to getting worse, it also took away all the emotional charge it contained in the book and drastically changed the message of the book. It is one thing for you to adapt, another thing for you to modify. The film does that, and in a very unfortunate way.It is inevitable to note that Akiva Goldsman's script, certainly fearing the possibility of stirring controversy similar to that generated by Dan Brown's book, cowers in the development of its central theme and converts the hero (with all the authority that Tom Hanks gives him) in an almost defender of the Catholic Church. While, in the book, Langdon made only a few reservations during Sir Leigh's passionate explanations, here the protagonist gets to exalt himself with his colleague's attacks on the History of Christianity - and, later, when talking to Sophie about the nature of Jesus ( Divine or Human?), He tries to minimize any discomfort that previous events may have brought to Christian viewers (and we could even conclude that he shamelessly manipulates the girl to make a determined - and important - decision regarding the Grail , not?). In a pathetic dialogue where Langdon and Sophie have just discovered one of the greatest secrets of humanity, which could end the oppression of religions, and instead of revealing this to the world, they decide to keep it secret, since ""what counts is the you believe in"". The only one who wants to free humanity from the abuses committed by religions for centuries is the ""villain"", as when he says he is going to ""leave this church of lies on its knees"". Therefore, the story features protagonists resigned to religious oppression and a villain willing to reveal the lies to the world, after all, what attitude is that of a hero?As if that were not enough, Goldsman terribly diminished Sophie's participation during the film, transferring to Langdon several of the actions that, in the book, were performed by the girl - something at least ironic, if we consider that The Da Vinci Code seeks to rescue the importance of sacred feminine"". Sophie is extremely submissive to men, obeying all of her grandfather's instructions at the beginning of the film (even though she is in a fight with him) and leaving the protagonist the task of deciphering the puzzles and making the important decisions. Not to mention the naivety of Opus Dei, an ultraconservative Catholic sect, which receives a call from someone who calls himself ""master"" and proceeds to follow his instructions without even questioning, being deceived by him at the end of the film.Ron Howard is not your typical authoring director; he just makes the recipe. The formula here is that of literary adaptations. In it, it is up to the director to wipe out what is literal (descriptions of spaces, flows of consciousness) and to optimize what is visual, the action. Hence the first problem - of action The Da Vinci Code has little. With the exception of two or three worthy climaxes, the film is basically composed of statements about Christian conspiracy theories. What remains of this adaptation, for those who read the book, is a mere curiosity that passes too quickly; for those who have not read, there is an intriguing curiosity, but it never seems to end. Like the book, the film generated controversy among religious groups, reaching the level of the Catholic Church trying to ban its exhibition and promoting boycotts, which is incomprehensible, since the work, which should demystify Christianity, showing Jesus as a mortal, goes the other way, showing an heiress of her blood who is also capable of performing miracles, further proving this ideology. The Da Vinci Code is afraid to address its themes and when the story presents something against religions, a character quickly argues against it, being then a film without audacity, exemplified in the lack of courage of its filmmakers.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'd never read the book but now I have....,"When I heard that they were bringing out a movie of the best selling book I decided I would see the movie first as I always enjoy books more and didn't want to be disappointed. It's not easy for a film to grip an audience and I thought Ron Howard did an excellent job with his film. It's quite a long movie and every time I thought it was going to end something else happened.Ian McKellen was fabulous in this film and stole the majority of the scenes he was in delivering some excellent one-liners along the way. I loved his passion for England and was very pleased to see he hasn't lost his talent. Paul Bettany was also tremendous in this film and it made me see him in a different light. After Wimbledon I wasn't sure of his acting skills but The Da Vinci Code proved him worthy of many of the actors in Hollywood today.Tom Hanks is one of my all-time favourite actors but I have to say he just didn't seem comfortable in the role of Robert Langdon. He wasn't terrible but he just didn't come up to par with some of his previous roles which I felt was a shame. Audrey Tatou was very good in her role and I couldn't have imagined a better actress for the role.Overall I felt the film was great, even with Ron Howard's inevitable cheesy scene...'Godspeed' from Tom Hanks. After seeing the film I decided to read the book and I can see why some people prefer the book. However I think it is much harder for a film to grip then it is a book and so for that reason I gave The Da Vinci Code 9/10. I would say anyone should go and see it, just accept it as a film, not as an adaptation of a book.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining movie about possible hoaxes,"I'll review the movie itself. I don't care if Dan Brown revealed the ultimate truth or if his entire work is blasphemy. I came to watch this movie as a viewer searching for entertainment through a fictional story. This is where I stand.I think the director didn't think this movie would become a major success since he created a movie based on the second book of the Robert Langdon saga instead of the first one.In this movie, you are introduced to Robert Langdon, a symbologist from Harvard that is attending a ceremony for the release of his next book. During the signing event, Collet from France's Federal Police requests Langdon's attention because of a murder investigation where the victim requested Langdon's help in his last moments. The plot revolves around Langdon being framed by the murder and searching for the truth while some other major things are also happening in between.It is a nice ride. Everything evolves in an interesting way that captivated me up until the very last moment. The plot twists are good and the ending was great.Was it accurate to the book? Is the book accurate to known historical events? Does it really matter? It only matters if you are watching a documentary, which this movie is not.If you are in for a good movie about crime and investigation, I'd recommend this one. I don't care if the historical facts are not accurate or if they are true. I'm recommending this movie based on fiction and fiction only.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The much anticipated film version did justice to Brown's famous yarn - the fact that they did it within the 'economy' of 2 hours 29 minutes is no trivial task,"Applause to director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman - what a daunting task of trying to condense the 454 pages of detail from Dan Brown's book to screen. The film version will have to stand on its own - it's a mystery-suspense Hollywood movie. The myriad of back-stories are selectively dispensed of or being audio-visually presented in overlapping/simultaneous effect, so the 'historical' explanations and 'technical' rationales are not short-changed. The story is successfully delivered. It's rather marvelous to see how particular descriptions are cinematically interpreted.I have read the book the summer of 2004. I actually read all four (back to back) of Dan Brown's novels: Angels and Demons; Deception Point; Digital Fortress; and, The Da Vinci Code. Somehow the details I remember most are from ""Angels and Demons."" Perhaps the Rome locations were fresh in my mind as I was just there in April and visited multiple times the Vatican City, St. Peter's Basilica, Papal Mass and all.Audrey Tautou is truly perfect for the role of Sophie Neveu playing along side Tom Hank's Robert Langdon. There is such an air of sincerity in their quest for the 'truth' behind that wooden box with a rose. Tautou's wistful ""Amelie"" expressions mixed with earnest ""A Very Long Engagement"" inquisitiveness, missing nary a hint of regal descent, she is. Hanks the professor, the 'symbologist', the ever resourceful optimist, a problem analyzing continuum, he is. With the always animated, 'fathomless' reservoir of knowledge is Sir Ian McKellen as the essential Sir Leigh Teabing - delightful as ever. The thoughtful and lavish casting and production, along with Hans Zimmer's score, enhanced the atmosphere and made the puzzles of anagrams, symbols, 'cryptex' all the more fun to follow. They did it: all the key points and elements are there on screen. The Da Vinci Code - the movie, is an achievement in itself, thanks to the collaboration of Columbia Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, producers with Brian Grazer and John Calley, and executive producers with author Dan Brown himself. Give it a fair chance - see it and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not as bad as people are saying,"I read the book - just like everybody else - and so when i went to see this movie, given all the bad reviews id heard about it, i was fearing the worst. Most of the reviews complain that all the actors do is just stand around talking, and that, although i guess is right, is not a problem at all if your actually listening to what they're talking about.For me, personally, it's the first half that's the problem. The film starts off as if its already in the middle of the plot, with everyone in there current situations around the globe all visited in the first few minutes. This prevented us getting to know the characters, there was no build up to the main events of the film - they were happening from the second the title came up.For me, the beginning needed to be a lot slower. More attention should have been paid to introducing Langdon to us instead of him getting involved in things 5 minutes into the film. From the second he was at the Louvre, everything seemed to going so quickly - they were solving clues in record times and it just seemed, well, too scripted - there was no real pause for thought.But once that first half of the jungle that is the book is cleared, the characters find themselves at Teabings house, and from this moment on the film is great. It keeps you gripped, interested in what is happening, and as far as i can recall (i read the book a year ago) stuck pretty closely with the book barring a few selected omitted parts.Its this intriguing second half of the film that gets my votes. Id buy the DVD when it comes out. If the first half were slower (such as more time taken for the opening scene in the book at the Louvre, Langdons conference thing, and, well, basically all the parts in the Louvre after that), this film would have been excellent and everything id hoped for. Some things are even explained better in the film than they are in the book.Whether the director or the editor is to blame for these discrepancies we shall never know. But Ron, i was expecting a little more care be put into the flow and pacing of this story.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rewriting Layers,"Okay, let's get this straight. The most heavily promoted movie in history, and one that deals with sublime organization and submersion in art. The story that touches on many of the greatest minds we know and refers to many greater we do not. The myth that in different threads captivates hundreds of millions...All that is contained in something less competent than your average cereal commercial? ""Hudson Hawk"" was leagues better. Or if you are afraid of humor in religion, ""Baby of Macon.""Well, let's pass on kicking Ron Howard when he's down. (I already kicked him hard when he was up: ""Beautiful Mind"" drove me nuts with its similar mismatch of grace in what the subject was and how it was displayed.)Instead, let's wonder a bit about why such a story in both book and movie form has been so popular in spite of multiple incompetences: from bad history to bad writing in several forms to brutally mundane cinema.We live in stories, we write our own, usually borrowing one and some of the eager lenders are religions. That's because we like manifold stories. We spin our own, but we like that there are hidden forces somewhere that spin their own stories which trump ours at certain points. Noir, depends on that notion. Greek theater. So we spin a personal story that has a greater writer in it.The full modern expression of this isn't content with just two threads, the personal and divine, we modern folk like to have a whole spectrum of forces, layered demigods in between us and the supreme machine of fate.We often cast these as conspiracies. In movies, we see them as detective or con stories, depending on which side of the eye they place us to start. Sometimes they have demons, vampires or ghosts as the in-between manipulators. But the purest form I suppose has the simple noir hero at the bottom, God at the top and several of God's conspiratorial institutions in between, all rewriting each other at all levels.So Dan Brown, I congratulate you for stumbling upon a pure form and knowing enough to copy it. And shuffling it among scholars, collectors, policemen, moles, and various religious clubs.Some day, someone really will write this form the way it deserves. Until then, this will stand as comically overpromised as the French military wisdom and competence which is implicit here.David Mamet often makes trite movies, but he has a tenet worth following. Never have a character explain things. If you do, you have left your cinematic story. Show, drive the narrative in the story rather than explain. That's what kills this here.Ron Howard. Okay, kick.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Worthy effort, lead acting aside.","After the awful panning the critics have dished out to this movie I went expecting the worst...and was pleasantly surprised. While Ron Howard's adaption of Brown's best-seller sometimes missteps it's a solid film, absorbing without ever being really exciting. The biggest problem is the casting of the two leads; Hanks walks around in a coma for much of the running time, Tatou is simply dreadful; the lack of chemistry between our heroes so apparent as to bite the viewer on the nose. Together these two soporific performances give the film a leaden pace - a bit of trimming would have helped here. Alfred Molina is wasted. There is also lot of exposition for what should be an adventure/thriller; including a lot of flashbacks while someone does a voice-over doesn't hide the fact.But here criticism ends. I won't go into the plot, it's too well-known to warrant comment; Howard manages to come up with several real shock moments - even if you've read the book, and keeps the intrigue intact. And if the two leads are flat there is always the compensation of watching Ian Mckellen at work. He eats up the role of Teabing with relish, and steals every scene he's in. Paul Bettany is also terrific as Silas, the monk with a mission, exuding a real aura of menace like a sort of Catholic Anakin Skywalker. The locations are exquisite but the film never feels like a travelogue. I came out of the cinema impressed that Howard didn't go for yahoo Hollywood action, but followed the novel closely. For that he's to be commended. The critical mauling the film has received is truly ridiculous.As to the controversial nature of the plot - it's fiction, raises some intriguing questions about Christianity, makes you think, and most importantly, is not to be taken too seriously.

"Maybe not Oscar material, but I enjoyed it.","From reading the reviews so far, it seems to me that the most scathing reviews are from people who also didn't like the book. Fair enough, though I have to say I don't understand why you'd go see a movie based on a book you didn't like.I thought this movie was well-cast and well-played. The direction was good, and the cinematography was excellent. I think the film's drawbacks are directly related to the difficulties inherent in adapting a novel to a screenplay, and particularly a novel that is as didactic as this one. There was a lot of explanation in the book, and it would have been impossible to include it all in the film version. I think they did the best they could to balance the need to explain what's going on and the need to keep the film under three hours.There are those, of course, who are offended at the premise of the original novel, and they should not be expected to like the film. There are also those who didn't like the movie on its merits as a film. They're certainly entitled to their opinion.

hmmmmm...,"Whenever you have a book where most of the action and suspense is the characters thinking through things and placing thoughts together, a big giant gorilla should jump out of a bush with a sign saying ""this will stay better as a book"". Then the Ape of Literary Adaptions, as he is so called by his fellow primate friends, will disappear and make sure another wildly successful novel doesn't turn into a bad movie.This movie had so much going for it that one might have considered the overwhelming obstacles of a literay adaption such as this trivial. Director: Ron Howard. Writer: same as Beautiful Mind. Cast: Tom Hanks, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Alfred Molina. AND its based on a great book written by Dan Brown. Alas, the movie just does not and really cannot live up to its literary ancestor.The excitement in the novel The Da Vinci Code lied not in intricate car chases, rousing fight sequences, or stupeyfingly impossible stuntwork, it lied in the mind. Puzzling pieces of information and history together to come to a satisfying conclusion was the power behind the novel. Well, all that putting together pieces business comes from the head, unless the characters think out loud, which is pretty much all they did in this movie. It turns out to be quite boring. Tom Hanks himself looks pretty bored with it. I could have sworn I heard him whisper ""someone give me a flippin volleyball. We'll claim it has something to do with the sacred feminine.""Honestly, the only thing keeping me interesting was the cast. They're all good actors. Ian Mckellen was good as always.

True to the book; a strangely beautiful film,"The Da Vinci Code, directed by Ron Howard, is an excellent adaptation of Brown's novel that leaves you with an odd mixture of quizzicality, wonder and contentment by the time the movie is over.All the actors put in an excellent performance, but Audrey Tautou, the actress who plays Sophie Neveu, is exactly how I imagined her when I was reading the book and practically steals the show with the interpretation of her character.As those who have read the book know, the plot goes into very controversial subject-matter, and that atmosphere of intrigue, mystery, religious zeal and hermeticism that keeps you in its grip from the first page to the last is expertly conveyed in the film. Lavish production, beautiful sets and locations (the Louvre!) and an ending that pretty much left me in a daze (I enjoyed the ending more watching the movie than when I read the book) make for a truly magical movie-going experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Have faith in the film,"The film version of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" is one film where I am stumped by what many of the critics have said. I had read some reviews before seeing the film, which were mostly all negative. Being a fan of the book, I still had faith that film could not be as bad as they were making it out to be. And I was right.Many of the critics have said Ron Howard takes the fun out of Dan Brown's novel, there is no chemistry between the two main characters Robert and Sophie, the flashbacks are tacky, and it was uninspiring. After reading these comments, I wondered if we were watching the same film. First of all, the film is not boring but I agree that it did not blow me away as I hoped it would. If one has read the book, they will be pleased. If one hasn't, try and keep up because this is not the type of movie where you can zone out and then come back, thinking you didn't miss anything. But most importantly, if you have an open mind, you will enjoy this film.Secondly, what makes a film fun? Some would say comedy, some would say action. Others might say an intellectual storyline. ""The Da Vinci Code"" provides us with the choice. Ian McKellan gives a brilliant performance as Sir Leigh that many have said is what finally heightens the film. And my response to that is of course he heightens the film at this point because he bring comic relief to the film when it is needed. Up to this point, we had just experienced a murder, Silas in action, and some car chases. So, well-planned in my opinion. Granted the film is no James Bond film with explosives, car and boat chases, and gunfights every ten minutes; there is still some action in ""The Da Vinci Code."" But again, I don't think this is the type of film that strives for action as entertainment.The true entertainment lies in the storyline. I guess some have said they didn't have the same quick-pace feeling as they did when they read the book, or they didn't feel as involved in the treasure hunt as much as they would have liked. Again, was I watching the same film? The point of the letters jumping out at us, the so-called ""tacky flashbacks,"" and aided visuals is to make us feel connected to Robert and Sophie as they too are trying to solve the puzzle and make sense of it. As Robert was trying to figure out the password to the keystone by remembering what Newton's tomb looks like, we also see it and put the pieces together as he does. As Sophie recalls historical events to understand things, we have an image presented to us to make us understand as well. Some of these flashbacks also helped me connect with the characters that at a time, I felt sorry for Silas. Paul Bettany's performance no doubt contributed. So maybe words are not often enough to tell a story, as I can't press the rewind button during a film, unlike the fact that I can read over a certain point in a book till it finally clicks (as I'm sure many did while reading ""The Da Vinci Code"").Now to Tom Hanks and Audrey T. Although not their best, the two give good performances. Some have said Tom Hanks looks lost and is sleepwalking through the whole film. He might look like he's sleeping walking because these people might be uninterested in the film and are sleeping themselves because I didn't see that in Robert. If that's the case, this film isn't for them. Robert does at times look ""lost,"" but I think he is suppose to be. He's trying to make sense of everything that has suddenly been thrown at him, which isn't lost but simply thinking through the given situation. I also read one review that asked ""why is Sophie so interested (in the case)?"" This made me laugh so hard I honestly did not understand why this person was a film critic. The simple answer is because the man that was murdered was her grandfather. It's simply for personal reasons. The chemistry between Robert and Sophie I think could have been played up more, but it certainly wasn't entirely absent. Scenes, such as the one where the two are in the van discussing God and Sophie calms Robert of his claustrophobic nerves, show this chemistry.Overall, I truly enjoyed the film. I wasn't disturbed by the plot nor did I find it ridiculous, and I'm Catholic. I found it entertaining, interesting, and inspiring. The book inspired me to learn about these theories, not necessarily believe them. And the film inspired me to not only believe what I see with my mind, but that there are other things more powerful that can shape what you believe. And that's your faith.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like Mona Lisa without her smile.,"Java Man reviews ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006, PG-13) Directed by Ron Howard Written by Akiva Goldsman. Based on the novel by Dan Brown. Starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow, Paul Bettany & Jean Reno. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Harvard Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is making a scholarly presentation in France when he is suddenly interrupted by Inspector Fache (Reno) of the Paris police. They go to the Louvre where Langdon's friend and colleague, museum curator Jacques Sauniere (Marielle), has been murdered by an Albino monk (Bettany). Before he dies, however, he manages to carve religious symbols into his skin and scrawl anagrams on the parquet floor with his own blood. Also at the scene is the department's Cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (Tautou), who warns Langdon that Fache is about to arrest him for the murder. The two escape and begin a complex quest to find the meaning of Sauniere's symbols, the identity of his killer, the mysterious men he works for and the location of the ultimate Macguffin: The Holy Grail.REVIEW: 2 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGSOpus Dei is a Catholic organization, like the Knights of Columbus. But instead of sponsoring bingo games and holding raffles, they evidently busy themselves with 2,000-year old conspiracies that involve Albino monks, shadowy Cardinals, the Priories of Scion, Knights Templar and, of course, that naughty Mary Magdalene.Because of its highly symbolic and mysterious liturgy, and because it is the oldest continuously operating institution on earth, the Catholic Church is an easy target for conspiracy theories. And some feel that this movie, and the pot boiler of a novel upon which it is based, might give offense to the Church's hierarchy. The truth is, the plot is far too ludicrous for anyone to take seriously. The group that should be most upset are art historians, who may cringe when McKellen's character manipulates Da Vinci's The Last Supper as though he were using the latest update of Photoshop.But a preposterous plot can be overcome by appealing actors portraying characters who involve us in the action. This is nearly achieved by the supporting performances of McKellen as the eccentric liturgist, Reno as the suspicious cop, and Bettany as the creepy Albino. But ultimately it is the leads who let us down and fail to provide the steam needed to keep the pot boiling. Tautou tries hard, but Hanks is far too remote to even register as a complete character.Technically, the film is brilliant, with fascinating European locations, suitably sinister interiors, sweeping cinematography, and sharp-eyed editing. An example of Howard's cutting technique is a chase scene that takes place in the Louvre. As Hanks and Tautou dash through the Da Vinci gallery, Howard cuts several times to details from Leonardo's masterpieces; these powerful images seem to come to life and briefly become characters themselves. The problem, of course, is that inanimate works of art become more fascinating than the living characters rushing past them.A pretty picture without personality is like Mona Lisa without her smile.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's Average,"I haven't read the book so I can't possibly comment on how good the book is and how bad the film is adapted. The film is really not that bad, but can never be regarded as good.I think most of you have read the book (after all it's an international bestseller) so that you probably know about the story than I do. In short Dr Robert Langdon is led to find out the top secret of Christianity.The whole plot goes as an ordinary thriller does; Something happens, some people get involved, here come some quests, the people crack the quests and find out the truth. So it's not so impressive though it's the first time I heard the story and despite well-researched background information.Ian McKellen really stands out, and his position as a leading role seems clearer to me than Tom Hanks. Langdon is supposed to be a very intelligent person, but this is something I really can't feel from Tom Hanks, and his character is a bit flat indeed. Audrey Tautou is another good choice of the film, but this film would be too commercial for her. Jean Reno, just like Audrey, should have taken another film.This film is really just so so. It's really quite difficult to do well with an adaptation of a novel, even though the Da Vinci Code is not a long one, but the directors of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have done better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I love the book, being a great fan of conspiracy theories and a good ripping yarn, so I was straight off to the cinema as soon as I could after it opened.This is one of those films that you know the critics are going to hate simply because of the hype and the publicity surrounding it. Being a subscriber to satellite T.V. the schedules were bombarded and chock full of Da Vinci Code documentaries either agreeing or disagreeing with the theories in the novel. I must admit I found it amusing watching certain religious types being up in arms about the book and literary types being sniffy and snobbish because how dare a book be so popular as to have the great unwashed reading!!! As expected the critics panned it, the academics hated it and all of them missed the point. It's a NOVEL, not a historical documentary! Everyone should get over themselves and appreciate it for what it is. A popcorn thriller and a bloody good one at that! Some chunks are missing because you can never fit the full book into the film but it doesn't detract from your enjoyment or understanding of the plot.The central performances are solid and it looks as if Ian McKellen is having an absolute ball hamming it up as Sir Leigh Teabing. The script is okay without being stellar but it grips you in all the right places as a good thriller should. It may not be on anyone's best ever movie list but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a good adaptation well worth two and a half hours of anyone's time.

Entertaining and stimulating,"Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code postulates that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were husband and wife and that Mary gave birth to a daughter named Sara who married into the bloodline of the Merovingian kings in early France. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dan Brown, the film tackles a great theme, the early history of Christianity, but does not rise to the occasion. The direction is flat and the story is ""complicated rather than complex"". Yet, notwithstanding the knee-jerk reaction of some critics who become apoplectic at the introduction of any ideas outside of their orthodox straitjackets, it is an entertaining and stimulating film that may cause people to think about the role of women in the Church or ponder the veracity of 2000 years of Christian orthodoxy.Da Vinci Code starts with a murder and a mystery. A curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), is found murdered and Police investigator Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) thinks that Symbology Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the killer since he was mentioned by Saueniere in a dying message. Langdon is summoned to the crime scene to aid in analyzing symbols painted in blood on the deceased along with cryptic codes left near the body but soon discovers that he is the main suspect in the murder. Together with Sauniere's granddaughter, cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), he tries to decipher the clues and solve the crime while on the run from the police. She thinks that her grandfather asked for Langdon in order to protect a secret that threatens the entire raison d'être of the Catholic Church.The two suspect that Sauniere was killed because he was a member of The Priory of Sion, a super secret society which is sworn to protect the knowledge of the Holy Grail. The Priory naturally is opposed not only by the Church but by an extremist sect called Opus Dei, personified in the film by Silas (Paul Bettany), a self-flagellating albino monk who together with the French police, hunts the fleeing couple. The skeptical Langdon and Neveu enlist the aid of eccentric Grail researcher Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) to help in their quest. He tells them of his belief that Leonardo Da Vinci hid clues and codes in his artwork describing how to find the Sangreal, the Priory's documented record of their history, and, ultimately, the Grail itself.The true Holy Grail, according to Teabing, is not the chalice shared at the Last Supper but the missing sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene who fostered the royal bloodline. After many chases and power plays, the two escape to London where they visit the Temple church, founded by the Knights Templar in 1185, and Westminster Abbey where they explore the tomb of Priory member, Sir Isaac Newton. Tom Hanks does his usual fine if not spectacular job as the thoughtful private investigator and Audrey Tatou is a pleasant presence throughout. While neither role offers the actors many opportunities to showcase their dramatic talent, the performances are neither dull nor lacking in energy as some have claimed.I particularly welcome the exposure the film gives to the denigration of women by the Catholic Church and the role of Mary Magdalene in church history. While The Da Vinci Code never reaches its full potential as a compelling work of art, it is solid entertainment that creates awareness of the differences within the early church and may spur people to read apocryphal writings such as the Gnostic Gospels and The Gospel of Thomas. Of course, the theory, first expounded in the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, is out of the mainstream, yet, it is not as preposterous as Roger Ebert has claimed. Given the paucity of historical records referring to a historical Jesus and the passing of two thousand years, it is no more implausible than many other theological notions, widely accepted as the unvarnished truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Considering the Budget and Talent- One of the Worst Movies Ever,"I haven't read the book. I am neutral towards religion. The DaVinci Code is the Worst Movie I have seen this year. I never felt at any point in the story that I cared for these characters. That I wanted them to find the ""Holy Grail."" I felt no suspense or thrill in this movie. I felt more interested in ""DaVinci Decoded"" on the History channel than this POS. When something is this awful, all i can say is Ron Howard, learn your craft please. MI-III was not the best script, but the movie was amazing technically and Tom Cruise's performance was top notch. Ron Howard, please pay attention, this is not 1970's- learn some new things please. Learn how to use the green screen, or to move the camera. Please god, someone teach this man some craft. Technology and Film-making has evolved, please learn. I feel so awful right now after watching this movie. Where the f**k is the suspense and the thrill of the movie.

A conspiracy theorist's wet dream,"Like a conspiracy theorist's wet dream, The Da Vinci Code arrives on our screens claiming to be a work of fiction but enticing us to believe e semi-revealed and darkly hinted substructure of fact.Tom Hanks leads the fray in this passable but over-hyped thriller about one cult dedicated to exposing 'the truth'about Christianity (and the Roman Catholic Church in particular) and another cult (Opus Dei, one of the more extreme branches of the Vatican autocracy) dedicated to preserving the status quo.The plot gets going with a murder and the discovery of a blood line going back to a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. This central premise is fairly weak: the war between the protagonists is based on the idea that, if this central truth is revealed, then Christianity (and the 2000 years of oppression that goes with, specifically that of women and of science) will simply crumble. It is weak firstly because there is little to suggest that burying one part of a doctrine will cause loss of belief in the whole - where external proof is overpowering, religions generally just adapt. Secondly, to have any real weight, the blood line idea would need to include some suggestion that Jesus'powers could have been transmitted genetically - which is not developed in this film.Like many a heaven-and-hell film, the Da Vinci Code swells or deadens in the imagination according to whether we hold personal belief in the symbols (to be impressed or frightened by God or the Devil you have to have some suspension-of-disbelief that says they can exist). To some devout Christians, this film will seem heretical, as it questions articles of faith (at one cinema, I was picketed by a man distributing leaflets urging doctrinal belief). To the rationalist who thinks there is little historical evidence for the Jesus Christ of the Gospels anyway, it's a non-starter to quibble over whether the alleged central character did or didn't have sex with, or married, an alleged prostitute - it is just these religious folk arguing over details of their belief system.The wider importance, if any, of The Da Vinci Code is probably somewhere in the middle. As a movie, it would be forgettable, but the social furore has guaranteed box office and discussion. Those of us who are not overly bothered either way about the historical accuracy of the Gospels have been largely disinclined to research the basis of a belief system that has dominated western culture for two millennium. The film at least suggests one could ask questions. For those doing so, a tantalising mix of fact and fiction have been unravelled - not in any quest for the truth but just for the sake of telling a good yarn.""How do we penetrate historical distortion"" asks the professor played by Hanks. Well, Tom, not by tripping out on psychedelic symbols that can be interpreted a million ways and one. The movie's assertion that the Council of Nicea 'fixed'what was, and what was not, to be believed is roughly correct, but historians may rightly question the extent of the cover up. There is no reason to suggest there wasn't an actual man called Jesus Christ - it was a common enough name - but it might raise eyebrows among the scientifically minded that the particular man of the Gospels went unnoticed by all his contemporaries and that all 'records'of him were compiled at a much later date. Or that much of the texts, including descriptions of attributed miracles, were lifted word for word from the accounts of lives of pre- Jesus Christ characters. None of this proves he didn't exist of course, but neither does it prove that he did. For our story, we have to believe that he did exist, so accounts of what the Nicean Council got up to have received some poetical licence. Whether the Christ of the Gospels existed or not, he is a remarkable figure that many might find inspiring - and it is this type of catch-all which Hanks ultimately finds useful.Predictably, the film ends just as messily, with a few nice warm fuzzy truisms and beautiful photography of Rosslyn Chapel. Hopefully it won't get overrun by tourists - last time I was there it was guarded by several goats.The film has made a spectacular amount of money (which hardly would have happened without the legends of Christianity to plagiarise), and the attendant publicity probably hasn't done the church nay harm financially either. Let us hope it will also encourage some people to develop their enquiring minds.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So-so thriller has gotten a free pass because of its outlandish ideas,"To some people, no two films could be more different than ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""The Da Vinci Code."" One affirms traditional Christianity, the other skewers it. But the two are similar in the sense that someone not raised in a Christian culture might be excused for wondering what the big deal is. Outside a Christian context, it is strange that conservative audiences were attracted to a film as violent as ""The Passion,"" and it is equally perplexing that a relatively formulaic thriller like ""The Da Vinci Code"" would inspire so much emotion, for better or worse.It is ironic that people defend the film from its alleged anti-Catholic bias by suggesting that it's merely a fantasy, not to be taken seriously. If most people saw it that way, I doubt the film would be so popular. The attention it has received, both positive and negative, is almost entirely rooted in its unique claims about Church history. When evaluated without paying attention to what it says about our world, the film is really nothing special.The beginning of the movie shows some promise. I enjoyed the scene introducing Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) as he delivers a fascinating lecture about common symbols that throughout history have had very different meanings from what we're accustomed. But as soon as the movie's plot unfolds, numerous holes begin to appear. Langdon is sent to the Louvre to help solve the murder of a curator. We already know that the murder was committed by a crazed monk (Paul Bettany), but Langdon is unaware of this fact. As soon as he arrives, people attempt to tag him with the murder, and he must go on the run with a cop (Audrey Tautou) who's helping him for reasons I found unclear, and who's involved because the slain curator was her grandfather. The two must work to solve the series of puzzles the victim left in his dying moments, which hopefully will lead them to better understand the murder and also account for why everyone's after them. Why the curator had to communicate his secrets in code is, again, not clearly explained.As an academic scholar going on adventures, Langdon's character has naturally been compared to Indiana Jones. But he has none of Indy's charm, bravery, or quick wits, and he never seems in control over what's happening. Most of the time, he's being led along by the story's events, often acting rather dopey and clueless. That would be okay, I suppose, if the movie established him as a Walter Mitty figure thrust by the circumstances into a heroic role. But he rarely does end up acting heroic. Even his intellect doesn't prove all that impressive, aside from his ability to solve anagrams in his head.The plot gets particularly shaky when Langdon's old friend Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) lays out the conspiracy theory that is at the heart of the story. At first, Langdon is skeptical. Sir Teabing presents not a shred of concrete evidence to support the wild claims he's making about the Catholic Church. He does, however, point out some rather fascinating details about a particular Da Vinci painting. On the basis of this demonstration alone, Langdon becomes an instant convert to Sir Teabing's unorthodox theory! I was practically yelling at the screen at this point.The Indiana Jones films may have featured some preposterous notions, but those movies were never about ideas. They were nail-biting adventures that worked because they focused on execution, such as mood and special effects. If the religious ideas weren't altogether accurate, the plots at least had internal consistency. Our enjoyment of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" for example, has very little to do with whether we think it plausible that an archeology professor would search for the Ark of the Covenant, much less find it.""The Da Vinci Code,"" in contrast, depends greatly on its ideas, and its execution is poor. The acting is shaky, with the best performances coming from the supporting roles, and the worst coming from the main players. Hanks gives his weakest performance in a long time, creating a character with little color or vigor. Tautou is woefully miscast; although the IMDb claims that this French actress ""speaks excellent English,"" that was not the impression I got from listening to her labored speech, and she lacks the sense of authority necessary to make her into a convincing police officer. Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen, though, are superb, and I also enjoyed seeing skilled veterans like Jean Reno and Alfred Molina doing what they could with their limited roles.Adventure movies often gain their strength from colorful villains, but here there are simply too many villains for any one to dominate the story. The focus therefore falls on the two rather bland heroes, and the movie never pauses long enough to make their relationship either believable or interesting. I'm sort of glad the movie resisted the temptation to develop a romance between Hanks and Tautou, given their age difference. But the movie makes a point of showing that they both had traumatic experiences as children. There was potential to develop some kind of relationship between them here, as there was when they have a couple of brief conversations about their religious beliefs. But all of this stays on a superficial level, and I felt no connection with these characters. The villains, with the possible exception of Bettany's monk, are no better drawn, and their motives are poorly established. This causes the film to have a very mechanical, calculated feel. As the movie bounced from place to place, I felt like I was inside one of those old sleuth video games like ""Carmen Sandiego."" Maybe if it had been interactive, I would have enjoyed it more.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst Film I've Seen All Year,"The minute they decided to shoot this lousy script is was all over for Tom Hanks and company. Was the book this bad? Could this movie have possibly been any worse? This movie was so uninteresting that I was tempted to get up and walk out.Unfortunately, Davinci Code is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema this year. It is so bad, in fact, that it completely degrades the movie goer. Of all the theories of where the plot may go I had read, or come up with myself, the book or Ron Howard's answers were so incoherent and downright unintelligent that none had even suggested themselves as possible solutions. This is shameful laziness for a film of (supposedly) such profound scope. Thumbs way down.The DaVinci Code wants to be taken seriously but it's nothing but utter nonsense. It has aspirations of being an intense drama. There's no heart and the story is so absurd that you're never drawn in to the film. Not intense enough and not smart enough, it's caught in no man's land.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wonderful movie, sad old critics are wrong in my opinion...","As most of you will know, ""The Da Vinci Code"" received a lot of negative criticism. It is said to be ""too difficult"" and ""too long"".Even though I have looked up some information about the scientific background of ""The Da Vinci Code"", I haven't read the book, so I went to the theater without any real expectations.What we got served was 2 hours and a half of splendid cinematography. Ron Howard obviously chose to use as much information as possible from the book. With photographic flashbacks he manages to both keep the depth of the characters and to not make the film any longer (which was one of the main concerns in my opinion). Acting in this kind of movie is always hard. Adding too much emotion will get the audience distracted from the actual film, while a really robotic performance would lead to a lack of realism. In my opinion both Audrey Tautou and Tom Hanks did a regularly good job. In other words: the acting part was not remarkable nor bad.I don't think that I am the person to judge other people's opinions (for example, the ones of the critics). I just want to say that I strongly disagree about this movie. Due to the fact that the developers wanted to put as much information as possible into the movie, it indeed became a bit difficult. However, unless you the huge pile of brainless Hollywood rubbish, that doesn't need to be a bad thing. During the pause, I personally thought that we didn't get any in-depth knowledge about the characters, but that was put straight again in the second part of the movie.The Da Vinci Code is the best movie I have seen in cinema for the last six months and it is, together with V for Vendetta, one of my 2 Oscar nominations so far (with The Da Vinci Code being a certain winner). It is a must for everyone who likes to think while he watches a movie. Don't listen to the critics and make up an opinion for yourself.

pretty faithful to the book...,"This film has had a lot of hype to live up to and I think that many people will probably say it doesn't.Now thats not to say its a bad film, but unless you are intrigued by the plot before you sit down, then you'll probably wonder what all the fuss is about, long before the quest comes to an end.The film is excellently shot and the locations and special effects blend seamlessly with some very nice looking sequences which show us Langdon's mind 'at work' but I think that most people will probably be wanting this film to go down similar lines to Indiana Jones ones and it doesn't. It stays pretty faithful to the book.Personally speaking, my paths have crossed with the Da Vinci Code a few times now so if anyone wants an inside glimpse of one of the locations just before filming then be sure to check out my blog at www.paulhurst.blogspot.com/2005/09/rosslyn-and-its-secrets.htmlAlso, I'm pretty sure that in the bus scene, one of Dan Brown's sources for his novel features as an 'extra'. I may be mistaken, but I think I saw Lynn Picknett sat on the top deck. She specialises in the occult and champions the feminine cause. Its not surprising that lots of Dan Brown's so-called 'facts' about femininity in church history comes from this lady and her writing partner who also sits next to her, anyway thats just a bit of trivia thrown in really!Watch it if: You have read the book and enjoyed it Don't if: You get bored easily or you are hoping its like an Indy film",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't listen to the critics, it's good - go see for yourself!","Despite the almost universal criticism I heard about this film I went to see it for myself - and I'm glad i did. The critics have it all wrong and i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. It is not the best film ever made but nor is it the awful failure some have made it out to be. Apart from the penultimate scene it is remarkably faithful to the book, so you are not in for any major surprises. As an avid reader of both the Harry Potter books and the Da Vinci Code I would say that the D.V.C movie was much more enjoyable to watch and was more successful than the HP films. No major chunks were omitted nor many embellishments made. It was like watching the book come to life and makes it much easier to understand.In my opinion the film slightly toned down the anti-Christian ideas in the book while remaining faithful to the plot of the book. The tweaked penultimate scene even plugs Christianity and the love of Jesus. However the overall message remains the same as the book.I would say all the cast did a great job, Silas was suitably scary and Ian McKellen made the perfect English gentleman. I would urge everyone to go and make their minds up for themselves - I really think the critics have got it wrong this time. Overall it was better than i thought ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An OK American thriller. Nothing more.,"I went to the film not expecting much and I didn't get much either. It was a rather cliché solve-the-puzzle-while-running-for-your-life plot, not unlike Indiana Jones or similar movies and series. The only thing different is the idea of Jesus having a wife and children and the Church actively working against it. I didn't care one way or the other, so I didn't find anything really interesting in this. Now, what I would have liked to see is the whole thing revealed to the world and the social and religious changes on the world. Now THAT would have been a great book.Conclusion: reasonable acting, reasonable plot, shamefully small role for Jean Reno. I also have a conspiracy theory about this film.

Much ado about blah,"I won't get much into the theological and historical aspects of either the novel or the film ""The Da Vinci Code"" because basically, I'd just ramble and would end nowhere. But one thing's clear: the tremendous calls for boycott and banning of the film in our country, the Philippines, isn't really necessary as the film version barely makes the claims of the book any more credible.With Dan Brown's best-selling novel becoming a worldwide phenomenon, tremendous expectations abound, so it seems natural for director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to feel a great pressure to transfer a faithful adaptation to the big screen. They did remain faithful, but as with other book-to-film adaptations, you can only include so much and still leave a lot lying on the cutting room floor. This film is essentially a crash course of the novel where everything feels so rushed and we don't really care about the characters. I have read the novel almost two years ago (and subsequently, I've read two books that try to refute the ""lies"" fabricated by Dan Brown). I found the book pedestrian at best, nonetheless a real page-turner. The movie is a three-hour dull exposition that not even the chase scenes can't manage to save.You probably know the plot as much as anyone else, but here goes: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard Religious Symbology professor who is called upon by the French police after the curator of the Louvre has been murdered, leaving with him clues to centuries-old secrets supposedly hidden by Leonardo Da Vinci in some of his works. These messages are said to be so powerful it can shake the foundations of Christianity. Together with a French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), they try to figure out the clues while running from the French police across the streets of France to the Rosslyn Chapel to the Westminster Abbey.The film certainly tantalizes us with an intriguing beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first see the murder at the Louvre. Soon after we meet Langdon and he's called while signing books (in the novel, he was called in his hotel in the dead of the night). He's then thrust into a labyrinthine of puzzles and clues, into Goldsman's soggy exposition that never really trying to flesh out any of the characters for the sake of fitting as much subplots of the book as possible. It might have worked as a miniseries or, heck, even as a two-part movie. But here, the pacing of the story is very uneven.After their pairing for the Academy Award-winning film ""A Beautiful Mind,"" many were waiting for Howard and Goldsman to bring a sense of thrill to the story. ""The Da Vinci Code"" contains flat, yet likable characters and a rich palette of lush, inventive puzzles. Unfortunately, the film lacks that edge. It's missing the thrilling elements of Brown's novel. Howard does weave some memorable scenes, but the sum is much less than each individual part.The film does end by asking one important question about faith that somehow was never addressed in the book. Unfortunately the film overall lacks depth to fully substantiate its thesis. There isn't really an emotional thrust to the mystery because we don't know enough about the leads. It lacks a solid foundation altogether. The screenplay spends so much time in placing the characters from one puzzle to puzzle with not much excitement and too much arbitrary exposition to say (though it does seem fun to see Ian McKellen do that lecture). The chase scenes aren't adrenaline-pumping either. And then we're given with grainy flashbacks of the early Christians, the Knights Templar, etc. The novel has all the pages to expound on that; the movie has just two and a half hours.Despite that, I don't think it would diminish the anticipation for the film. I saw this film a couple of nights ago in Thailand and the theater was fully-packed (most of them were Europeans). ""The Da Vinci Code"" is sure to be an altogether different experience, especially if one has read the book. And those who are not willing to ""compromise"" their faith for the movie's worth may not be enticed the same way as those who are. Then again, in the greater scheme of things, there's no need for a boycott. Whatever controversial message the film tries to say, it does so unconvincingly.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

maybe the best that could be done from the book- a contrived-to-hell (no pun intended) blockbuster with some merit,"What can I say that hasn't already be written or said about Dan Brown's international smash book about the deepest ""secret"" in Christianity? Having read only part of it (as it is, arguably of course, an airplane book with a hugely elevated status over controversy and popularity), I can say that the movie, directed by Ron Howard and with a cast of French, American and British all-stars, does what it means to do. It brings some food-for-thought, with enough exposition for three typical Hollywood movies. And, at times, Howard and company (i.e. screenwriter Akiva Goldsman) shave off a couple of parts in Brown's writing that aren't necessary while keeping the thoughtful (as well as, dare I say, silly) nature of the writing.As it is, the Da Vinci Code DOES have a plot that is structured well enough- a symbol specialist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks in a role that basically calls for the basics of his talents, no more no less), is drawn into a case of murders, a conspiracy involving secret, ultra-dangerous sects of the Catholic church (with a creepy villain in Paul Bettany's character), and a search for an item as old as Christianity itself.The film traces parts of Europe for the hunt, and along the way there is information compulsively expounded upon about the secrets behind the murders, the symbols, the clues, and how the entire history of the Jesus Christ is possibly- dare the filmmaker/authors say- corrupted and a lie. So it is here that the controversy has been brought through. But the controversy is no more understandable than it was for films like Dogma and The Last Temptation of Christ; religious groups are BOUND to get sensitive by material that faces against their sternly stringent views. That it's transferred into a murder mystery/thriller that has more twists than the International House of Pretzel puts it up for everyone to contemplate.What helps make the film watchable even as the story goes through more contrivances and surprises than I'd care to count (with the core being a suspension of disbelief of both plot turns and the exposition bits) is the cast assembled. The bulk of the players- Ian McKellan, Alfred Molina, Audrey Tatou, and Jean Reno- are the best that could have been cast, and all that are asked of them are to say the dialog with enough conviction and believability to not be totally dull or just, well, wrong.While the direction by Howard and his crew is not the most imaginative, he is able to serve all of the ""so-called"" facts and ideas to use without making it into the overly pretentious. While I wouldn't think of this at all of being a great film or with the ambition even to BE one, it at least tries to have the skills of the common Hollywood thriller while serving up more facts than the same thriller wouldn't think to touch.To put it another way- this is basically Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with half of the adventure, and more than half of the historical and religious implications amplified. As Ebert said, it's ""preposterously entertaining"", and to take it as 100% serious is missing what is aimed for, even if not entirely successful. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So dull the con of man...,"Before I begin, I will state that Dan Brown is a lame author with a weak style who happened upon an old Gnostic theory and made it mainstream. His cliché plot structuring made for a very dull read, with a few moments of intrigue scattered throughout. So with such a weak source to work from, this movie was almost certainly doomed to suck or achieve mediocrity at best. It would have been better served as a documentary on the History Channel.I will certainly say that Ron Howard did a somewhat respectable job of bringing this tripe to the big screen. In fact, many of the methods I observed in this film seemed to be more creative than usual for Howard, probably due to the lack of creativity in the source material. I would go so far as to call some scenes almost downright impressive to watch, coupled with Hans Zimmer's tragically beautiful score, such as the very final scene in the film.Tom Hanks fills his role very methodically, as he always portrays himself. That was no surprise. I did notice a lack of personality on behalf of the other actors, most notably in Ian McKellan and Jean Reno who also seem to ""fall short"" of interesting. Again, I will blame the source material, because these are very highly respected actors with great experience, and a very colorful resume. Because of the controversial nature of the film, perhaps it was intended that everyone be cast as cold and stoic as possible, so as not to ""overshadow"" the cold logic of the plot.To sum it all up, this movie was inevitable with its book's bestselling status, almost certainly bound to suck, damned by the critics for its absurdity, and a great way to sell more copies of this detestably bad book.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enough with the religious debate.  It's still a good movie.,"In the three years since it's publication, ""The Da Vinci Code"" has of course gained a cult following and has finally arrived on the silver screen. I will admit that there are some scenes from the book that the movie omitted due to time constraints, but the movie overall does a very good job. We might expect a Ron Howard movie to tug at our emotions, but this one does no such thing. It blows your mind as much as the novel does.And then there's the characters. As Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, trying to expose a 2,000-year-old religious cover-up, Tom Hanks makes the most of his role, even with that weird hairdo. As Det. Sophie Neveu, trying to find out what was behind a certain murder, Audrey Tautou plays with the audience: she looks sweet, but this woman can gravitate between nice and acerbic. As Sir Leigh Teabing, Ian McKellen does as great a job as we can anticipate from a famous British actor. As Capt. Bezu Fache, Jean Reno is as good as always. Also starring are Alfred Molina as Cardinal Aringarosa, Paul Bettany as Silas, and Jurgen Prochnow as Andre Vernet, all doing a very good job.Does the movie have any problems? Well, there seems to be a lot of running around, so you wonder how much that adds to the story. Also, I don't know whether or not this counts, but there's the possibility that the presence of someone like Tom Hanks distracts from the plot. And one has to wonder whether Audrey Tautou is there mostly for looks. What about the probability that this story is pretty unlikely? Maybe, But overall, I don't think that these factors subtract from the movie's quality. I really liked ""TDVC"", and I'm sure that you will. As long as we understand that this is a movie - albeit one that really gives us something to think about - then it's all good.So what do YOU think that the Mona Lisa means?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Da Vinci Code Does the Job,"When I was looking for a movie to see this weekend, the fact that I really kind of enjoy a good controversy was alone enough to make me buy a ticket to see The Da Vinci Code this weekend. That I'd enjoyed the novel immensely was almost secondary.In The Da Vinci Code, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) works at Harvard as a professor specializing in symbols. His particular area of expertise involves religious symbology in an historical context. He happens to be giving a lecture in Paris on the very evening the curator of the Louvre is murdered by a mysterious Opus Dei monk named Silas (Paul Bettany).Because the body is surrounded by symbols, Police Captain Fache (Jean Reno) seeks Langdon out for help. The curator's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou) specializes in code breaking for the police, so it's no surprise that Fache and Langdon find her on the scene at the Louvre as well. But what Langdon doesn't understand is that he is himself the prime suspect in the murder.While the professor innocently helps the police with the meaning behind some of the symbols he's permitted to see at the murder scene, Sophie works along a parallel course. She's just as anxious to solve the murder as is Captain Fache, but she also knows that Langdon is not only not guilty but that he could be of crucial assistance in finding the responsible party. Interpreting the messages left for them by a dead man, the two soon find themselves on a trail followed by thousands from time immemorial: a search for the Holy Grail itself.Though of mythical proportions, there are experts who believe the Holy Grail is real and that it might actually be found. One of them is Sir Leigh Teabing, an Englishman retired to the French countryside. Fortunately, Teabing is known to Langdon, and he and Neveu contact him to learn what they can. The police, of course, are wasting no time and they're not on the trail of the two fugitives. Unknown to those on either side is the fact that representatives of Opus Dei are determined to get there first to ensure that some secrets are never told.Tom Hanks, who has won Oscars® for some of his past performances, is perfectly fine here. Playing a relatively staid (and frankly bookish) professor doesn't allow him a lot of room, though, to really show what he can do dramatically. Audrey Tatou is very pretty and also perfectly fine, but again, much of her role doesn't offer the opportunity to do more than go with the flow. Paul Bettany, who often plays the quiet, studious type, is positively menacing here, and good for him! But the standout performance comes from Ian McKellen who steals virtually every moment of every scene he's in, and does so handily.Special effects that involve illustrating historical events while the professor narrates are beautifully rendered (pay particular attention to the way an explanation of Sir Isaac Newton's funeral is handled). The sets are just; the editing was nicely done, too, especially given the fact that a great deal of information had to be distilled into a two and a half hour movie. And that brings me to commenting on the script.Writer Akiva Goldman had a tough assignment adapting The Da Vinci Code for the screen given the incredible amount of detail  some of it quite esoteric  that author Dan Brown included in his novel. Although the screenplay isn't unflawed, I also would agree that he did just about the best job possible with the material he had to use.Those who suggest that The Da Vinci Code is difficult to follow without having read the book are, I think, giving audiences far less credit than they're due. And those critics who apparently found the film so lacking when they were given a preview of the finished product at the Cannes Film Festival last week apparently don't represent regular audiences at all: The people I saw the movie with actually applauded at the end, something I very rarely see any more.The best recommendation for seeing The Da Vinci Code may not come from me, but rather from a young man seated behind me with his girlfriend. As the closing credits ran, I heard him say, ""Wow. I didn't think I was going to like it. But it was good!"" It is.POLITICAL NOTES: If you haven't been living in a cave, you've doubtless heard more than you care to about The Da Vinci Code from those who'd like to see the story silenced. In my own mind, that attitude is really the only wrong one to have.If people want to use the story as a springboard for discussion, good for them. If religious groups would like to use the story to educate their followers, good for them. But if those who don't like some aspect or another of the story intend to stop all of us from hearing or seeing it, well, that's bad for all of us.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Da Vinci Code is rated PG-13 for ""disturbing images, violence, some nudity, thematic material, brief drug references, and sexual content."" Neither the nudity nor the sexual content is, in my opinion, remotely an issue here; the drug references are subtle enough that I don't even remember them. The thematic material is, however, much too complex for younger children to understand or to appreciate. Additionally, some scenes of mortification are far beyond what youngsters ought to see. I'd say that The Da Vinci Code is best suited for those of about age 15 or so and up.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quietly moves forward with deliberation and purpose.,"Did not read the book. Read ""Bloodline of the Holy Grail"" and ""The Woman with the Alabaster Jar"" so was somewhat prepared. Cannot believe the stink and protests this film is stirring up. I have read other fiction based on religious beliefs, secret societies, etc that should be under more scrutiny than this. Discussion is healthy.Watched the movie as a story unfolding rather than trying to figure out what will or won't happen. It was a quiet, reverent matching equal to the story's secrets. The characters move with deliberate purpose sometimes with a surprising end.Very impressed with the cinematography. The overlay of present over past. I was shown the paths walked by the ancients. Enciteful. Respectful. Drew me in.Will never have a chance to visit the Louvre or the great cathedrals. They were awesome on the big screen.

"Well done, but rushed","I read the book and enjoyed it, so it's always tough to see the movie interpretation. As with any book adaptation, the Da Vinci Code movie lacks much of the back story and set up that made the book so alluring. Most everything that was in the book was included in the movie, but it was very squished. This was probably done to keep the movie from becoming a marathon, but it was upsetting to see some key scenes crushed into a few seconds. Everything that was included was well done, though. Tom Hanks pulls off a satisfactory Robert Langdon, even though it is difficult to think of a chummy comedic actor playing a university professor. Sir Ian McKellen is spot on, as usual. I'd recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"The movie adaptation of the book was done poorly and in such a way that you take a strong female supporting character, and turn her into and someone for the male professor to teach history. It was such a disappointment after the books. I'm not sure if it was because they got Tom Hanks as the lead and didn't have a known French actress to play the woman. It made me made when I saw this movie in the theaters and it still upsets me to this day every time I come across this movie and think about what it should have been.If you haven't read the books, the story is pretty good if you can get past that part.

Very happy with The Da Vinci Code,"I seem to be at odds with film critics again. I've read and enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and I've now seen the movie and I loved it. I did not find the dialogue excessive, in fact without it, too much of the storyline would have been lost. I watched the movie with others that had not read the book, and they found the dialogue meaningful as well.Dan Brown has told a fascinating story and Ron Howard has done that story justice. It was a mentally and visually stimulating, but most important of all, it was a great story. Go and see it.I can't help but imagine what the critiques would have been if the details of the storyline had not been explained. Well done again, Ron Howard.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Implausible but fast and exciting; a good ride...,"Dan Brown's bestseller had all the surprising twists and turns of a Sidney Sheldon novel--add to that a plot concerning a secret sect of the Catholic Church involved in a conspiracy and a treasure hunt to the Holy Grail and you've got a pretty entertaining thriller. Ron Howard directs this adaptation fluidly (it may be his best directing yet), however the opening moments involving a murder and some nasty self-flagellation are off-putting. Tom Hanks is very good as a famous writer and professor who lectures on the study of symbols as language; he's pulled into a murder investigation in France and soon finds himself on the run with a French female officer who was the granddaughter of the victim. There's a bit of heavy exposition with the arrival of Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, a learned acquaintance of Hanks who helps sort out the clues left by Audrey Tautou's grandfather. Jean Reno's police captain presents a different problem--he's left too ambiguous without enough material. Otherwise, ""Da Vinci"" is a fast-paced game of wits topped with exciting flourishes and European travel. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Almost as enjoyable as the novel,"Having read Chris Tookey's very disparaging review in the 'Daily Mail', I was of two minds to see this film. I'm glad I decided to ignore Tookey and see for myself as, having enjoyed the film, I now suspect he was allowing his own right-wing prejudices and snobby nature to colour his view of the film as a number of others have done.Based on Dan Brown's best-selling novel, 'The Da Vinci Code' sees Professor Robert Langdon, a leading American symbologist, caught in the midst of a baffling mystery when he is suspected of murdering Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre. Determined to clear his name and discover the truth over the clues Sauniere managed to leave behind before he died, Langdon joins forces with the victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu. But on their trail is sinister monk Silas as Langdon and Neveu soon discover there are those who are not ready for secrets dating back to the era of Jesus Christ to be brought to light...I wasn't sure of Tom Hanks being cast as Langdon at first as he was a decade older than I would have preferred but, as usual, he rose to the occasion, depicting the honourable, quiet and refined nature of the character. Audrey Tautou was equally as good as Neveu, managing the English dialogue without mangling it while also portraying both the character's inner strength and her vulnerability and uncertainties. However, it was Ian McKellen who stole the show as Sir Leigh Teabing, the scholar who has deceptive schoolboy enthusiasm for all things to do with the Holy Grail. McKellen seemed to have had much fun filming, completely throwing himself into the role. Also, highly noteworthy was Paul Bettany, completely unrecognisable as the unhinged albino Silas, and Jean Reno as the single-minded Captain Fache, determined to get his man.Like all film adaptations based on novels, this film isn't quite as good as the original source. The ending in the book was far superior compared with the ends scenes of the film, particularly the Roslin reunion where those who haven't read the book might not be so clear who the caretaker of the chapel was. The romantic tension between Langdon and Neveu in the novel was more of a sibling bond in the film, which did work better considering Hanks was a good decade older than the Langdon of the book while Tautou looked about five years younger than Neveu was depicted. There is nothing worse than seeing an ageing film star passing himself off as a young stud so I'm glad my stomach didn't have to contend with the inklings of a sexual chemistry between Hanks' Langdon and Tautou's Neveu!That said, in many other ways the film was very faithful to the novel and even used imagery to convey points that may have been hard to imagine in the written form, such as how the painting of the Last Supper linked with the theories of the film. It also preserved every piece of evidence, complete with explanation, relating to Langdon and Neveu's quest so one didn't have to have intimate knowledge of mythology or the novel itself to follow the plot.All in all, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a fun detective film with a unique twist, retaining the excitement and thrills that made the novel such a page-turner. Don't allow overly-harsh critics put you off and judge for yourself whether it makes the grade. As for the Vatican's stance on the film, I would have some sympathy for them if they actually put as much effort into hunting down the paedophillic priests in their flock as they do in protesting over a fictional book/film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great performance of Ian McKellen!,"When I entered the theater I didn't know what to expect. As with every movie made from a book, it lacks many subplots and it somehow fails to reproduce the mystic atmosphere in the original writing. The movie is good, performance of the actors is excellent, and I must say, Ian McKellen's act was by far the most convincing.As for the movie, we must state it is a fiction from the very beginning, as is the book. Did Jesus and Mary Magdalene have a child? Unlikely, but this is what the movie and the book try to make you see. As for the religious part, people believe in witchcraft, spirits, ufos, extraterrestrials and even devils but not God... It's much easier I guess.As a conclusion, this type of modern literature, that catches (read traps) most youngsters into the world of IFs and possibilities is shamefully widespread. Coelho-like spawn that shadow true literary masterpieces are very trendy these days. What most people don't see is that they come and go as the rain.I'd give it a 6, and that alone for artistic performance. If you want something spectacular, try something else instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Say what you will about the context, but this movie did well in following the novel","This type of story has always appealed to me. I honestly don't know why it caused so much controversy. So what if Jesus had a child? God is devine too and he had a son, didn't he? The thing that people need to understand is that Jesus wasn't a Christian. He was Jewish and followed Jewish laws. One of those laws was that they had to have children to obey God's first commandment to 'multiply and replenish the earth.' There is likely no way to prove a bloodline for Christ at this point, but the plot of The DaVinci Code provides an excellent theory of how such a bloodline might be documented. The one thing the movie could have done better in would be in the background of all the hidden clues in famous works of art. It did show the Last Supper and explained that one, but there were many other pieces of art explained in the book that helped the reader see why this theory is so easy to believe. It is the omission of those explanations in the movie that cause me to rate it 7 out of 10. I am hoping there will be an extended version available when it comes out on DVD.Look at this movie as fiction. It is exploring a theory as provable as the thousands of JFK assassination theories. Regardless of what your faith causes you to believe, you can't deny that the points Dan Brown makes in his book are very intriguing and worth thinking about. Believing that Christ had a child and was married doesn't make you any less Christian. Just remember that Christ was a Jew and followed different laws than you do. You also have to remember that the Bible was voted on by men and not assembled by a devine being. You can't discount the fact that more clarification about Jesus and his life could exist and weren't included in the Bible.If you liked the book then you won't be disappointed in the movie. It leaves some things out and it tweaks the end a bit, but there isn't anything missing that would lose someone who doesn't have the background of the novel. It was an enjoyable movie that I look forward to adding to my collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My only thing is the acting. It wasn't that great and I thought Hanks could have done much better. They did leave parts out that might have made it more interesting and they did change the ending, but I had expected that. I do think that if the book had never been released or so big, the movie would be much better. I don't feel I wasted any money on this, if you want to slam a book turned movie, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" was much worse.

Jesus Christ: One of the most famous personalities in History,"First of all I must say I didn't read the book (reading is not one of my favourite hobbies), so I wasn't one of those who went see the movie knowing already the entire story. For me it was all new! The movie wasn't really as I expected, because I thought it would be a lot more around a ""theological discussion"" and not this ""religious thriller"". Even so, the plot is interesting and has great suspense until the end of the movie, when all ""mysteries"" are reveledNow talking a little more about the Dan Brown's masterpiece itself, ""The Da Vinci Code"", I think what really matters there is that he's trying to change something in history, especially in our Christian societies. We all used to see the Christianity through the point of view of some untouched dogmas. There are some ""truths"" from we can't even have the littlest doubt, because they are just like that, and they will be this way foreverWe cannot change it, because it's sacred, it would be a Heresy! It's called a Dogma, and the Catholic Church has plenty of them. But the Dan Brown's novel tries to change some of these Dogmas, transforming some details of the life of this myth called Jesus Christ. And if he was a human being, with wife and kids, like all of us? Would it change the faith of people? Would people disbelieve Christ's words just because some Dogmas about his life were changed? I don't think so, but the Vatican doesn't have the same opinionOne thing is for sure, ""Son of God"" or ""just human"", Jesus Christ is one of the most important personalities of all Mankind's history. His life changed many things, and it's still being important to many people; so, either we like it or not, Jesus Christ's life will still be discussed, theorized and even ""invented"" (in some details) for many years, as it has been so far!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
smelt like french brie,"with my namesake in the film i had some expectations for this film. Sadly this all went the way of bad French cheese and just smelt. Hanks was wooden, mckeller was just rehearsing for x-men 3 and audrey was downright useless. The only redeeming feature was Silas trying to put them down. Otherwise it was a snorefest - I think Ron had gone for thickshakes with the Fonz at Arnolds. It was a very tedious tale (2.5 hrs) with next to nothing in terms of plot and character development and story you just had to laugh at to make it bearable. Sadly the hype for the film was necessary in order to sell the flop that it was. I cannot say I have read the book but even without that the translation was ridiculous.

"Good adaptation, but kind of unnecessary","Based on the world-wide bestseller by Dan Brown.A bizarre murder in the Louvre leads a professor of the study of symbols and a young Parisian policewoman to uncover a long hidden secret. One that, if uncovered, will shake the foundations of Christianity and give much of World History a whole new meaning. Various other parties are also interested in this hidden truth and forces clash to get a hold of it.As far as adaptations go, this is a good one. Doesn't stray at all from the book and Director Ron Howard keeps the book's quick pace flowing very well on screen in addition to finding a perfect cast for the film. Each actor fits their role seamlessly, especially Paul Bettany as Silas. Naturally, the book has more information and anecdotes, but the film's story manages to take in and present all that was most important and interesting in the source material.This is also the film's biggest problem. It is JUST LIKE THE BOOK. So many people have read the book, so many people have read into other sources that support the book and the theory that the film represents is known virtually worldwide now thanks to the book. So... why make a movie about it? Cash in? Most likely. Also the very last shot seems to wander a little too far and goes to state the obvious from what everything that preceded it has implied.That aside, the film is very well made with stellar production values and yet another epic score by the one and only Hans Zimmer.

Entertaining if controversial,"Unless you're the kind of person whose faith is so unsteady that a mere Hollywood movie can shake it, you'll probably find much to enjoy in The Da Vinci code. It has a bona fide leading man in Tom Hanks, a cute French femme fatale, a centuries-old mystery, and Gandalf/Magneto/Ian McKellen. It's longish, and perhaps a little overplotted (though not for the millions who've read the book on which it's based), but when it was over I felt satisfied that director Ron Howard had gotten it right. As usual.The curator of the Louvre is found murdered, but before finally expiring he leaves a cryptic message in his own blood that induces Chief Inspector Fache (Jean Reno) to contact a visiting Harvard scholar, Robert Langdon (Hanks). Fache thinks the message indicates Langdon's guilt regarding the murder, but another officer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) feels otherwise. What was the curator trying to say? The chase - and effort to prove Langdon innocent leads the duo around Europe, immersing them deep in the legends of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and Mary Magdelene. It's important to remember, though, that the book on which this movie is based is a work of fiction. For the learning impaired, that means the author makes no claims of authenticity - the storyline has been concocted for the purposes of entertainment.Along the way, Robert and Sophie meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen), a Grail scholar/devotee/nutcase. McKellen spins a yarn about what everyone's really after, managing to deal a couple of serious blows to the basic tenets of Christianty as we know it in the process. And no, of course I'm not going to note what those surprises might entail, although by now most people have an inkling or two.While Robert and Sophie struggle to find clues regarding the curator's murder - and clues pertaining to the Grail itself - other, more sinister forces are afoot. An albino monk (Paul Bettany) has the mission of finding the location of the Holy Grail - and then preventing at all costs anyone from ever finding out. Then there's a semicorrupt bishop and the Pope, but they both just have cameos. Not the real bishop and Pope, though; that would be quite the casting coup.Hanks is well cast. If we're to believe the rumors, Bill Paxton was Howard's first choice. If you're Tom Hanks, how do you deal with your favorite director wanting Bill Paxton over you? It's gotta hurt at least a teeny bit. On the other hand, Tautou was chosen instead of some pretty strong competition, like Sophie Marceau and Julie Delpy, and she has excellent chemistry with Hanks. They're not supposed to be lovers, just two semirandom people thrust into increasingly odd situations. Both roles are well written, and the actors are well up to the task.As good as Hanks and Tautou are, though, McKellen is extraordinary, owning every one of his scenes. Sir Ian has given plenty of commanding performances in recent years, and although this one may someday be dwarfed in retrospect by the roles of Gandalf and Magneto, it's no less compelling.The Da Vinci code is perhaps even better than the book, because the book wasn't terribly good. A riveting, well-paced religious-mystery/thriller is supplemented nicely by a fine cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"As a book, awesome....as a movie, average.","One of the bestselling books of our time is making the jump from the medium of print to that of film and attacking theaters everywhere. Now The DaVinci Code may not have been the best work of literature to ever grace our bookshelves but it did hold your interest and keep you turning pages. The mystery was stacked on, the puzzles and riddles the main characters were to solve were detailed and intriguing. The story moved along at a nice clip and you did not really want to put the book down once you were into it. Because you were there with the characters, experiencing what they did, you were part of the adventure.Sadly, in the jump to film the adventure loses out. Running right around two and a half hours in length, the movie seems to lack something. Perhaps it was all the detail in which Brown explained what was happening, perhaps this story was meant to be told and simply not to be seen. As far as visuals go the movie is gorgeous. Filmed in many of the actual locations you get a nice view of the world abroad. The story more or less make a seamless transition to film with many key instances remaining intact, some were cut for time and others i assume were just cut. There are minor changes from the book but none that will take away from the experience. Summer thrill seekers might be disappointed also, as this movie does not have many gun fights or car chases, the action sequences that are presented are sort of mundane and dull and also short lived. Ticketbuyers searching for a thinking movie will also be rather disappointed, because everything in the movie is pretty much spelled out for the average mind to grasp. No making connections and thinking of things on your own, the path is already laid out.Then we move onto the actors themselves. Most performances were so so at best, with Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany making their characters stand out the most. Tom Hanks does what he can but just seems to lack something this time out. His Robert Langdon, while not terrible was far from terrific. For me it just seemed to much of a forgettable experience, the action was not as proclaimed as i remember in the book, while some of the humor was removed as well. Perhaps Browns other book featuring Robert Langdon, Angels and Demons, would have made a better movie-going experience. It has more action sequences and just as much puzzle and riddle solving. It however, is not surrounded by the controversy that DaVinci Code is, and perhaps that is what Paramount was banking on. In the end, not a terrible movie but not a lasting memorable favorite either.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Simply put the movie was great!!! It was pretty much just like the book. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled with Tom Hanks playing Robert Langdon but he does an outstanding job. All of the other characters especially Silas and Teabing are exactly as I pictured them when reading the book. Forgetting that it is based on one of the best selling books of all time and that it has upset the Catholic Church (you have to love it for that alone!) it's just a really great movie! It has mystery, action, violence, intrigue and really good acting. The movie starts just like the book with Langdon being set up for the murder of Jacques Sauniere in the Louvre. Sophie warns him and they are off to figure out the identity of Sauniere's murderer using the clues he left before he died. They quickly realize that the identity of the murderer isn't what they are searching for but something much larger that will change history forever.

"Not nearly as good as the book, but more consistent","Although I'm a Christian, I must admit I did like the book. As a work of fiction, I found it to be a fairly good yard - at least for the first part: up until Langdon and Neveu leave Teabing's home, I found it a gripping read. From then on, the book got a bit muddled on its purpose and dynamics and turned a lot less satisfying. A good thing about the film is that it is a lot more constant, in the sense that I didn't feel cheated with this ""second part"" after seeing the events up to that point. The problem is that it is uniform of the wrong side of good, and it all feels too long and drawn out. While I loved Audrey Tautou in ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement"", where she played endearing and funny roles, I think she just feels too fragile as Neveu. Tom isn't nearly as bad as I feared as Langdon, but feels uneasy in the part as well (I think someone like Sean Bean would have been better). Sadly, the two of them, while competent, don't spark. And that is really the ""sin"" of the film: it's not bad, but everything about it (the directing, the actors, the screenplay with inevitably too much exposition) feels too safe to the point of being bland.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't let the critics put you off!!!,"I thought that The Da Vinci code was a well made film, with dramatic and intense scenes.

I know The Da Vinci Code has its critics, however it is worth making your own mind up. After all, not all the critics have the same taste as you. Lastly, I've never read the book, but that made no difference whatsoever. I went with a friend who had read the book and we both really enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pulp fiction...ordinary thriller given too much attention because of controversial theme...,"If you approach watching a film like THE DA VINCI CODE as a thriller (and forget all the mumble jumble about the history of the Roman Catholic Church), it works on an elementary level. The background score (a very busy one) by Hans Zimmer gives it the required element of suspense even when two characters are merely giving you a lot of exposition to make the plot easier to follow.Unfortunately, it would take someone more familiar with this material to truly enjoy the movie as a serious look at the dark side of Christianity and its symbols that never quite make complete sense. And so, I will review the film on the level of a thriller that has added a controversial theme to attract a large audience ready to put on its thinking cap and at least ponder what might have been.Ron Howard has seen to it that the controversial elements have been toned down considerably from the book, without eliminating them entirely. But on the debit side, most of the photography is too dark (intentionally so, I presume to keep an air of mystery going), the explanations come at a slow pace but there are too many to keep the plot from moving forward the way it should in a thriller of this kind, and the acting is, for the most part, not extraordinary.TOM HANKS gives a very understated performance in a role that is, for the most part, rather bland. He plays the role straight, without any emphasis on his lighter side, but one almost wishes for some trace of wit or humor in the role. His French cohort AUDREY TAUTOU has an accent that makes some of her key words undecipherable (at least to me) in a film where every bit of relevant material needs to be handed to the viewer who wants to catch all the clues.Only Ian McKellen sparkles in a supporting role, bringing flashes of humor and intelligence to a well-written role. Alfred Molina as a Bishop has little opportunity to be more than slightly interesting. The most striking and intense supporting role goes to Paul Bettany as Silas, the albino who has his own interpretation of what he must do to please the Lord. He has a few masochistic scenes that dole out the required chills and he has a look of quiet menace and desperation in his eyes.All in all, I'd say this should please readers of the book. Howard has done as good a job as possible with the bulky twists and turns of the novel and translated a popular work of pulp fiction into a movie that will undoubtedly be seen by audiences looking for a summer blockbuster.Summing up: A good workmanlike job by a movie that really doesn't ask the viewer to take it too seriously. It's more like an espionage thriller with a dose of religiosity thrown in.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just does not 'cut it',"I have read the Dan Brown novel twice in the last two years and with great interest each time. The last viewing of the big screen version was plain laughable and left me wondering of how i was robbed of my precious time and money.Ron Howard left much to be desired when it came to portray crucial, nail-biting and intense fictional parts. For those who are familiar with the book, it will be apparent of how slow and bland the action is as opposed to the smooth and catchy literary work of Brown.Actors are well matched to the expected feel of the book characters with the exception of Tom Hanks, who does not suit well as the brainy Robert Langdon, a frail , but nevertheless courageous scientist. Sophie Nouveau character is done especially well and deserves a separate credit for a great performance amidst bland and uninspiring ones.Altogether this depiction trails for too long to redeem itself from the utter mess it crawls into and just bombs in comparison with the book. This is one 'secret code' you can live without.The film deserves five stars just on the basis of sheer financial investment and magnitude that went into mirroring the book's text. Otherwise, it feels underachieved and pressed for real amusement.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Soulless and Boring Adaptation,"Being such a huge admirer of the book and having heard so many negative comments regarding the film, my expectations of this movie were low. Howard tries to do right by the book but he seems to have lost track of the fact that for a story to work, it needs a heart. This is where 'The Da Vinci Code' grossly fails, in my opinion. There are some dazzling visuals, stunning locations and a good score but the pacing is slow and this is not good for a long movie. I do not have problem with a long time length as long as a movie can keep me engaged but this one just drags forever. I actually fell asleep after the first hour (part of this could be due to the fact that I was tired as I rarely doze off during a movie) so I just continued the next day. Tom Hanks is mostly wooden and perhaps miscast. His chemistry with Tautou is non-existent in the first hour but picks up eventually (thanks to the female lead). Audrey Tautou is quite alright. Jean Reno plays the typical French copper (but I cannot picture anyone else for the part). Paul Bettany is unrecognizable and suitably menacing. Ian McKellan is great. To add to the positive side, the art direction is impressive. I liked how the interiors and architectural designs looked. France and England looked great too. Well, that's about it. Many people who have liked the movie seem to have not read the book but I would suggest that one read it because it has far more to offer than this film ever will.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The code on how Hollywood screws up movies that could have been good,"One day when I was surfing the internet I came upon news about a movie being made after a novel. The Da Vinci Code it was called. Time passed and soon the movie was to have its premiere.As I and some friends of mine walked through the streets of Sweden (where posters of The Da Vinci Code had found their way onto the sides of the trains) one of my friends bought the book in English. Back in Norway, I found myself reading the book with great passion. The subject discussed in the book was what made the book interesting at all, the events themselves being OK. As I finished the book, I thought for myself: a grand 5 out of 6. That's how good I found the book. The next day I downloaded the movie off the internet and found it...pathetic! What I saw was a movie for children, a National Treasure duplicate. I was saddened by the way the story had changed and turned for the worse. It was like as if the movie had been made in a week: everything happened too fast (no time to breathe) and the end...aw, don't get me started. Take a gum and stretch it. You'll notice that from the point you started stretching the gum, most of the substance still is located - the stretched part being long and thin. That's how the movie is! If you are planning to read the book, by any means do NOT watch the movie first since it will only ruin the essence of the book. In fact, don't watch the movie at all - read the book instead.1/10 - I'd give it less if I could!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Nothing really new, one of Howard's weakest films","The Da Vinci Code is based on Dan Brown's popular number one best seller about a murder that occurred in the Lourve mansion and clues in Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings that is being investigated by a Harvard symbologist and a french cryptologist that lead to a religious mystery that could shake the foundations of Christianity. There's not much new to this film, but just Tom Hank's goofy hair and some french accents. I have never really read the book so I had only a little clue what this film was going to be about. I came out of the movie theater with a lot of information, but was still confused on most parts. There is still tons of question that still need to be answered and what I've heard from many fans from the book was, that they were missing some key points in the movie. But there were a few positives. Although Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, his performance in this film was pretty dull and could've been a little better.But it was Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen that made the acting carry the film. There performances were very enjoyable and they played their parts perfect. The screenplay was written really well by former writer of Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsman and had nicely used dialogue. Overall, the film was decent and could've been a lot better. For its 2 and a half hour length, I thought it went way to slow and felt like it was almost 4 hours, but that's just me. I think this is one of Ron Howard's weakest films, compared to his previous ones such as A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13. But then again, this is my opinion on the film.Hedeen's Outlook: 5.5/10 ** D+",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good summary,"Hollywood has its limitations. They dislike dialog. Well, The Da Vinci Code book contains lots of puzzles that need to be presented, explored, solved and explained. Ron Howard does an admirable job in condensing these parts of the book a bit, and stretching the chases and escapes a tad, and thus creating a very consumable ""summary"", ""reader's digest"" of Dan Brown's book. I saw lots of movies of this length that were boring at times, but The Da Vinci Code is entertaining and interesting from the start. Tom Hanks adds another type of character to his long list. Also admirable for a Hollywood movie is the use of original language: English, Latin and French. The only scene where they probably messed up was in the church dialog with the nun, but I would have to re-read the book to see if maybe I am mistaken.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good Movie, great casting!","The Da Vinci Code was everything I thought it was going to be. However, people are jumping to the conclusion that this movie wasn't very good. You have to give Ron Howard credit for making such a detailed story into a 2 hour movie. Sure, things were left our and thuings were put in, that's Hollywood. I thought the casting was great, though. Sir Ian McCellan was terrific as Leigh Teabing. Hanks,of course was wonderful, as usual. Jean Reno was the perfect Bezu Fache and the part of Sophie Neveau was also well done. I liked this movie, but it is getting a bad rap because people have their own individual ideas of what it shouldn've been like. It was such a popular book, everyone thought of the characters in different ways. Overall, this movie was worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Da Vinci Code,"Considering that they were working with a really wordy book, they all did a really good job of telling the story. This is decent entertainment. Forget the hype pro and CON. Go into this expecting an interesting mystery movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed. I never read the book, so I had few preconceived notions of what to expect. I am familiar with all the members of the cast from previous endeavors and enjoyed all of their performances. The backdrops of various cities were exceptional and in some instances, breathtaking. While I don't think that, as a director, Ron Howard will ever attain the skill level of someone like Alfred Hitchcock for this genre, he does a decent job here and displays a maturing of his style as a director. The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debaters. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stick to the book,"I loved the Book and was really looking forward to the Movie. I kept my expectation low fully aware that a movie seldom can hold what the book promises. But this was worse then I expected. At times it was plain boring, such a draggy pace throughout the movie - they totally failed to bring the fascinating and absorbing pace from the book to life.They didn't make a movie, but rather just visualized in the most basic way the book. I had totally forgotten some of the twists in the book, and still in the movie it lacked any kind of impact. Friends of mine who hadn't read the book didn't like the movie much either and some were even confused because the story does not really unfold as well in the movie as in the book.Tom Hanks was the worst possible choice as Robert Langdon, I'm asking myself why him? how come the whole film is so lousy? Its nearly like its sabotaged...On a good note, Ian McKellen and Audrey Tatou are great in their respective roles, but even that does not manage to save the movie.My recommendation: If the media-hype around The Da Vinci Code has got you all excited, keep the excitement alive by just reading / re-reading the book.

"Speaking as a woman, I was insulted, but not how you'd expect.","In the book, Neveu and Langdon work as a team, solving codes, orchestrating escapes, protecting each other. In Dan Brown's story, History and Religion provide a backdrop to a terrific thriller with strong characters. I was insulted by the elimination of strength and intelligence in Sophie's character. The actress has the ability, so I lay the failure on Ron Howard, and ultimately, on the producer, Tom Hanks. He has to become the brains and the brawn of the whole show and fails miserably. Too bad. If he had kept the actual plot, this could have been a good movie.There are bright spots. Paul Bettany does his usual spectacular job as the monk, Silas. Please, World, make this man a star! Also, the only thing in Hank's favor is that he does manage to look confused in some of the right places. The story is about someone who has not had enough sleep when the plot begins, and doesn't get more than a catnap for most of the intrigue. He's dragged into a murder investigation and hasn't a clue how he got there. He really should have looked MORE confused! Sophie does seem to know how to act like she can handle a gun. Too bad the policewoman was so dumbed and gentled down that she became a non-entity. Definitely not Ron Howard's usual deft touch with his characters.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
some light viewing,"Director Ron Howard has made a variety of interesting films over the years that rarely allow his work to be pigeon-holed, nor in many cases particularly respected. ""The Da Vinci Code"" continues with that legacy. Here he has adapted Dan Brown's overrated best selling novel that was easily torn through on any given Saturday afternoon. The book was well-researched but not great literature, however it made for an entertaining read.The film equivalent stars Tom Hanks, who was no doubt the most recognizable and diplomatic choice for the lead role. He fills the shoes of Dr. Robert Langdon, the embodiment of a smarter, whip-less Indiana Jones, who finds himself caught in the mysterious circumstances surrounding a ritual murder in the Louvre. The quest he finds himself at the center of opens a can of worms able to cause a litany of consequences beyond the scope of the film itself.""The Da Vinci Code"" is a solidly made, complex religious thriller with a beautiful visual landscape to share that might have been too faithful to the manipulations of the novel, but it's nonetheless a worthy substitute. This is classic Hollywood film-making just the way someone like Ron Howard does best!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I read the book, and it never occurred to me that Hanks would play that part... maybe someone less well known, more scholarly? But he was OK, and Audrey Tautou was perfect for the part of Sophie. Paul Bettany as Silas was excellent. The action scenes were good and the cinematography was excellent. I'd read the book, so I could follow the story but I think people who haven't read the book might have a hard time during the first half of the movie, at least; the book was quite involved, with a lot of explanation to it that just wasn't possible in the movie. I'm sure Ron Howard was thrilled with all the controversy! Any publicity is good publicity!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

See it for yourself,"No, it's not the worst movie ever made as some reviews state, nor is the best.

I would suggest that you have an ample supply of heavily-caffeinated soft drink, popcorn and chocolate. The pace is rather slow.Oh, and one other thing. Some people have commented that ""religious and Christians zealots"" will be offended by this movie (and the book) for what it claims about Jesus' life. This is true, sort of. I think what may aggravate them the most, however, is the fact that there are people (idiots) who actually believe these things are true!

Entertaining and faithful to the novel but sadly much of the puzzle element has been sidelined,"After what appears to be the biggest publicity ever given to any film tie-in to a book ever, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is now in front of us. Masses of newspaper coverage of the ""implications"" of the film have been thrust upon, with the question now if the film in itself lives up to its hype or not.The film surrounds the chase for the ""holy grail"" by an academic Hanks with the grand-daughter of a murdered museum curator, whilst being chased by the police and an albino monk out to murder them, with ""revelations"" about the Christian faith abounding to surprise us or not! Personally, i'm not going to bother with the semantics of the novel, seeing that as best left to academics. In any case, that is a main thrust to the novel, although I feel it has been watered down for the film which might have been due to the nature of the limited time of a film, but the director does do a good job in compressing the novel into what he can.I was disappointed in that rather in the novel we are presented with puzzles to join in with the solving, there is nothing of this really in the film, rather the puzzle and solution is a given. Da Vinci also appears to be sidelined, with little examination of his link to the whole issue, as was done in the book, but the main obvious change to the book is that the film appears to back track on the novel's belief that the ""revelations"" are fact! In light of the controversial nature of the book this is probably a good thing.As for the acting, the roles are genuinely adequately done, with Hanks doing very well. It was never going to be too easy, with much excitement removed by the fact that the book is already too widely read to cause mass shock by its release. Nevertheless, the film matches the book fair enough, and to be honest I think much has been over rated about the book which in itself is no classic piece of literature but is a great thrilling read none the less when you first read it.Overall, an entertaining movie that is faithful enough to the book, but I miss the puzzle element strongly. Most importantly the film and novel should be taken at face value only. Further evaluation is for a more rigorous academic outpost. For those in the know, keep an eye out for cameos by the templar theory authors in the film. Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No Mona Lisa,"After all the hoopla given the subject matter, calls for censorship by opposing parties and buildup to its release in general, what we are presented with is a poor effort at film-making which is insulting to the audience's intelligence. I'll spare the plot outlines since practically everyone and their mother has read the book. Personally, I did not read Dan Brown's novel, but I was familiar with the theories presented prior to its release.The two lead actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou, do a laughable job of portraying their respecting characters. Stoicism is the best adjective to use here.The story as is shown in the movie lacks any sort of urgent rhythm to it, this despite a script that features a Europe hopping context. Hanks and Tatou go here and there, do this and that, all the while every single detail is said to the viewer as if one were in kindergarten.""We must find the secret to the Holy Grail because my grandfather died for it.""""Right, allow me to crack the code verbally and visually so a two year old could understand it.""Following that we have to go to Scotland in order to use da Vinci's device on stone tablet, which remember, unlocks the secret of Mary Magdalene.""""I really think this can be done in only a few days with practically no sleep.""Granted, the book's complexity required explanatory prose, yet the end result is so tediously laid on that the film is chock full of uninteresting dialogue. When the theories are presented, the counter-theories are declared at the same instant, apparently concluding the audience is too lazy or stupid make up their own minds. Controversial source material such as this should be said with conviction by the filmmakers, whether the viewer believes it is right or wrong, and not give politically correct garbage as not to offend anyone. A perfect example is Oliver Stone's JFK, where a clear message is conveyed and doesn't hide its viewpoint for the sake of agreeable cinema.The European locations are a tourist's wet dream, historically and visually appealing. However, the cinematography comes off as more like a TV commercial than actual cinema, foregoing any form of stylishness for mundane images.However, Ian McKellen is the only one to get it right in this god awful mess. His dramatics are at their usual best, despite said dialogue and the rest of the movie being so inferior. Bettany too does a reasonable job as Silas, though emotional exaggeration does occur from time to time. Their screen time alone influenced my decision to not give a worse score.The Da Vinci Code perfectly captures what casual entertainment represents, avoiding boldness whatsoever.

A roundly ho-hum affair,"Dr Robert Langdon is a historical symbolist from Harvard in Paris to present some of his work when he learns of the murder of friend and colleague Sauniere, curator of the Louvre. Inspector Fache calls Langdon to the scene under the pretence of helping translate the symbols and text that Sauniere left behind him as he died but really he believes the historian is his man. The police cryptologist does not agree though and she helps Langdon flee the scene and so begins a race against time to expose the identity of the killer and the wider quest for the Holy Grail.I'm not a snob but when it comes to books I do so little reading that I am pretty selective about what I read and the massive thriller tombs beloved of long-haul travellers and beach holiday makers generally don't appeal to me. Even with all the fuss and hype over this book I never bothered to check it out and when the film came out, all the fuss just put me off. Now that it has safely reached television it arrives in front of me with so-so reviews, lots of copy-cats and several screenings per day  it takes a better film than this to stand up to such once it is stripped of its marketing campaign.For those caught up in the story then I'm sure that this film will do a sterling job but for me sitting a bit further back from it, the plot is really too contrived and silly to engage. OK, we're not in the realm of the terrible National Treasure 2 here but still I was watching this mostly feeling quite cold and uninterested in the material. Thanks to the budget it looks very good and visually it did make me feel a bit guilty for not being able to take it more seriously but ultimately looks are not enough and the running time is far too long for something so dull that takes itself seriously to the point of being hard to enjoy.Howard's delivery doesn't help too much as it feels like he doesn't want to make it too exciting at any point for fear of taking away from the ""seriousness"" of the material. So he and his cinematographer make the European locations and religious imagery all very classy and impressive but yet there is little in the way of entertainment or dramatic value. This is backed up by some surprisingly bland performances  particularly from Hanks. He is too soft and nondescript in the lead and his intellectual apathy was another barrier to me being drawn into the plot. Likewise I didn't think that Tautou managed to find much within the character to work with. Reno floats round in the background, Bettany is so-so while names like Molina, McKellen and Prochnow all fill in round the edges without anyone lifting the film to be better.Overall then this is a very ho-hum affair that failed to engage me even if it was sporadically interesting. The delivery is too serious and plodding considering how silly the vast majority of the plot was and ultimately I didn't find the film to be much cop in regards drama, action, acting or anything really.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm A Fan -- The Da Vinci Code is Great!,"I read the novel. I loved it. I was delighted when I heard that the book was going to be made into a film, that Ron Howard would be directing, and that Tom Hanks would star. When I began to hear rumblings that the film wasn't good, I grew concerned in a protective way -- because I was attached to the book and adore both Howard and Hanks. I went to see DVC the weekend it opened, but, I admit, reluctantly. I might not have gone except out of my sense of loyalty and because I'd made a date months ago with a friend who shared my joy of the book.I'm SO glad I did. I loved the film!In contrast to criticism I've read, I didn't feel like the film bogged down. It was wonderfully absorbing, gripping even. In my opinion, Hanks and Tatou shared a lovely chemistry. In fact, I thought that the way in which their connection developed over the course of the film was one of its great strengths. Phooey as well to the much-ballyhooed claim that the film was wordy and didactic. Howard balanced words and action superbly. (In fact, one of my few criticisms is that I would have liked to see more exposition at the beginning of the film. Folks who haven't read the book are likely to be confused about who was murdered and the man's connection to the Louvre.) It was also a great treat -- as always -- to watch Ian McKellen in action. He's a glinting jewel in whatever role he plays and, in my estimation, only grows better with age.I have to say honestly, now that I've seen DVC, that I'm troubled by the strength - - and depth -- of the criticism that was thrown at the film, especially before its release. In fact, since seeing the film, I've come to think that that's an issue worthy of greater examination. Is it possible, for example, that some folks who didn't want the film to succeed -- because they felt it portrayed the Catholic Church (or, at least aspects of it) in a negative light, etc. -- were a bit disingenuous in their approach; that, rather than admit they hadn't seen the film and that they wanted people to buycott it -- they launched criticism of it at the cinematic level? What of the professional critics? Where have they been coming from?Of course, I don't know the answer to those questions. I'm merely one simple moviegoer. All that I can say with authority -- because, I exercised independent thinking, ""jumped the broom,"" and went to see the film -- is that I'm much more inclined to believe now in the ""culture war"" that I've been hearing people talk about than I was ""Da Vinci Code, B.C.E.""To those of you debating whether to see DVC, my message is ""Be of strong heart."" Don't get scared off by the so-called literati -- or hoi-pol-loi. I had a grand experience.P.S. I was on business in Oakland, California at the time, and saw the film at a wonderful -- and grand -- movie theater called, appropriately, the ""Grand Lake."" (There's a lake nearby although it isn't named ""Grand."") The theater definitely added to my experience. If you live in that vicinity, I highly recommend that you take in the film there.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sketchy,"There's been such a lot of controversy regarding the book that the movie was bound to be something that people watched out for eagerly. Despite a lot of adverse criticism, people flocked to the theatres to watch the movie and judge for themselves whether all the hullabaloo was really worth it. To that end, I think, unwittingly, the people who were calling for a ban, actually ended up promoting it!! I was amongst the people who waited for the movie to be released in theatres in India and made my way to the hall the moment it was released.Having read the book, I was a trifle disappointed by the movie. From the point of view of portrayal of the characters, the actors have done a fairly good job. But the sum total of the movie as a whole, could have been better, I feel.The book deals with the plot very systematically ... proceeding step by cautious step. The plot is developed very logically and convincingly. It's true that the ending is a bit tame, but by and large, the book's action is fast paced and gripping.This is sadly lacking in the movie. I realise that with the limited time frame within which the plot has to be unravelled and wound up, it is impossible to do justice to the storyline. However, I still found the treatment to be very sketchy and superficial. There were people in the audience who had not read the book. It was difficult for them to follow the entire action ... that is, there were gaps that remained ambiguous since there was no explanation, no foot-notes about entities such as the Opus Dei etc. The reasons behind Silas' actions remain a mystery. For the average Indian audience, or for people who are non-Christians, a lot of what was portrayed on screen, left questions in their minds.The movie fails to live up to expectations. The atmosphere of suspense (Dan Brown's book is essentially a thriller), never really gets a chance to be built up.The book is ""unputdownable"" ... but the movie, apart from satisfying the curiosity of the public, thanks to the furore over it's release, is eminently very ""missable""!!",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

First things first, Hanks seemed wrong for the part - my money has always been on Dennis Quaid to pull off a good Langdon and after seeing the film I'm even more certain of my choice. I also thought that Audrey Tautou seemed to misfire in one of her first English-speaking roles (Dirty Pretty Things aside): she put some very strange emphasis on certain words and occasionally let out the most god-awful example of how not to deliver a line (""But PROFESSOR!""). However, she was spunky enough for the role and I for one was more than happy to look at Amelie for 2 and a half hours! Paul Bettany, Ian McKellen and Jean Reno were all fine (Bettany probably came off the best); Molina didn't seem to register whatsoever, especially considering the character is fairly meaty in the novel.As for Howard's direction, it was largely good with a few clunky moments. The Louvre lacked spectacle (aside from the climactic shot which I thought was handled very well) and the chase sequences seemed a bit stale and flat. I also thought the pace was too zippy, flitting between set-pieces with reckless abandon and little concern for plausibility (the novel had a lot more reason and explanation for the plot's various meanderings, something that Goldsman clearly decided to omit). Dialogue was good on the whole, apart from one of the worst lines in recent cinema history...""I need to get to a library, fast!""The Da Vinci Code is certainly not the cinematic travesty that some reviewers might lead you to believe; I also think that those who have read the book will get more from the film since too much has been cut out. Whilst far from a polished, tantalising adaptation that could have been made by a director with more artistic sensibilities, it's a functional and enjoyable romp to complement the rest of the summer movie crowd.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stinker,"I thought it would be a good ride. At the very least, I thought I'd get some good real estate porn and a few sly thrills. At least it was a free screening.It's truly terrible. In fact, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Paul Bettany is embarrassing in ways that are hard to fathom. Tom Hanks looks constipated. Audrey Tautou is okay. Not even Ian McKellen can save it. The script is god-awful and the direction is clumsy.Now I know the novel is crap, too, but it's disposable like a good roller coaster ride. Robert Ludlum is no great literary artist but even his books can get made into crackerjack fun (the Bourne series).In a nutshell, this movie is jejune!Will curiosity still lure you in?

Da Vinci doesn't da liver,"Oh dear. What happened?Phenomenally successful book turned into a big budget treasure hunt with absurd conspiracy stories that border on retarded.No, it really isn't that good, and my audience made that known. People leaving looked underwhelmed and confused. One guy yelled out to his mate on the other side of the hall, ""It ain't good, eh mate?"". He agreed. It doesn't take Robert Langdon to figure out that it's not a good sign when audience members complain audibly about the film the moment it ends.Cast wise, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou make a great team but the absurd plot obviously kept them from reaching their full potential. It didn't help that they were being dictated by a wooden script that didn't even know what to do with itself. As being the blast of fresh air that he always is, Ian McKellen saves the film. His soothing deep voice was definitely comforting and helped to reassure me that the creators of this film wern't completely brain dead. His presence really is wonderful and I was so grateful to see a great actor grace the screen.On to bad things. The meaningless flashbacks really REALLY got on my nerves, especially how they just pop out of ordinary situations, and had that weird dreamy sense to them. The almost countless conspiracy theories of Opus Dei got so numerous I practically gave up 3/4 into the film. In the end, I gave up on trying to make sense of it and accepted it for being what it is: fiction.Overall, to put it in short terms, The Da Vinci Code is way too outrageous to be taken seriously. I want to like the film but it's just not going for me.Save your money this weekend and stay in with a rental and a curry.6/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good solid movie!,"This is a good movie! It stays more true to the book (which I should point out is fiction) than any other movie of a book that I have ever seen, from ""Matilda"" to ""Harry Potter"" to ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""The choice of locations for filming was incredible. Almost every scene that was centered on a location was filmed at that location. For example, it was awe-inspiring seeing the actors walking around the deserted hallways of the Louvre in the dead of night. Also, the Templar Church that the characters go to in London was feet away from my work...I have actually walked down the streets that they ran down.I would like to set the record straight about Tom Hanks' performance. He was not exactly who I pictured as the role (that would have been a Harrison Ford circa Indiana Jones) but he was very good! I thought that he was very believable as Robert Langdon. There was no chemistry between him and his co-star but (contrary to popular opinion I believe) that was a good thing. Their relationship was supportive and kind, and most importantly interesting to watch.No, this film isn't award winning. But it is a great movie to see on a hot summer day. It is definitely worth spending ten dollars for the two and a bit hours of fun that ""The Da Vinci Code"" provides.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very entertaining but overlong,"I have not read the book, but the movie was pretty entertaining to me anyway. Now for my constructive criticism:Ron Howard was not the best director they could have found for this, because he's too manipulative. The music swells every time something dramatic happens, and that gets really annoying after awhile. The cinematography was actually very good; everything is captured onto celluloid in a beautiful way. They managed to avoid a ""shaky"" camera during the chase scenes, which was commendable. Every director seems to be keen to use shaky cams these days, and it is very annoying/nauseating, so this film gets the props for that. The script was good, although not airtight, and I am sure the book is better in this case (from what other people are saying, anyway). The music was O.K. although it was very forgettable (I don't remember any of it).So is it entertaining or not? Heck yes! It might have been loads less entertaining if I had read the book beforehand, because the uniqueness of it all would be taken away, but I digress. I sat there very entertained for 2 hours, only to have it get too drawn out near the end. This also could be due to the fact it was an 11PM showing, and we got out of the theater at 2AM (and I was dead tired by that point), but still. I could tell that there were other people in the audience getting restless too, so it wasn't just me. They should have condensed some of the scenes to make it about two hours max, but of course they didn't (I'm looking at you, Mr Howard). With a different director (although I'm not sure who), this could have been THE best movie of the year. Actually, it still is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It sounds like I'm being too critical, but meh, its what I do. Highly entertaining but overlong; enjoyable nonetheless. Verdict:7 out of 10: recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A well crafted film,"Just watched The Da Vinci Code and I have to say I'm quite impressed with the way they dealt with this Controversial book to adapted film. I read the book over a year ago and I had a pretty good idea of how it was going to be. I went to watch it with no reviews read, beforehand of the film but yes, while watching the film I had to keep comparing it to the much talked about novel. So this is what my account of the film was -The film starts of a bit slow paced and I wasn't very attached to the first few of scenes because they weren't so vivid and dramatic as I had seen it in my head while reading the book and I was having doubts whether it was going to hold me on the edge of my seat. I felt even the ending dragged on a little tiny bit too much. Also I was having a difficult time Acclimatizing with the characters in the beginning especially Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon but all that suspicion goes after a good half an hour when we start getting right into the crux of the story.There were some aspects I really liked about this film such as the use of flash backs which really worked in favour of bettering the story understanding. The book goes into great deal with explaining the whole story behind Jesus Christ and the Blood line and I felt that was well assembled on in film. I was watching the film with my parents (who haven't read the book) and wondering whether they were actually understanding the story and it turned out they were following it, which was a relief for me because i literally dragged them in to watch it.Over all the actors did a wonderful job I was totally blown away with Paul Bettany's performance as Silas. Audrey Tautou was very much in character mode and the same goes for Ian McKellen and Tom Hanks (although I didn't think Tom Hanks hair style was necessary, short hair was the way to go).I also really loved the cinematography for this film, it was really well done. The whole feel of the film was very much like the book, the colour, contrast, composition, lighting and architect was very much Da Vinci like.There have been minor changes to the narrative in the film to the book but that of course had to be done. The filmmakers pretty much stuck to the whole plot and how it unravels, which was delight to compare with, with the Book. I enjoyed watching the ending, quite provoking, the way Tom Hanks leaves it to us to believe what we want to and that this whole episode means nothing if want it to mean nothing cause at the end it doesn't effect our relationship with God, its just our thinking.The Da Vinci Code, I believe lived to its expectation and Director Ron Howard crafts a very delicate subject with the right touch of spice and presents it in style. I would rate it 9 out of 10 watch it, -1 for the beginning and pace of film :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The screenplay followed the book perfectly.,"The movie was slightly above average. The acting was average. Tautou was better than I expected. Directing was OK. I thought the screenplay was, as a whole, well written. Let's face it, Dan Brown isn't the best writer in the world. (He's no Arundhati Roy.) What made the book worldwide bestseller is the fact that his subject matter was so thought provoking. I learned, subsequently, about the Gnostics, whom I never heard of before.Can we at least agree that the critics were wrong in bashing this film as much as they did? They were hoping to see a great movie and they were disappointed. Wah wah!!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Solid, faithful adaptation, which presents some beautiful portrayals, a little gritty action, and a compelling story.","WARNING: SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM!First off, this review is concerning the movie, not the book itself.I will begin with the casting. There has been a lot said over the past year or so since the casting list was unveiled, expressing misgivings concerning what has been called the ""miscasting"" of Tom Hanks in the role as Robert Langdon. I am happy to report that earlier misgivings were completely unfounded. Tom Hanks delivers a performance reminiscent of his earlier days when he was more relaxed in his execution, and seems to have rediscovered his remarkable talents.Ian McKellen contributes a believability to his performance, which is so strong, as to make you consider (if only for a brief while) whether or not he has personal interest in the Grail. He was remarkable as Leigh Teabing, but would you really expect anything less of him? Certainly not!Audrey Tautou gave a refreshingly capable performance as Agent Sophie Neveu. She portrayed her character with a polished professionalism one might not expect from a relative newcomer to the world of American films. Of course, people who think like that are in for a rude awakening, and Audrey Tautou is just the one to give it to them.Jean Reno enacted a character which goes through some heart-felt changes. He does so with a style and grace amid the action sequences involving French Police Captain Fache in a portrayal which is reminiscent of his riveting spot lit performance as the Professional. The principle difference between the two characters, and Reno's enactment of them, is that there is much more time for character development in the Professional wherein the audience may get to ""know"" the character. In the DaVinci Code, Fache's (pronounced Fash, by the way) character was one of peripheral standing and, therefore, there was very little in the way of opening character development where his character was concerned. He manages quite succinctly, however, to give you enough of the back-story of his motivations and motives to allow you a brief window into the many-faceted man who is Captain Fache. His performance was possibly one of his best, to date.And that leaves Paul Bettany. I was concerned, never having seen him portray such a complex character as Silas. I am here to apologize for my earlier misgivings. He portrayed Silas dead on. The raw (and sometimes confused and clouded) emotion he exhibited was spot on and we, the audience, found a certain reality in his portrayal. He was brilliant.And after all that, I still feel the need to say that Ron Howard was the real star of this work. His choices of camera angles, filming techniques, effects, and overall direction shine through it all in such a way as to solidly cement his name into the list of top directors. Some would argue that he was already there, and he was. But he is affirmed, confirmed, and reaffirmed as one of the best directors in the world.The work itself was an extremely faithful adaptation. It was gritty, and had us completely involved in the story, even though we were all fans of the book, and already knew what to expect. The execution of the action was shockingly realistic. I would not take children under 16 to see this, personally, and would have to think a bit before subjecting a 16-year-old to it. Silas's use of the cilice (which, according to my dictionary, is a hair-coat much like Robbie Coltrane wears while filming Harry Potter) and self flagellation is quite graphic. However, if they have seen the Passion of the Christ, then they can most definitely handle this.As far as the subject matter goes, this is neither the time, nor the place for that discussion. I will say that this work of fiction fully utilizes the potential presented by the prior historical research upon which it was based; namely, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail."" It is a work of fiction lovingly interwoven throughout some compelling historical hypotheses presented by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln in their aforementioned published historical work.The Catholic Church has issued condemnation after condemnation of this work. They should know better than to condemn a movie, by now. All it does is raise the box office sales, by piquing the interest in people who normally would have no desire to see the work. It bestowed such a high level of exposure that many people who never would have even heard of it, are now going to see it.Opus Dei has also wrongly condemned the movie for portraying them in a less than favorable light. That is not the case. It is made quite clear that Silas's mental stability is not only in question, but is doubtful. I was obviously just an opportunistic grab for their fifteen minutes of fame, than any true objection they may have had to the film at large.SPOILERSBook fans may be interested in knowing that there were four scenes omitted from the cinematic version. These scenes had no determination or bearing to the outcome of the story, and were therefore not missed...merely noticed. Namely, Sophie never puts it together that her grandmother was the woman who was with her grandfather during the rite. And she is not told (at least not in our presence) that the gap-toothed boy who attends Roslyn Chapel is her brother. You are shown the photo of the boy as a child, and you realize (if you've read the book) that it is her brother, but they never say it. The Madonna on the Rocks sequences were omitted for time. The ending is different than the novelized version, but more enjoyable.END SPOILERS!!That not withstanding, The DaVinci Code is highly enjoyable, regardless of your religious views. It is a work of FICTION, and as such, was entertainingly engrossing.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Here's the secret to the DaVinci Code... IT SUCKS!,"I just came back from seeing the film and I couldn't be more disappointed. I am not some religious addict or a freedom fighter for albinos, nor am I a purist who demands that the movie stay close to the book (which it most certainly does, to an awful degree). The problem with the movie is that Ron Howard was so preoccupied with trying to stay as close to the novel as possible that he forgot to tell his own story. I have enjoyed as many of Howard's films as I have disliked, but I thought he knew what he was doing with this one. It seemed like a the first cut of the film. There was no focus, everything was jumbled together and squeezed into a very long 2 1/2 hours. He should have gone the simple route and focused on the plot, not try to deepen the characters with an excessive use of flashbacks. The story is what people loved about the book, the hunt for clues, not understanding Langdon's claustrophobia or Sophie's personal issues. It's the story that was fascinating and Ron Howard forgot about that. Also, there was no suspense. It was predictable and dull. Not even during the car chases was there ever a moment of pure excitement. Truly the biggest surprise at the end of the DaVinci Code was indeed that it sucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fine movie that remains true to the book,"I just got back from watching 'The Da Vinci Code' and I think Ron Howard has made a brilliant movie. He has been so true to the book that no Dan Brown fans can complain. Other than 'The Da Vinci Code', I have also enjoyed reading 'Angels and Demons' and 'Digital Fortress', and I am definitely a fan. I think Dan Brown is a gifted storyteller and achieves what any writer aspires for - people to obviously first buy his books(!), then think about them and discuss them. My companions at the movie had not read the book, so my initial thought was that they were brave to watch the movie first. Yes, things happen at such a fast pace that sometimes you are left reeling! But all three of them loved the movie as well, and are off to read the book now!Let me warn you here that I am an Indian and have grown up watching movies that are, on an average, three and a half hours long! So two and a half hours is child's play :-), but if the movie does seem a tad too long at the end, I think that is a direct consequence of the book - I thought that Dan Brown outdid himself with the cryptex breaking scene, and anything after that had too much to compete with!Ian McKellan is delightful (as always). Just listening to his voice asking Langdon the three questions to gain entry makes you realize you are in for a treat! And I feel that Teabing's last scene as he is driven away in the car is longer than necessary to allow for applause!!For the first part of the movie, I thought other than being very French - avec accent and petite form - Audrey Tatou was very weak and contributed little else, but she kind of gets more involved in her role as the movie goes on, and I think her final scene where she dips her shoe into the pond and gives Tom Hanks a winning smile with a twinkle in her eye was a touch of genius at the end - it relieved both the built-up tension at that point in the movie and elicited the most appreciative laughter from the audience in my theater.I thought Paul Bettany was fantastic - what a talented actor. After seeing what a likable guy he is (on a talk show), I can now appreciate his acting abilities - the disturbing portrayal of a troubled soul - all the more.Tom Hanks seemed a bit wooden - for Tom Hanks, that is... I think being such a fine actor, he makes it look so easy - too easy sometimes, almost like he is less than completely involved. Although, to be fair to him, I think he was true to Dan Brown's Robert Langdon, and other than spontaneously morphing into a young Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks could really have done little else to improve on his character!Technically brilliant, with the past and present woven together with magnificent special effects, and an appropriately haunting musical score to boot. All in all, definitely an enjoyable afternoon's viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was so uninteresting that there were loud yawns in the cinema! I think the main problem of this film is that there were too many explanations and hypothesis telling. It almost becomes a documentary with all the history lessons. There were so much talking and left no time for action. Nor was there time for real character development.Disappointing film, I would say. Or maybe it was just because I had my hopes too high.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Enjoyable,"Good adventure story, reminded me of the better Bond films before they became campy extensions of late 1960's puerile television shows. Curiously I found the book had a better adventure feel to it, in the sense that it was not very difficult to suspend a sense of disbelief. The film, on the other hand, and it's use of very graphic special effects and gadgetry, seemed to be upstaged by these devices and lacked a certain amount of ""believability"" - regrettable, to my way of thinking.Two things came to mind: 1- there is a scene where the British shoot someone, and they fire single shots in succession. This is contrary to the ""double tap"" rule used by British police. Also, there is a religious reverence to the film at times that seems out of place.Very glad to see it do so well at the box office opening weekend, in spite of critics that seemed to consistently pan it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good adaptation,"usually, most of the films based on a book are much worse than the book, but this is an exception. The book, though enjoyable, is quite bad (it has had these enormous success only because it criticize the Vatican, anything more; the book is like a funny comic, any literature value, but good for enjoying the time). However, the film is rather good (which was a surprise). The cast is really good: if I had to choose the best actors for all the roles, I'd chosen the same that were there, so, I can not complain! The film has a good rhythm and it does not stops during most of the film, the action develops itself in a fine way (good directed) and the puzzles are not boring but interesting.Maybe the ending is quite slow, and this, in addition to the great longness of the movie can result tiring for some people. To sum up, I'm quite pleased with this film, I expected it to be bad, but it is enjoyable. If you are not able to be easily offended about theological subjects, probably you will have a good time. It is curious that it is not needed to have read the book to catch everything that happens, which is unusual.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I think Paul Bettany did a great job as Silas. *applause* and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing and Jean Reno as Captain Fache, were just so great as person can expect from great actors as they are.all in all.. movie was good and there was a great cast, but the book was still better.Should we now expect a movie based on Angels and Demons?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
True to the book.,"Some might think that Da Vinci Code is rubbish, but the plot and characters are really quite true to the book. Although Tom Hanks might not have been the best actor to play Langdon, he played the part as close to the character as he possibly could. Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, and Jean Reno are probably the best actress to play their respective parts (except perhaps the changes made to Reno's character). Paul Bettany was nothing short of amazing as Silas and there were no ""giggles and guffaws"" at him. You could read the book along with the film if you wanted (or could read that fast). There were many lines from the book to make it enjoyable to those who have read it.This film is absolutely worth sitting in a room of strangers for more than two hours. It's full of fun, excitement, and knowledge. And anyone who enjoys films of faith and, well, of action should absolutely see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A pleasant surprise...,"After many attempts to persuade me otherwise, I braved the Da Vinci Code on opening night. Expecting the worst, I must confess to have been pleasantly surprised by this movie. So all right, the book was better, but isn't it always?Despite the negative reviews it got in Cannes it stands well on it's own right, bringing forth a great plot with enough twists to keep the audience entertained. I'm sure that if I hadn't read the book prior to seeing the movie, I'd be going on and on about what a great movie this is.Tom Hanks, Jean Reno & Ian McKellen delivered a fantastic performance. The rest of the cast also did an amazing job, however Tautou left me a bit cold. I'm not saying her performance was bad, but it wasn't very good either. She just didn't bring much depth to the character,so I couldn't really sympathize. And, as much as I hate admitting that the critics were right, there was indeed not enough chemistry between Hanks & Tautou (they give off sparks in the book!).I loved the way this movie/book transforms everyday reality into something of a mystery. Things we walk by or dismiss as 'ordinary' are given a whole new dimension. It also deals with religion and it's impact in our reality. A big plus to this movie is that instead of letting the French characters speak in English - as most movies do- they had them speaking french, giving the movie something extra. And I absolutely loved the ending shot!Some of the less positive aspects of the movie are the omission of a few important parts from the book, something that would have definitely added more depth and suspense, and the rather hollow characterization. Silas, amazingly portrait by Paul Bettany, was simply the bad guy. The futile attempts to give us an insight to who he was hardly sufficient. In the book I really felt for him, here: Nada! Off course I can understand that it's mostly because of insufficient time. 2 hours isn't enough to make the characters really come to life.All in All a definite recommendation for those who haven't read the book, and for those of us who have- it may be a bit annoying knowing what's going to happen and dissecting the differences between movie and book-but it's definitely worth seeing The Da Vinci code come to life!Not the best, but one of the better movies I've seen lately.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a fun movie to watch.,"I did not expect the movie to be as good as the book. Nor do I think that the 'Da Vinci Code' story is suitable to be made a movie. But with all the publicity and the excellent cast playing I watched the movie and I expected something entertaining. Well I was disappointed. Of course Tom Hanks and Jean Reno's play was great because they can play almost anything but Audrey Tautou's performance was very poor, clearly she was not the actress suitable for the job. None of the characters had a glimpse of the personality and vitality they are supposed to have in the novel. And the flow of the movie did not keep you interested to keep watching it, I was more than bored in the middle. And with the budget spent to it I really believe the 'Da Vinci Code' to be the biggest failure of last year. I'm giving it 3 stars because I was able to finish watching it and I don't consider my money completely wasted.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A chilling adaptation,"To preface my comment, I would like to say that most movies based on books range from superb adaptations (LoR, Shogun) to so awful the writers (dead or alive) are spinning in their graves (Necronomicon, Congo, about a thousand more...). What The DaVinci Code does is make an incredibly solid adaptation.Frankly, I have no idea about what most of the critics are talking about. The movie ""xXx"" was, strangely enough, an incredible movie because of the characterization of Vin Diesel's character. What I think a lot of people are forgetting about The DaVinci Code's main character is that, frankly, he's not exactly personable. That's right: Robert Langdon is THE HEAD OF THE RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, he is not Indiana Jones (though Jones was a professor, he was actually characterized as charming, unlike Langdon who is awkward), and he is not James Bond. Tom Hanks, with the punctuated phrasings and awkward movements seem more correct than having him sip a martini and expose the code; it is only at times of deep, intellectual argument that he explodes in anger.Why does he not act absolutely terrified when guns are discharging next to his head and he being chased by the authorities? Because he did that during Angels and Demons, which occurred two or three years before the DaVinci Code. Enough of Langdon.Likewise, it is impossible to cram all the information from the book into the movie; the movie does get every plot point down, and as someone who is a fan of the book, I could not complain when I walked out of the theater. Another point is that many people seem to point out that the book is God's gift to literature: if you analyze it, all the book is is short, punctuated chapters that use a ""Description-Explanation-Action"" schema to express a really interesting idea. It's not literature, it's popular fiction. The movie is a fine adaptation of this schema, employing the scenery with great gusto (I was disappointed that they missed out at Kings College, but it was 2:29:00 long movie), the explanations came with full, flash back scenery for those without imagination of knowledge to know what a Templar was, what a Roman city looked like, etc, and the action was superb.Silas was not the only good part of the movie; though he was freaky enough to exploit Brown's imagery of Opus Dei. McKellan was bound to be the best actor, and proves the Leigh Teabing was in fact the only one in the book that actually had personality. Tautou actually made a grander impression in my mind than the Sophie from the book.Overall, this is a great adaptation. It's certainly not one of the greatest films of all time, but a steady 8.7 would best describe the masterful work of Howard, Hanks, and Tautou in accordance with a really good (yet fictional) idea.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good film,"I read the book and expected the worst based on the critics and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. In facts, I could enjoy it without constantly checking my memory of the book. Ron Howard did a pretty fine job following the script to make it a fiction without entering too much into the politics. The chemistry between the characters is actually quite good too - Audrey Tatou is a little stiff in the beginning but projects better emotions later on. The critics should step back and look at this movie without bias.I suspect the main reason behind the opposition is that it will entice more people to read the book, the later is actually much more damaging to the church (any church) by revealing how it controls human behavior and get its dime in the process.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as satisfying as the book...,"Okay simple as this, I'm not the most frequent reader or movie-goer for that matter but. This movie doesn't in any way capture you like the book does. It is simply two different worlds of storytelling with the book always leaving you wanting more at the end of every chapter, while the movie in it's essence looses that mostly because it rushes the story along so fast that you don't have the possibility to really realize what the story is about, and quite how big the consequences will be because of their discovery.All and all I feel that the movie could have given us more background on characters and most of all the story - and the reason for its grandeur.Until next time //Robin Karmakar",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrible. It is so bad that it completely degrades the movie goer.,"The minute they decided to shoot this lousy script is was all over for Tom Hanks and company. Was the book this bad? Could this movie have possibly been any worse? This movie was so uninteresting that I was tempted to get up and walk out, but I was still curious if they were going to actually find a conclusive end to their story. I'm sorry I stayed.Unfortunately, Davinci Code is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema this year. It is so bad, in fact, that it completely degrades the movie goer. Of all the theories of where the plot may go I had read, or come up with myself, the book or Ron Howard's answers were so incoherent and downright unintelligent that none had even suggested themselves as possible solutions.

I was so nervous that barely could read the legends, just paying attention on the scenes. At first, the movie starts with quickly thoughts, the way that Robert Langdon finds the first anagram of Leonardo DA vinci: The Mona Lisa appear to be a little easy, considering that in this anagram 26 letters composes it! But moving on...the story is well presented, the actors were really into the film! But here's the point, for those who did not read the book, the movie is wonderful, the person stays fixed ons the screen...you don't lose anything of the real message the book wants to tell! But for those who read the book, the movie seems a little weak, and become so little that it maybe very disappointing to these people that read the book, including myself! In the book, the very codes are solved after a lot of hard work of Robert and Sophie, once that in the movie it appeared a little soft and easy! So we cannot compare movie with book in the minimun details. And I understand that the producers and director couldn't make a movie that can be compared to the book, 'cause the book has so many things said, so codes, so point explained that this can only be passed in a Book! Therefore, the movie is great, the Book is great but we cannot compare both! one is movie industry and the other is literature! both passes messages in a different way!hugs, Maurício!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good but, unfortunately had a lot to ask for","Unfortunately the movie is not overly accurate to the book which was AMAZING!. If I had not read the book ahead of time I would have really enjoyed this film, but being a fan of the original the lack of continuity was a disappointment. The biggest inconsistency was the last 45 minutes of the film. Which took away from the important story information.On the positive side, Tom Hanks was amazing (as always), his portrayal of Robert Lagdon was not lacking what so ever. Audrey Tautou was also wonderful and really captured the character of Sophie Neveau. I also want to comment on Ian McKellen's performance. I felt that he was a very effective Teabing but, was definitely out shinned but Hanks, and finally I would like to applaud Paul Bettany's performance as Silas.The only question I have about his character is ""Where are the red eyes?"". I thought Albinos had red eyes?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not bad if you don't take the metaphysical aspect seriously,"From a purely entertainment perspective, the movie was pretty good. There was mystery, suspense and accomplished acting led by Tom Hanks and supporting cast. Depending on your metaphysical stance, you may or may not enjoy the movie since it pokes holes in the Roman Catholic religion. What's interesting is that the author of ""The DaVinci Code"" did not make up a lot of the issues, he took existing points that have been debated through the ages and incorporated them into his book. From what I understand, a lot of details from the book was left out (my guess the script writers didn't want to bog the story down with too much information) of the movie. I may grab a copy just to see what difference between the 2 is.Give the movie a shot, it's a decent movie. Some religious zealot will complain about anything. I found it interesting that some of those folks complained about ""The Passion of the Christ,"" which was a pure pro-Christ movie. Go figure.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Truth or Fiction? Does it Matter?,"This film was neither as good as the hype nor as bad as the backlash. It was what it was-- another Hollywood film blown out of proportion with an all star cast, good production value (except some of the shots seemed a bit underexposed at times) excellent soundtrack... and blasé unoriginal narrative. For someone like me the believability is not crucial because I find it no more or less believable than the stuff they try to teach us in Sunday school, although from a purist point of view I can understand why someone might be strongly opposed to it. What the detractors should realize is that their fire-branded criticism contributes to the hype as much as any advertising paid for by the studio. For that reason it became a must-see movie. And apart from the hype there's no big rush to go and see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As Good or Better Than the Book,"Brown's Da Vinci Code is basically a pulp fiction reworking of Umberto Eco's 1990 novel ""Foucault's Pendulum,"" but it's nonetheless entertaining pulp fiction. The same is true of the film version on all counts, but contrary to the pack-mentality pans that career critics have given it, the film in many ways actually improves upon the book, most notably in Hanks' fleshing out of Brown's incredibly wooden hero Langdon. Hanks gives him a sense of brooding determination that breathes life and complexity into the character; Tautou, Reno and McKellan are perfectly cast opposite him. I think a big part of the reason the ""pro"" critics are trashing this movie is that they bought into the book's hype without ever bothering to consider the fact that as original source material the book was only lightweight pop-bestseller fare to begin with.The controversy surrounding both the film and book has added to the mystique, but by now it's become tiresome in contexts of both the Christian protesters and of Brown himself.Catholics have the most legitimate beef in that the story basically portrays their religion as a massive fraud. But for Catholics and Christians in general to have protested so loudly and bitterly about a theory shockingly simple to debunk with even a cursory study of history, comes across as an embarrassing confession of a lack of confidence in their own faith.Brown has of course insisted from the start that his novel is factual. Why? For the exact same reason that Madonna has spent the bulk of her career playing trashy sexual innuendo off of her religion-steeped name: Stoking the fires of religious controversy will make you rich despite often profound shortcomings in talent.Brown is playing the religious firestorm to the hilt no matter what the historians say; the vocal outrage from offended Christians, as in the case of Madonna, merely generates mountains of free publicity and amplifies the venture's success. It's really quite a brilliant moneymaking ploy when you think about it.As for the rest of us? We're the happy recipients of the very thing that people generally expect - but find with diminishing frequency of late - in early summer movie fare: A good rip-snortin' adventure yarn.Everybody loves a treasure hunt, particularly when it involves musty arcana, shadowy villains, a claim of roots in historical fact, and real-world locales and landmarks - ""Da Vinci Code"" has gobs of all of them. It doesn't pack anywhere near the mandatory-second-helping wallop of the phenomenal ""Mission: Impossible III,"" but all controversy aside it's good, engaging and briskly-paced entertainment that's well worth the price of admission.The only downside is that the entire screenplay is noticeably rushed - presumably because the producers knew it was a guaranteed blockbuster and were looking to maximize the box office take with as short a film as possible. Which means we can perhaps look forward to a generously-extended Director's Cut come DVD release time? We're counting on you, Opie...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Controversial? Yes. Bad? Absolutely Not.,"There has been quite a bit of controversy over this movie since its release, as one can clearly tell by looking at its rating on this very website. Nobody would have probably expected the rating to be this low if asked to predict how good of a movie it will be 3 weeks ago. It is obviously opinionated, as it is one man's, Howard's, fictional theory on some of the backgrounds and origins of Christianity.Coming from somebody who has NOT read the book, I thought it was a great movie. Great acting, great directing, great story; didn't seem to be lacking anything in any category. But then again, I did not go in to seeing this movie with all that high of expectations, having not read the book and having read others opinions on it. The person I saw it with has read the book, and they said it was not bad by any means, just slightly disappointing.Did people question JFK, and all the opinions thrown out by Oliver Stone? Of course they did. Did that change it from being a good movie? No it didn't. This movie seems to be almost in the exact same situation, but there are so many more people that believe very strongly in their opinions on the subject. For someone who is for the most part indifferent about religion, such as myself, this movie is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tom Hanks rules the world!,"I'll start by saying that I love anything Tom Hanks is in so I may lose credibility.GREAT FILM!

People may not approve of certain religions but do they stand outside the places of worship and protest? Do they shun people who accept the foreign religion? Not in the norm! So why don't people just get over it and enjoy some interesting writing. It is, after all, a thrilling murder mystery and in no way does seeing the movie make a person less of a Christian.My advice, go see it but leave the kids at home and don't bring your friends who are unstable and questioning of Christian belief.I do no regret this movie or resent its existence.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who would have thought it would be so boring?,"I confess, I haven't read the book.But I like Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsmith (screenwriter), and the cast, so the movie seemed as though it should have been an amusing trip.The most amusing part is Paul Bettany's albino(ish) monk hanging around on a cell phone, but the rest of the movie is pretty dreary. Tom's Robert Langdon is fairly bland for an academic (hint: that much education makes anyone twitchy). Tatou's cop status seemed more like a prop than a career, and I would have loved to hear the conversations between Ian McKellen and Ron Howard over Sir Leigh's ""personal motivations."" Most of the actual plot unfolds through dialogue, and Akiva seems to be giving the finger to his screenwriter profs who said flashbacks were a bad idea. They are in this movie too.Quite a lot of the movie unfolds too much like National Treasure: clues found in historical artifacts that must be explained with a History Channel sound bite. For all its goofiness, National Treasure is more historical accurate than Da Vinci and saves us the self-flagellating monk.(note: I really am a fan of Paul Bettany, the amazing actor who came out of A Knight's Tale with you thinking he was still an amazing actor. The role of Silas, I hope, sounded amusing to him on paper but the character is so thin, it's the kind of role that someone hands over to Kevin Bacon for the sake of a quicker link to Audrey Tatou. Also, Silas appears to be in fairly good physical condition for a self-mutilator. The punishing gym scenes must have been cut.)",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very well done,"I think it's quite a good film and I don't know why the critics didn't like it. I hadn't read the book and it was gripping from start to finish. There was never a dull moment and the pace was even too fast at times, before the brain had had the chance to absorb all the new concepts and for emotion to arise and subside.If one really allows oneself to think, the scenes that hinted at Mary Magdalene carrying her precious burden, fleeing from persecutors were very touching. So were the brief scenes that hinted at the witch hunts that put thousands of women to death soon after the Catholic church came to power. There was hardly any time to let the emotion of that sink in, before we were onto the next scene. This is not a criticism, just to say that a lot was packed in a very brief space amount of time in the film and the pacing was just right to hold the attention of the audiences.Tom Hanks had a very cerebral role and I think he did a very good job. I don't know how else he could have portrayed all the inner workings in the mind of his character. Teabing was an eccentric, so it was easier for Ian McKellen to bring lots of spice in his portrayal.I think Audrey Tatou was a very good choice. I just think that her hair was too stiff and she had on too much make-up. A more natural look would have been better for the kind of character she played.Dan Brown deliberately ended the book where he did. Now it's up to us to think what we want and to discover our own potential. If one man can reach certain heights, so can all of humanity.",,Anonymous,Mystery
What is all the buzz about?,"I just watched this film and although I was interested and quite entertained to up until the part where Audrey Tautou and Tom Hanks go up to the church and find all the old documents, I must say that from there on I just wanted to laugh at the pure ridiculous nature of the scenes. Why not leave the debate open for discussion at the point where Ian McKellen's mystery is solved (I don't want to give anything away)and Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou go up to the church? I must say though, Paul Bettany was AMAZING; I hope he gets recognized for his role. All in all it was a good film but I would never watch it a second time.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could have been worse,"It's pretty hard to express my opinion of this movie in words, but I'll give it my best shot.I believe that as a movie, it was good. Tom Hanks delivered a great performance (as usual), Ian McKellen was great, and the rest of the cast were good as well. The directing, by Ron Howard, was great, too. So what's the problem with this movie, then? The problem is, it's based on the Da Vinci Code. And so, the movie inherits all the weaknesses of the book (except for Dan Brown's writing). It inherits the b.s. (no better word to describe it), it inherits the poor attempts at cliffhangers every second just to keep the reader (or viewer, in this case) in suspense, and it inherits the weak ending. It hurts the movie.Still, it wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't a great one, either. However, I suppose I expected it to be a lot worse than it is, so I ended up enjoying it, flaws and all.If you liked the book, you'll like the movie.

It kept me turning pages and was a quick read, but I was catching errors on almost every page. Sure, you could day it is fiction and you can't have errors in fiction. But I disagree. If you are going to weave a convincing tale, at least the foundation needs to be firm, and the book had too many problems that could have been fixed and made a stronger book.This problem seems to be fixed in the movie, or at the very least it comes off as less of an issue. maybe we are more willing to go along with shaky plots in films?

"Not Worth your, or my own time.","So I sat, with my drink and popcorn in hand, waiting to see a movie about a book I never read. The audience chattered away, and the people next to me kept commenting how they hoped this movie would do the book justice.After the credits ran, I was plunged into a world with so much exposition in it that I couldn't tell whether or not I was watching a fictional movie, or watching a reading of a script done by actors who normally do good jobs but this time around proceed to seriously lack ANY emotion (with the exception of Sir Ian Mack, shine on Sir, shine on).At what would be the movies many tense dramatic points, I couldn't help but sneer, as to the sheer cockiness of Tom Hanks' character when explaining an integral plot point.The script was sloppy. It was like watching someone on screen say ""We need people to understand how and why we're acting the way we are, so here's how and why, we hope you don't get lost for the remainder of the film"" The movie National Treasure, with Nick Cage, does a better job at explaining the whole Templar thing. Now, yes, they are coming from two different view points, but at least I wasn't hoping for it to end. With this I couldn't care less about what they were doing or why. There just wasn't enough motivation it seemed, either that or the actors did a horrible job of portraying it.How many endings does a story like this need? 1? 2? well I lost count...and that's not good.

Mediocre,"This is a bad movie that would have otherwise been completely overlooked (even given the cast and the director) had it not been for the book that it so religiously follows in almost every frame. Its sole purpose is to rake in the cash, but I am not sure it is going to do so. I confess my judgment on the movie would have been different had it not been for the director's abominable avoidance of risk-taking and his evident playing-it-safe attitude. Paradoxically, in this way the movie is completely opposite to the book - it is aptly made but unentertaining while the book is an interesting read, if a completely obnoxious one littered with quasi-scientific and quasi-historical BS.

"What a draaaaaag. But a nice movie, anyway.","I've never actually read the novel when I saw this (Which was just a couple of hours ago), so I guess I really can't make a comparison, but I am guessing that the novel was not as slow-paced as this movie. Though some parts definitely were in the booger-picking-bored level, this film definitely deserves some merits.There's nothing special about the acting, except maybe for that of Ian Mckellen's, but there was just something about Audrey Tautou in this film that I found so magnetic compared to her appearances in other films. Tom Hanks was a little bit more stern here in this movie, but I guess that projected look is what makes him perfect for the film (He always looks like that regular, normal guy who who just happens to get caught up in something - which is exactly the job description for this movie).Sequencing was very dull sometimes, and some historical cut-scenes weren't as emotionally effective as they should have been. The story in itself was very good, though, and the reason why nobody could sleep on any of the parts, despite it being boring, was that everyone knew something interesting would always pop-out out of nowhere. And they did.Keep in mind, as well, that aside from a few very gory scenes, some of the claims against Christianity and the Opus Dei may be too much for the devout to handle (But, well, I came in a faithful Catholic, and came out unmoved. The ""blurred line between fiction and reality"" that they claimed about the book was not present in the movie, or at least for me), but, nothing too offensive. In fact, the movie review board here in the Philippines - where the majority of the population are Christians - were supposed to give in at ""X"" rating, but since no clear and direct attacks were made against the Christian faith, only an R-18 rating was given, which I think was very fitting. Why some countries would give this anything less is beyond me.All in all, the only thing I took with me outside of the theater is the thought that Audrey Tautou and I are unexpectedly meant to be. This was a wonderful film, but nothing I will remember and appreciate beyond a week after viewing it, and probably something I won't pay for again.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Some Nice Visual Flourishes in a Muddled Adaptation of Dan Brown's Religion-Fueled Thriller,"The dense plot complexities of Dan Brown's novel around the pursuit of the Holy Grail made it a thoroughly entertaining read, but the unending plethora of detail looks contrived and ultimately predictable when translated on screen, especially if you have already read the book. Having Ron Howard helm this 2006 production certainly assures a mainstream-oriented consciousness would predominate, but unfortunately, it also means a lack of pervasive invention when it comes to conveying the dramatic twists and turns of Brown's story. Moreover, Akiva Goldsman's screenplay requires scenes of lengthy exposition which Howard tries mightily to offset with fantasy visualizations of speculative religious history. However, the core problem is that the filmmakers' diligent attempts at remaining faithful to the book make the movie feel overstuffed within its lengthy running time of 149 minutes.For those who don't know, the focus of the plot is on the hunt for the secrets hidden by the Priory of Sion including the Holy Grail. Some want to protect it, some want to expose it, and some want to destroy it. Harvard professor Robert Langdon and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, equipped with secrets shared by the murdered curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniére, are a step ahead of the police, assassins, and churchmen in full pursuit. After what looks to be a standard murder mystery set-up, the story finally gains momentum in the second hour with the creatively handled explanation for the hidden meanings behind Da Vinci's ""Last Supper"". A historical labyrinth is presented piecemeal, incorporating the origins of the gospels and the assimilation of pagan rituals and symbols into the early church's practices, all of which showcases the revelatory role of Mary Magdalene in scripture. While Langdon is the nominal protagonist, Sophie emerges as the pivotal character here, especially as they recognize how her past provides keys to vital information that could change history and religion.Casting is a challenge here since the actors are really there merely to support the convoluted storyline. As dazzling as she has been in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films, Audrey Tautou of ""Amelie"" fame is comparatively constrained as Sophie, though she also seems a bit burdened by the verbosity of the role. As Langdon, a lank-haired Tom Hanks is more problematic as his versatility is sorely tested by playing an academically-oriented sleuth. Stealing scenes easily is Ian McKellan as erudite, Grail-obsessed Sir Leigh Teabing. On the other hand, Paul Bettany merely exhibits a fairly one-note malignancy as the murdering albino monk Silas. Also left to their own elliptical devices are Jean Reno as the secretive Captain Fache and Alfred Molina as Opus Dei's designated kingpin, Bishop Sringarosa. The film's plodding pace is offset somewhat by Salvatore Totino's superb cinematography, especially at the Louvre and other European locales.Thinking back on the film, I keep wondering if it could have benefited more from a fresher director like Darren Aronofsky or Christopher Nolan, or even Quentin Tarantino's pulpish approach since the kinetic thriller elements are ripe enough for his cinematic audacity. The two-disc 2006 DVD set is certainly full of extras. Disc One contains the movie and several previews for upcoming theatrical releases. Disc Two has all the extras, which consist mainly of ten featurettes on various aspects of the production and its translation from Brown's hugely successful novel. The best of the bunch is ""The Codes of the Da Vinci Code"", which has Howard and Brown explain much of the symbolism used specifically in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Terrible, terrible, terrible","I nearly walked out of the theater- it was that bad. There were several reasons why. First, Tom Hanks. He's cute. He's harmless. He's like a playful little puppy. What he is NOT is a sexy Ivy League scholar/grail seeker a la Indiana Jones. The delivery of lines that should have made his character appear informed and intelligent came out stilted and halting instead. Even the addition of his near-mullet couldn't stop me from expecting him to yell ""WIIIILSOOOON!"" or spit out ""Stupid is as stupid does, Sir Leigh."" Second, the slight character changes. In the book, Sophie is educated, intelligent, and independent. She kicks butt and takes names. But Sophie was seriously dumbed-down for the movie- probably in order to make Hanks/Langdon look more intelligent, which didn't work. Sophie the character in the movie actually *whines* ""Can you solve it???"" which is completely out of line with the strength that Sophie the character in the book has.Also in the book, Langdon is fairly well versed in Grail study, and appears to accept if not support the thesis. In the movie- likely to make it more palatable to religious groups- he's a skeptic. His non-belief makes the whole plot line awkward. If he doesn't believe in at least some of this stuff, why does he continue to pursue it? Third- the interaction of Tatou and Hanks. The dynamics were underwhelming. No chemistry whatsoever. They may as well have been interacting with a blue screen.I am a big fan of the book, and was really looking forward to the movie.

"Delightful thriller. Minor logic 'problems', but belief stuff aside, this is a brilliant and rousing chunk of movie magic and movie fun!","The spiritual 'truths' of 'The Da Vinci Code' are not the point. What does seem more important, and worthy of our consideration vis-a-vis the movie, is the phenomenon whereby whenever something powerfully new is in the offing, and then the old-school die-hards resist it. It seems to be a story about how humans will do virtually any evil thing to protect their ego's stand on whatever topic is at hand.This movie is not anti-Catholic. The so-called 'codes' and secret societies depicted in the movie are illogical, and pure hooey, in my opinion. I personally think that whole aspect is silly. I have read the book, and thought it was all pretty silly then, too. Upon seeing the movie, I was not convinced otherwise.Having a world-wide religion broaden its base, and begin to appeal to the feminine, to the Universal Mother principle, is undoubtedly a very good thing. Perhaps some version of this, minus the hokem and hooey of Dan Brown's book, of course, is in fact The Next Big Step for mankind.That aside, the movie itself is extremely well made. It is very effective, well acted, and an exciting way to spend an afternoon or an evening. I heard some homegrown English critics on BBC Radio 4 this past Friday, reviewing it. One woman said she was gratified that the British actors acquitted themselves admirably, especially contrasted to the timid and hesitant character played by Tom Hanks. As much as her pride in the British actors was well-placed, her panning and criticising of Tom Hanks was unfounded, and grossly unfair. The character he was portraying WAS a timid and hesitant character. He played an academic who was swept up in a storm of mistaken identities and mistaken guilts and purposes. This is called 'act-ing', and is what a great actor such as Hanks excels at doing. I thought Hanks did a fabulous job of being someone--- an intelligent, well educated, and basically good and wholesome someone--- who got caught in events way beyond his control, that he neither understood nor could control. Audrey Tatou (Sp?), the French actress who played the other main character, also did a wonderful job. It was refreshing first to hear her speak English (because I speak English, of course). Second, it was nice to see her play a 'real' person this time, rather than the simpering fluffs she played in 'Amelie' and another role I cannot remember the name of just now.Ian McKellan was amazing, as usual. Isn't funny that it now seems that he is in HALF the movies coming out of Hollywood these days? He deserves the success, as he is a great and sturdy actor. Paul Bettany, also in director Ron Howard's previous film, 'A Beautiful Mind', was great, as was Alfred Molina--- who continues to defy categorization as to his nationality. Funny, the BBC 4 Brit-praising critic did not mention him! Molina is such a chamelion--- another great actor. He is a native Londoner, and his generic Euro-Dark looks allow him to repeatedly play Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians, or whomever else the script (and subsequent paycheck!!!) calls for.The cast--- superb all around. Marvelous! So, forget the churchy stuff, or not, as you will. But do leave your logical brain at the door, and you'll have a wonderful time at the movies with 'The Da Vinci Code'.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not as bad as I remember,"I read the book and saw this when it came out. I remember not liking it then, but re-watching it now 16 years later, it's not terrible.

The Da Vinci Bore,"I'd only read around 1/3 of Dan Brown's the Vinci Code, before going to see this film, however I was sat with people who had read the book and bar one scene when Silas should've used a candlestick instead of a book/religious trophy, the film was very close to the book, but that doesn't mean it'll be a great film. The film is just full of dull ""oh my god it's/that/he/she/they..."" type moments, but Howard doesn't embrace that. Instead he makes them dull, better Cinematography could've made a lot of the scenes in the film better instead of boring and mind-numbingly boring. Ron Howard (Apollo 13), is a great director that knows how to exploit the audience for the reactions he wants, however this is quite hard when the suspense and tension dies down before the final 'clue' has been given to Langdon.Tom Hanks (Langdon) and Tattou (Neveu) had no 'chemistry' what-so-ever, whether or not Ron intended to create 'passion' between Tattou and Hanks, who knows, because the scenes between the two characters look like a half-hearted job at romantic sequence with neither actor caring, nothing is there and it's clear as hell. On top of this you had a stale, yet highly amusing performance from Sir Ian McKellen. It felt at times he was lecturing the audience on the history of the times rather than carrying on the story and with the plot already all over the place, this wasn't needed. The only actor which I enjoyed in the film was Paul Bettany as the religious Opus Dei monk Silas. He fit the psychotic, yet lonely role of lost man perfectly. Jean Reno was same ol', same ol' as yet another detective. Nothing new.The ending of the film dragged on, was hugely predictable and failed in so many ways that it killed my enjoyment of the film and ultimately was an important factor to why I gave it such a mediocre score. The 'key' scenes were impeded by stone-cold acting that didn't help such a predictable and clichéd script. I hadn't even read the book yet at one point I was able to recreate the script before Hanks had even spoken a word. Following on from this, no tension or suspense, it probably will leave many in a confused state of ""oh so that was the twist."" It was met with a cold silence as it was forwarded to the audience so poorly, Hanks and Tattou didn't connect on any level needed for such an ending and it was something that could've been covered in 10mins and better.All in all, from somebody that hadn't read the novel all the way through, I thought it was a mediocre film at best. Remove Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, Audrey Tattou, Jean Reno, Sir Ian McKellen and re-shoot the ending, then you'll have a slightly better film. See Brick instead, it's a lot better film that cost nowhere near what Howard spent (and I'm honestly wondering where the $160 million went?).5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not bad,could've been a great film.However, you can't help but feel really disappointed.","Da Vinci Code is one of those novels that I kept reading over and over again and yet be bewildered by its twists,turns and surprises.It was a book that had my jaw dropped wide open until I had finished the whole book and solved all the mysteries and yet kept me hooked into it.It was an addictive book with facts that may or may not be true.But it had everyone under its spell.It's one of the smartest and most brilliantly written books,where the fun never stops.A book where you will not be able to stop turning the pages.The twists,the surprises to the end of the book will hold your breath.That was the magic of the book and it was the finest I've read in a long time.No doubt a movie was to be made.But could that film live up to its source?That is rarely a possibility,especially when the film is booked as Hollywood Blockbuster.The film is neither good or bad.It isn't a terrible film,it's just too bland and straightforward that you are able to predict everything that goes on.Even the minor alterations become obvious.I had massive expectations ,like everyone.With a skilled director,with a great cast and a producer who has produced good movies.It was bound to be great.Except,the writer was Akiva Goldsman.That's where I went all skeptical about the film.If you check his resume,it will shock you that why did the producers hired him.But then again,he did Beautiful Mind.A great pedigree on its shoulders,it should've been great.But no,the film's execution is so uneven and so messy that you are unable to find any good points about the film.We all the know the story too well.But at least the makers could've changed it a bit rather than making a way too faithful book to screen presentation.Everything,sadly,becomes too predictable,leaving no surprises.The book had an excellent setting,and an exciting pace that kept your hands turning the pages.The film has none of the excitement and an uneven pace that will either bore you with its dull conversations or will want you to yell out loud.I mean ,even the book's conversations felt so entertaining,whereas the film's felt so banal.There scene that were really lame and poorly executed.Something I didn't expect from Howard.And of course,lifting almost 80% of its source.When it comes to chases and action,it's fine.But when it comes to the revelations and explanations,it becomes cheesy and lame and you laugh at its execution.In the book,the the factoids explanations was what hooked you in and made the book such a classic,but in the film the facts and explanations seem really boring and lame,poorly done except for its flashback sequences,which were impressive.The only saving grace here are some standout performances and accurate casting.Sir Ian Mckellen couldn't have been better cast in a role that I pictured him playing when I read the book.His perfect portrayal of Leigh Teabing is what makes this film worthwhile, for a while.Although,after the big reveal he is just another actor disposed.Another actor who took me by surprise was Paul Bettany as Silas.I never thought of him playing a role like this,but he just proved his talent.He manages to evoke the emotions of his character and his chilling performance really makes Silas come alive.Hanks is a terrible miscast.Perhaps his worst role yet. His portrayal of Langdon is dull and expressionless.His wooden acting really disappoints me,as I had expected more.When it was announced that he would be Langdon,I was excited.But I guess it didn't matter now.While reading the book,the only actress that struck my mind who would be perfect for Sophie Neveau was lovely Audrey Tautou.The character's description matches with her and she was well cast.Except,she couldn't pull it off.She looks totally silly with her weak accent.The makers made a joke out of the character.Most of the times,when she delivers a classic line from the book,I'd be having chuckles.She was a let down to a great character.Alfred Molino is fine.But he's underused.And Jean Reno plays his routine cop character,which I've seen many times before.I had no one else in mind who would play him but he just lets down.And as the smartest character of the book is turned into the stupidest character in the book,Jacque Sauniere.There was more depth in the character in the novel than it is in the film.Director Ron Howard pulls a few surprising elements and handles a number of scenes with his skills but overall he lets down big time as he couldn't hold the film well.His visual taste is fine but doesn't apply to the film.Forget about the writer,he's just made a terrible adaptation.The film has a stunning look to it.It's visually entertaining.Even if under uses its masterful setting it still manages to capture the essence of the book.The score is fine while the editing could've been better.The flashbacks or the re-tellings of the past events were the key highlights of this film.That's what succeeds in the film.Once again,the book-better-than-the-film claim could be easily applied here.What could have been a great translation,is turned into a bloated and disappointing film.It succeeds in only few parts.But regardless of all that,there is a lot to enjoy in this brainless adaptation.It is ridiculously entertaining.It has a gripping atmosphere that will keep you interested as long as it can.It's certainly loads of fun. But don't expect a classic.Another could've been better film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Can movies be rated with minus values?,"Given that I hated this movie, and taking into account a particular user review. I can only presume that I am both biased, and have a sub-par intellect, as I deem this movie - Awful - It fails on almost every level. With brief interludes of decency, not least 1. when the end credits role, and 2. when the end credits stop rolling.I suggest firstly, reading the book. Although not much better than the film, it will certainly improve your fundamental reading skills.

You can even laugh at those waiting to buy tickets for this film if you wish.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing! Where's the thrill in this thriller?,"I have to admit that I am very disappointed. This film is supposed to be a thriller, right? But where's the thrill? I was expecting to be entertained and to be in the situation of the characters themselves. The critics are right. The movie is boring. Of course, the first viewing will be fine. But if viewed multiple times, this film is likely to bore anyone to death.I've read the novel from which it was based and I can say that if this film was viewed by a non-reader, they will be lost and confused. I have a feeling that most of the people (apparently non-readers) in the theater I was in didn't understand the movie well. They just come in to check out about the film and satisfy their curiosity.There are several reasons why I really want to see this. 1) To see how they present the key scenes 2) To see the locations! 3) To compare my own vision of the film vs the director's vision (just like any other movie adaptations) 4) To see Ian McKellen on the big screen for the first time since The Return of the King... 5) To see how they handle the mystery of the Holy Grail or whether they will stick to Dan Brown's theories or not.As you may notice, I'm not after the film's faithfulness to the source. I actually didn't mind it now after I got used on LOTR and Harry Potter were adapted. HP2 is very faithful to the book that it takes away the excitement from the viewers. They never let the viewers engage in breaking the codes. Many fans hate HP4 because it deviates from the book but I say, it is the best movie in the Harry Potter franchise (as well as HP3). In DVC, it's like I'm watching just to see how things will go, there's a little element of surprise. I want to see more. The movie is too long. It would be better if they removed the ""Robert the claustrophobic"" subplot in the movie.This film is TOO faithful to the book. Even the lines are lifted from the book word per word and it's a good thing. They edited the film in such a way that it follows every chapter breaks in the book. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate well onto the screen. I wish the screenwriters add something more to make this movie more exciting. At one point, they even showed a flashback on how the Langdon and Neveu escaped from the plane (just like in the book). But in the film, the scene is out of place. I have to say that being too faithful to the source material is not always a good thing. If I am to blame someone, that would be the author Dan Brown. Yes, his book made many non book-readers to pick up a novel and read (including me). But when I re-read the novel, the flaws are evident. It becomes too shallow. And because of that, the movie suffers.One of the key elements in this movie focuses on a ""secret that if revealed, would devastate the very foundations of Christianity"" Given the prerelease controversy surrounding the novel and the book, the secret the movie is talking about is already revealed to everyone that it isn't a spoiler anymore. For non-readers, the only thing that they have to figure out is the identity of the Teacher and a thing about Sophie.As for the actors, Tom Hanks is obviously miscast. BTW, I liked the way how Langdon think visually. The planets, anagrams etc. Langdon here is not the same as on the book because the Langdon here is doubtful. He even engage in a debate with Teabing. Audrey Tatou (Sophie) is very pretty. I've seen her in Amelie and she was amazing. Jean Reno (Fache) is the kind of actor who's always in a Hollywood movie in need of a French actor. I think he is the most sought-after French actors today. Paul Bettany is very creepy as Silas. Too bad he wasn't given enough screen time. I was surprised to see Silas naked because he was wearing something in the trailer. In the movie, he's totally nude and I pity him for his ""corporal mortification"" thing. Ian McKellen (Teabing) delivers a great performance once again. It's in the way he speaks, wit, humor and eyes that make him a lovable character whatever role he is playing. He gives credibility on even the most crappiest line. Many people are surprised to know that Ian McKellen is gay. Someone in an internet forum said that he is the most straight-looking gay actor.There are several scenes that I don't like very much. There are few action sequences in the film but many of them were poorly done. One of them is the SmartCar scene. It's not handled well. The camera is shaky that you can't understand what's happening. Most of the movie is talking scenes (just like the book). The theories are presented in a nice way through flashbacks. These flashbacks are nice. They could create a separate movie through them.I don't think anyone will have their faith shattered just by viewing this...especially Filipinos. And I don't think that the movie is blasphemous. Maybe I got used to it. That was my first reaction before reading the book. But once I read the prologue, I never stopped reading.The Da Vinci Code is not actually an excellent book but it is good page-turner. The movie adapts the book too faithfully that the real essence of adventure and thrill is lost. If you want to be entertained, go and watch National Treasure. It's a better movie. Dan Brown's novel succeeds because of its controversial premise. But I have to say National Treasure is a better thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Somehow disappointing,"As a fen of Dan Brown's novel, I must admit I was rather disappointed by the movie. The worst part was the casting - neither Tom Hanks, nor Audrey Tautou were right for their parts. Perhaps, only Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany fitted my imagination. Also, some important parts of the book were skipped and I believe it would be hard for someone who doesn't know the story, to follow it completely. This also stole from the tension and dynamics, which are crucial to ""The Da Vinci Code"". I must mention that the effects were good and there were some amusing moments that made the film entertaining. So, I suppose those who haven't read the book would enjoy the movie; fens of the novel, on the other hand, will be frustrated.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Veni Vidi  Da Vinci,Having read the book (has anyone not?); it was difficult to experience suspense when you know the story but the movie covered the book very well and expressing the ideas and theories were the main focus of the movie - see MI3 if you want to see mindless action. Audrey Tautou was a charmer - more of her please. The controversy over the movie is hard to fathom. I think the Catholic church gets some bad press but then with secret organizations like Opus Dei what do they expect. The idea of Jesus being married and having a child is much easier to accept than that of the resurrection. Most of us never challenge the basis of our beliefs as nearly all of us are born into them via our parents and if it does nothing else the book and movie will arouse a questioning and maybe lead to either an affirmation or rejection of what we've been brought up to believe in without ever giving it a second thought.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could've been better...a lot better; but ended up being decent enough.,"It wasn't bad! I actually enjoyed it a good bit. Not a GREAT movie, but good. First and foremost, I have to say that, of all the films I've ever seen, casting Paul Bettany as Silas was probably one of the best casting decisions I've ever seen...he was absolutely perfect. Each and every scene of his in the film was electric...he commanded attention, and was able to simultaneously draw fear and sympathy to the character, as in the novel. I've always noticed Bettany in his movies, but this one really solidifies it for me...the man is incredibly talented (and I hope he wins out for Joker in the next Batman...I might actually go see it if he does, ). Um, anyway, so...aside from a few wooden moments from Tom Hanks, and a few cringe-worthy lines, (ie. ""No, this can't be, what I think it is"" ), the movie was pretty durn good. I found it well-paced, true to its source, well-acted, and interesting. It reminded me a lot of a slower, less action-packed version of National Treasure, which I realize many people hated, but I loved it (I love historical fiction, 'treasure' hunts, conspiracies, puzzles/codes, etc). My only major qualm was that, as someone who had read the novel, it was painfully obvious in parts that they had tried their best to make the movie less offensive than its source material...one critic said the movie was ""nervous about offending someone"", and that's true...although I'm not entirely sure how obvious that would've been to someone who didn't read the book. That's the major reason I gave the movie a 7/10, and not an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Screenwriter Goldsman and Director Howard couldn't turn this book into an enjoyable movie maybe that was impossible ( the book is quite talky and not filled with many action pieces ).

Great Movie for a great Book,"I found myself intrigue deeper and deeper as I was reading the book. I found it fascinating the way symbols change meaning throughout generations. I read the book in two or three days because of the suspense, well written mystery of the book. The movie was the cherry on the cake for such a wonderful book, but I have to say that I was not so much into it because I already know the story and thus the ending. I love the visuals, and the acting of Tom Hanks, not so much the French lady though.If you have never read the book, this movie is a must see, regardless of your religious beliefs, IT IS JUST FICTION and if you have read the book like me, this is putting a picture to the written material.I am not even going to comment on the crazy, close minded people who somehow think this movie is going to change what you have believe all your life.Also, watch out for the Christian fanatics outside the movie theater distributing pamphlets and the bible.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Now I understand the need for so much publicity,"This movie needed the publicity to get people to see it. And with that and trailers and all of that, you could get the idea that was going to be one of those movies that you'd have to see at the movies, at least, 2 times. I went to the movies to see it with high high expectations, boy was I disappointed or what? Bad acting, bad dialoge, weak script, and looooooooooooooong, by the near end of the movie all I could think was ""please roll credits!""I know it was a thriller, but I think they sold the idea of the whole ""Christ is not what you think he is"" so much that all we cared about was that, an explanation. The rest was just filling. I think the whole explanation is about 30 mins and the rest is them getting chased by cops.I'd have to say that the only one with a good performance was Sir Ian McKellen, he was good and believable, well Paul Bettany was good too, not great. Tom Hanks disappointed me so much, it's the first time I have to complain about his acting. You couldn't believe him for a second. And Audrey Tatou either, she was terrible! jean Reno was all right, not bad but not great either.I'm a Catholic and the reason I say this movie is bad has nothing to do with the concept of the movie, as a matter of fact, I found it quite interesting, plus I don't care what people say or don't say or he Church or whatever about Jesus, you either believe or you don't, it's up to you and it depends on how easy is to manipulate your faith.Go and see this movie or wait until it comes out to video, and ""find out the truth"" The Da Vinci code is a lame movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A chore for anyone except the Converted !,"Not having read the book but familiar with its contents and story - I found this film a real chore to endure - and not something I would like to repeat either. It was a film that appeared to be like a contestant in a reality show where it had to do 20 things in two and a bit hours. It appeared to be making sure it was covering the ground of all those who had read the book (so a lot of the book's scenes are there as well - as I understand from my partner) - but also deal with those who had no clue about anything. Hence the weird 're-enactments' from Christianity's past including Emperor Constantine, paganism's fall, The capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the secret the Knights Templar had found which allowed them to blackmail the papacy . For those in the middle - like myself - well , I kept thinking - 'there is no time for us to get to know - or care about these characters'. I think also it was an interestng clash of acting styles. The British actors had no problem getting into their roles (McKellen, Bettany and Molina) but Tom Hanks was a tourist in his own movie. As for Audrey Tautou - her strong French accent wasn't charming when you couldn't understand what she had just said. So for fans of the book - go see. Anyone else - hope Ron Howard has made a better film by the time the DVD comes out.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Faithful adaptation, excellent casting... and Howard didn't disappoint us.","Let me begin with what I think about the book. I think though it is poorly written, it is extremely clever in creating sensation. The characters are one-dimensional, the story too cheesy, but the plot and the theme are extremely interesting, revolutionary and its controversy well-marketed. And yes, the codes were entertaining.Now for the film, which obviously created more sensation than the book, delivers enough satisfaction to both... those who read the book and those who hadn't. My companion haven't read it yet but she enjoyed the film as much as I did. Howard created a very faithful adaptation of Brown's novel. He only omitted a few rather unnecessary portions of the story for the sake of time and left out one or two steps in the story's code-breaking sequence, which was perhaps good for a moviegoer who haven't read the book. For example, the film deals with only one cryptex. The film also introduces one or two added scenes that only added to the entertainment... like Sophie's joking attempt to walk on the water in the end.A strong feature of the film is its casting. Each main character is casted according to his/her nationality. Tom Hanks gives us another perfect professional performance as Robert Langdon. He's indeed not the way I imagined while reading the book but Hanks's expertise got over that feeling. On the other hand, Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu is absolutely what I imagined during the reading -- strong-willed, intelligent yet soft in demeanor. Tautou, an enormously talented actress as she is, makes Sophie one of the film's strongest points. There's much critical praise for Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing and I agree with the critics here. And finally for the two Opus Dei people, though Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa is under-utilised, Paul Bettany steals every scene he's in as Silas. His self-torture scene at the beginning is priceless.Then what are the film's flaws? One is certainly its wooden dialogues. Well, the basic plot may give rise to laughter when you present them with such flat words. And some of the viewers in the theatre indeed giggled when Langdon let out Sophie's secret in the end. I believe its for the film's attempted simplicity for the 'virgin' audiences. Still, there should have been more smart lines. The next thing is the rush the film runs with. Yes, one has to adapt a 500 page novel in a two-hour film. Still, some key secrets demand slow detailing... otherwise much thrill is lost. That's exactly what happened. At least the final secret about the Merovingian bloodline needed more time to grow. I think three hours should have been the film's ideal duration.Lastly, an appeal to the viewers: please don't rate or judge the film from your religious standpoint. Films/books are pieces of art and entertainment. I'm frankly surprised by this film's IMDb rating. It certainly is worth more. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely the year's one of the most entertaining films.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Job Well Done!!,"I have read the Da Vinci code and while still a strong Catholic, found it an interesting, well written story. Despite the story's premise, it does not actually contain any mind-shattering anti-doctrinal revelations, simply because none of the stuff in the story can be proved anyway, and even if it could, this is hardly Dan Brown's fault - it would have come out eventually, I think! I can't really understand what many of my fellow Catholics are so worried about. I guess the idea of worshiping at the tomb of Mary Magdelene is blasphemous, but as the existence of this tomb is in itself debatable, let alone it's whereabouts, I think it all essentially breaks down to a storm in a teacup.No, what Brown has done is written a good, maybe even great story. A rippin' good yarn, so to speak, and having seen it translated to film last night when it opened in Sydney, I wasn't disappointed. Tom Hanks played Robert Langdon exactly as I'd imagined him when I read the book, so I was impressed by his acting and Ron Howard's direction. Audrey Tautou, I felt, was a little weak as Sophie Neveau - personally I'd imagined Sophie's character as stronger, a little more forceful (although in one scene Tautou smashes the albino monk's head against the ground and man! It was nasty! Perhaps even too violent, but anyway ...). Teabing, played by Ian Mckellan was bang-on, I thought, almost exactly how I'd imagined him (although my Leigh Teabing was slightly younger) and McKellan's acting was, as usual, spectacular!The scenery, most of it the real-life venues of the book, was spectacular and enchanting. After reading the Da Vinci Code and now seeing the movie, I am more determined than ever to visit the Louvre and to learn how to speak French! The paintings in the films backdrop, though we only get quick glimpses of them, add a rich and ancient dimension to the aesthetic experience.As in the book, some of the codes are quite predictable, not so mind-bogglingly difficult to crack, and the movie can be slow in parts. I would perhaps have liked to see a LITTLE more character come out in Hanks (Langdon) although I think Ron Howard was very weary of making this The Da Vinci Code and not a 'Tom Hanks movie' so I understand why this didn't happen. Overall, I thought the book was adapted to film excellently. Even my husband who hasn't yet read the book and is a hard-edged critic when it comes to movies, was impressed. You feel as if Ron Howard has been faithful to Dan Brown's original, and hasn't just gone off on a tangent of his own, which often happens in a novel-to-screenplay adaption.I would advise anyone, particularly those who have read the book, to see the film, but PLEASE see it at the cinema, otherwise you miss an amazing part of the experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Good movie boring if you've read the book,"This of course is my opinion. I read the book about 6 months ago and was very pleased with the way it was written and the story it told. Fiction, non-fiction, it didn't matter to me i am in no way religious.The movie follows the book almost to a point. It followed the book so closely I became bored. Don't get me wrong it was an amazing movie, but because i was so familiar with the story, I often became uninterested.Many people are complaining that they cannot understand Sophie. I have no idea what they are talking about, after long enough time I forget she was even french.Basically this movie is an amazing feat of cinema with many elements that Dan Brown could not make us imagine through just words.Religious or not i think everyone who wants to see this movie should.

what more to ask for,"This movie for which the Greek Orthodox Church expressed its' formal disapproval and urged people not to see it, thus magnifying their natural curiosity and making more popular, is a movie I very much liked despite that the opinion of the critics internationally and in Greece was in general negative. I had read the book without which I think is rather impossible to understand the movie. The mental problems of the book have been obviously simplified for the needs of the movie but in general I found it considerably close to the story line of the book. The best actor was Ian MacKellen who was the perfect choice for Teabing. The movie was bringing forth the ideology of the book concerning the hotly debated religious issue whose writer claims that is based on true facts. The movie and the book have generated a huge amount of secondary literature which explores every conceivable aspect of the problem on which no reason exists for to dissertate here. I think that a movie is watched as a recreative experience and not as a medium of expressing views on metaphysical problems which after the French Revolution have become matters for the individual conscience in the Western world at least. As a form of sophisticated entertainment I found the movie very satisfying, shooted in fine locations, involving fine works of art, beautifully built churches, action and surprise, clever dialogue, adventure, timeless and insoluble questions, the city of light= Paris, fine actors- what more do the public and critics want? More explicit sex?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Redundant for those who have read the book,"If you have neither read the book nor planned to read it any time soon, you shall find this movie perfectly entertaining. However, to all those of you who have already read the book, the movie may very likely appear simply boring.Generally I prefer to watch a movie adaptation of a bestseller novel *after* reading the original story itself. Following this habit, I read the book in the last three days before I saw the movie tonight. Accompanied by a very fresh and detailed memory of the novel, I found myself yearning to fast-forward (not that I could) during the whole movie - until the very end.The thing is, this movie offers no additional value to the readers of the book. The acting is average, quite unimpressive - neither in good nor in bad way. The camera work is plain as well, there's hardly any spectacular scene - not even the final one, which has certainly been designed to be moving but doesn't really fulfill that expectation. There is little special effect in this movie - which is nobody's fault because the story simply doesn't require much. In the end, nothing of this movie exceeds a reader's own imagination in any aspect.On the negative side, the story has proved to be quite hard to compress for the screen. Even with a length of over two hours, the movie has cut off some significant parts of the original story and squeezed what's left even more remarkably, resulting in many small inconsistencies, logic holes and incredible speedups - specially regarding the development of human emotions over time (or rather no time, in the case of the movie), all of which not present in the book. I don't want to blame the screen writers for doing a bad job, I just think the story is simply hard to adapt in this way. Maybe if the movie had cut even more parts of the novel, it could have handle the remain more properly?Bottom line, the story itself is definitely worth enjoying - as long as you don't take it as an religious insult, of course. Whether you choose the book or the movie is up to you, however the former makes the latter pretty much redundant.PS: Sophie is definitely more attractive in my imagination. ;)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Believe the hype,"I didn't want to believe all the awful reviews this film received. I thought any critic worth his salt would be forced to rubbish this film, due to its source material. Unfortunately however they were correct. The book, i agree, is engaging and pacey, despite the fact everyone thinks Dan Brown should write like Shakespeare, but the film is the exact opposite. Dull and tedious with flat characters (well apart from Ian McKellan) and almost humorless. Maybe if you haven't read the book (yes i mean the indigenous tribes on the Indian archipelago of Nicobar) then maybe it's worth watching just to see what all the fuss is about.

"Good start, great middle, poor ending","The Da Vinci code starts out good with solid story telling and you are sucked into the story, near the middle of the movie a new character is added to the plot which really turns things into a very enjoyable and addictive movie, but the end and finale of the movie was not well done, it was too short, not enough in-depth, missed out a few key point which were mentioned in the book and this does reflect on the movie as a whole. Recommended for those who have read the book (plenty of you out there); average Hollywood thriller for the those who haven't read it.The actors do their best at bringing the book's characters to life, with Sir Leigh sticking out head and shoulders above Langdon and Sophie, his character is witty, fun and enthralling.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This truly is a movie version of what I imagined as I read Dan Brown's best-seller; for good and bad.,"The Da Vinci Code Critics have been complaining about the pacing in ""The Da Vinci Code."" Dull, I've heard. But I have to say that it's quite entertaining despite its running time - approximately 148 minutes.This truly is a movie version of what I imagined as I read Dan Brown's best-seller; for good and bad. Hence, if you liked what you read... I'm still amused by the fact that people around me took Brown's novel seriously. People who usually are skeptics believed some of the stuff because Brown blurred the line between fact and fiction. I want this stuff to be true, and the world would be a more interesting place if it were. But it's a cock-and-bull story if there ever was one. That becomes even more evident as we see the movie. This is a more straight-faced version of Indiana Jones. Dr. Jones for the ones who consider themselves too old for the archeologist's adventures.As I see the film I sense that this is an architectural construction; it's lifeless and the people involved made it for the money. Still it's useful for entertainment. These actors, who are otherwise great at what they do, hold back and you can practically see dollar signs in their eyes. Ian McKellen can do this stuff in his sleep, Tom Hanks has acknowledged that he made it for the money, Jean Reno literally sleepwalks as Captain Fache; the acting is competent, but these guys don't seem the least bit hungry.""The Da Vinci Code"" is good entertainment. Even though I know all the twists and turns beforehand, and despite the lack of passion from the cast and crew.THREE STARS *** Note: The newspaper article with the picture of Sophie Neveus family before the car crash... is the brother Clint Howard?

Disappointing and boring,"This movie is not a good movie. First of all for a film with so little action 2.5 hours are much too long. Some scenes only seem to be confusing. Then the many subtitles are also very peeving. Some scenes like the whip-scene are very brutal and superfluos. Like the book the plot of this movie is really strange and I assume that Dan Brown only wants to talk about a topic no movie before talked about in order to earn money. The actors are good, especially Tom Hanks and Ian MacKellen. The music at least at the end is reasonable. All in all Tom Hanks is not able to make the movie better because of its very strange topic and a too dark atmosphere.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not half as bad as people are making out.,"I saw this last night and would give it a solid 7/10. I think the problem the makers had was trying to get the very convoluted story across with reams of dialogue. The nature of the story demands this but it takes a while and doesn't have the 'page-turner' effect of the book as these revelations, which happen often, are not visually appealing but portray images when you read them. I think they did as well as could be expected getting a complicated story to the screen intact. Silas the monk is menacing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache could have been made more of but as is the nature of the story, it doesn't lend itself well to character development, the main focus of the film is on the revelations, which are just spoken words. Ian McKellen is excellent as Sir Leigh Teabing, the eccentric English symbologist who turns a bit nasty and Audrey Tatou as Sophie Neveu is exactly how you would have imagined her to look whilst reading the book. As for Tom Hanks, well he's Tom Hanks, you know what to expect but he didn't really make you root for him as you tend to in the book and he is probably one of the few characters who has the chance to. Watch it, even if you have read the book, it isn't that bad!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good! It does take a not bias person to enjoy it.,"First off, I will admit, the book was a better nerve bending thriller. But the movie explained everything very well and made it a psychological thriller. At the beginning, for those of you who are familiar with the book, it seemed a bit rushed. I thought that was a good thing. The movie got straight to the plot and the interesting information. Second, the music was fantastic. Hans Zimmer is a genius. If you don't like the movie, definitely buy the soundtrack. The music was one main aspect that kept my eyes wide open waiting to see more. In conclusion, very good movie.

Better than I expected,"Having throughly enjoyed the fast-paced novel of Dan Brown, and then having read some of the not so nice reviews in the last few weeks, I didn't really have any expectations for this movie. But, I was pleasantly surprised! It wasn't the best movie that I have seen, and it wasn't the worst either, by any means. The characters were quite spot on (if compared to the book), and I especially enjoyed Sir Ian McKellan's Leigh Teabing: he becomes more fanatical as the movie goes on. Tom Hanks did a good job portraying Robert Langdon, although the hair definitely bothered me. I think for me, the most enjoyable thing was how closely they stuck to the novel. Of course a few ""hollywood"" adjustments were made, and of course the book is better (isn't it almost always?)but still I enjoyed the movie, and didn't find it nearly as slow moving as I expected, having read the reviews. I went with a friend who had not read the book and she said she had no problem understand what was going on. In the end, I came out of the theater happy to have seen it. If the rumors are true, it will be interesting to see how they do ""Angels and Demons""...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A classy and very faithful adaptation.,"After re-reading the book a month ago, I walked into this movie a bit leery how it would be treated on screen despite my faith in Ron Howard who is 1 of my 3 favorite directors (Spielberg, of course, and Chris Nolan being the other 2). But Howard gives us another very entertaining and smart movie. Dan Brown must be very happy. He should be. This is one of the most faithful movie adaptations ever. Nothing of any importance was left out and the movie benefits by turning intriguing words and ideas words into beautiful and often emotionally moving pictures plus the performances are top notch. It is very nicely cast. Audrey Tatou is the standout here. Tom Hanks gets better and better as the movie goes along (and at over 2 and 1/2 hours it goes a long way). In fact this movie gets better as it goes along. It picks up an emotional weight near the end that the book didn't give me. The writing and the editing are superb. It is a bit talky at times, but it never dragged. Whatever you feel about the book is how you'll feel about the movie. (I would actually give the book 8/10 or slightly lower than the movie.) For Ron Howard fans this isn't APOLLO 13 or Cinderella MAN, but it is close.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Indiana Jones in First Gear,"The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies that doesn't reach its potential as a movie because it doesn't realise the depth of character development needed to keep the characters interesting between action sequences. Perhpas Mr Howard should have taken a leaf out of the book of Mr Jackson to get a real view of how it could have been done. Instead, what keeps this movie going is the promise that somehow Langdon would find the secret- a promise that can only take this movie so far.Tom Hanks is interesting as Robert Langdon but the fact of the matter is that his character is too one-dimensional to really empathise with him. The same goes for Audrey Tatou whose revelation at the end is predictable and doesn't really add to the story as much as it should. The supporting cast however does a good job in keeping the storing interesting- with Ian McKellan stealing the show and acting the two principles off the screen. Alfred Molina is a sinister and driven villain as Bishop Arigarossa and Paul Bettany playing fanatical priest with glazed eyes and frightening devotion are also great, though underused.The fact of the matter is that this movie drags when these supporting actors are not on the screen despite its interesting premise ( which, by the way, is not new and has been bounced around historical fiction for a while ).The Da Vinci Code is worth a look if you're interested in history and are prepared to put a hypothetical theory into reality. But don't expect too much as it doesn't move mountains like other religious films, such as Life of Brian.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nice job by Ron Howard,"Saw it with the wife and friends over weekend. Having read the book may have been an advantage, as the couple we were with said they were hopelessly lost for the first half of the film. Ron Howard is a talented director who does a very good job with this material. I would think that some of the puzzles and most of the historical background would be pretty hard to convey in film. In fact I could almost see Howard wincing as he was forced to use those History Channel like recreations of the past with intentionally blurred film, computer generated crowds, and costumed non speaking role extras. Even with millions in the budget, it still looks made for TV during those scenes.On the plus side, the movie keeps moving, and Audrey Tautou is not hard to watch at least for me.As an adventure yarn, it reminds me of the Hitchcock films. A common ordinary man is thrust by circumstance into international intrigue. Forced into the situation, he uses common sense, American (British) values, and an amazing amount of luck, to defeat an organized and powerful foe. He also saves the female lead while at it.If you see this movie as an attack on your faith, I would suggest re-evaluating your beliefs. Those Catholics who are true believers would never have their faith shaken by a work of fiction like this movie. No more than a movie about the ""Protocols of Zion"" would shake the belief of an orthodox Jew, or the works of Salman Rushdie would affect true believers of Islam.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just another storyline to make money,"The media portrayed that there is so much controversy surrounding the book. After watching the movie I just feel that the apparent controversies are just exaggerated: The media is to blame for a major part of it. 'The Da Vinci Code' is just another one of those movies where things are portrayed differently contradicting or supporting the viewpoints/beliefs of most people.I went to the movie expecting so much. (Have to let you know that I have never read the movie. I just went to watch the movie straight up) I did not even find the movie to be as spectacular as the pre-talk was, but it is not a badly constructed story. I have to agree that it has some interesting sequence of events, thanks to Dan Brown's creative imagination (and apparent research). But then again, to me, it is just shocking that Dan Brown made too much easy money. It just reiterates the fact: how easy it is to manipulate peoples' minds to excite them just from a random author's perspective (the storyline).It would be a bit disappointing if 'The Da Vinci Code' ends up being a blockbuster or gets some good accolades. I wouldn't recommend anyone to not go and see it, but I think everyone should watch it to judge for themselves.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Don' listen to the downers, this is a well-made adaptation","Let's just get one thing straight, I am not some nut who believes every single thing about this story. I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it, it was a great page-turner. When I heard Ron Howard was signed to adapt the book I was thrilled. But after hearing that a lot of critics looked down on this movie, I decided I would go in open-minded. I was definitely impressed. This is a faithful adaptation that many people should go and see because it is a fast paced thriller that doesn't let down.For those that haven't read the book. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou) are drawn into a web of conspiracy after the discovery of Sophie's grandfather's death at the hands of an albino assassin, Silas (Paul Bettany). He has given them a set of clues that lead them to find the 'Holy Grail.' But hot on their trail is Captain Fache (Jean Reno). They seek the help of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) and soon the race is on to discover what the 'Holy Grail' really is.As adaptations go, this is a very good one. Although the book is definitely better, the movie isn't far behind. The acting is fine. My only problem was Tom Hanks, who I think was miscast. It did take some time getting used to him as the lead. Tatou, McKellen and Bettany are all great, though. Everything technical about the movie was fine. The only other problem I had with the movie was that it was too fast paced for me (if that makes sense). I found that some scenes could have been longer, because I found the movie a little rushed.But as an entertaining cinema flick, you couldn't do any better. It's a great movie and I am not disappointed.A solid 4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""It's One Of Those Read The Book & Skip The Movie Types""","The Da Vinci Code, based on the massively popular book by the same name, sees Robert Langdon sent to a murder scene to investigate certain symbols left by the victim. What Langdon figures out though, could destroy Christianity and his life.The Da Vinci Code is a cultural phenomenon, which almost everyone has read. So it's no surprise that they want to get a movie out there for the people who are too lazy to read the books, but here it's an obvious case of cashing in on the money that the book has earned. Much like Passion Of The Christ, you can tell that the filmmakers hope that it's controversy is the key to it's success. It's a shame to say that it's one of those read the book and skip the movie.I've read the book, been to it's locations and believe in Jesus Christ, so I really enjoyed the book. With Ron Howard giving us the motion picture, my hopes that the film making a good translation to screen were still up in the air. After finally seeing the film, I've come to realize that the book is indeed better then the movie. The main reason behind this would be because the film itself felt rushed. It felt like it was still trying to cash in on the book's success, it just so happens that it leaves the viewer wondering what all the fuss is about. If they haven't read the book that is.Da Vinci is the weakest film out of the Hanks and Howard collaboration. Hanks still doesn't seem to fit the title character of Langdon. No, it's not the hair, it's just that when I'm watching the film I see TOM HANKS, not Robert Langdon. Hanks aside, everyone else seems to fit their roles perfectly. I enjoyed Reno as the french police officer Fache and adored Tautou as Sophie Neveu. Ian McKellen does a good job as well, although I thought he was more comical then his character should be. Molina is barely used in the film, but out of everyone, it's Paul Bettany who shines here. Bettany showed his acting chops in Gangster No. 1, here he steals the screen. Unlike Hanks, Bettany becomes his character sends chills down some spines.The film is true to the book, but I could of sworn I remember a lot more stuff happening in the book then what was showed in the film. Granted, you can't transfer everything from page to screen, but it seems like they didn't really care for the material. The most important and entertaining part of the book seems to fly by here. I was also very turned off by the scenes that showed Langdon looking at certain things that weren't there. Hologram like images that play out in his mind and to the viewer, but are invisible to everyone else.The score was impressive, it's one of the few highlights in the film. The book itself was a page turner and never seemed to slow down, the film doesn't slow down either, but with a 2 1/2 hour running time it does hit you in your seats. National Treasure I said felt like a Da Vinci Code ripoff, but Treasure was the better film of the two. It was more adventurous then Code, which to me, even with it's beautiful locations, seemed confined.Howard is a good director, and if he actually took the time to make a good film here he could have had a success, unfortunately his rushed attempt to get the film in theatres shows. As does the acting, which is quite embarrassing at some points. The controversy surrounding the film should die down when people realize that the film isn't that great, as should it's box office intake. If they do decide to make Angels and Demons, I'll go to see it, as it was the better book and should make the better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It had that much going for it. The film doesn't. It just drags.I don't know what happened to Ron Howard, perhaps he confused book reading time with screen watching time.

What's your problem?! I really enjoyed DaVinci Code the movie,"I read the book. I read Angels & Demons. I don't think Brown is the world's greatest word-smith, and while reading both I often questioned the plausibility of some of the situations. But he does know how to create a page turner and expose the reader to an amazing travelog and awareness of historical art, architecture, facts AND - MYTHS. It is a NOVEL. Those who are so threatened by the tale need to get over it. How much of our literature and movies are twisted and turned to make an exciting story? Most of it.Now to the movie --- I thought Ron Howard did a beautiful job telling the tale of the book. He didn't leave out anything too important. What - you want to sit there over 4 hours? My son didn't read the book - and he was able to follow the plot. The story has wild twists and turns. It is fast-paced. But I thought it was well told and I especially liked the way they superimposed other images - often historical - to tell the back stories. There were actually some things I better understood after seeing the movie - like the motivation of Remy Jean.Audrey Tautou was captivating and Ian McKellen was a perfect Sir Teabing. The big reviewers are criticizing Tom Hanks for being boring. It is one of his more subdued performances, but I didn't find him dull. And the portrayal of Silas actually brought more understanding to his actions and devotion to Opus Dei - rather than presenting him as a one-dimensional villain.I am personally not threatened by the thought that Christ might have been married or had a child. Over the centuries a lot of our church doctrine was decided by men controlling things in a back room. I was actually surprised at several points in the movie where Howard especially brought out statements that one's faith should not be diminished by what was being revealed in the plot. But those with closed minds about this NOVEL aren't going to appreciate any of this.I thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and viewing the historic sites. I sat through the entire movie, not wanting to miss a moment. No potty or snack breaks during this one. So I don't get the complaints about boredom. I'm ready to go see it again. Don't get turned off by the naysayers. Especially if you read the book, I think you will be pretty happy.Now if they ever try and do a movie of Angels & Demons -- I think that will be a crazy one. The twists and turns are much more unbelievable and implausible!Addendum: After reading the mass of negative reviews on this site - I'm guessing a conspiracy by the ""religiously offended"" to blast this movie here and wherever they can. (And for the others, with their snobby and blasting criticism -- I wish they would name what they consider a GOOD movie - so we can put their criticism in perspective!) Wonder how many blasters actually even saw it. One woman picketing a theater in Chicago was quoted as saying she was so upset about the blasphemy of Jesus having sex - and if they say he had sex - then every kid will think they can have sex with anyone! Great connection. The movie's theory is that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene in a loving relationship - not someone who slept his way across the holy land! Folks - you are out of control!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Put yourself in the reviewer's shoes,"As a Ron Howard fan, I knew that I would have to see this movie at some point and I do make a point often to read the reviews of viewers beforehand and after. This movie has received a lot of negative reviews, but from what I can decipher, the majority of them come from those who entered the theatre with preconceived notions.One must remember that almost every movie adapted from a book will always be measured against the book and therefore any negative criticism has to be mitigated by the fact that those having first read the book see the movie with certain prejudices. Whether or not Tom Hanks makes a ""good"" Robert Langdon is irrelevant to the movie; it is only a personal observation based on the mental image of the character created by the reader while reading the novel. The same is true of the other characters and for what bits of the story included or omitted in the final cut in comparison to the book.A movie with the pre-publicity that The Da Vinci Code had (based on the legal battle and the subject matter) also will prejudice many against it. There are those, insecure in their faith, who will always speak out vehemently at the slightest questioning of religion, God or our moral code and, as usual, they are best left ignored. There are those also who will take a negative bias simply as a result of the publicity, sort of a that same sense of non-conformity and rebelliousness that leads teenagers to smoke.My point here is that you, as a viewer, have to ask yourself what it is that you want from a movie such as The Da Vinci Code. Having not read the novel or followed the trial and looking to appreciate a decent thriller without having to question my spiritual and/or religious opinions, The Da Vinci code was a decent movie. Not great, not bad. It certainly isn't the best work that Ron Howard or Tom Hanks has done and it could stand to shed a good 15 to 20 minutes, but that's all it is. It isn't going to shake the foundations of Christianity; it has a plausible plot, some of the escape stunts are a bit far-fetched, some characters are over used or underused, the police are essentially bumbling idiots...hey, it's just standard Hollywood fare, but with somewhat more weighty subject matter.

Disaster,"Spoilers!This picture is a flat out disaster. The plot in the novel was actually laughingly and stupidly convoluted, but masked by the interesting discussion of symbolic meanings in Renaissance art. In the movie, however, this discussion comes across as wooden and even rather silly digressions from the investigation of a homicide.The disaster begins almost from the start. The curator is murdered in the Louvre. While any sensible person would have been saying prayers or writing a coherent note about his killer, this fellow performs more self mutilation and spends his last moments constructing an anagram and puzzle clues for his niece. It sold in the book - it comes across as preposterous as it is in the movie.This is the first time in forever I can remember Tom Hanks dialing in a performance.

Ain't No Masterpiece,"Starring Tom Hanks. Directed by Ron Howard. With Alfred Molina and Ian Mckellen. A movie with credits like that should be an embarrassment of riches. Instead it's a talky cloak-and-dagger chase film, interspersed with jerky flashbacks and faulty accents.By now, most people know the plot. Tom Hanks headlines as Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor asked to solve the murder of a Louvre curator. The curator has left a series of clues, written in blood, that lead Langdon, along with cute tag-along Sophie Neveu (Tatou, struggling with her first major English role) to uncover a vast conspiracy. Oh, but it's not just any conspiracy. This cover-up involves a Catholic sect (Molina hams it up as a sinister bishop), an Albino assassin (played with quiet menace by Paul Bettany), a crippled history buff (Mckellen, excellent as usual), and a shocking secret hidden in DaVinci's ""The Last Supper"". The book, heavy on history and light on action, was great in small doses. But a non-stop 150 minutes spent listening to Hanks describe the time of Christ amounts to a much less enjoyable experience. The film never shakes from its somber tone, and director Howard tries to cut down on the talking by using grainy flashbacks that look like a high school production of Hamlet. Devotees of the book will find this a forgettable thriller that stays faithful to its source. Everyone else will be let down by a great director and a great cast, who produce an average film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I was very fascinated by the story and it really had me thinking for a while after the movie. I can't for the life of me understand why it's getting such bad reviews, but once again I didn't read the book so I technically can't say much.

It's such a shame that some people just can't separate fact from fiction and just take the movie for what it is; good intelligent entertainment. Judging by its style and directing this movie was clearly not made to shock or offend but to purely entertain.And for the unbiased open minded person this is surely an entertaining movie to watch. It was not as slow or boring is I had heard and expected. The movie is definitely fast paced and features lots of thrilling moments.The movie its story had definitely enough potential to make this one of the best movies of 2006 but yet it isn't.

The story also takes lot for granted and goes to deep with its theories which isn't always good for the realism of the movie. It overall also makes the movie too long which makes it hard to keep interest for its entire duration.The movie has a good style and quick pace, with some good editing and moody camera-work and a great perfectly suiting Hans Zimmer soundtrack. The directing is also good when for most part but yet you can tell that thriller/mystery just isn't Ron Howard's genre. The movie doesn't always flow well enough. My advice to him would be to just stick to drama's and comedies, were his true talent lies. Guess Howard really wasn't the right guy for this job.Lots of fine actors are also wasted in the movie. The movie lies its emphasis on the story and therefor too often forgets about its character that become at times a secondary element in the movie. The movie does really lack a solid main character. It's not that Tom Hanks is of course an horrible actor and it's not like he's miscast in the movie, like most people say he is, his character just isn't always likable or understandable enough. Ian McKellen's role is too limited, as he is introduced too late into the movie. So is Jürgen Prochnow in a very small role and Alfred Molina, who's character had way more potential than was eventually used.Yet the movie remains a perfectly watchable one that is also more entertaining than you'll perhaps would expect. The movie features more than enough interesting and mysterious elements to keep you interest in the story until the end. The story features lots of imaginative and fascinating elements, the book by Dan Brown on which this movie is based is not a world wide success for no reason. Too bad that in the end the movie does not live up to the book it's success or brilliance and it doesn't quite meet expectations.It's some good intelligent entertainment but it's just not one of those movies people will still talk about in 10 years from now, I would reckon.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Watch it with an open mind. You will like it!,"As this movie has been touted as one of the most anticipated films of this year, certainly expectations are high. And it does not failed me at all. I had read the novel beforehand and so at least I know what to expect of the movie.The critics had been saying so much about this movie, it had actually made me kind of dread how the movie will turn out as I had read the book already and like it. Still, I went to the cinema with an open mind. And I realised, having the open mind really works. Yes, it's all just work of fiction and it's up to oneself to decide what is real and not. I am not a Christian myself but yet I like overall how it's presented. Also for someone who had read the book before, I do like that it stays with the book most of the time despite the time constrains with few minor changes here and there in the movie.The places being featured in the movie are just - fantastique! I like overall how the cast are being presented. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas...it really fit altogether.For my father who had accompanied me to go watch this, he had certainly asked me a lot of questions (and I patiently replied him back after the movie ended) about what the movie was trying to say. Still eventually, he had managed to get the gist of it. The pace of the movie is the reason why he and I managed to understand the whole thing. For me, it's better because I had read the book beforehand. I know I had said that many times but then for one who had not read the book, you will still more or less get the hang of it.The final few moments of the movie can really drive home why director Ron Howard had made this movie well. Even if I dare say I was not aware of the novel version beforehand, I think I will still be almost choked up towards the end of the movie.So much had been said about Dan Brown's bestselling novel and this movie adaptation but then I can only give this one advice for those who are going to go watch the movie - watch it with an open mind. It will surely do value to your movie ticket as it does to mine.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Premise is Based off WHAT EVIDENCE?,"It was a great movie, but I just keep replaying in my head a picture of Ian McKellen pointing to a painting created 1500 years after Jesus's birth and saying ""this is the evidence"" of the entire movie's premise. I was baffled.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I was not prepared for cheesy,"I liked the book. Being a recovering catholic, I enjoyed looking at the Jesus story in a different way. I was looking forward to the movie, mainly because of the great locations the story unfolds in.I also imagined the book being good movie material. When I read all the bad reviews, I told myself that most of the times good reviews are wrong. And how often did I end up seeing a movie because of some approving film critic and found the film disappointing and walked out of the theater convinced that this critic has been bought by the studio.Heck, I wanted to see the movie, so I went to a matinée. There is a lot of things I do not understand . Does nobody looks at the movie after it is finished to see that certain things are not working? And maybe changes it then. Why does the main character always has to be a big star? I have nothing against Tom Hanks, but he did not convince me at all in that role. And why make a movie about the feminine power suppressed by the church and make the main female character weaker than it is written in the book? And there may be a lot of things which are wrong with the book, but it is an interesting read and it is certainly not cheesy. Especially at the end the movie was so cheesy that it made me gag.And it was boring. There is no excuse for that movie to be boring. And I do not mind long. It is a complicated story to tell. But long and boring? I wanted to see the movie on the big screen. I like the big screen and there are movies which I saw in the theater and then bought the DVD and they had not the same impact on me at home. And why is the whole movie so gloomy and dark? This is not a gloomy and dark story. It is an exciting and colorful story. I regret that this movie is going to make so much money. It does not deserve it. After I came home from the movie I watched part of Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball and she claimed that Jesus was there. Maybe she is a descendant of Jesus and Magdalena? Who knows?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The movie is much better than the book,"I read "" professional ""critics comments and user comments, what a disappointment to see that everybody is on hype mode and really have nothing new to say. I read the Da Vinci Code like everyone else. The book started as a very interesting one only to bore me past half the plot, I actually made an effort to finish it..This movie will be delightful for those who did not read the book and, if it was not for all the critics who gave it a thumps down, the reviews would be in the masterpiece category. But since it seems those critics have personal agendas and politics to follow I guess we will not see that happening. The film is entertaining, with a great plot, awesome performances, great special effects, interesting characters and very artistic photography, yet most of the people focus on the politics of the film rather than the extreme quality of it. Sad...Kudos to the producer and director, thanks to their movie I will not have to punish myself reading the book again, like Silas..Maybe the next time something like this comes along Hollywood can make and present the movie before the book comes out.. I will see the movie again, and most likely the DVD, if anyone is interested in buying a used book feel free to contact me..",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth the ticket price,"I walked into this movie expecting to see one of the most impressive films of my generation. What I got was not so much as this, but I left feeling satisfied with what I saw. Choosing Tom Hanks to play Robert Langdon was something that surprised me, but I was impressed with his ability to become the character. I thought he did a superb job and his acting definitely added to the enjoyability of the movie. Ian McKellen as Teabing was a surprise for me as well, but I never found myself actually think he was the bad guy, due to many roles he has played in the past. I lack the ability to see him as a bad guy. The script was well written. Though the plot was scattered about while following the numerous character story's(Langdon, Silas, Fauche and the Bishop)it worked well enough. I agree with folks who say that the book was better, but honestly, when isn't it? Movies such as Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia did a very good job of keeping to the original plot, and I think that The Da Vinci Code should be praised for this too. I have seen this movie once and intend to see it again. I was able to enjoy it throughout the films time(149 minutes) and as I said, left feeling satisfied. Good job Mr. Howard",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
truly dire,"This was the worst film I have seen in years: indeed, the worst ever, if you consider how much money was spent on it. It is right up there with Heaven's Gate, or Antony and Cleopatra, in terms of how much money, intelligence and talent was expended for so bad a result. Just a few instances: Paul Bettany's naked bottom, yet again. In case we had not seen enough of this in The Knight's Tale (where at least it was deployed to great humorous effect -- as a long-time Chaucer scholar, I can tell you that the naked Chaucer was worth a thousand dull articles) we see it not just once, not twice, but -- oh, I stopped looking after a while. And just in case we had not got the message, that this was one weird monk: we saw him whipping himself and the blood dripping off his leg again, and again, and in case we had not got the message, yet again. And what sort of brilliant direction is it, that EVERY TIME some historical event is mentioned (Mary Magdalen at the cross, Constantine, etc) we got to have a full-blown flashback, done in swirly oh-this-is-the-past colours? And who wrote a script that managed to make the dull patches and longueurs in the book even duller and longer? As for the actors: Hanks and Tatou looked plain bored throughout, with a total lack of chemistry between them; McKellen provided the film's only bright moments, and that was it. Finally, I did something I have never done in films before: I did not go to sleep; I just STOPPED WATCHING. I did not see the last fifteen minutes. From the dull silence in the (packed) auditorium I think I was not alone in this reaction.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good -Until the last 10 minutes (no spoilers),"First of all, it goes without saying -see the movie with an open mind.The movie was fast paced, intelligent, and provided the right amount of action without becoming some mindless action flick. The characters were down to earth -Hanks and Tatou are very believable in their roles, and Bettany and Reno's ""villans"" were flawed and vulnerable, prompting pity for them, a rare feat in a blockbuster film.I read the book first, and of course, I didn't expect the book to be exactly like the movie; the book is much longer and much more detailed. However, the movie followed the book very closely, so literary perfectionists (like myself were appeased). That is, until the last ten minutes. Unfortunately, the director opted to modify the ending for some unknown reason,deviating completely from the book, which was kind of sad, considering how well the movie had done for the last 2 hours. The ending was entertaining, wrapping up the film nicely, but the film ending added nothing to the movie that the book's ending did not, and the book's ending kept with the overall theme of the DaVinci Code. It was too bad, because the disappointment of the last ten minutes overshadowed the overall effect of the film.Final verdict? Go see it (if you are ready to, of course), and enjoy it, but book lovers be warned, the ending is rather different. 8/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually accurate but frightfully dull,"Watch a dull 2 and half hour film or read a dull 700 page book, I have had the misfortune of both. The film is little more that a page by page visual interpretation of the book with only very minor changes. Each dull scene only takes place to take you to the next dull scene and the next part of Dan Browns little puzzle. At one point there is a minor car chase but it has no excitement and only serves the above purpose of bringing our characters to a location where they can spout more pseudo-history. The acting is functional to say the least, but the actors don't really have much decent dialogue apart from explaining the above mentioned pseudo-history. There is no character development and by the end of the film you really don't care about the characters or what they are doing. Of course Ron Howard didn't have much to work with in the way of characters, the lead role is essentially a poor mans Indiana Jones. This films only saving grace is its visual quality, most of the scenes and descriptions from the book are well realised and some good effects are used to convey the characters thoughts rather than poor ""internal dialogue"".5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Books fails to translate into Movie,"The magic formula Dan Brown used to transform his book, The Da Vinci Code, into a bestselling novel didn't seem to be present in the new film version. What in book form had been a fast paced novel became a slow film, bogged down by an overabundance of dialogue. Although most of the differences between the book and film were fairly inconsequential and made simply in the interest of time, some major changes at the end were questionable. Unfortunately, the beautiful Paris scenery and creative cinematic techniques weren't enough to override the mediocre acting and sluggish plot.One of the greatest strengths in Dan Brown's novel is the plethora of background information on symbology and early Christianity, regardless of whether these so called ""facts"" are actually true or not. It is through inner monologues that most of this information is revealed to the reader. Since it is difficult to reveal a character's thoughts on film, extra dialogue is used instead. The amount of dialogue that the script writers were forced to add is one of the major factors that slows down the plot. Some of the lines seem awkward and unnatural because they sound more like thoughts than what a person would actually say out loud. In an effort to avoid adding even more dialogue, the film uses an interesting technique to show the problem solving process in Langdon's brain. When Langdon is trying to solve the riddle on Newton's tomb, the tomb appears on the screen as a kind of hologram and the different parts that he is thinking about are highlighted. While this was a refreshing change from simply adding more dialogue, it wasn't enough to pick up the pace of the movie in the numerous places it started to slow down.There were many small differences between the book and movie. Most were obviously made simply in the interest of time and made little difference to the plot as a whole. A scene where Sophie and Langdon try to escape Paris in a cab and a scene in which the two use a computer to decipher part of a riddle were removed. Neither of these changes, as well as several other small ones, really made that much of a difference. There were a few changes, however, that probably would have been better had they been kept the same as in the book. In the book there were two cryptex, the first one opened to reveal another. Because the second cryptex was removed, an entire riddle that was in the book was taken out of the movie. The riddle solving is one of the most interesting aspects in both the movie and novel, so the complete removal of a riddle from the movie was a little disappointing. An interesting difference in that the movie version is that Langdon is less open-minded than the one from the book. He discredits most of the grail myth and even argues with Teabing about several points. By giving Langdon a more moderate stance on the whole issue, the film loses some of the controversy that was created in the book. Whether or not this was intentional is hard to say. The most noticeable change in the movie is the ending. While in the book Langdon and Sophie never find the Sangrael documents in the Rosslyn Chapel, they actually do in the movie. The entrance to the chamber seems ridiculously obvious, hidden beneath a very evident symbol of the unified chalice and blade. Another grating difference was that in the film it is implied that Sauniere wasn't actually Sophie's biological grandfather while in the book he most definitely is. The changes made for the sake of cutting time made sense, but the other big changes were not only unnecessary, but often times irritating as well. The special effects and cinematography were very creative. Whenever a flashback occurs in the movie the picture becomes slightly grainy and takes a bluish tone. The grain adds to the effect of these flashbacks being distant memories, deteriorating over time. This effect was used to illustrate Silas's history as well as a few parts of early Christian history. Another interesting effect was when Langdon and Sophie were walking into Rosslyn Chapel, what the chapel had looked like hundred of years ago was projected around them, helping to put the fantastic age of the church into perspective. Ian Mckellen's portrayal of the eccentric Teabing was excellent, but for the most part the acting was mediocre. Tom Hanks seemed miscast for the part of Robert Langdon, described in the book as an attractive man in his mid thirties. Hanks, with his terrible hair and lack of sex appeal, seemed unsuited for the role. Silas, played by Paul Bettany, was fittingly creepy, but was unable to capture the audience's sympathy like the character does in the book. Part of the reason for this could have been the much abbreviated background of the character. A chapter's worth of his history is shortened to a three minute flashback in the movie. What is a fantastic thriller on paper simply doesn't translate into a great movie. Although the film is by no means terrible, its slightly slower pace and annoying changes could be disappointing for those who enjoyed the book. It's a movie worth seeing in the cinema once, but it's unlikely too many people will go back to see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Each breath you take is a sin. No shadow will be safe again, for you will be hunted by angels.","The Da Vinci Code is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by Akiva Goldsman from the novel of the same name written by Dan Brown. It stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Jürgen Prochnow. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.When a man is murdered inside the Louvre, his body is found to be surrounded by cryptic messages. The police call in American symbology expert Robert Langdon (Hanks) to decode the clues. When he is joined by Parisian cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), it quickly becomes apparent that nothing is as it first seems and a mystery begins to unravel that could shake Christianity to its very core.Extended Cut (Blu-ray) Version Viewed.I haven't read the book! And I love treasure hunt/clue chasing movies! So I came to Ron Howard's hugely successful film (over $600 million in worldwide profit) bereft of literary pressure and with only a modicum of genre expectation. Perhaps this is why I'm apparently only in a small percentage of film lovers who really enjoyed the film? In spite of those gargantuan financial figures.Ultimately it's very safe film making, with a director and cast guaranteeing professionalism, but it weaves a magical mystery tour full of cryptic clues, secret organisations and cover ups. Yes, there is a good deal of corn thrown in as well, which inevitably stops the adaptation from being hyper intelligent. There's also an understanding on my part as to why many feel it's just too talky, but was the film ever going to be unfurled as an action movie blockbuster for the popcorn munching crowd, like National Treasure et al?It is a clever conspiracy thriller full of twists and turns with a outlandish revelation at the finale. It's also very appropriately performed by the cast (serio brooding and fret), and when McKellen joins the fray after an hour of film it has a little class as well, while Zimmer's score is a majestic blending of choir, strings and synths. I maintain that the film didn't deserve the critical whacking it got, but again I say I had a blank canvas going in for my first viewing.I wasn't sold to it because of controversy or had a saliva tinged mouth having worshipped at the altar of Dan Brown, I expected exactly what I got. A flawed but ever so intriguing adult mystery thriller, and not even Hanks' hair stopped me having a great time with the movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film!,"Before watching the Da Vinci Code I was really skeptical. I had read all these awful critiques and I believed that the film had to be taken with a grain of salt. Who can forget Scott's review for the NY Times? ""A Code that takes longer to watch than read"". After watching it I have to say that it was a great film and I shouldn't have been that concerned. Ron Howard did a great job, Ian McKellen was absolutely fantastic and the rest of the cast was really good as well (I quite liked Bettany and Molina as Silas and Aringarosa). Yes, there were changes in the plot and yes, little and not-so-little details were omitted. The thing is that instead of ruining the film, these changes gave it a freshness, an originality that was much needed by the people that have read the book more times than they can remember during the last couple of years, like me. The characters stayed true to the books; as did the things that mattered, so I didn't really mind the little changes. Overall, I give it a 9 out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sexist Depiction of Sophie Neveu In Comparison to Book,"I read the book and was sorely disappointed in how Sophie Neveu was depicted in the movie. In the book she was much more intelligent and capable. She demonstrated this time and time again. For example, she was the person who embedded into a bar of soap the tracking device hidden in Robert Langdon's coat in order to help him escape. This is not revealed in the movie. She also helped him decode several things many times and he was in awe of her intellect and cleverness. This was not shown in the movie. They do not show her intelligence and do not depict her as close to Robert Langdon's equal.I was looking forward to seeing a strong feminine force and how well she and Robert Langdon worked together. That's what was so fascinating to me about the book. They were such a team together and the union of male and female forces was the overall theme of this book. Ron Howard seems to have missed this.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I LOVED this movie,"So I really enjoyed the book and I couldn't put it down. I honestly deprived myself of sleep and food for 2 days while I read this book. So then I was like ""The movie is going to be AWESOME."" I was very skeptical and thought Tom Hanks was not the best choice for the movie, not by a long shot. When I read the book I thought Robert Langdon would have been more of a Gil Grissom from CSI, but after seeing Tom Hanks in the roll, he actually did an awesome job. Then I saw Audrey Tautou and thought that she just looked like the ""adorable"" girl that a movie always has. Sophie needed to be a tough chick. She did a great job. She wasn't the ""pretty"" and ""cute"" girl you would expect her to be. I really enjoyed the character of Silas. Paul Bettany did an AWESOME job. He was also in a Knights Tale where he walked around naked. You get to see his ass again in this movie, and I am not complaining. A few of the lines in this movie were really lame. The worst part ever was when Sophie tried to walk on water, and made the joke about water into wine. So then Robert says ""God speed!"" That was pretty much just retarded as ever. Honestly though, I am going to see this movie again tomorrow. It really is that wonderful. I loved it fully.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good acting, good special effect, bad movie?","The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is one of the best novels I have ever read and I suggest to anyone thinking about seeing the movie to read the book first. This will be a lot more enjoyable for you.Now, the movie changes a lot of things from the book. Some are required due to time issues (it is hard for one to cram 450 pages into 2 hours), but others I thought were just plain useless. This story is so rich it is a pity the movie changed so much from the original.The acting is good although Hanks does not seems like the Robert from the book to me and neither does the girl who played Sophie, but that is expected. I felt like the first scene with the teacher was going great in the movie and then in the very next scene they reveal too much. Why?! That scene alone ruined the movie for me.I wanted to see this movie because the book was so well done and such a good story (let's remember it is just a fictional story, okay people?). I was, however, very disappointed at the outcome. I felt like I would have done better watching Mission Impossible 3 again. I know those of you who want to see it will see the movie nonetheless but I am sure most of you will be disappointed at the outcome and for this I am sorry. It is what happened to me.

Da Vince Code,"The movie on its own was self sustaining in a way as it already had all the major plot in the story.

The acting by Ian McKellen was superb to say the least.On the topic of religious controversy, I found that the show was more of a teaser. In sense that they are just grazing on the issues of what to believe or whom to believe in.

Comments from People who really don't know their facts,"I had a chance to see a preview of this movie last night. Actually it's quite entertaining - even for someone like me who is a teacher of the history of religious history. The film is well cast and moves along to a good conclusion. However I am growing increasingly tired of people talking about the factual correctness or otherwise of this film. People bandy around comments about what happened 2,000 years ago as if we have concrete evidence - we do NOT! All of the gospels were written long after the events and supposed to have happened - we do not have eye witness testimony! Let's be clear about this. Christianity is a matter of faith - if Christians choose to believe that somehow a vigin (mis-translation from the aramaic almah - which means a young woman - by the way for you fellow Latin scholars ""it did not say that Mary was ""virgo intacto"" - was impregnated by a ""holy spirit"" thats up to you. But look at the evidence - scant as it is - that exists. Christians borrowed the faith from the Jews. According to the Jewish faith - Jesus was married (he had to be - he was a Rabbi - you cannot be a Rabbi unless you are married). Also at the wedding in Cannae, Mary Magdalene anointed his feet with oil and wiped them clean with her hair - this is EXCLUSIVELY done as part of an ancient Jewish marriage festival. Dan Brown takes some of these ""facts"" and creates an entertaining story. Just enjoy it for what it is!

Pleasantly surprised,"(Contains some minor spoilers) Like millions of people around the world I read The Da Vinci Code novel. While I was not impressed with the writing, I found myself lying awake late at night. The novel was a real page turner despite the far-fetched premise and factual errors. I happened to know something about the early period of Christianity, so I knew that the novel had some truth when describing Constantine and the existence of hundreds of Gospels and about the sad demise of the Knights Templar, but these were buried beneath some truly awful dialogue.I had planned to watch the movie to see what the hype was about, and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by Ron Howard's take on the source material. I can see how the novel does not translate perfectly into a movie, but Howard has paced it very well, resulting in an enjoyable historical thriller that jumps around some wonderful locations and culminates in the beautiful Roslyn chapel. The acting is very good, Hanks shows why he has won the Oscar on repeated occasions, and McKellen is magnificent as usual. Tautou does not shine as she did in Amelie, but she is more than adequate. Bethany's Silas stands out, he is much better than the novel, and it lends some depth to otherwise flat characterisation. I can see that many people will complain about the anti-climatic ending, but I actually found it very moving, perhaps the best part of the entire movie.Do not let the critics and the Church spoil this, I think that it was highly enjoyable and I will definitely be seeing it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Interesting concept, poorly executed.","There is no denying the hype of ""The Da Vinci Code"". I recently read the novel prior to the theatrical release of the movie. And in my opinion, I found the book interesting because of the many theories and facts it presented, not the fictional story that surrounds it. The movie on the other hand, seems to favor the fictional story. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed of Ron Howard. It would seem that after his recent masterpieces that this would be a safe bet. You know, like an epic adaption, code breaking in the sense of John Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Sadly, Howard moves through the material with hasty pace, and without much tension. In general, I guess you could say that the movie is quite faithful to the book. Some things are changed though, but nothing major. However, the movie seems to be taking a much safer and milder tone to its accusations. Visually, the movie looks OK. I had hope a for a little bit more from the cinematography, but it was OK. The same can be said from Hans Zimmers score, it does its job, but nothing memorable.To conclude, in my opinion the movie seems to lay its wight on other elements then what I found interesting in the book.

"The book is better, but still enjoyable.","First off I wold Lek 2 say that I had read the book before going to see the film as did the packed cinema it seemed. I lost count at the amount of times I heard someone whisper ""That was just like in the book"" and so forth. Like most people who had read the book I had high expectations of this film and after watching, I felt as though that early promise had not been fulfilled. The action was slow paced, the dialogue was very wooden at times, the chemistry between the main characters was non-existent. However the film did stay true to the book, only cutting small parts out for running time. I enjoyed the flashbacks to ancient times when Hanks or Sir Ian where referring to ancient scripture, looked like it was lifted from some epic film. One personal gripe I had about the film being from Scotland is that it never mentioned Roslin(I know I spelt it wrong) Chapel is in Scotland, just outside Edinburgh, just they arrived there.Overall go and see the film if you are a fan of the book, you will get some enjoyment out of seeing the actual Churches and painting etc., just keep in mind that it may not live up to your memory of the book.

The acting was mediocre at best (with the exception of Paul Bettany), and there was no chemistry whatsoever between Langdon and Sophie. I went into it expecting it to be lacking somewhat in depth, as movies based on books usually are, but it went above and beyond my expectations in terms of the hack job that they did on the book. The mystery and excitement that made the book so wonderful were completely missing from the film, and the writer made changes to the story that were unnecessary and unforgivable. There were several parts where my friend and I actually laughed out loud because of the ludicrous changes that were made to the storyline. This may actually be putting it too nicely, but the movie crucified Dan Brown's brilliant piece of work.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No tension...no drama... tedious....but you'll still go and see it.,"Whatever you think of the book, at least it made you turn the page...the film is more or less a faithful adaptation of the book (with a couple of changes that I won't spoil)...but Dan Brown wasn't writing a film script. And the script the movie uses is clunky and tedious...there are a few really funny moments, sadly they are unintentional and mostly come from the urgent (over)acting and lengthy lectures the audience is subjected to. There is no chemistry between the actors, there is no tension.Saying that, the triumph of this film is the marketing, no matter how poor it is, it will rake it in at the box office: that will be the measure of success of the movie.For all those anti-Da Vinci Code people this film is the miracle they wanted: whereas the book could have been discussed for decades to come - this bad adaptation is likely to ensure that the Da Vinci Code becomes a flash in the pan.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Overlong and occasionally dumb, but otherwise a pretty enjoyable blockbuster","The best way of appreciating The Da Vinci Code is to be perfectly sure of your expectations. In my case, I knew exactly what I thought I would see: on the cover of the Italian edition, the original novel is defined ""a thriller by Dan Brown"", not ""an essay on mankind's history by Dan Brown"". The book is 100% fiction and, while not a classic, it's entertaining enough if you have nothing else to do on a boring Saturday afternoon. The movie adaptation is just the same, and that's why I enjoyed it.Most critics, even those who didn't like the film (and there are plenty of them), claim the first fifteen minutes are the best. They've got a point: the opening sequence, where Jacques Saunière, the aged curator of the Louvre, is murdered by albino ""monk"" Silas (Paul Bettany), is indeed quite chilling, setting the tone for subsequent events. The weird circumstances of Saunière's death (apparently, he left a series of clues on his own body right before biting the dust) lead to symbology expert Robert Langdon's (Tom Hanks) involvement. Unfortunately, a misinterpretation of certain signs make him the prime suspect, and with the help of the victim's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), he has to discover the truth, a truth which will see him, to paraphrase English historian Leigh Teabing (the scene-stealing Ian Mckellen), ""witness the biggest cover-up in human history"".It is said cover-up which has made some people (mostly over-religious) utterly hate The Da Vinci Code, because of its supposed ""blasphemy"" and ""heresy"". Now, the theory at the center of the film is with no doubt intriguing (a part of it was already dealt with in Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, conveniently mentioned in Brown's source novel), but let's face it: is there anyone who would take that stuff seriously? I mean, The Last Temptation of Christ can be taken seriously, in spite of its ""upsetting"" content, because it's a serious film. The Da Vinci Code, on the other hand, while dealing with interesting ideas (well, as interesting as they can get in an average mystery book), was made for only one reason: to be an exciting, entertaining summer blockbuster. Which it is.Despite the overused plot line (average guy ends up in something so much bigger than him), director Ron Howard keeps the pace and suspense at a constant level, proving his versatility once again. He also confirms his very good eye for casting: Tom Hanks is a convincing protagonist, mainly thanks to the fact that he doesn't look like your ordinary action hero, and is therefore an excellent choice as a Hitchcockian everyman in an unusual situation, while Jean Reno gives all of his natural roguish charm to the stubborn French cop who makes it his mission to arrest Langdon (it is reported that Brown created the character with Reno in mind, and it is hard not to believe it). But, as usual, it's the Brits who steal the show: Alfred Molina's ambiguous bishop won't please devout churchmen (but hey, if everyone complained for being misrepresented cinematically, then how often would the French, the Germans and the Russians have sued Hollywood by now?), but he is a charismatic presence; Bettany is downright terrifying as one of the most disturbed (and disturbing) psychos to have hit the screens, adding an extra edge to the darker side he had previously shown in Gangster No. 1; and let's not forget Sir Mckellen, who enters the game an hour into the movie and then practically walks away with it, thanks to a characterization that is over-the-top, but in a classy, English way.I still haven't mentioned Tautou, and that's because she is, despite trying her best, the weakest element in the film: best known for playing sweet, slightly naive women (as seen in the wonderful Amélie), she struggles to look convincing as a smart scholar, a fact that is particularly evident in the stretched epilogue, the only part of the movie that gets close to becoming utterly risible. However, this shouldn't detract from the merits of The Da Vinci Code, an unpretentious Hollywood thriller that sets out to entertain and succeeds most of the time, as long as the viewer knows it shouldn't be taken seriously.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The DaVinci Code;will it meet the standards of the book?,"Rating- 3.5/5 Category- Drama/Thriller/Mystery The Davinci Code is a drama/mystery/thriller that literally keeps your eyes glued to the movie screen for 2 and a half hours. Starring Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, The Terminal, Cast Away, etc.) and Audrey Tautou (a decent French actress from out of the blue). Now in this movie these two characters help each other with the treasure hunt for the Holy Grail. This hunt was made from Sophie Neveu's, Audrey Tautou, grandfather. He set clues all around Europe all having to do with symbols and things having to do with Christ.Even the New York Times says, ""WOW... Blockbuster perfection. An exhilaratingly brainy thriller. Not since the advent of Harry Potter has an author so flagrantly delighted in leading readers on a breathless chase and coaxing them through hoops."" Sadly other people had different views, mostly from the liberal side. People from the Chicago Tribune gave the movie a 1.5/5. But yet we have to think about this. It seems like the Chicago Tribune can't handle religious movies because the same thing happened when Mel Gibson produced the Passion of the Christ. So why don't you just think about that for a second.Now for my opinion I believe this movie had a decent part in every field. The acting from Ian McKellen was phenomenal (like always), the screenplay was well written, and the directing from Ron Howard was more than half way decent. The main reason though that I gave the rating a 3.5 is because not the whole cast had their A game for this movie (Tom Hanks). Tom Hanks just doesn't have the pizazz to be in a serious role. All in all this movie brought it to the big screen in a big way.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This book deserves to be read and this film to be watched.,"From the first place I want to say that the novel was very useful to me.Leaving aside that it held my breath for two days and two nights, keeping me connected all the road to the end,in the long summer evenings,it made me think and start a research on the subjects presented in the book,till I found out all the answers to the questions I had.I am grateful for Dan Brown for attracting the public attention to things which really must have been known,but remained in the shadow.So after all this I couldn't miss the chance to see the film version. When buying the tickets at the cinema,one thing amused me.In front of the door there were standing a lot of priests which were praying and lecturing,by this boycotting the release of the movie and trying to obtain its forbidding.Looking at them I thought how many of them have truly read the book and thought without prejudices on the subjects in it.None I suppose.The film was great.The cast was very impressive.I liked very much the acting of Hanks who succeeded pretty well in bringing Langdon to life, though his long hair was a surprise to me.I had some preconceptions about how Audrey Tautou will do,but after all she turned out to do just fine,better then I expected.She really impressed me with her grace and beauty.About Jean Reno I can say only that he was perfect for this role.McKellen did a good job with Teabing as well.Also worth of notice was Paul Bettany whose performance as Silas was breath-taking.Altogether,I had a good time watching it.And the end, the epilogue scene was spectacular, with a perfect combination of music and visual effects.It got me like an electric circuit and I felt a strong desire to jump on my feet and applaud noisily,when it ended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Illegitimi nil carborundum,"A good movie, not great. It rattled along well enough to keep one interested, but a little too quickly to delve into any one of the many issues and characters - the main intent seeming to be to cover as much of the book as possible within a reasonable time.Comparing it with other ""chase across Europe"" films, Da Vinci Code has none of the pace or viewer involvement of Ronin or either of the Bournes.Considering the number of other supposedly controversial movies released over the years, I was amazed to realize this is the first film I've seen where I encountered people demonstrating against the movie. And what a sorry bunch they were.It's ironic that many of the religious bigots who ARE offended by Da Vinci Code were just last year defending The Passion of the Christ against criticism from Jewish groups for the offense that film caused them.As other reviewers have said, this film is a work of fiction. The story may shine a light on certain questionable facets of Christianity (like Constantine's handy reworking of pagan rites and dates), but that stuff is more anti-Catholic than anti-Christian.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A maze of codes and convoluted bad guys,Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a symbologist skilled at deciphering and understanding ancient symbols. He is asked to examine clues in a gruesome murder. Soon he discovers that he is a suspect by the French police Captain Fache (Jean Reno). The murder victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) goes on the run with Langdon on a continental wide chase to discover clues to the mystery and evils of Opus Dei.Ron Howard tries to wrestle down this convoluted maze of codes and confused motives based on the popular novel. It was a big mistake to have Tom Hanks have that ugly weird long hair. It's a weird mix of puzzles and Bourne action. The large amount of French with subtitle doesn't help the matter. It just doesn't get going well. The good part is the likable Tom Hanks. He keeps the mystery solving on track even though nobody cares after awhile.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
critics have never been more wrong,"I saw the movie twice (two different dates wanted to see it) -- opening night and Sunday night of the first weekend. Both times it was sold out and both times the audience was gripped from start to finish. Opening night the audience clapped at the end. Sunday night they did not clap but were clearly deeply into the movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Nah. But it's about a topic that fascinates audiences indoctrinated since birth in all manner of religious myth. The US is chock full of very superstitious and paranoid people, so the movie delivers right into the sweet spot. This is the land of ""Touched by an Angel,"" the land where 80% of people do not believe in the theory of evolution. Can't miss with a film like Da Code. I enjoyed the subversiveness of the flick. It's pro women, it's pro rationality, and it quite rightly portrays Christians (particularly Catholics) to be members of a worldwide cult that has been as prone to violence over the years as anything the Muslims can dish up. Ian McKellen (openly gay) makes the movie. I love his response to the protesting Christians at Cannes, to the effect that they ought to welcome a film depicting Jesus as married and sleeping with a woman, as it finally puts to rest conjecture Jesus was gay.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent escape movie with controversial topics,"The Da Vinci code is a thriller directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou in the lead parts. Most of you also know that the novel of the same name that it is based on, caused major controversies partly because it doesn't tell history of Christianity from the common winners' point of view.Instead, Both the book and movie dwell into the mysteries of the lost forms of Christianity and tell a largely fictional version of their legacy through fictional characters and fictional events taking places in non-fictional locations in the 21st century Europe. There are those fanatics who want to dig up the almost forgotten heretic 'facts', those fanatics who want to stop them, and of course the main characters symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), who have to escape the inevitable mess that the fanatics create. During their journey they team up with enthusiastic Grail seeker Sir Leigh Teabing (played by Sir Ian McKellen) who offers his insights and resources to keep the main characters following the mysterious and dangerous path to truth.The book was a best-seller for a good reason. It gives the reader almost constant suspense as the mysteries stack up and events unfold. Though the book is real page turner, it is also so long that people have lots of the time to reflect upon what they read during the breaks between reading.The movie stays very close to the source material written by Dan Brown, both in good and bad.It was a very hard task to squeeze the book, with it's long and detailed discussions, into a two and a half hour long movie. As much of the thought-provoking pondering gets cut out, the movie turns into almost continuous escape, which is not ideal, because after all, the original story is at least as much about discovery as it is about running and hiding.The few calm sequences amidst the storm are mostly rushed and too far between, which is why the movie ends up being abrupt and undramatic when the characters discuss of the background events. This is very unfortunate because the background story is what made the book popular in the first place. Most of the action and drama both in the book and the movie is not very interesting, although Ron Howard does succeed well in some sequences that zoom in on the fears and pains of characters or zoom out to show magnificent locations or historical events. But mostly this story is ran through.The acting is a mixed bag. Credit must be given to Sir Ian McKellen who succeeds in giving his enthusiastic character Leigh Teabing depth and entertaining the viewer with his strong, theatrical performance. Tom Hanks does a nice job as witty professor Robert Langdon, that is, nice relative to his other performances. The french actress Audrey Tautou has a bit too tough a task. The character Sophie Neveu she plays is so perfect that she's dull. She is attractive, intelligent, tough and sweet all at the same time, basically a flawless person. Considering the task, Tautou pulls off a proper performance, although her English isn't very strong. The supporting cast is surprisingly strong and their characters interesting personalities.The Da Vinci Code is not only cinematically well-executed and entertaining, but also thought-provoking, although not as much as the book it is based on is. The main flaws of the film have to do with the undramatic way the background story is told, the rushing through events, and the uninteresting main characters. Overall, Da Vinci Code is a decent thriller that deserves seven points out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Qusestion about DNA testing,"The main battle in this movie between the Catholic Church and the Priory of Scion in this movie seems to me that if a modern day descendant of Mary Magdeline could be DNA tested and proved to be a direct link to Mary M. then that would prove that this person is the long lost offspring of Jesus. My question is, to prove this wouldn't they also need a strand of Jesus's DNA to show that Jesus and Mary Magdeline had produced a blood line. So without Jesus's DNA it seems to me that the only thing that could be proved is a link to Mary M.Oh and please do not turn this thread into a religious debate, if hell exists I will not be going there because I have seen this movie (but I might be for something else) , seeing a movie will not change anything I believe in (I did not start believing in UFO's when I watched ""Close Encounters"" and I did not quit believing in the stories my dad told me after I watched ""Big Fish"" OK...Flak vest on, Helmet strapped to my head...FIRE AWAY",,Anonymous,Mystery
The big rush...,"I read the book and guessed that it wouldn't be an easy story to make a screenplay out of it. But I liked the movie too. In the novel there are a lot of explanation on art/historical things and the characters' backgrounds that has been left out from the movie. Even so, the 150-minute-long movie is not long enough for those who haven't read the novel to understand, it seems like a big rush for the divine truth. So as to make the good and evil characters more balanced in number the plot make Sauniere seem as if he was an aggressive bodyguard of the young Sophie, instead of his loving grandpa. Also, bishop Aringarosa lies to Fache to have Langdon and Sophie arrested, while in the book the bishop eventually turns out to be a decent but misled man. Fache motives are not even close too. The acting is not outstanding, but fair/good. The emotional content is restricted according to the novel.**************** READ THIS: VERDICT ******************** Although sometimes difficult to understand without having read the book, I recommend this movie. If you like conspiracy theories you will even like it on its own. If you have read the book, you will love the music interacting with the emotions shown (it gives a huge boost to it; congratulations Hans Zimmer!) and the imagined story coming alive.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How Could It Have Been Any Better?,"Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE was long and complicated, so I didn't expect the film to cover it exactly. I don't expect any movie to mimic any book word for word. Only Kenneth Branaugh's HAMLET did that.The movie adaptation turned out better than I could have expected. Sure they changed some parts. Some parts, of courses, were left out. Overall, they compacted the story. It, however, still worked well. Ron Howard kept the Plot tight, and not one piece of dialogue was wasted.Tom Hanks played an excellent, realistic college professor. No slickness and No glossy Oscar-worthy clichéd nuances. He played the role straight like it needed. All of the other actors did equally well, but I hold special recognition for Jean Reno and Paul Bettany. Reno WAS Fache and Bettany did his best to balance eerieness and sad piety in Silas.One warning: YOU MUST PAY ATTENTIION. Like A BEAUTIFUL MIND, 12 ANGRY MEN, and the best episodes of LAW & ORDER, you can't wallow in the clouds while sleepwalking through this film. The best plotted movies waste nothing. Each shot, nuance, word, transition, and musical note forwards the plot or adds to the characterizations.Again, I don't think the production could have turned out better.

Cryptic crypts,"Dan Brown is a good enough storyteller to sell millions of books.The Da Vinci Code was a blockbuster of a book and it was only a matter of time that it was turned into a movie.A controversial plot that visits lots of foreign locations, mystery, thrills, graphic violence and a search for religious artifacts where you are chased by nasty villains.You can call this a modern Indiana Jones.Paul Bettany is chilling as a faithful henchman of Opus Dei, aiding Alfred Molina who incidentally was in the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.However, Ron Howard's direction is bland despite the the good use of locations.The screenplay by the hack Akiva Goldsman is uninspired as always, although he or Dan Brown might had got some inspiration from Kevin Smith's Dogma.Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou lack spark and you end up staring at Hanks hair for all the wrong reasons.The film is watchable enough but there is too much silliness and some of it is just implausible with cryptic clues that the greatest minds have been unable to solve until Robert Langdon came on the scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ron Howard rules!!!,"I didn't like the book because I thought it was too long for what it had to say, and since reading of the book happens at the reader's pace, the puzzles weren't tough enough to appear difficult to a reader with a substantial mathematical knowledge at his own pace.However the book did make me imagine the wonderful locations it goes through and I figured it was going to be a really good movie.I read the critiques when the movie premiered - booing in Cannes, jokes about Tom Hanks' hair, Audrey Tautou's accent, incomprehensible dialogue, whatever. Some friends told me the book was better, some that they didn't like it and they didn't read the book, and fortunately, some told me that it was totally OK.We saw it last night and we really liked it! I thought it could have been longer, and I wouldn't have even noticed it. The script was fine. Tom Hanks' hair is fine. Audrey's cute and intense, her accent does sound confusing in 2-3 lines but it is believable, and the rest is all fine. Everyone did a great job. I liked it how all the clues were highlighted and how they were passing through ghosts on the way to the Westminster Abbey; the flashbacks were clear and not overwhelming; I felt sorry for all the characters who were manipulated to do horrid things in the name of their faith, and the end of the movie offers the moral of the story much clearer than it was done in the book, and ... Yeah, I liked it very much.There are 2-3 instances in the movie when the cut to what happens next was too fast, and I imagine the DVD will explain why some stuff was cut out -- probably to save some time, which they shouldn't have done.And, unfortunately the sound was not crystal-clear which, given all the accents, in the audience full of popcorn and candy-chewing couch potatoes, for whom it is appealing to crack a difficult code fast without need to understand complex sentences, made it difficult to listen.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You're better off reading the book.,"I went and saw it last night, and what do you know, for once, I actually agree with the reviews... in a way.My main thoughts on the movie, is that for such a fast paced book, the movie is rather slow. It's overlong (almost 2 and a half hours??) and I found myself looking at my watch about an hour into the film. That's never a good sign.The car chase scene at the beginning is badly filmed. One would think that maybe it would have been better if another director was chosen for at least that particular scene - I hate to say it, but sometimes the big blockbusters with the great car chase scenes (like The Bourne Identity, Ronin, etc) make or break the film. The music was rather maudlin, with no real memorable scenes for it to even attempt to come into it's own.The acting was terrible. It's the first film I've seen with Tom Hanks being such a wet blanket. He's usually so good in any type of film, but he just didn't look like he cared very much about acting in this one. I've only seen Audrey Tatou (did I spell her name right?) in this, so I don't know if this is the way she normally acts, but she didn't seem to have a great bearing on her role. The scenes with her and Silas seemed to lack depth, and she seemed to be out of her depth with the more emotional scenes. Is this how she normally acts? Paul Bettany as Silas wasn't too bad. I think he had the 'mad monk' down reasonably well in his mind. In the end I couldn't help but feel sorry for him, as everyone (and everything) that he cared about was using him, and his character is one that stayed in my mind a little longer than any other for his depth.On the plus side, Ian McKellen did a fantastic job. Every time he was on the screen, you couldn't help but be drawn to his character. The facial nuances, the longing in his voice... HE is what made this movie bearable. Every movie I see with him in it proves again how great an actor he truly is. Plus he was the actor that brought in a little humour to the film, something that otherwise was sorely lacking.My favourite scene in the whole film, and the one thing I keep thinking back on even now as I'm typing this, is the 'discussion' that Langdon and Teabing have about the history of the grail. But, come to think of it, it was also my favourite scene in the book, so that may not be a huge surprise :) The effects (yes, they have special effects) were great. To be able to literally fuse two different era's in the one scene hasn't been used to this great effect in a long time, if ever.But is it a film I would recommend? Probably not. If you (like the majority of the world) have read the book, then you'll be disappointed. It's the first movie I've seen where mobile phones went off (twice actually) and NO-ONE shushed the owners. One of the people I went and saw the film with (who hadn't read the book) fell asleep within 45 minutes of the film starting, and stayed asleep for the rest of the film. What she did see, she found confusing.So, basically, I'm guessing I'm saying that this movie ain't a bad film as such, but it's a better video/DVD film than a theatre film. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Poorly made,"Like any book turned movie, the book is usually better. In this case the book is drastically better. I wish I did not see the movie, it does not provide justice to an amazing book. The book contained elaborate puzzles, great characters, and easy to follow transitions between scenes.First the puzzles. The movie ignores one puzzle altogether, SOPHA. It seems the director/producer had a choice to make: either add suspense through action or keep the suspense from the puzzles. Unfortunately, they elected the Hollywood approach by adding extra pointless scenes. After reading the book I was expecting the movie to be constructed similarly to The Usual Suspect, but sadly the movie was more like The Game or even The Borne Identity.The movie is jumpy at times, they do a poor job of informing the watcher what is happening in the scene. Even when they have added in the appropriate information it was usually after the long after the scene ended. The movie inadequately explained Sophia's history with her grandfather, including the sacred ritual she saw him conduct. If you did not read the book first, the movie watcher had to be scratching their head.The last major problem I had was with the characters. First Silas and Teabing were amazing, very similar to their characters in the book. The movie did a poor job of explaining Silas's past, but nevertheless both the characters and actors (Bethany and McKellan) were extraordinary. Sophia's character in the book was very intelligent, clever, and useful. The movie did not display any of these features. Instead she is viewed as a tough cop, and defers to Langdon during most of the search. They carefully cutout and edited the scenes that showed her true characteristics (The Grand Gallery and The Bank Vault). It is unfortunate.Lastly there is Robert Langdon, the movie Langdon is not the real Langdon. Langdon appears ignorant at points in the movie, but others times quick and cunning. He solves the puzzle on the plane in a matter of seconds (but in the book takes much longer and needs the help of both Teabing and Sophia, and actually does not solve the puzzle himself). I won't even begin on the ending scenes with the Star of David, Langdon never solved that puzzle.The biggest problem was the changed Langdon's view of the Holy Grail. He spent his entire life researching symbols and strongly believed in the story told by Teabing. The movie, maybe to the pressure of the church, decided to make him more a skeptic.When the movie was complete I thought to myself, wow the movie critics were correct on this one. After I watched the movie I had to go back and reread the book. I suggest everyone do the same.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Movie of the Year!,"This film is great. I believe that it is one of the best films of the year. There are a few things that make the Da Vinci Code is such a good film.First, the film has an actual plot. Most of the films out there today are plain stupid, plot-less movies that are purely made just to bring in that little bit of money that they somehow manage to make. Da Vinci Code has a plot that is well developed and actually makes sense. It has lots of twists and turns that make you think. The ending of the movie was very well done and true to the book. Unlike some other movies, Da Vinci makes a nice closing at the end that is heart warming and emotional.Secondly, Da Vinci was very well cast. Tome Hanks was just outstanding as Robert Langdon and so was Audrey Tautou as Sofie Neveu. The rest of the cast like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina were awesome. I don't think that there could be better suited people for the roles.Lastly, the one final touch that makes Da Vinci so good is the music. Hans Zimmer did an absolutely wonderful job with the music. The score adds to the movie and pushes it up, makes thoughtful scenes thoughtful, and action scenes full of apprehension.The Da Vinci Code is a movie based on a book. Everyone knows that and the movie will be criticized about it but to be honest the movie is on the same level of excellent as the book. Some of the parts of the book were cut but it doesn't bring the movie down.I must say I will definitely go and see the movie again and I urge everyone that reads this review to do the same even though there is so much bad criticism surrounding this movie and its content.

I'm glad that Howard doesn't assume the audience won't be able to read the subtitles, because hearing the French police speak French adds a lot. Paul Bettany was simply brilliant. He has got to be one of the top actors currently working. Despite all the talk about their lack of chemistry, I thought Hanks and Tatou played very well together.

They just reappear periodically in a different disguise. This movie's claims resemble those of numerous fools throughout history, who have contradicted the united testimony of the Apostles and the early church they built. Those witnesses have always attested that Jesus Christ was and remains God himself. It didn't take an ancient council to make this true. And the pseudohistorical claims of a modern movie or novel can't make it false. That aside, it's just a dull film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
So-so.,"Tom Hanks disappointed me thoroughly. I'd expect something more than the uninspiring performance he gave from Tom freaking Hanks. He just wasn't appropriate for the role at all. He came across as too awkward, and spoke from the side of his mouth from time to time, which was pretty distracting. Robert Langdon is supposed to be aging, but suave all the same-- which Tom Hanks just did not pull off. Definitely not Hanks' best work.However, the movie was pretty easily understandable for those who didn't read the book, and included a couple of extra little things so that the movie wasn't just a clone of the book. However, it was dumbed down significantly. If you're seeking an intellectual thrill ride, look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...","Admittedly, I am a film person... If there is a choice between reading a book and watching a film, I'd typically pick the film. After reading the acclaimed best-seller by Dan Brown for a day or two, I heard that Ron Howard was shooting the screen adaptation. So, about a third of the way through the book, I stopped reading and waited.Now that I have seen this very entertaining film, I am curious to go back and read the entire novel. I am sure that some parts had to have been left out. And frankly, I am curious to compare the two.This film was quite easily the most anticipated film of 2006... Ahead of any comic book adaptation or summer sequel / remake. I don't believe the validity, but I heard a rumor that this novel was the most sold work of fiction since... well... the Bible. No doubt it was an enormous phenomenon... For about two years it seemed that, every time I boarded a flight, every other passenger had a copy tucked in their carry-on luggage. The film will assuredly be a big success too, making a boat-load at the box office and then exploding into DVD collections.The reason for all the popularity? Quite simply, the story is a fantastically entertaining and riveting one that works on many levels. It can be read as a detective story, a crime thriller, a religious exposé, a conspiracy theory, a puzzle... The complexity and depth are endlessly fascinating.The film is shot by the wonderful Ron Howard, whose résumé is fast becoming one of the most impressive in recent Hollywood history. He is as sure-handed and reliable a director as there is... You can count on him to deliver a fine film almost every time out.The cast is equally impressive. Hanks has been called the Cary Grant of this generation... And he resembles a wrongly accused Hitchcockian character in this film. He is the rock to this film's insanely hyperactive story. He is our focal point and he manages the part superbly.Audrey Tautou is one of my ten favorite actresses. I am grateful for every moment she spends on screen. She handles the English-speaking role with aplomb and is quite capable of carrying the film along with her co-star.There are also a handful of quality roles turned in by Jean Reno, Ian McKellan, Alfred Molina & Paul Bettany. No one lets the film down with a weak performance.The story is so familiar to almost everyone... and I will not ruin it for anyone who wants a virgin movie-going experience. The film begins with a murder inside the hallowed halls of the Louvre. What is left behind is a handful of cryptic clues that will lead to the greatest cover-up in human history and the true source of God's power on earth.Now, of course, the story is controversial in the sense that it deals with religious belief and vast conspiracies. However, anyone that gives this story weight or credibility, by denouncing it or forbidding people to see it, is utterly naive. They'll only add more interest to the members of the public who are waivering. The same thing happened to Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"". After all, controversy puts asses in seats.Movies are movies... they are not laws or doctrine or factual documents. People should not fear films like these.The book, and thus the film, is complete fiction and does not claim to be anything other than that. It is merely a great suppositional piece of entertainment... and on that level it works spectacularly well.You will find it virtually impossible to be bored during the 150-minute running length... something most 90-minute films cannot boast. This film is engrossing up until the chilling final sequence.If there is any quibble, it is with the pacing. I felt a little rushed while watching all these earth-shattering events unfold. This prevented me from being fully immersed in the story from time to time. It was so hurried in parts that I became aware that I was watching a movie... And that is a big no-no in a film like this.However, ""The Da Vinci Code"" works very well and it is easy to see why this story became such a world-wide hit. It is not the type of film to win Oscars and Globes... but it will captivate an audience who appreciates great storytelling, eerie moods, exciting action sequences, whodunit puzzles & surprise endings. This is the cinematic equivalent of a page-turner! -- TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Da Vinci Code: The Movie,"After all the hoopla and controversy parting the waters between the religious right and Catholic Church and the avid devotees of Dan Brown's multi-million dollar success book, the movie version is finally here. THE DA VINCI CODE makes a good movie - and that is enough.Director Ron Howard has assembled a good international cast, trusted the screenplay to Akiva Goldsman, and in fine Hollywood style has transformed an interesting premise of a story from Dan Brown's interested though unsophisticatedly written blockbuster into a suspense thriller. The story of a murder in the Louvre leading a former flatfoot detective turned writer of symbology and a French cryptographer on a chase involving the Vatican, the Opus Dei society, and the Priory guarding the Holy Grail is full of terrific visualizations of some of the encrypted secrets of Brown's novel and in the end the movie allows the viewer to follow the interesting story much more easily than did the book.The settings are magnificent (cinematography by Salvatore Totino), the musical score by Hans Zimmer sweeps the story along embracing all aspects of the atmosphere, and the visual effects department has done a fine job with some tough tasks. The actors take their characters in stride, given that many of them are over the top figures: Ian McKellen will satisfy every reader's vision of Sir Leigh Teabing; Paul Bettany is appropriately crazy as Silas; Jean Reno offers a Captain Fache who manages to hold things together; Audrey Tatou turns a fine spin as the all-important Sophie Neveu; and Tom Hanks sleepwalks through his rather innocuous conception of Robert Langdon. And the ending is a rather sappy sellout not found in the book - but this is Hollywood...This film may set box office records - which seems to be the point in making it - and serves to prove what good PR work can do for a movie. Many will put down 'The Da Vinci Code' because of religious reasons or other reasons, but in the end it is a just a good story well told - not a great movie but an entertaining one. Recommendation: a good 2 1/2 hour diversion, but not one to rush out to see until the crowds dwindle a bit. Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A boring Christianity history lesson,"The Davici Code finally showed in China mainland, actually the first show in China became the earliest show all over the world by China had the sanction to be one of the first show countries on May.17th. According to the time difference，China , became the first country showed the hot movie.I saw the film on May.20th. The ticket price is 70 RMB per adult. The film lasted for around 3 hours and I couldn't bear to get out for fresh air. The new century theatre,where I saw The Davici Code, shut down their air condition( or they never set the air conditions right). And the content of the film, which I have to say something about, is fabulous at the beginning but become worse and worse from the middle to the awesome ending. A happy ending I have to say, but so many Jesus-gossip were put into the film . Maybe it sounds thrilling and interesting to those foreign movie fans and Christians, but for me , as a Chinese, can't really follow the meaning of the protagonist's analysis and the history of Christianity.For one word, the film is worthy of seeing as well as the same-name original work wrote by Dan Brown. But consider what I said, choose one of them to watch, either the movie or the book. Not both of them. Having been through both the movie and the book is a tragedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligent and entertaining.,"I have no idea why this received such a thrashing in Cannes. I found it an entertaining and intelligent film. I've never read the book so maybe that is why I am unbiased. I enjoyed the story, visuals and the acting was superb. The cast was strong. The first half hour was maybe a little slow but then I was completely in the story and it held my attention for the rest of the film. I found it completely intriguing. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou were great. Ian McKellen was his magnificent self and Paul Bettany was superb as the monk. Very very good. I found myself routing for the main characters most of the time.

Emmm no thumbs up.,"I was completely disappointed with the film. I was expecting something extraordinary, considering it was a Ron Howard film but I thought it was crap. It was slow, uninteresting and the actors seemed to have no passion for the film or the purpose it was supposed to serve. I read the novel a few weeks back and absolutely loved it. I found it entertaining and very well written in the sense that it kept the reader interested. Needless to say I finished the book in a day. However, the movie was not what I expected it to be. I bought tickets in advance and was looking forward to it, but I absolutely hate that so much was different in the movie, I mean yeah, movies are never exactly like the book but I was expecting more considering all the hype. They skipped a whole scene in the plane and I thought that was a vital point in the novel. Another thing...the ending. Where did that come from? I think I was most angry than disappointed at my waste of money. If I liked anything about it, it would have to be Silas. He was my favorite part of the film and most like the character in the novel.Boo.I like how no one clapped or showed enthusiasm for the film at the end. At least I don't stand alone in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If this is intellectual, then I am an elephant","Being a university teacher myself, I can only wonder why they call Da Vinci Code ""intellectual mystery"". There is nothing intellectual about it: the characters are not in a slightest way close to what professors are (in reality they don't own private jets), the plot is as primitive as Hollywood could possibly make it, music is too loud and particularly annoying because it is used to explain the situation on the screen, not to accompany the action, acting is wooden (Ian Mackellen is the only exception).In short: it's a cliché-laden unsophisticated comic meant to entertain those who don't have any idea of the real complexity of scientific work.I don't see how this bull's excrement can threaten the foundations of Christianity. If I was Christian, I would feel just annoyed by how talentlessly they are toying with symbols. And also relieved, because the movie makes such a joke of itself, that I could hardly sit it out (the same applies to the book).If you are in for a really serious intellectual mystery, I suggest you to read Uberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" where the topic of secret societies is treated with irresistible charm.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'm a Christian and I have read the book....,"And I will restate that this movie and the book upon which it is based is FICTIONAL work. I personally found nothing ""wrong"" or offensive with the book or the movie...except that the book's pace was, in a word, plodding. The movie was faster paced, beautifully shot, and kept the audience's attention, adding a touch humor and whimsy through out so as not to get bogged down in its own action. As with anything that hints at a ""conspiracy theory,"" there will be those who will ""absolutely know"" that everything in the movie is ""real,"" that it is designed to ""bring Christianity as we know it crashing to the ground around us,"" and to ""damn the souls of anyone who watches it to eternal suffering.""

Why all the hub-bub?,"After reading this week's edition of U.S. News & World Report, I can't help but scoff at righteous indignation. Catholics and evangelicals are in such an uproar about a fictional movie. There are plenty of movies that are based upon some false premise. It doesn't mean we have to ban movies that may introduce others. What about the widespread panic at the radio program of Orson Wells ""War of the Worlds?"" That program was so real sounding that people thought they were literally being invaded by aliens! Were aliens invading Earth? No...But it was one of the best radio programs ever created. Why? Because it was realistic. The days of cardboard cutouts and cheap outdated computer graphics are gone. We are in the wave of the future. That includes the new wave of better story lines and the courageous journey to the edge of fiction/non-fiction. I believe the best authors dip their toes into truth in order to sell their fiction. It works. Dan Brown's book was genius. Go see it for the sheer enjoyment of a thriller and almost outrageous plot line of a great FICTITIOUS cover-up of the largest religion in history. It's not true, but it's a way to grab the viewer's attention. It's almost like a ""what-if"" sort of story. How far would people go to hide a secret? I'm excited to see the movie and to see how well adapted it was from the book. That is the only thing I would criticize if I find anything.",,Anonymous,Mystery
most underrated movie of all time perhaps,How dare people say this movie is bad. You are wrong! I am sorry there is no other way to put it. I do not know what was wrong with this movie. Everything was done extraordinarily well. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were perfectly cast as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Jean Reno was good at being what he always is. A cop. Ian McKellen was probably the best as Sir Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany did a decent job as Silas as well as Alfred Molina who played Bishop Aringarosa. The score was superb and dare i say should have got an Oscar nomination perhaps even should have won! Ron Howard's directing and the camera work are exceptional. I was surprised to find this got second most disappointing adaption from a book to a movie. (first being golden compass) This is unfair. Everything in the book was in the movie except for a few minor details. Nothing huge. I thing everyone did very well and i do not understand what was wrong with the script. It worked fine. It was not outstanding but it was definitely not something to criticize. Do not let anyone else stop you from seeing this movie. :),7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm deliberately NOT going to say much about it because I strongly believe you should all just go and see for yourself!! What I will say is that it starts off with a murder in this museum by this weird guy (who worships Jesus and hurts himself in the name of him!) Tom Hanks (a lecturer in Theology or something religion related) becomes involved presumably because the people unravelling the mystery thought he would come in useful.. the story unfolds from there really with the different people trying to work out the code etc, quite funny in places, also quite graphic scenes (especially with the man who hurts himself, so bare that in mind for under 12's) but a thoroughly motivating storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seats so to speak!

Go for it India,"The hype, the controversy and stupid reviews are finally laid to rest. I watched the movie today and to say it in one word: amazing. I always held that the biased reviews it got from the western media is basically because the movie was never opened for reviewers until the final moments. So, the anti-Code was already lurking amongst the reviewers who along with misguided activists tried to scuttle it.The movie, just like the book, starts with murder in the paraquet hall of the Loveru museum. Its like watching the pages of the book unfold right in front of your eyes. The lead Tom Hanks does a wonderful job as Prof. Langdon, so does Audrey Tautou. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this movie is its portrayal of histroy using cinematic magic. You will witness crusades being fought, the marching of nine Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Jesus Christ and the great sarcophagus of Mary Magdelene. Not to miss is the Councils of Nicaea 325 AD where the Gospels were scrutinized for the first time.I was amazed to watch The Roseline Chapel, Sulpice Chapel, the Temple Church and of course the interior of Loveru, never missing the 666 glass planes considered to be as one character puts it ""the scar of Paris"". Oh my! did i forget to mention the most beautiful painting of Leanardo, the La Belle Ferroniere. This is the first painting the movie starts with when Jacques Sauniere runs for his life. According to the novel The Secret Supper, the La Belle Ferroniere is a real life Cecilia Gallerani whose daughter was an inspiration behind Mona Lisa and the portrait of St.John in the last Supper.The most proficient character is that of Sir Leigh Teabing, played by Ian McKellen, the dialog delivery and his explanation of the history of Holy Grail is the center of the movie. Alfred Molina's performance as Bishop Aringarosa brings out the dedication the faith commands. he says ""it is doctrine, not rules, we follow"". True to it, his angel albino Silas resembles the young Darth Vader of Star Wars"" Episode III, with black cloak complete with hood scared the hell out of me when he crashed flying on Teabing.The screenplay by Akiva Goldsman raises the stake. Hans Zimmer's music score is what I didn't like in the movie. I expected more refined Gothic and gospel music blend. However, the music during the vehicle chase scene is cool.In conclusion I would say: Watch out for the traffic heading from Punjab to Delhi.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly OK,"I had heard a lot of bad things about The DaVinci Code before seeing the movie, so did not have high expectations - thus I was pleasantly surprised.I was a big fan of the book and was pleased to see that this adaptation had stuck fairly faithfully to it (and not gone the way of, for example, LOTR by inserting random stuff into the story). The locations and cinematography were also pleasingly excellent and (although some may disagree) I was a fan of the way the ""recalling memories/past events"" sequences were portrayed and liked the way some of the more wild elements of Christian-bashing from the book were tempered with reasoned, rational explanations and pointed criticms of the church and its history.The film was entertaining and well executed - that is until the final section, where some truly shockingly cheesy dialogue was delivered that had the audience I was literally in roaring with laughter on several occasions that were meant to be profoundly serious. I also found Silas' mannerisms and facial expressions to be often be bordering on comical rather than intense.The only other gripe is that there were a couple of occasions were the storyline lost continuity as I think prior knowledge of the book was assumed.I went in with the expectation that the whole film would be as bad as the last 30-odd minutes, but a good start and middle was cancelled out by a silly and annoying end leaving a distinctly average experience all round.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A worthy adaptation of the book,"In spite of its detractors I feel this movie is a worthy adaptation of the book. Oddly enough the books feels faster paced than the movie at times and of course the fans of the book will miss several details, but here are two reasons I would still recommend this movie: The acting of Ian McKellen is extraordinary, specially how he projects the excitement of the grail quest. But for me, the Finale alone is worth the price of admission; Tom Hank walks towards the Louvre pyramid following the Rose Line to a crescendo of stirring music by Hans Zimmer until he reaches his goal, kneels down, and strikes a Grail Knight pose. The hair in your back will stand up. It just amazing how good music can make a scene unforgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fun flick--I don't get the critical drubbing,"Yes, I read the book. And I enjoyed the film as much if not more. The movie dispenses with lots of unnecessary rambling and gets right to the action. Some have questioned why Langdon has become more of a skeptic of Teabing's theories, but it truly helps to balance out Dan Brown's story where everyone agrees on the same radical beliefs. It's not as much of a turn-off-your-brain action movie as National Treasure, but it's more satisfying. The art direction is superb and I had no problems with the acting. My only real problems came from the pedestrian dialogue. I know they were trying to stay true to a dumbly written book, but they could have spiced it up a bit and avoided a lot of the cheesiness.If more critics were concerned with objectively looking at movies rather than selling a pithy blurb, this movie would be getting better ratings.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The book was bad, the movie was worse","I read Brown's book because I thought where there was smoke, there had to be fire. Any book that sells this many copies must certainly be moderately well-written, right? How could so many people be wrong? Well, they were. It was horrible. I did not expect art, but the book was less artful than Tom Clancy. Pedantic, preachy, atrocious dialog, this was a book written by a man who thought that as long as he generated an intricate plot, he could skip the inconvenient step of actually WRITING. This book made Dan Brown rich, but it did not make him a writer.But still, the underlying core of a good story was there, buried beneath the morass of tortured prose. And so I thought, if anyone could correct the fatuous language, Ron Howard and Sony could certainly afford a screenwriter capable of untangling this mess. I was wrong. It appears that the script merely lifted Dan Brown's horrible language from the book. This is the kind of writing that makes one wish the word processor had never been invented. Copy and paste screen writing. But hearing these words in your mind's ear as you read the book, uttered by characters who aren't really there, is one thing. Hearing these ridiculous lines half-heartedly recited by Tom Hanks makes them even more preposterous.The worst movie Tom Hanks has ever made. Possibly the worst screenplay adaptation of a book this decade. And it's difficult to determine if and where Ron Howard added value.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The relationship between Hanks and Tautou is perfect, given that they just met and are in the midst of an exciting, incredibly complex mystery. McKellen adds another layer of fun and excitement as they unravel the code. All the supporting cast performs quite well. The ""factual"" basis of much of the story, with kernels of truth (Council of Nicea, Constantine, etc.) as well as pure speculation (divinity or not, marriage or not, etc.), requires your further investigation.

I couldn't find a review to support the film. Most reviews made the film seem awful, and shouldn't be watched.However, after watching the film, i can safely say the critics got it wrong. Granted it's no phenomenon the book was, but Ron Howard delivers a thoughtful film that stays faithful to the book. Sure some people will laugh at the climax when Tom Hanks says 'I have to get to a library fast!', but the film is overall very successful.

It didn't follow the book very well. The casting was not credible, the acting dead pan, really flat. It took little advantage of the depth of talent of the cast. Except maybe Ian McKellen, whose character is self centered evil to the core throughout, and ends up a defeated raving lunatic. Still, for him, that's probably more his natural persona than acting. Tom Hanks falls far short of a Harrison Ford professor portrayal. Audry had none of the verve of her Amelie role or even her Senay role in Pretty Dirty Things. Jean Reno's ""Leon"" talent completely suppressed. The film lacked PASSION! Speaking of which, the whole promise of some great revelation undermining God or His Son Jesus Christ was so clearly fiction, that the film came across as false advertising. National Treasure, or any Indiana Jones film can be watched repeatedly and deliver great entertainment. This film is more like a handsome man or beautiful woman of allure, until they open their mouths and a hollow inside is revealed. For mystery or suspense novel/movie seekers this one will leave you unsatisfied on most any level. You feel cheated. Still, great cinematography.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It may turn out to be the best movie this summer.,"""The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"" secularly head for the coast as I remember American Pie reporting. The Sisters of Saint Joseph had a decidedly different take for this Catholic boy, one that brooked no argument against the divinity of the Son, Jesus Christ.So with what glee have I read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code and seen the faithful film version directed by Ron Howard. Anyone who would dare compromise the nun's version to posit Jesus marrying Mary Magdalene is an instant hero for this critically thinking, subsequently Jesuit-trained professor and film critic, whose skepticism the well-wimpled ones punished mercilessly and regularly.The film, with Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who helps unravel a centuries-old mystery about the Holy Grail and the uncelibate Christ, is a lengthy debate about the truth of the myth and the places of Opus Dei and the Knights Templar in the history of the church's violent past. Regardless of where you stand on the possibility that Christ was not divine, this film makes you interested in the debate and immediately suspicious of the Catholic Church's goodness.But that skepticism is healthy in many ways, not dangerous at all to the doctrinaire leadership in real life, yet in this film the conservative church groups fear it enough to murder in the name of the Lord. So the laity joins the priests in beating the devil at his own game. Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ dwells overly long on the physical suffering of Christ; Howard and Brown dwell too much on the thrills if the chase. As Jimmy Durante quipped, ""Everybody wants to get into the act."" The film is so faithful to the novel that the slowest part of the film, the chase after the intellectual exposition of the theory by the mesmerizing Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabling, is just as weak and it is in the novel.The Da Vinci Code may turn out to be the best movie this summer: It's faithful to the novel, intelligent in exposition, and an easy 2 1/2 hrs of intrigue. The faithful translation of Brown's provocative theories alone should please the highbrows; the thriller component should satisfy the summer sunbathers.",,Anonymous,Mystery
An Apple and the Rose,"Greetings again from the darkness. It does seem as if everyone has read Dan Brown's book and of course, rarely does a movie based on a quality novel ever measure up. Although there are exceptions, Ron Howard's version of ""The DaVinci Code"" is not one of them. For fans of the book, there are wonderful moments of awe and recognition. However, there are more moments of mediocrity, even near boredom. In other words, the visual presentation offers nothing new, save for some wonderful shots inside and out of historic buildings and churches.The casting of Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou seemed perfect, but the execution is lackluster at best. Neither brings any energy to their part and the lines are spoken as if dress rehearsal is the NEXT step. Hanks in particular appears lackadaisical and really doesn't fit the Harvard professor role. Ian McKellen brings a much needed lift to the movie when his Teabing finally appears. Jean Reno is solid as Fache and Alfred Molina is fine as the Bishop. As in the novel, Silas (played well by Paul Bettany) is by far the most interesting character. The guy is definitely committed to his cause.Despite the beautiful scenery and historic shots, it is with regret that I report the film just doesn't do justice to a colorful and exciting novel. Yes, the book is an easy read and it seemed to move much faster than the movie. It will be interesting to see how those who have not read the book react to the presentation and if they are able to follow along. So many details are skipped and Howard evidently assumes the viewer will know what has already happened and why the story has jumped ahead.Howard's last outing, ""Cinderella Man"" was sadly ignored by movie-goers, but I fear this one will be crucified. Let's hope his next outing, a remake of ""East of Eden"" will be his breakout.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Adaptation from Novel,"Dan Brown's book adapted really well to screen. They took some artistic liberties but stuck to the book probably better than any movie out there.Very few things were cut or simplified.I think the reviews are kinda mediocre because people are expecting Mission Impossible 3 type action and that just isn't gonna happen.A Symbolist, a Cryptologist and a Gimp can only get into so much action and adventure. This movie is a mystery and much more cerebral than I think most people want to deal with. I think it was wonderful and Ian Mckellen is the BOMB. He played Tebing wonderfully!!! Paul Bettany played Silas to a T!!!!

Disappointed,"I saw this film tonight hoping that it would recapture the feeling of seeing a film that everyone in the world wanted to see. It might have been the somewhat lame audience, but the movie did nothing for me. Ron Howard was an excellent choice to direct Dan Brown's novel; he's a sharp and provoking director with a beautifully universal aesthetic. This film has less in common with the fluid editing or powerful photography of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, or even Cinderella Man and more in common with some of his sloppier work with EdTV or The Grinch. Partly because this film is an adaptation from a book, The DaVinci Code suffers from a choppy, incoherent feel. Howard and long time collaborator Akiva Goldsman try to follow Brown's novel religiously, nervously moving from one character and narrative to the next. What ensues is a stylistic mess, clumsily using hand held cameras and somewhat obscure angles for a mass appeal film. Hanz Zimmer does provide a supportive score, but it is too prevalent in the film. I don't know if that belongs to Howard or Zimmer, but much of the action would have more impact if we were less dependent on someone telling us when to be excited. Which brings me finally to the flashbacks. This is especially where the adaptation component comes in. Since novels have so much more room and time to elaborate upon a character's history and personal development, movie adaptations must make up for this with more succinct and efficient suggestions. Howard chose to actually show many of the characters' ""historical monologues"" (these could either pertain to the characters' actual recollection of personal memories or their summations of the conspiratorial history regarding their pursuit) through an awkward integration of flashbacks. The one and only that sticks out successfully is the Council of Nicaea-portrayed as a mess of courtly men throwing words at one another as if they were weapons. Pulling back, the cast is good but, as other critics have noted, they look rather silly speaking some of Brown's gibberish with serious tones. Hanks and Paul Bettany surprised me. Hanks is a fantastic actor, but I thought him wrong for the role until I saw the film. Bettany was very effective, leaving no hint of his lighter side he's shown in previous films. McKellan is wonderful as always. Like the actual locales the characters travel to, the rest of the cast function as props, looking very pretty on screen but remain underused.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Praise Sir Ian McKellen in this fine adaptation!,"The DaVinci code, i had read in reviews was a complete mess. Therefore, wary of a complete bomb, i wasn't expecting the greatest film of all time, and it wasn't the greatest film of all time. But, it sure as hell wasn't bad.The start began OK, but until the arrival of Ian McKellen about 45 minutes in, i was beginning to fear that it was about to head severely downhill. Hanks looked one dimensional, Tautou looked like the 'fill in the gaps' support. Thank goodness for Ian McKellen. He really got Hanks going, the middle scene at Teabings château, one of the least interesting in the novel, became the best scene of the film. Suddenly, Hanks had some live, some buzz, and from this point on, its as good a film as it could have been, by no means the greatness Dan Brown wrote, but as good as i had hoped.The final 10 minutes after McKellen & Bettany (Superb) had no more part to play, left you feeling that once again the two leads weren't quite reaching top form, but, the final ten seconds, closed what was a excellent, but not superb, piece of fiction.Overall, a fair 8 out of ten!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
DVC - Cool and cryptic or complete crap?,"Me and the missus are just back from the pictures in Adelaide, first night of the Da Vinci Code.I enjoyed it as had read the book but think if you haven't seen the book it would be too fast-paced to follow that easily. The codes and riddles that puzzled you for pages and pages in the book were solved in seconds on film and that was disappointing.Also I didn't like the actors in this so much. Sir Lee Teabing (Gandalf) the English aristocrat was superb; the albino monk was good too. But the French girl was too young and Tom Hanks instead of being the heroic and highly academic Robert Langdon was just a bumbling buffoon on screen.Real shame as the story is fantastic and just spoiled a bit on screen by the pace.Verdict: Enjoyed it but still a mediocre 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Davinci falls to impress,"One of the most highly anticipated movies of the year proves to be one of the most disappointing. Tom Hanks looks all at sea, not really sure what he is meant to be doing.Again Akiva Goldmans adaptation misses the mark by a long way. after the dire Batman and Robin and the equally bad A Beautiful Mind. It is surprising that he still finds work. he is responsible for changing the ending of the book (thuse missing the point of the piece) which is not the only bad point. gone is the audience participation, hands up if as you the book you tried to crack the codes and solve the puzzles. Everything goes along at a rate of knots, leaving the audience frustrated and mqny times unsure as to exactly what the hell is going on. The only redeeming feature in a wooden cast is Sir Ian Mcellen, who is easily the only reason to watch this film!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An Honorably Darn'd Worthwhile Dragon,"Pop culture religious heresy is a pleasure only mildly guilty as long as it's done with reverence. Spielberg nailed this formula long ago with the ""Raiders"" movies & Ron Howard takes a pretty good whack at it with ""The Da Vinci Code,"" or, ""Dan Brown's Big Book of Renaissance Puzzles."" Harvard religious symbology professor Langdon (Hanks) is brought in to consult on the murder in the Louvre of his associate Sauniere (Marielle), which features numerous cryptic symbols & clues left by the dying man in his last minutes. Police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), after learning that detective Captain Fache (Reno) is convinced that Langdon is the killer but knowing that the professor is not, helps Langdon escape. They can only clear their names by solving riddles deliberately left by the dead Sauniere & leading to the exposure of a secret society dedicated to preserving the hidden truth of the ""Holy Grail,"" a revelation that would embarrass & perhaps destroy the Catholic Church hierarchy. The Quest for the Grail crosses the paths of Opus Dei official Bishop Aringarosa (Molina), his vicious, self-mortifying albino henchman Silas (Bettany), oily Swiss banker Vernet (Prochnow), wealthy, eccentric Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen) & an unseen, sinister mastermind whom Silas & Aringarosa know only as ""The Teacher."" Brown's convoluted tale is built around puzzles & selective interpretations of historical fact & legend, a challenge for a filmmaker since the viewer, unlike the reader, can't turn back the pages or put the story down until the movie comes out on video. Howard & Company get off to a strong start. Akiva Goldsman's script begins deftly, following the book closely without losing or intimidating the viewer. Howard's direction sets the tone darkly & tensely, not ponderously or somberly. Hanks is understated & terse as Langdon, much as Howard directed him in ""Apollo 13,"" where he also played a stressed-out professional whose life depends on his skill. Tautou is strongly, heartbreakingly evocative of Audrey Hepburn, almost as if she were in ""Charade"" and her roles with Cary Grant were reversed. Bettany, Reno & Molina portray their heavies with even more sympathy than Brown let them have, one way in which the movie improved on the book. Howard & Goldsman do an excellent job of covering up the book's greatest flaw, which is the ludicrous ease of solving a key mystery, by keeping the action moving steadily & reducing the mystery's prominence. The film is still aloft when it gets to Teabing, whom McKellen makes his very own with a perfect mixture of self-important eccentricity, condescending intelligence and scholarly eagerness. As the clues unravel, so does the film. It goes on at least a half hour too long, passing one Oh-My-God climax after another, desperately throwing in more Western Civ puzzles like fuel on a fire. CGI special effects in the second half confuse more than illustrate, though they probably cost more than all those ever created by Ray Harryhausen. Perhaps Howard, like most other big-ticket directors, is no longer capable of telling a story without whiz-bang effects, or maybe he couldn't find another way to deal with Brown's concentration of so many difficult, confusing clues near the end of the story. For most of the movie, the action keeps the viewer's attention away from glaring holes in Brown's religious-historical background, particularly the flawed interpretation of Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" which should be apparent if you can answer ""yes"" when Indiana Jones asks if you ever went to Sunday School. Unfortunately, all that baggage comes crashing down as the film approaches its end. Langdon's attempt to explain it away in a short speech to Sophie falls flat, tending, if anything, to negate the whole point of the bloody adventure they share. Despite several brief attempts, Hanks & Tautou never get to fully develop their characters either individually or together, another drawback of following Brown's story closely. Those looking forward to a chemistry like Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn or Gregory Peck/Sophia Loren will be quite disappointed. Despite the global furor, the Opus Dei order is not demonized, since the story clearly indicates that Aringarosa & Silas are operating beyond official sanction. Catholic characters in fact come across with a sympathy--sometimes even nobility--when the story has time for them, which is seldom. If the ""The Da Vinci Code"" is open to a religious criticism, it's a depiction of Christianity as a religion only fully appreciated by brainiac puzzle-masters. To that end, this reviewer has left you an anagram in the title of this review, made up of the names of two real-life people associated with this movie plus the name of one vital plot device. Like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it's best enjoyed without thinking much about any historical rationales behind it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tom Hanks is NOT Robert Langdon,"A major disappointment for me as I watched the movie yesterday. I was expecting a well performed role of Robert Langdon by Tom Hanks but he didn't pulled it off plus there was no chemistry between him and Sophie! OMG! They resemble more like a father-daughter role in a classical movie. BUT Silas.... the man. He really pulled it off in his role as a loyal servant of Aringosa and the teacher.The movie FAILED to make full use of the TWIST and turns on the novel. Poorly done.... One of the most thrilling twist would be Teabing revealing himself as the teacher and yet... yet.... a major disappointment.the movie FAILED to make the audience ""ohhhhhh"", ""really?"", ""i can't believe this!"" instead twas like this: ""????"" and this ""..."" and this (-.-) IF NOT FOR SILAS I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS MOVIE a 4/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I read the book and loved the movie,"Critics be damned but I loved the movie. When I read the book, I found some of the explanations long and drawn out. (I actually listened to it on audio book to and from work for a couple of weeks) Having said that, I was actually looking forward to the movie so that some of it would just unfold instead of a living text book, if you will. There were a few parts that hearkened a bit to Dan Brown's heavy and professorial prose but then I decided to give them a break. When I was in college and grad school I was sort of the weirdo. I am smart, sort of, I guess! but also blonde and originally from Miami. Not exactly what you would picture as the studious intellectual. But I am smart and had many clever friends who sometimes liked to speak in lofty terms and argue arcane points and flex their mental muscles. I felt the same way when Langdon and Tibbing discussed the Priory and the Grail. It was a bit annoying but then again, sometimes smarty pants scholars are annoying. That is part of their ""charm"" So, bottom line... If you have read the book then you should know what to expect in the movie. 30M people can not be wrong. Maybe I am too simple? Yet again, I have had it with the critics telling what is smart and engaging. You watch movies for a living! You don't create them. Talk to me then when you have put yourself out there. Until then, I will stick to making my own decisions. I was never bored, never looked at my watch and will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Didn't quite capture the magic!,"In my very humble opinion, I think in general terms Ron Howard did a very good job of this screen adaptation. I never looked at my watch, plus the quality of the cast and use of the Louvre gave it a credible feel. However, there were a number of disappointing elements. Firstly - the entire film lacked the pace of the novel. The book reads like an episode of 24, however the film sadly didn't capture it as it was bordering the boring line. Secondly - there was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Robert Langdon and Sophie as described in the book, particularly at the end when the film was altered to fit the no chemistry factor. Audrey Tatou was a bit of a cold fish in this as well which was rather disappointing. Thirdly - what was with those special effects in and around Westminster Abbey?!?! That gave the whole film a completely unrealistic feel to it and brought the credibility of the film down several notches.I also believe Tom Hanks didn't shine as he normally does in his films as the other cast members ie. Sir Ian McKellan, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany, were absolutely superb and such strong characters in the film that it took the limelight off him a little bit... another difference from the book to the film. I don't mean to be taking away his acting skills at all, just that the others were just as good.Will be interesting to see how they go with Angels and Demons as I believe that was the better book of the two.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is a very good film.  Why all the fuss?,"Ron Howard did a very good job. Seems it would have been hard not to, given the source material. Since it wasn't that long since I read the book, there really wasn't much in the way of suspense for me, but I did appreciate the way the film was put together, particularly the method Howard used for illustrating scenes of the past. The actors all do well. It was interesting to see Jean Reno's statement that the author had him in mind for the role of the French policeman, because when I was reading the book, Reno seemed the obvious choice. Now to the religious nonsense. The book is a work of fiction, the film is a work of fiction. If the idea that Jesus had a family bothers you -- try not to think about it. Don't read the book. Don't see the film. If you still feel bad, lie down quietly with a cool cloth over your eyes. For people free of that hang-up, though, I recommend The DaVinci Code as a good film well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining!,"What is the problem with everyone and this book/film? No-one has a good word to say about either, and I'm puzzled because I enjoyed 'em both! Okay, so they're not great literature - but I personally don't know many people who read Shakespeare in bed at night or go to see filmed stage versions of Hamlet and the like, although I've no problem with those who do. It's horses for courses and we don't all have to like the same things! I would say, I also noticed the arm thing but it was a trivial hiccough in an otherwise beautifully filmed and reasonably acted bit of entertainment. Langdon is an academic, not a special agent and I don't think there necessarily has to be a sexual chemistry between him and Sophie. To me, he came over as what he was; a staid academic thrown into a dangerous situation and trying to deal with it - I'd have been a bit off my best too! I thought the driving scenes were brill (...reminded me of me...) and I have to say Silas' self-chastisement made me physically shudder! Paul Bettany was at once a chilling religious psychopath and a damaged child (...which I feel could have been explained a bit more....). I do, however, feel that viewers who have read the book may enjoy it more than those who did not, as it is quite an involved plot to squeeze into a two hour film. I do normally sit there whispering 'that's not right - look at that - you wouldn't see one of those there...' etc. etc. but the fact that I was able to suspend this irritating trait for two hours tells me it wasn't that bad!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Maybe it is, but still not worth paying to sit in a cinema and get bored.

Decoding the Encoded.,"A murder inside the Louvre in Paris leads to an incredible journey for a Harvard professor (Tom Hanks) and a beautiful French detective (Audrey Tautou) as clues and puzzles seem to point to an unbelievable secret that could rock the very foundation of the Catholic Church and Christianity as a whole. Along the way they look for help from a cryptic expert (Ian McKellen) while dodging a pesky French police officer (Jean Reno). An eclectic cloak and dagger organization which includes priest Alfred Molina and albino monk Paul Bettany also attempts everything in their power to stop Hanks and Tautou from uncovering the greatest con ever conceived by man---the possibility of Mary Magdalene's real relationship with Jesus Christ and her true historical role. Dan Brown's ridiculously successful novel sadly falls flat for the most part on the silver screen. Director Ron Howard's picture is well made and highly ambitious, but its tone is oddball, its pace is sporadic, the chemistry among its stars is nowhere to be found, and its pathos are fuzzy and uninspired. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman's (who collaborated five years ago in 2001 with Howard on the critically superior ""A Beautiful Mind"") adaptation is preposterous and totally unclear. ""The Da Vinci Code"" drags its feet, then sprints with confusing action sequences and wild flash-points/flashbacks that will leave many more confused by the elaborate eye candy. A major loss that is just as disappointing and unwanted as the other cinematic busts of the 2000s (""Pearl Harbor"", ""Gods and Generals, ""Troy"", ""Alexander"").

I have heard reviews discussing how there was too much dialogue in the movie. My thoughts are that the movie was made with the assumption that the viewer had not read the book. The dialogue spent a reasonable amount of time explaining what was happening. I found it to be extremely helpful.There was plenty of action and surprises and I did not have one minute where I was bored. The acting was good and the characters well cast. I think Robert Langdon could have been played by quite a few actors out there today but I was happy with the choice of Tom Hanks.

"Well done, but sometimes too close to the book.","I think, one of the main reasons why many people (and critics) did not like the movie is, that it is too faithful to the book: If you read a book, you made you own ""mind-movie"" with your own perfect actors, places and scenes of it and you have all time in the world to read it. This are only a few of the reasons why the ""book is always better than the movie"". For a movie, you have a given running-time and it is almost impossible to put all the thinks of a book into a movie and to fit everyones imagination who have read the book. So the most movie adaptations of a book will be shortened in story and characters and sometimes parts of the book must be changed to fit the strengths and possibilities of a movie. The makers of ""The Da Vinci Code"" tried it the other way round, put a little bit too much of the book into the movie and tried to be too close to the book. They missed sometimes to retell the story with the possibilities that a movie can give; even if this means to cut out some parts of the story or to change parts of it. The storyline is often too fast (even the more than 20 minutes longer Director's Cut) so it can be confusing for someone who did not read the book to follow the plot (yes, i have read the book first). But this film is, in my humble opinion, far better than most critics said. The action is good, the flow of the story is straight, it contains a lot of riddles. It is like a modern ""Indiana Jones""-story! I think, the best idea is to read the book first, and than watching the movie. Don't miss it, it is really worth to see!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Open Mind is Important,"In response to the first comment, I think it's important to make a few key statements.First of all, it could be argued that the Bible - particularly if it is merely accepted at face value - is preventing people from exploring history in a more objective sense. Those who only believe The Da Vinci Code (a work of fiction) are doing themselves just as much of a disservice as those who only believe the Bible (itself also largely a work of fiction). Both of these books do contain historical truths, but both also contain embellishments and fictions.Far from being an anti-Christian film or premise, I think it's important to understand that The Da Vinci Code simply seeks to explore the history of Christianity in a more objective context. Emperor Constantine's virtually autocratic construction of the New Testament, for example, is an important point for both Christians and non-Christians all over the world. Why were other Gospels not included in the Bible? The answers are obvious, but nobody ever seems to consider the simple idea that the Bible is a construction of man more than anything else.So, I would say to Christians, perhaps this movie should shake your unwavering faith - because an ""unwavering faith"" is in and of itself probably not an entirely healthy thing. But I would also say that true Christians - those who understand the history of the religion as well as its context in Western civilization - have absolutely nothing to fear.At least, the movie can be ignored by those who aren't interested.At most, it can become a tool for further discussion and hopefully a more objective analysis of Christianity and how it affects the world today.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Suspenseful if you didn't read the novel - Still enjoyable if you did.,"If you like Indiana Jones style plot devices such as puzzle solving to find clues, you'll enjoy this flick. There were many twists and turns and a major revelation about the Christian church that would have floored most viewers had they lived in a cave when the book was released or during all the hype surrounding the release of the movie.In my opinion, all the hype, protests, and TV specials describing what all the hype and protests were about gave away too much of the film's plot. Had this not been the case, I probably would have rated this film a little higher.I've watched this film get beat up by professional critics and just don't understand why they were so harsh. No this wasn't one of Tom Hanks' best characters, and it probably wasn't one of Ron Howard's best efforts, but if your a fan of the novel, you'll be happy that Tom Hanks played the character ""to the tee"" and Ron followed the plot line of the novel very closely. This film did not deserve many of the 1 out 5 star ratings I have seen.Although some of the suspense was lost on me, having read the novel, I still found the twists and turns exciting. Sometimes I knew what to expect next, but there was a thrill in seeing what I visualized when I read the novel actually happening on screen very much as how I had imagined them.On that same note, I was amazed to see that Dan's Browns descriptions of locations and settings in the novel gave me a very incredible and near exact visual images of how these same locations appeared on screen, and that is to say in real life. I've never been to the Louvre or to the Temple Church in London, but when I saw the scenes on screen in these locations, they were exactly as I had pictured them.The same held true for many of the characters, save for Robert Langdon. I did not picture Tom Hanks as this character at all. However, after the first scene, I found that he was in fact a good fit for the character.I noticed quite a few people in the theater, probably those who had not read the novel, cringing and cowering in many suspenseful scenes and eerie depictions of a self-flagellation ritual performed by Silas, the devout Opus Dei disciple played by Paul Bettany. The suspense was effective, and Paul shined in what may seem to most as very far from any character he has ever played.Overall, a very good film. If your the ""wait for the DVD"" types, this is one you should not wait for. Go see it in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not exactly top notch,"I sat through this movie thinking 'wow, I didn't realize it was this poorly written when I read the book' - the acting was decent, but the movie, and I think perhaps the book (though I read it when it initially came out and don't remember it independent from the movie) relies entirely on its provocative claims to support it as a story. if these claims are not new to you, (and they shouldn't be new to anyone who has even a passing familiarity with conspiracy theories, or religious studies), then the movie is mildly entertaining at best. I got in with a readmission ticket from the theatre, (they messed up another movie I saw), so I didn't have to pay. given I had nothing else to do those few hours, I don't' regret it - but I don't think it would've been worth paying to see. on a good note, I was surprised when I got out of the theatre how much time had gone by. while it was a long movie, and I was familiar with the plot line, it didn't bore me too badly. it was alright to kill some time with, but I don't think it should win any awards.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Movie!,Everyone has heard about this movie. And almost everyone has watched The Da Vinci Code Movie! Well just in case you heard about the movie and were reading a review in a Newspaper and read it sucks. Well you need to see this movie because the newspapers are W-R-O-N-G WRONG! And hearing that from a 13 year old boy should make you want to see this movie instead of the WWE Horror movie See No Evil (See No Evil Movie review coming shortly) This movie was just filled with twists and turns. When you thought it was over there was yet another part to the movie.The Da Vinci Code is about Professor Robert Langdon (Tam Hanks) and Sophie Neveu on a hunt for the Holy Grail.During their journey to the Holy Grail you find out people you thought were good would kill their own friends to get the Holy Grail.Langdon and Neveu find out a secret that would devastate the entire world if it were to find out.There are a lot of subtitles at the beginning and after everything starts to happen it gets better and there are less subtitles. The movie has a lot of talking but it is interesting in what they say.If you would like to find out more check out this movie at local theaters near you! Thats my review of the Da Vinci code movie.Please if you have read the book or watched the movie please keep stuff to yourself instead of posting up what happened! After reading this review and comparing it to the newspapers. Which makes you want to see it more? Because I'm only 13 and Id rather be watching a movie about action (Which it has a lot of in it) and Comedy.My 10 year old brother even liked it a lot! Well tell me if this has made you want to see the movie more or less!,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This is an engrossing picture, despite its flaws","Robert (Tom Hanks) is an expert on historical signs and symbols. Giving a lecture in Paris, he is suddenly summoned by the police to aid an investigation. It seems a gentleman at the Louvre was killed but managed to write a message in blood on his body. While giving his opinion, Robert is caught up in a very tangled cat and mouse game, along with Sophie (Audrey Tautou), between the police and other forces. Robert and Sophie's lives are at stake and so are the secrets long kept by various Catholic societies. Just what is going down? This is an interesting movie, despite its slow story and shadowy look. Hanks and Tautou are great as the souls caught in an intrigue without a compass. Paul Bettany is downright scary as a terrorist Catholic monk. The tale is a bit wandering and long and the decision to shoot the film under a cover of darkness may turn off a few viewers. But, not many. For those who read the book and, for those who did not, here is a movie that has a sensational tale to tell, no matter the final production values. Most folks who sit down to watch the film will find it a great popcorn and soda kind of affair. What is more, the film may inspire people from all faiths and backgrounds to delve more into the world of history, both of Christ and of the Catholic church. As films go, that is perhaps the crowning achievement: a viewer who wants to reflect on the movie in the days and weeks ahead.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Oh my - could they have done any worse.,"Firstly - the book. It took some time, but eventually I was converted and read it.....quickly. Engrossing, page turning piece of harmless fun which had the right mix of ideas to make it work on the big screen.But then Ron Howard forgot that the adaptations which work best are just that, adaptations, not cut and paste efforts.He sticks with fervour to the original text of the book, and instead of taking the best ideas and working with them to reinvent the novel for the screen, he includes everything, and boy does it become a borefest.Bar McKellan, the cast are really really flat. I won't give away anymore in case there are some of you out there who haven't read the book.But my advice, read the book.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fake novel, fake movie","Adaptation of a blasphemy with scent of scientific research, the movie is far of any definition. Stupid, childish, grotesque, confuse, bizarre, only surprise is the cast. Sure, the box - office and the fascination of Dan Brown book must have a nice package. But why this ? Actors with impressive roles, precise status, in an awkward caricature, which can be only a burden. Only money ? Spell of an insane and sickening tale ? Desire to work with this director ? Dream to be part of project ? It is a mystery ! In any case, Da Vinci code is only a blasphemy with ambition to be truth. Not literary virtues, not interesting story, not great revelations. Only chains of lies and corpse of common sense. A show of ordure and Leonardo da Vinci as axis for rusty carousel.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't Believe the Reviews,"Much later than most, I read the book. When I heard that Tom Hanks was starring, I was surprised because there's really not much of a character for him to play in Prof. Langdon. After reading the reviews (did you see the crying Anthony Lane did in the New Yorker?) I figured the movie was wooden and too-close-to-the-book. I was especially deflated by the several reviews that said this was a terrible performance by Tom Hanks. The audience doesn't seem to agree and neither do I. I was at a 12:45pm show in New York today and the theater was 2/3 full. For a weekday, that's how we say ""hit.""This movie is a fine thriller. Not the greatest movie, but a fine thriller Tom Hanks does very well with a role that doesn't have much in it. He doesn't overplay a thing and plays it real. I wish they hadn't had him say, ""this can't be so"" twice within the first ten minutes, but that's a nit. The movie follows Hollywood thriller conventions and does so well. The added wrinkle of the religious mystery they're unveiling is handled well enough, making for a successful ""family"" themed resolution. A little more development of Sophie and her issues would have made that resolution even better.So why all the savaging reviews? I can think of a reason . . . or maybe 40 million of them. People who make their living in the arts (like many reviewers, particularly the effete ones)have trouble with Dan Brown's book selling 40 million copies. God knows why such things take off (pun acknowledged)but people who struggle to get published are kept up at night by what they see as the unmerited success of a hack writer. It happens. The movie is fine. Tamp down your expectations and it'll be fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"interesting, but overwhelming","""The Da Vinci Code"" is the most over hyped/disappointing movie, next to ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" of 2006. That does not mean it is a bad movie, or horrible movie. Unfortunately, it also does not mean it is a good movie. It is just an okay movie. It is worth to watch but you should not expect much from it.""The Da Vinci Code"" is a movie based on the popular novel by Dan Brown. Robert Langdon is in Paris on business when he is summoned to The Louvre. A dead body has been found. Suddenly Langdon, with the help of a Cryptologist and a British Royal Historian, sets off on an adventure to unravel an ancient secret that has been hidden for over two thousand years. Can he decipher that code, well you will just have to read the book or watch the movie to find out.The main flaw of this movie is the pacing. It is a very slow-paced movie. It was very hard to sit through the 2 hours and 29 minutes runtime. There is an extended cut, not out in the United States, which is 2 hours and 54 minutes long, which would have been even harder to get through. It is so dialog driven that the movie turned from what could have been an interesting mystery thriller to an extended history class you are forced to be a part of. This reviewer had not read the book, so it all felt a little overwhelming.The saving point of this movie, or at least what made this from getting a lower review, is the acting. As mentioned in the last paragraph, this reviewer had not read the book, so there will not be any comparisons to the characters in the book. Of course, Tom Hanks is always professional, and it is the same with his portrayal of Robert Langdon. Audrey Tautou, while her French accent was very difficult to understand, was good as Sophie Neveau. Ian McKellen was great as Sir Leigh Teabing. Jean Reno was in there too as Captain Bezu Fache. Paul Bettany stole the show as the murderous albino monk, Silas. Alfred Molina as the Bishop, Manuel Aringarosa was also good.Unfortunately, while there were some good thrilling parts, the information was just too much and it was overwhelming. At least with a book like this, you can pause, write notes, and eventually stop when it gets to be overwhelming. The movie is not as bad as some people has made them out to be, Ron Howard does not even deserve a Razzie for the direction of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but it was not outstanding either. One thing ""The Da Vinci Code"" movie does well is makes you, and mainly the people who did not read the book, want to read the novel. Unfortunately, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is only recommended to those who have read the book!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Way Below Expectations,"I can only imagine this story is told far better in Dan Brown's novel, because this film is not the groundbreaker I had anticipated. Far too many things happen oh so conveniently just at the right moment, so the two lead characters can continue on their Easter egg hunt. There are that many twists in it, a fair few you can guess easily, that you never get a chance to appreciate the story, because it's changed again in two minutes.The underlying premise is really engrossing, and should keep you guessing throughout, but it didn't take long to get so ridiculous that it removes any realism from the plot.Acting from McKellen and Bettany was superb, however the rest were mediocre, and particularly towards the beginning some of the interactions were just plain wooden.Above all though, the whole thing kicks off with a ridiculous set of clues. An old man has just been shot, but not to worry, he still has the energy to do laps of the Louvre writing out clues in invisible ink next to the most impressive paintings he can find. These clues are then coded in a way he quickly thinks up, knowing who in the world he wants to figure them out. Then to finish off with, he returns to where he was shot, does some nice body art in his own blood, lays down on his newly bloody painted floor, and dies in a nice pose. Yep, fair enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mixed vote on this one.,"My wife and I went to see The Da Vinci Code last night, as she had read the book and wanted to see the picture. I tagged along as I had heard so many mixed reviews of the movie. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although not as much as she enjoyed the book. I am not a religious person and really I thought it was dragged out quite a bit. I like the acting performances of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou who I had not seen before this film, but the outstanding job done by Ian Mc Kellen was just great. I also liked the acting job done by Paul Bettany. My advice is go see it if you like religious picture but skip it if you do not.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I especially liked the historical backgrounds, it put the movie's current events in perspective.I can't understand why the critics had a problem with the direction.

Decent if it were an indie film,"Too many silly things happening in this movie. Script and screenplay writers should get fired for the silliness. Example: you're going to sit there and tell me a mortally wounded elderly man is going to stumble around a museum writing cryptic anagrams for tom Hanks to solve, in blood (only a black light can see lol) all over priceless artwork, then retrace his steps back to where he was shot...paint a pentagram in his blood on the floor....THEN get naked and draw another pentagram on his body with his blood AGAIN...THEN die...lol right. And the mini car chase scene where she's driving a little toy car backwards, evading the police through heavy Paris traffic was laugh out loud stupid.

I Wish I Cared More,"Let me first confess that I never read the book. My friends all did, and they regretted it. They hated the movie more than I did, because I had NO expectations on its quality, whereas they had a concrete vision of how it should have been. However, expectations or not, I was pretty disappointed. After all this controversy it's been getting over the ""big Christian scandal that's lasted centuries,"" I have to say I was let down. As an avid Christian, I thought this would at least peak my interest a little bit. Insult me, intrigue me, whatever. SOMETHING, please. But the presentation, the bland line delivery, and the groggy pace really hurt the film. As the credits rolled at the end, I walked out thinking that I could never have seen this movie, and my life would be the exact same. That is not the feeling one should get after seeing a movie with as much controversial hype as this. I've pretty much already forgotten almost everything that happened in the movie, and I have a pretty good memory.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hype Can't Make It Any Better,"It's going to be a sad day for Dan Brown fans when they go to see his, ""The DaVinci Code"". Not only does the film not live up to the novel, or to the hype, but it also doesn't even breach the surface of all the potential the movie had going for it with some good actors, such a Hanks, Tatou, Reno, Molina and McKellen. Although there were good performances from Tatou and McKellen, the cast in general performed rather poorly. When I see a film adaptation of a novel or a book, I prepare myself for the usual disappointment that parts of the story will be changed and edited for the sake of time. In ""The DaVinvi Code"" however, I was more than surprised to see that not only were some parts missing and altered, but there were many things added as well. There were many instances where the story was rushed, leaving many questions unanswered. This will also leave anyone who hasn't read the book somewhat lost. WARNING to those who have not read the book; watch the movie with someone who has so they can fill in the many gaps. I love the novel and my love for it had not been altered after watching the film. Yet I don't believe Ron Howard did any justice to the book with his direction. In summary, the movie is still worth while to watch, although maybe not in theaters. For those who have read the book, prepare yourselves for some disappointment. As for those who have not read the book, prepare yourselves to discover the ""greatest story ever told"".",,Anonymous,Mystery
"OK movie, what's the big fuss about?","The audience reaction to this movie is so polarized, and the critical reaction to universally negative, that I had to go see it just to see where I would fall. My impression is that the book is a great page turner, albeit written at a 10th grade level.First of all, I have not read the book, so I found it a bit confusing. But it was a very handsomely made movie, fairly provocative, nothing really outstanding, but certainly not bad. I haven't a clue as to the total dislike of the movie by the critics, I have sat thru far worse. I imagine to someone who had read the book, and knew all the intricacies would find it a very good movie.My partner thought it was an excellent adaptation, though of course the book, as usual ""was better."" As for the religious controversy, I'll let the religious fight over that. In my view, anything that puts organized religion in the bad light it deserves is OK with me, even if the particulars of this story are ""fiction."" I can see why true believers might not be too thrilled with it. At least no one is getting killed over it.Overall if you liked the book, I think you will find the movie very well done and beautiful to look at. If you didn't like the book, you won't.

Now as far as adaptions go I can only guess since I haven't read the book yet. There did seem to be a greater attention to detail that you normally find in a 'big Hollywood movie' while avoiding the normal pitfalls of 'dumbing' the movie down.

"Worth the watch, but is it a classic?","The Da Vinci Code. Talked about a great deal, caught in a firestorm of controversy for fictional theories on one of the world's major religions (Christianity), and a star-packed cast... all the fuel is there for a potentially great fire. But does the Da Vinci Code satisfy? Let me evaluate the movie as a movie, for movies are a different animal than books. If you've read Dan Brown's novel, you will have preconceived notions. I encourage you to take this as a movie and leave out the comparisons until later if that is the case.Casting is well done. Tom Hanks is a strong name and with that comes the task of making the character its own. For actors with star power the challenge is to make you forget that you are watching the actor and are instead watching the character. Hanks does well as the lead in this regard, but is not perfect. Audrey Tatou is not a household name, yet her Sophie Neveu is also fairly strong. The pairing of Hanks and Tatou does not generate stellar chemistry, but is not objectionable either.At the top of his game is Sir Ian McKellen. His portrayal of Leigh Teabing is excellent and believable. Alfred Molina is a great actor, yet I found his priestly character a bit melodramatic. Granted, the character is a supporting role, yet there are moments where you wonder if a priest could really be ""that way."" Paul Bettany IS Silas and is suitably creepy as a fanatical if misguided monk. Jean Reno puts forth a strong performance as Bezu Fache.Cinematography is lush and consistent. The film is visually appealing and makes excellent use of lighting and color. It's easy to believe you are in Paris, which is helped by the sparing and timely use of the native language, which is captioned where it appears. Special effects are sparingly used and to good effect to help advance a complex story. One niggle for me is the fact that the albino monk does not have pink eyes - although it appears Bettany is wearing some kind of contact lens to make his stare burn into you, it's a strange inaccuracy.The soundtrack is excellent in that it's transparent. Tension is built at the appropriate moments but never overwhelming. Thankfully, the film is not used as a vehicle to promote singles or artists, allowing the score to do its job effectively without jarring the viewer.Pacing starts off quickly - you are brought into the action almost immediately without confusion. Many ""aha!"" moments keep the movie from becoming a snoozer. All the same, the length of the film (2.5 hours) is a factor, and the long running time might make the viewer feel a bit tired. If you experience something for long enough, you become fatigued and this film feels a bit languid towards the end. The climax of the film is almost understated and not substantially more dramatic than the events leading towards it.Finally, the production is excellent overall. The sets are designed well and do not overpower the acting. The locations were well chosen and provide an excellent environment for the heart of the story. Ron Howard develops the characters well as the movie progresses and brings out strong performances from most of his cast. There are also a few cheap scares and plot devices, but they are infrequent and forgivable.Having viewed this on both the big and small screens, I find the Da Vinci Code to be an entertaining evening. Where the film suffers tends to be in minor things: the length contributing to a somewhat slow feel at the finish, and some perfunctory character development where the leads are not concerned. A 7/10, the Da Vinci Code leaves you satisfied but not wanting more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely Beautiful,"Hi, I had heard some criticism of the movie and had low expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised that this was a great movie! I don't understand how some guys can criticise it. Okay, Hanks' hair is awful, but his performance is strong. Audrey Taotou is lovely as Sophie. The scenes from history are done exquisitely, especially the Council of Nicea. Ian Mckellen delivers another power-packed performance as Leigh Teabing, and Paul Bettany as Silas is simply outstanding. Jean Reno looks tailor-made for the role of Bezu Fache.

The DaVinci Code,"I read The DaVinci Code almost two years ago. I saw the movie on Saturday night at the drive-in. Tip number one: don't see it at the drive-in. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie. First let me say, I thought the casting was pretty damn good. Reading the book, I imagined Jean Reno as Bezu Fache, so I was pleased to hear he would be playing him. Also, while reading the book I imagined an older character for Aringarosa and I imagined a less feeble Teabing, for some reason. But personality-wise, Sir Ian McKellen and Alfred Molina were perfect. I also thought Audrey Tatou was a wise choice for Sophie. I couldn't think of any mainstream actress that could have played Sophie, but Tatou did wonderfully. Tom Hanks was good as Robert Langdon. I imagined a younger and more handsome Langdon, but nonetheless, Hanks did well. Not superb, as he has been in Forrest Gump and The Terminal. I even prefer the characters he plays in Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, but he did well. They stayed very true to the book. The only things lacking, and I know it's for time because the movie was long enough as it was, were that the book went a bit deeper. Also, while the movie was good, it didn't thrill me as the book did. Perhaps that is because I had read the book and they stayed so true to it I saw every step coming along the way.

oh man...,"i felt that this movie had so much potential. I read the book 2 years ago and disliked it immensely because there was no type of intellectual thought at all. The riddles were easy, the plot was contrived, and in all seriousness the characters are not developed. In general it was self important and laid everything out nice and tidy for all the people reading it to see which is why it was so popular... people thought that they were being smart but they were just buying into the horribly written book. In all honesty it had me fooled until about page 30 when i had an epiphany: This is Dan Brown trying to show us how smart he is, but he's not. The whole way through the book (which i had to read) i kept thinking that it was talking AT me and not letting me find my way to conclusions and events like a good novel would. However, there was great potential for a fun action movie that i thought would be quite enjoyable. and that is what this review is about: a movie.the movie, much like the book talks at the audience. it is all dialog and facts with no space or time between for interpretation or acting. I think Ron Howard is an Extreemly talented director and all the actors in it are very good as well, i just feel that the material could have been portrayed better rather than be a fictional history lecture. there was little enjoyment in a very interesting topic and people got very huffy because they are portrayed as facts rather than fiction... if you believe Dan brown i feel sorry for you.why i gave it a 3: it was not very entertaining and the character did not mesh well together, it gets 2 stars for the actors in it who did the best they could with what little they had and 1 star for not having it turn into a HORRIBLE romance in the end like the book...BRAVO Ron Howard.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie- people need to chill,"Many people have put a lot of effort into building this movie up or tearing it down based on the religious implications it contains. To these people I say, shame on you. This basis for judgment is simply ridiculous; no Hollywood blockbuster is, or should be, capable of tearing down any of the tenets of Christianity for anyone with even an ounce of faith in said religion. Those who are threatened by this film were clearly plagued by doubt and insecurity in their religion to begin with. Further, those who believe this film strikes some sort of winning blow to Christian ""lies and oppression"" comprise the most detestable class of arrogant, pseudo-intellectual Christian-bashers alive. THIS MOVIE AND THE BOOK UPON WHICH IT WAS BASED ARE FICTION AND ARE ADVERTISED AS SUCH. THEY ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. With that said, I am not a Christian and am not in any way educated in the art of film making. I judge movies based on entertainment value and philosophical content. With that out of the way, here is what I thought of the film: The Da Vinci Code is over two and a half hours and I am generally pretty antsy in long movies. I didn't find myself checking my watch once. This movie made me laugh, it made me jump, it made me cover my mouth in surprise, it made me sad, it made me excited, it intrigued me, it engaged me and it entertained me.

DaVinci is NOT Da Bomb --- it's just a wet firecracker.,"It has been said that when God created man, he put definite limits on his intelligence but no limits on his stupidity.Dan Brown with both his book and now this flaccid excuse for a movie has certainly proved that to be correct.He's got to be laughing his rear end off at all of us; all the way to the bank.Here's a guy who wrote a novel (if you can call that collection of mangled sentences a novel) that did little more than express his distorted personal views of a God he doesn't believe in and his distaste for people who do believe.Take Adolph Hitler's hatred of Jews in ""Mein Kampf,"" add a weak story line and call it a novel and you'll have what Dan Brown did with his hatred of Jesus Christ, the Bible, Christians in general and Catholics in particular in ""The DaVinci Code."" I'll give him credit for one thing though; he's a master of the BIG LIE.He seems to fully understand that the bigger and more outrageous a lie is, the easier it is to get people to fall for it. P. T. Barnum understood that and made a career out of telling big lies in a humorous way. It worked. The public was entertained and he got rich in the process.By comparison, Dan Brown's big lies are neither humorous nor entertaining, they're just lies; period.Regarding those who have the audacity to protest against Dan's lies, (like the people that were standing across the street from the movie theater holding signs) the DaVinci disciples are fond of saying ""Hey, get a grip. It's just FICTION!"" As if that makes it all OK. With that kind of thinking you can then tell any lie you want about anyone you want; call it fiction, and you can get away with it -- right?Try this one on for size. Someone writes a novel about your family; your mother, father etc. and all the people you love and respect. In the novel your family members and all your friends are called whores, liars, thieves, and murders. When you protest, you're told ""Get a grip!! It's just FICTION!"" I wonder if you would accept it as such; ya think?Yea, I know. The book was a mildly interesting murder mystery. If that had been translated to the screen, perhaps it could have been given at least two stars for entertainment value. Not so.This flick is so dull you'll need a six pack of ""Jolt"" just to stay awake. People in the audience actually snickered at some of the supposedly most serious and dramatic moments in the film.I really can't give it much of a review at all; it was just too over hyped, too long, too weak and too dull to even deserve commenting on.I can't grace this slug of a film with anything more than one star. I guess Ron and Tom needed the money. If you value yours, stay home and watch a rerun of ""Shoes of the Fisherman."" It inspires something a lot more productive than Dan's hokum does; that fer sure.What's next? Maybe Dan will follow this up with a novel about Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Yea, ""The Calcutta Code."" In it he'll give us the inside scoop on how Mother Theresa was actually a conspirator and together with today's descendants of DaVinci she was really planning to take over the world. All that business of helping the poor for over forty years was just a cover up.Like Dan, Ron and Tom will laugh all the way to the bank. Why? Because almost no one will pay any attention to the negative (but honest) reviews of this dog and they'll still cough up their bucks at the box office window.This overflowing hog trough will probably be nominated for six or seven academy awards.

Disappointing 'Da Vinci' lacked tension and wasn't thrilling ...,"I saw this film at the cinema today, and although I own the book, I have yet to finish reading it(I only got to chapter 2). So, watching the film like any other cinema-goer who has no previous background experience from the novel, I found it entertaining, but unlike I thought it lacked sufficient thrills.The main plot in which the curator of the Louvre museum is shot by Silas(an albino monk), is the opening scenes of the film. Before he dies, this curator leaves behind symbols and anagrams to pass on the ancient secret which ""could shake the foundations of Christanity"".Robert Langdon, a professor from Harvard, is brought to the murder scene, later joined by Sophie Neuveu, a cryptologist who helps him to discover what exactly the symbols and anagrams mean - which, as we discover, leads to the Holy Grail.The following chases that follow lack any kind of suspense that make me feel that the main characters are in immediate danger. It seems very ... formulaic in a way. We get some very good performances from Sir Ian McKellen(Sir Leigh Teabing) and Paul Bettany(Silas) but I do get the feeling that the other main leads were miscast - namely Hanks and Tautou. Don't get me wrong, they can act well, but they don't have ANY chemistry and Tautou's strong French accent is hard to understand at times.Even I, that I haven't even read the whole novel guessed the ending and fate of the characters before the credits rolled. I would say it was somehow thought-provoking, but more in a controversial way, like: should I believe this or not? In my opinion, as a Christian, I feel the whole quest for a 'Holy Grail' is rather far-fetched and is something more of a conspiracy theory, a fantasy rather than the actual truth that has been hidden from us by Catholics for 2,000 years. Let me add that I'm not rating this film on the whole 'Holy Grail' theory, but rating it on how it is shown on the screen, whether I support these claims or not - in other words, I'm rating this as a FILM not how 'believeable' the theory actually is.This book is merely a fictitious thought that has been blown way out of proportion. Whatever conclusion you come to, is up to you - I'm not forcing anyone to share my opinion. The fact is, though that as humans, we live by our beliefs and beliefs can be manipulated.Rather than the religious people protesting to ban this, I reckon it should be seen as more of a springboard for a discussion about religion - more of a way of debating about our beliefs(or lack of). Watch the documentary 'The Real Da Vinci Code' to get more of an idea of the theory presented in the novel this film is based on.However, that being said, there were certain moments in the film that made me jump in my seat, and was quite entertaining, just not up to the persistent hype for the film that I had hoped for, really.It's not a TERRIBLE film, but not a brilliant one either. I think that Langdon only exists to serve the plot of the film/book and doesn't really have any depth of character as such - kind of like a cardboard cut-out. This film had the potential to be better, but it was hindered by a bad script and not-so-great performances by the main leads, as aforementioned.It's a shame that this wasn't as outstanding as I had hoped, and was a bit disappointing. I'd give it a 6.5/10.",,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie however is horrible compared to the book, of course you can't expect it to be as good or better than the book, thats simply impossible.

Don't waste your money/time if you've read the book.,"And if you haven't read the book, do it instead of the movie. The movie builds suspense by hiding events and revealing them after the climactic event (when the book would have revealed more of these events in real time). This isn't true for the entire movie, but I did notice how the movie compresses a lot of the story. This was a highly anticipated movie, and I left the theater a bit disappointed. To the directors credit, I would say that a lot of the scenes appeared on the screen disturbingly similar to the way I perceived them while reading the book. The movie was entertaining, but I would be interested to know how someone perceives the book after having watched the movie first.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Yarn - If you haven't read the Book,"Your view of this will be spoiled if you have read the book. It's a two part story with the first being a murder mystery, and the sub-plot the influence of the Opus Dei. If you have read the book you know what happens in relation to the main plot, and the sub-plot is better to be handled in print. Fortunately, I had not read the book. Marveously filmed, it has outstanding performances from Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany. Tom Hanks is not well cast as the lead who is a professor and Hanks does not come off as professorial. Yet, I was surprised at the action, and enjoyed most every minute. The sumptuous photography is well appreciated and the various twists and turns very interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Read the book, but still enjoyed the movie","I was surprised that I actually enjoyed watching the movie. I do like Tom Hanks (for the most part), so I did want to like the movie. It was almost exactly like the book, and it was almost everything I envisioned as I was reading. The one problem was, I felt that if you did not know the history of Opus Dei then you would have a hard time understanding Silas' plight, as well as the Capt. and the Bishop. If there was a way to explain the passion Opus Dei had for keeping the secrets of the church better (w/o adding more time to the movie, it would be a benefit to the movie.

Lacks chemistry and drive but Ian McKellen is the saving grace!,"So I need to preface this review with the warning that I had not read the book before I saw the film. My dad is a big fan of Ron Howard and we have been getting through a lot of his films and he has read the book so he was looking forward to watching it. I found the first hour a bit of a slog to get into. The chemistry between Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou wasn't cutting it for me and I was just kind of confused at what was going on! Then Ian Mckellen's character arrived and massively lifted the film up and that's where I feel the story was really explained and he was very charismatic and i liked the theory that was expressed about 'The Davinci Code'. Without giving anything away, the last 30 minutes both felt rushed and dull at the same time so it was strange!

Da Vinci Code a Deliberate Work of Fiction,"Firstly, I would like to say that I am looking very forward to the release of this film. I have read the book and anticipate it making a wonderful movie. That, however, is not why I write.To the readers of this comment, I would like to say that I am a devout Christian. Bear this in mind when I say that I have no problem whatsoever with this book and/or movie. I view it, as absolutely everyone should, as a work of pure fiction. It is a novel, created from the thoughts of a man whom many people now hate. Many people, including the previous commentator (whom I offer my respectful apologies for this comment), have learned to despise the filmmakers and the author because they feel their faith is threatened. I feel that people can have faith and still be able to realize that the book is not factual. That said, anybody whose faith has been tested by this book should, indeed, not have read it, for they have missed the point of the story entirely: to entertain.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A poor scholar still, I've read almost every argument about this book and movie.There is plenty of facts, fiction and error in all of this--not just the book or movie over 1,000s and 1,000s of years (prior to Jesus as well).I don't believe it is, about fact for the last few 100 years, but 10s of 1,000s of true believers from every religious camp has spilt blood for centuries to make many of the point in this movie.That's a fact.The Da Vinci Code tells much of how Christianity and the Bible came to be but doesn't dispel that it's only another belief system rife with corruption and lies, as all man-made systems are.The movie itself is a hell of a fiction ride!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A wonderful quest for truth and knowledge.,"As I read the book , i began to think about how the movie it would be like and I am far from disappointed : the director has managed to catch the true essence of a book that questions the verity of the pillars of our existence.Juat as I imagined , ""The Da Vinci Code"" honors the book itself by an impeccable performance on behalf of all the actors , on behalf of the magnificent locations , on behalf of the intriguing atmosphere and feeling.It is truly a great movie , a great story , a great alternative to the everything we think we know.Fiction or not , it is up to each of us to decide...""The only thing that matters is what you believe.""

Novel is far better than the movie,"Yesterday I finally saw a chance to go and watch the most discussed movie of this moment: The Da Vinci Code. After reading the book twice, hearing the great cast that would represent the main characters, and seeing the overwhelming trailers, I was so curious and full of expectations that nothing could spoil the screen version of this great book.In a fully packed cinema I was able to conquer a nice seat somewhere in the middle of the hall. After watching dozens of commercials and trailers, the movie finally started. After the movie I left the cinema kind of unsatisfied. I think Audrey Tautou, Tom Hanks, Paul Bettany and Ian McKellan did a nice job playing the roles of Sophie, Robert Silas and Sir Leigh Teabing. They were just as I imagined them, reading the book. But what I really missed in the film was the excitement build up during some passages, greatly described in the book, but kind of neglected in the movie. For example, the excitement build up during the transportation of the cryptex, and discovering the cryptex hidden in the Bank of Zurich. In the movie, these things pass by in such a speed that there's is no time to build up any excitement. Also solving all the riddles left by Sauniere were solved so fast, that it's far from realistic. I also missed the emotional parts of Sophie and the relationship between her and her grandfather, especially when she was young.The things I loved the most in the book were the little details most people never thought of: phi and its role in nature and the connection of Disney and his hidden messages about religion. They did not show up in the movie. But I know that when all these things would have been present in the movie, it will have a playing time of over 4 hours. For the people who want to go see the movie but did not read the book, I suggest them first to read the book, because I think they will have a great deal following the story. It's kind of hard to understand because of all the facts about ancient groups that pop up and pass by in a high speed.Overall I think the book is far better than the movie, especially when you have great expectations. I think Ron Howard did not succeed in giving the movie the charms the book has got.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The da vinci code,"This film was really good, i had read the book over a year ago and then went to see the film, all the characters portrayed in the book were acted out brilliantly by the actors and the film was brilliant! definitely going to see it again...when i first heard Tom Hanks was to be Robert Langdon i couldn't see it working but he was very convincing, even if you don't like art and don't believe in religion this film is still really good to see. There is something for everyone thrills, crime and love, I have read Dan Browns other 3 books and hope that they are making them all into films as well especially angels and demons!

Review of the movie...not the subject,"And now for something completely newa review about the movie instead of the conflict it created.First off, I did read the book. I found the casting a bit questionable but as is generally the case, minutia gets lost the further in your memory it is. I read the book quite some time ago, so the glaring mistakes were missed to some degree.I watched the movie with my wife and she had never read the book. It was enjoyable for both of us.The good: The topic in and of itself keeps you thinking throughout, if not on the actual action in the movie, on your own religious musings. The casting was pretty darn good actually. Sadly all the supporting characters were overshadowed by the one mistake Howard made in putting Hanks in the lead. It was just too difficult to get past for anyone who had a preconceived notion of who Langdon should have been (Ralph Fiennes or Hugh Laurie for me) The pace of the movie was good, and I did not feel that it dragged at all.The bad: There were too many times you could poke a hole in the material. Again, this is not a critique of the content but a comment based on your ability to find holes independently of the subject matter. I also didn't feel the final few scenes tied things together very well. There was too much intellectual blather and you didn't feel a major emotional attachment between Sophie and her grandmother. That needed to be developed or you still felt ""can she trust these people?"" at the end of the movie.I think the twists and turns were faithfully reproduced, but it did not wrap up nicely. For perfect wrap up see ""The Usual Suspects"". I wanted something along those lineswhere after the finale I was glad to see how it came together, somewhat surprised and very happy for the come-uppance of the antagonists.All in all I think this was a good depiction of the book, given the limited time you have to do so. I look forward to Angels and Demons more as I think the story is tighter, at least until the finale, which I imagine, will be laughable at the theater.If you liked the book, go see the movie. If you did not read the book, but it intrigues you, go see the movie. If you are consumed with the conflicts in subject matter and the inconsistencies with the details in art, placement and historical facteither don't go, or keep it to yourself. I wish to watch in blissful ignorance thanks",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When A Heresy Meets Hollywood,"Well, a heresy is a heresy, after all. For hundreds of years, the ideas and concepts have been molested, falsified, distorted, changed all over and got rid of. And we live in the age of post modernism, when as it seems everything is relative and therefore any stupidity immediately catches the general attention and does become a real fad. Dan Brown with his impossibly poor book, The Da Vinci Code, did exactly that. He wrote an unimaginable mishmash of pseudo-scientific, quasi-religious, sub par ideas that he suffered greatly to collide ands then juxtapose together. See, man, the Theory of Conspiracy has nothing new beside it. We have heard that all before many times. And then, see we all know that this is a lie, outright. Let us be somehow fair to Hollywood. They did their best trying to reproduce that mixture of sheer lies, idiocy, anti-Christian paranoia and anti-Catholic stance onto the silver screen. They did. But again, they failed on several levels. First and foremost, Tom Hanks as Prof. Robert Langdon is weak, bleak, slow and very pale. He used to save a whole lousy film before, but not now. Here, Tom is certainly not the main star; he simply goes with the general anemic flow and lets it happen. Sir Ian McKellen also does not shine. He is what he is  an old man. Add a beard and a cloak, and voilà, you have the same old Gandalf again! Jean Reno plays without his usual gusto and his role is at its best schematic. Maybe, only Jurgen Prochnow saves the day with his impeccable little part, but all is swept away with Audrie Tatou's impossibly weak performance. She goggles her eyes, she utters incredibly silly maxims, and she overplays and exaggerates it all to the level of amateurism. With that all in mind, no wonder that the 2-hours' long torture never gets a desirable cohesion. The film starts very well, as a real thriller, then gets to the point of some detective story, then almost falls down to some comedy and ends up as a second  rate melodrama. I almost wanted to laugh and change the DVD for some lightweight show on TV. What a pity many had to suffer that in the cinemas! Dan Brown, with his main ally, ultra-liberal Hollywood mongers, has made a new fierce attack on Christian beliefs and values. The inedible beefsteak of utterly hilarious ideas never gets to the throat. A mere enumeration of what he tried to depict will leave any seriously thinking individual in total shock. Jesus being married and having a daughter with Mary Magdalene, herself being a kind of pagan female goddess with some sacral sexual meaning, the Temple knights fighting to save the secret, the very idea of Jesus being a mortal man only  these are all old, old fairy tales. They are old, venomous, but not as harmful as some angry believers could get it. We saw that all before, didn't we? Time will show how many new Dan Browns will appear with their abominable books and films full of gods and demons, false ideas and wrong suppositions. And Hollywood will always keep that fire burning, making shallow screening versions, with poor plot and bad play. I pity Hanks, Reno, and Tatou, all others who wasted their talents on that low-key, tasteless treatise. Time will show. People will gladly forget this ditty, never having become a real song. A heresy is a heresy. It was, is and will always be.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Da Vinci Code Review,"Upon seeing the Da Vinci Code, I entered having read and enjoyed Dan Brown's successful novel. Whilst I knew the story line of the film, I was still expecting a good film to entertain me nevertheless. After watching the film I do not think it was as good as I expected. I think if you had not read the book it may have been more gripping, but for me I was never gripped as I was when reading the book.I think the film on its own was still a good film that had good individual acting performances, in particular Paul Battany who played the character Silas. The two main chatracters played by Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou were also individually good however they lacked the chemistry together to make the audience get sucked into their characters' lives. I also think the film should have been made as it represents what all good films should be made for: making an audience think and leave the cinema pondering thoughts posed by the film. I think this film does this and on that front is thus successful, I left the cinema thinking and disscussing more the ideas put forward in the play.On the whole I think the film was good but I expected it to be a little better.

The characters, with the exception of the ""Teacher"" are not very well hashed out in the movie. Ron Howard, who usually does a good job< really doesn't let the characters grow on you before they are running for their lives. Doesn't really set up much of a connection.

Over hyped book leads to over hyped film,"Let me start by saying this... I have not read the book. This review is on the merits of this work as a film alone. Now that we have gotten that business over with, let us begin.This is a mediocre film at best that has been over hyped by the media in an effort to sell news papers and get you to watch the 11:00 evening news. I am a fan of both Howard and Hanks and the work they have done together so far has been exemplary. If you enter the theater looking for an excuse to dislike the film, you will find plenty of reasons. If you enter looking for a reason to praise the film, there are a few. Let's break it down...Story: Suspension of disbelief is required in abundant amounts for this predictable story full of convenient coincidences, character arcs, and repetitive dialog and imagery intended to drive the point into you over and over until you feel as if you're being hit in the head with a hammer. While I can not speak to the content of the original book, I can not assume that all these obvious flaws are limited to the film alone.Directing and Cinematography: On the technical elements of the film, it is a decent body of work. The lighting, camera position, movement of the actors through each scene; they are all executed well by capable hands. Each scene evokes the expected emotion giving you the excitement of a treasure hunt, the thrill of a chase, and the intrigue of a mystery. Well done Mr. Howard.Acting: It is hard to find flaw with Tom Hank's work but in this film he comes across as a little too charismatic for the bookworm he is supposed to portray. Audrey Tautou does a fine job given the script she was handed but most of the flaws there have to do with her character not with her as an actor.Supporting Characters: This is where the film falls apart. The supporting characters are often two dimensional and stray from their spine. What I mean to say is each character as they are introduced is given a spine that defines them. The spine tells you who they are and what their motivation is. When the character does something, you can read from their spine WHY they would do such a thing. In this film the supporting characters often deviate from their spine simply to drive the plot. Without revealing any spoilers, as you watch the film, look specifically at the characters of Captain Fache and André Vernet.Finally the Media: The media has hyped the book and the film to the point of idolization just so they can knock it off its virtual pedestal in order to drive sales and to get you to watch the late night news. These reports about protesters and boycotts and other such antics are just a means for them to capitalize on the hype they have created. Oh, and by the way, it takes a special brand of idiot to think ANY of this fictional work is real.So in conclusion, as a film I give this a 6 out of 10 vote. If you are looking for some entertainment and don't care much for some annoying plot holes or character flaws, by all means see this film. If you are a connoisseur of fine film and you are looking for a thought provoking story of good, evil, love, and redemption; I must recommend you rent Road to Perdition instead. It is by far the best work Tom Hanks has ever done.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Is good but.,"The movie is goodie, but I think its just a medium value. My Mom love it and told me, if I can go with her to see the movie again. I saw it once and well, if they (the producers, writers and directors) want to tell all the people about how bad is the elite power of church, they don't have to include things from Jesus Christ. Is like they want to make a bad testimony with science fiction and magic. I think it doesn't matter if Jesus loved a woman,because one man that recognized the power of women since then, was him, but from that, than to say he and Mary Magdalene, had children together, was not a good thing for the believers, because it could offended many people. The whole story need to be more polished, more deep in its meanings, to indicate precisely what they want to criticized. If they want to tell bad things about Opus Dei, they have to be more clear in their assumptions, and leave Jesus Christ's philosophy alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A literal adaptation of a tedious book,"With a Dan Brown novel you can put it down before going to sleep - and maybe that's its greatest attribute. It won't engage your mind enough to cause a disturbed night but it won't annoy you quite enough to feel you're wasting your life. Then comes the movie. A faithful adaptation of the novel - faithful in a Harry Potter way; it's all in there whether it's good or not - but with such a clunking script it defies description. E.g. Tom Hanks: ""I need to get to a library. FAST."" Bad enough, but they go by double decker bus! The cast make valiant efforts to lift the thing but without success. Plot point are verbally highlighted lest we should miss them in a kind of Roadrunner/TV Batman kind of way.

Sir Ian stole the show with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou as bystanders (as it was in the book) as Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany produced acting displays worthy of any Shakespearean ensemble. Hats of to the whole cast though, their parts were magnificently transferred from the book to the big screen effortlessly and I hope I'm not being presumptuous, but I believe the cast had studied the book closely before preparing their parts.Well done !

Authentication and therefore perpetuation of mumbo jumbo,"Interested in the hype surrounding this for a long time I finally got to see the film tonight, it happening to be buried somewhere amongst UK Channel 5's usual shedload of brain numbing adverts.

During the chases you can lose track of who is good, bad or both apart from the earnest and always dependable Tom Hanks. And by the end I had denouement fatigue, so many pre or misconceptions were reversed or blown away that it almost became a comedy for me. I think they found the HG by the end, although another last minute ""discovery"" by Hanks overshadowed even that. I thought the ending of Pygmalion was the most contrived I'd ever seen until this - all that was revealed to me was nearly 3 hours had gone and that my TV was still on the same side.There's usually at least two things I take away from films with religious messages: 1/ just how destructive fanatics of all kinds (whether believers unbelievers or neithers) can be; 2/ just how works of fiction such as this can end up authenticating the subject by serious treatment and therefore invigorating the superstition they are fictionalising. Also I suppose it's incredibly sad that so many intelligent people of all persuasions got so swallowed up with this nonsense they partially jettisoned common sense - whereas all religious or anti-religious fanatics jettison all common sense. My Catholic father in law would never watch this on principle! Well, he didn't miss anything conceptually vital here except maybe a good laugh.It's fascinating and extra-thought-provoking hokum! A well made slick time-passer cleverly mixing fact fiction and fantasy and God willing something I'll watch again - but apart from fanatics does anyone really know or care where the key to the code to the key to properly appreciating it is to be found?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overwhelmingly Stupid,"I'm not sure why I even went to see this movie; I hated Dan Brown's book and find Tom Hanks about as appealing as dental surgery. More to the point, I'm not religious and couldn't care less if Jesus got hitched or not. I just figured that my expectations were already so low that I might enjoy the film. After all, despite its general idiocy, I still managed to finish that damn book.The Da Vinci Code is not a poorly made film. I think the actors (with one exception) are fine and the adaptation is faithful to the novel. The problem is more that the concept of solving riddles is not cinematic, thus making the large, gaping holes in the plot so much more apparent. The film's slow pacing and unimaginative use of locations just makes things worse. I managed to take the film seriously until Robert and Sophie left France. After that the stupidity of it all became too much to bear.Some critics have singled Tom Hanks out as the bad apple in the cast. Personally, I found him far less annoying than usual. His performance is relatively restrained and his general cluelessness seems appropriate for the dumbest hero in movie history. Audrey Tautou is endearing as Sophie. Audrey is too good an actress for trash like this. I just hope she was paid a lot of money because this will probably kill her international career, at least for the next few years. The supporting cast is composed of several great character actors. Ian McKellen, Hollywood's current favourite ""hire-a-thespian"", is enthusiastic as Leigh, while Alfred Molina continues to carve a niche for himself as a bad guy specialist. Jean Reno, not surprisingly, shines as Fache. However, he also made ""Empire Of The Wolves"" watchable, so the man is obviously capable of anything. I was also pleased to see Juergen Prochnow score a role in another big budget film.The exception to the generally impressive performances belongs to Paul Bettany. It doesn't help that his character is a walking sight gag but there was no need to camp it up even further with crazy eyes and demented stares. The scenes of him running around London are unintentionally hilarious, with the Michael Jackson make-up and bad contact lenses, he looks more like a crazed fan on their way to a Star Wars convention than an Opus Dei monk.The Da Vinci Code is not a total waste of time. For example, I congratulate the joker in the make-up department who gave Tom Hanks Pat Benatar's hairstyle. However, Tom's amusing mullet is not enough to sustain 120 minutes of this crap. Fans of the book may enjoy the film but I think that even they will be put off by the plodding action and cheap flashbacks. It saddens me to think that religious groups have taken this tripe seriously enough to bother protesting it. They really should have more important things to do.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A simple mystery thriller,"The Da vinci code is a mystery thriller casting lead Tom hanks. A quite intresting genre and rewritting history with some imagination and stuffs, bringing in christianity and the preachings into the story, which motivated me to check the life of jesus in another movie. The story is simple and the screenplay is ok, because some of the dialects and words are really new so its hard to understand at first place, but found out to be easier as it progress. The mystery has been easily judged. The theme is really dark and the screenplay could have been better but not bad. Tom hanks as usuals nailed with his performances.

Excellent movie,"A movie can never compete with the original novel. It is truly unfair to the movie to compile them. Neither can the DaVinci Code. But seeing the movie was rediscovering the book.I loved it! I love to have the characters I have put together in my head being either confirmed or dismissed. Sir Theabing wasn't half as fat in the movie as he was in my head :) But Silas was exactly as I had pictured him.I love the plot of the DaVinci code.And once again Hans Zimmer's music is just the perfect topping.

Mona Lisa smiles because.,"THE DA VINCI CODE Mona Lisa smiles because.She knows that the Holy Grail is still missing and Jesus is still a bachelor. Even though Don Brown and Ron Howard have tried very hard to bring to their own conclusion both mysteries.Although most of the French press at the Cannes Film Festival laugh at Don Brown theory of Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene and have a progeny still living today. Also the Vatican threw a warning to all Catholics, that Jesus was not 'a married man of divine inspiration'. Of course all that controversy suited the movie into bankable publicity.In my book, the movie is a prime rate political and historical thriller. The acting performances throughout the film are the best seen in this decade. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is equal to his talent and credibility Audrey Tautou (Sophie Neveu) is perhaps the talent revelation of this movie with Paul Bettany, as Silas an albinos monk who wears a bloody silica on top of flogging himself to expire his sins. Only Ian Mc Lelland ( Sir Leigh Teabing ) doesn't seem to belong to this story.Ron Howard is a skilled movie maker. He knew how to weave this very complicated story concocted by Don Brow, a prolific writer who sold over 60 millions of his book THE DA VINCI CODE which became the most sold novel in the world at all time.The locations are breathtaking and rarely have we never seen such of powerful locations on the silver screen. The photography and the editing are Oscar material.I haven't read the book and I found easy to follow the complicated and fast story line. But if you pay attention and get involved in Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdom chase you grab the spiritual force behind this great picture. I give it a ten out of ten and I wish Ron Howard and his crew the best of luck at the Oscar night, next spring.Mona Lisa will keep smiling knowing that was all fiction just like the Priory of Sion secret organization that Leonardo Da Vinci would have been a member. Despite bad and controversial publicity Brian Grazer (producer) will be laughing all the way to the bank.Roger Cardinal Boucherville Canada",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Code with its own Cross to bear.,"The Da Vinci Code: The, so far, highest anticipated blockbuster of the year for 2006, or the most, again so far, media hyped movie of the year. Whatever the viewpoint, for what ever reason, The Da Vinci Code turned out to be a nice little thriller, little here being the operative word, regrettably too. A thriller it is, with its beautiful English locations, such as the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, Lincoln Cathedral, which was substituted for Westminster Abbey, London and Burghley House, again in Lincolnshire, England. The European destinations speak volumes here, such as the filming inside the Musée Du Louvre and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, France. These locations give the movie a taste of flamboyance and style. They are used very well, to inject a world of high-octane adventure that only the gifted and elite can acquire.The cast here are of a pedigree to hold audiences captivated in their own right, with the skills of Messrs Hanks, McKellen and Reno and the French actress Audrey Tautou, who apparently, took the job after the original choice were for Julie Delpy and Kate Beckinsale. In addition, the role that was, eventually, given to Tom Hanks was considered for Bill Paxton, amongst others. This collaboration come together very well, in their own refined and subtle way, they are given a fictitious project to be apart off, they are in a plot of huge consequence and intrigue, the magnitude of the overall conspiracy theory is some what, sadly, eroded and in parts, deflated.The historical story telling, by using a sense of flashback and a over lapping of the past with the present is interesting, this form of movie making is a procedure that does The Da Vinci Code justice and actually does project the story line to the next phase, giving the movie a true sense of Historical wonder and dread.Apart from the high level locations and cast, we have a movie that is somewhat over drawn in the writing department, in the interpretation of Dan Browns book, who also acts as Executive Producer on this project too. Has Mr. Akiva Goldsman found this a tad too taxing? This question begs being asked, in the contest of a huge Production, why has The Da Vinci Code gone from being a Thriller Movie to a thrilling movie that does not thrill hardly enough? The script, I feel, has driven The Da Vinci Code's pace, in places, from high-octane to moderate B-Movie status. This is a shame, for who ever was in charge of this department should, again I feel, have looked more closely at reading between the lines, and given it more attention, this, regrettably, could be the weakest link in this movies chain. Alternatively, and fairly, has he merely adapted his skills to the environment that he has been placed in?Mr. Goldman's other works for writing and screenplay consist of The Client 1994, Silent Fall 1994, Batman Forever 1995, A Time To Kill 1996, Batman & Robin 1997, Lost In Space 1998, also for I, Robert 2004 and the 2005 movie Cinderella Man. He has been nominated for many Awards in his career; he won has the 2002 Academy Award for Best Writing for A Beautiful Mind 2001.The musical score is also worth a mention, with the work of Mr. Hans Zimmer, who during the early eighties was in the band The Buggles, their hit ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" became their best seller. He has worked on many, many classics such as My Beautiful Laundrette 1985, The Last Emperor 1987, Rain Man 1988, Thelma and Louise 1991. His vast workload was to include The Lion King 1994, The Rock 1996, Mission Impossible II and Gladiator in 2000. He worked on Black Hawk Down in 2001 and the list is endless. His work on The Da Vinci Code is a fine classical score that highlights the high quality message of this movie, with a combination of drama and suspense that kicks starts each moment into daring adventure.To conclude: The Da Vinci Code is a good movie, it is a reasonably good thriller, with very stylish locations, cast and modest Director, but it, not at all points, tends to, for me, fall on the flat side, because of the high importance of the overall story line, the delivery of the script has fallen short. This is the Cross that The Da Vinci Code now has to bear. Shame really.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An adaption that ultimately missed the mark,"I'll start by saying I did read the book and was a big fan. So, I was excited to watch the film. I think a good movie adaption does two things: it knows where to borrow from the book, and it knows where to change things up. This movie failed in both respects.It should've stuck with the characters and the romance as written. Unfortunately, it did a terrible job with casting. Namely, with Tom Hanks. He's much older than Langdon (the character) and just doesn't fit in this role. He's like 20 years older than Tatou, who plays his love interest (Sophie), so the romance doesn't work at all. Sophie is also nothing like she's described in the book, and she's not practically dressed at all (they threw her into a skirt and heels for the movie, instead of the pants and combat boots she wore in the book).Now, for the plot itself: it should NOT have stuck so closely to the book. What works well for novels doesn't always translate well to the screen. Reading about the theories and these characters going on a code-filled quest was fun, but watching that got a bit boring. The movie needed some more action, and should have been a bit more liberal in its interpretation of the book's events.Overall, it's not a bad watch, and if you've read the book it's worth checking out. But if you haven't read it, it might not be all that interesting. It's sort of a book in movie form, as opposed to a movie version of a book, if that makes sense.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More than met my expectations,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie after reading most of the reviews in the paper. A huge review gave it ** and not much else was any better.

I am able to discern for myself that this is FICTION and why do people always think we cannot handle deciding the truth on our own? People who cannot figure out that this is novel of fiction would most likely not even be interested in it.That said, if you haven't read the book, you are in for a great ride.

"when Cannes slams a movie, it's always better than you expect","if you go into this movie not expecting much, and preferably with a friend who also likes to take the mickey out of things, you'll have an enjoyable time. mind you we were adamant that our contribution to the box office should be via discount Tuesdays - we figured it was worth 3.50 pounds and not a penny more.yes, i have sheepishly enjoyed the book. a friend gave me a copy for Christmas one year (complete with treasure hunt to find it) - despite my refusal to sink into pop trash. and i couldn't put it down.so when i heard that they were making a movie with a star studded cast, i was looking forward to it. then came the premier, and the reviews. so i wasn't expecting much.the script is pretty awful. there are many cringe worthy moments, and like many other reviewers my friend and i snickered and giggled at very inappropriate moments. i didn't find any of Silas' flagellation's chilling (and i'm a squeamish person), and the archbishop reminded me of Ira from 'mad about you'. hanks' expression made me think of a less subtle bill Murray, but frankly he did a good job. i'm a tatou fan and i expected more sparkle from her. agree that Ian mck was tops - there's something very warm about his eyes, which lends his character even more depth.the movie is quite true to the book (and you have to give Howard/the screenwriter credit for not romanticising the ending) and i guess they did that at the expense of creating suspense. the cinematography is nothing to write home about - but when you have Paris as a backdrop maybe you don't need to work as hard.it you expect cheese, you'll be satisfied. if you're a die-hard fan of the book, or there for the box office pull of the actors, you may just walk out.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not as bad as some people are saying...but not fantastic either.,"I was wary of seeing this movie after all the bad press it received after Cannes, but honestly, it was not a bad way to spend an afternoon. The cinematography is nice, the music is cool, and the acting is solid, with the exception of Hanks and Tautou (more on that later). In particular, Paul Bettany and the inimitable Ian McKellen were enjoyable to watch. The only problem for me was that Hanks seemed awkward in the role of Robert Langdon. Not because he is Hanks, but because of delivery and persona problems that weren't quite filled out. I realize that Langdon is not supposed to be debonair and dashing, but even the less socially adept part of Langdon does not come across cleanly. Tautou is better, but the performance lacks solidarity and is plagued with the same odd dialogue problems and awkward moments as is Hanks (the dialogue problems obviously not being their fault). Their moments alone in the don't quite flow as they should. As a whole, the movie flows better, but still doesn't feel completely solid, maybe because they were still editing it two weeks ago (or so I've heard). That said, I would prefer to give this movie a 6.5 instead of a 7. As compared to the book, the book was better for me, but might not have been had I seen the movie first and known as I was reading how the book was going to end. The film is pretty darn faithful, with the addition of only a couple of small cinematic touches. Final note: It's worth the gas and ticket price if you're looking for a way to pass 2.5 hours on a slow day.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Overall, it was entertaining....","i thought that the film was an accurate adaptation of the book, but it seemed a bit slow in places whereas the novel was extremely fast-paced. part of what kept me interested was Ian McKellen's amazing performance as Sir Leigh Teabing. of the many movies he has acted in, i found this to be one of his best. the opposite could be said about Tom Hanks. although it was not a challenging role to begin with, he made the character of Langdon seem like a bland, expressionless figurehead. part of the reason i found the movie boring at many points is because Hanks did nothing to evoke a response with the viewers. Overall, the film was just an interesting action/adventure thriller. Ian McKellen salvaged what would have been a mediocre movie, and seemed to make the muddled plot and random twists make sense in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
True to the Book,"Follows the plot line of the book fairly close, and is generally a good ""who dunnit"". You will never guess who the murderer is--at least I didn't. The last portion of the film dealing with the St. Clair Chapel is where the movie gets a bit improbable. The underlying religious premise is questionable, but one does not need to believe it to find this movie worthwhile. The R.C.C. and Opus Dei don't come off too well in this movie--but I think they earned the portrayal they received--vicious, manipulative, stop-at-nothing types. Again, you don't have to accept this view of these organizations to find this movie worth the watch--you can merely accept them as the designated villains and that only some of the members of these organizations are vicious corrupt characters. In short, this movie can be watched at multiple levels, depending upon your own beliefs/biases.There are some jarring scenes, including Silas' self-mortification and some of the murders--but what's a good ""who dunnit"" without some good murders? The violence and suggestions of violence are appropriate to the story. The shooting locations were excellent, the plot twists every bit as good as the book. Not sure why some critics panned it. I would say go watch the movie, form your own opinions and don't let any priest tell you what you should/should not watch. I would see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent movie,"The reason many people do not like the movie is because it discusses history and requires thought, but it is quite a magnificent movie. At first I was unsure if Tom Hanks was going to be able to pull of the character of Robert Langdon but in my opinion he did. I do admit that you do need to read the book in order to fully grasp the concept of the movie. I understand that they needed to condense the movie in order to keep it from being too long. I think they did the movie perfectly. The movie was very well done and the acting was superb. My suggestion to anyone watching the movie is to read a spark notes version of the book, it would help you keep track throughout the movie.To all the people that say it was boring I beg to differ. It was an interesting story and the concept that are brought up are quite remarkable. I was interested during the whole movie and so was my friend that never even read the book. My friend loved the movie. Just pay close attention to details and you will understand and catch on with the movie perfectly.The concept that I love about the movie is how everything is not right in front of you like ordinary movies, the movie makes you think things that you would have never pondered, it leaves the mind open to imagination.Ignore all these reviews, if you have a bit of class and a mental capacity higher than the average teenager I promise you will love this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"treat it as a ""film"" and still find it a strong sleeping pill","I have to say i have quite high an anticipation when i walked in the cinema, and obviously i was not alone to have high emotions tonight: the whole cinema was packed and my friend and i had to move to the front rows. my neck is still sore.Anyone who had read the book may find the film version terrible as all the twists are known beforehand. But let's be fair and treat it as it is--a ""film"", there are still a whole lots of things making me bored and yawn. The film's flow is slow and all the twists and suspense you expect from the book are clearly overshadowed by the slow pace and clunky conversations. Ron Howard, as expected, tries his best to shoot this film in a linear way, in the sense that it squarely follows the chapters in the book, and that, makes me bored and yawn. Not did i want it to deviate from the story but if the purpose is to keep the audience' adrenalin going, Ron Howard just did the opposite.The cinematography and the background sound effect doesn't really add up and help this movie a successful thriller. I don't agree that the movie is ""dark"" or ""nocturnal"" as according to the book, the incident happens in the middle of the night and only when the setting moves to London can one see the daytime activities. It is supposed to be 'nocturnal"".In a nutshell, the fatal flaw is it lacks the elements what a thriller should have: the tantalizing puzzles that make the audience baffled and desperate to know what will happen next; the looming sense of insecurity that keep the characters make the whole matters make-or-break. But for this one, you would probably just sit there and like ""so?""Still some good points: The visualisation of the plot, the architecture and the paintings are very much captivating. Ian Mckellen is just remarkable and fitting (though a bit of over exposure recently given his new work: X-Men3 is out soon); Paul Bettany's Silas wins my sympathy; Jean Reno, as some viewers said, was made for the role of Bazu Fache. Who could've done better? Audrey Tautou is convincing as Sophie Neveu. Finally, Tom Hanks, ha, guess we all need to give ourselves some time to get used to his hairstyle.P.S. (no pun intended for the Priory of Sion or Princess Sophie) the emotions were equally high outside the cinema as some serious Catholics and priests gathered along the street to denounce the screening of this movie.

Such a wonderful movie,"One must remember to suspend your disbelief when watching movies. I haven't read the book and I was totally sucked in by the wonderful story telling of Dan Brown and the movie making of Ron Howard. Even if the subject is somewhat controversial.

Much as the bible is also a story and is based broadly on historical fact.At issue is the theory that Jesus may have been married and had offspring.

Lag Eat Storm,"Interesting position I find myself in trying to honestly review this movie, really enjoyed it, but came away empty, looking to be fulfilled so much more.Thought the casting was fine, cept, for the life of me,I have a hard time with Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Viggo, Hugh, Russell, even Paul Bettany, (as brilliantly as he portrayed Silas), I would have envisioned more impactive as Langdon, than Hanks.Major problem was the constant breaks in the action to revert to flashbacks for the sake of historical significance. Really the only way to accomplish this on film, but it did have a tendency to slow down, and murk up the feeling of suspense. Also, the chemistry was a stretch between Hanks and Tautou. Still, all of the pieces still fit all together, making an enjoyable movie viewing experience, whether you have read the book or not.Thought the soundtrack was haunting and beautiful, and Howard's cinematic eye was right on target as far as the filming was concerned.Never really a fair comparison, book to movie, but I expected sooo much more.

Visually Stunning Moments,"This film has some visually stunning moments with shadows from the past overlaid on the present, a good score, and a strong supporting cast. But that's about it.There is a major weakness in the story: the main characters are not in control of the action, the characters are driven by the plot. The main characters are victims of circumstance rather than taking control of their own destinies. This leaves us with weak central characters lacking the depth that would draw an audience to identify or sympathize with them. Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu is reduced to a talking doll. Not for one moment is she believable as a police officer.Tom Hanks is equally unconvincing as an action hero on a mission to find an earth-shattering secret. He is given claustrophobia in an attempt to add some dimension to his character, but it is an unnecessary embellishment. If it was meant to give him some vulnerability it is canceled out by the fact that he is completely unfazed after being attacked, shot at, threatened, held prisoner at gun-point and facing several harrowing near-death experiences. When he finally reveals the answer to the puzzle that is the fulfillment of both his personal quest and professional career, there is no excitement, no thrill, no professional or personal satisfaction. The secret of the ages is reduced to an anti-climax.The resulting film is a long, violent chase through exciting locations. The main carrier of the plot is not, as one would expect, the solving of the mystery, but the violence. The story itself is so weak that they try to spice it up with extra violence, adding scenes of Templars being stabbed and burned to death.The weaknesses of the film over-balance the strengths leaving us with a forgettable below-average film  and it is not the fault of the actors or the filmmakers, but of the basic story all the technical brilliance is hung on.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
this is a good movie,"By now, your head will probably be scrambled with the mixture of reviews this movie has gotten. It suffers from hype and that is the only element detracting from it. When a movie generates as much publicity as this one has, too many critics can't wait to slate it. Interestingly, the negative reviews concentrate on childish things like Tom Hanks's hair. Which leads me to believe that if you are looking for faults, they can always be found. Ignore the reviews (even this one)though and just go and see this stylish thriller. The plot sticks quite closely to Dan Brown's novel and holds the audience's interest in the same way. Hanks and the beautiful Audery Tatou work well together without trying to create chemistry. The supporting cast all put in descent performances, although Jan Reno's considerable talents maybe a little waisted as the stereotypical French Detective. There are moments of humor too. But, like the novel, the purpose of this film is to get you thinking. Even though I found the religious theories a bit far fetched, this is still the most entertaining movie I've seen this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Works as a Thriller but not as a mystery,"Acting was, of course, considering the cast, excellent. It was thrilling and exciting and well photographed. It was fun to watch. Good movie.As a mystery, it falls apart. And as history it is chock full of false information -- but, it must be remembered that the book and the movie are fiction, not fact. And, I think the majority realize this and I kept that in mind when I watched the movie and enjoyed it.The characters depicted are supposed to be highly intelligent yet they make tortured intuitive leaps which weren't logical. There are almost too many to list. The obvious ones are 1.) Even if Mary Magdelene was married to Jesus, how does that make her divine and how does that affect Christ's divinity? Mary's divine and Jesus isn't? If Jesus was married, so what? 2.) The ""Sang Real"" is a huge, gigantic secret, yet at every turn in the movie it seems that everyone in the film knows about it. Ever try to keep a secret with just one or two people? Why wasn't this 'secret' widely known after centuries of so many people knowing it. And going around killing off the bloodline doesn't wash. 3.) The protectors of the ""Sang Real"" (Priory of Sion or whatever) show up at the end to ""Protect Sophie . . . 'as we always have'"". So, where in the heck were they throughout the movie? 4.) So what if Leonardo Da Vinci painted a picture with a woman in it or left a chalice out? It's not relevant. He wasn't at the last supper. How does that support a conclusion that Jesus was married? It doesn't. How could highly-intelligent people make these illogical conclusions? Historically, the council of Nicea did NOT meet to throw away gospels. They met to decide whether to enter 2 Peter and some other new Testament books into canon that had already been widely accepted by the first church. The gospel mentioned in ""The Da Vinci Code"" was written a few hundred years after Christ's resurrection whereas the canonical gospels were written within a generation of Christ, from eye-witness accounts, and were already widely accepted by the first Church.The council of Nicea met to debate only one huge question -- Christ's divinity. 1. Was Christ pre-eminently divine and therefore the Son of God and God Himself OR 2. Was Christ appointed by God to be His son after His resurrection. The vote at Nicea was decidedly one-sided -- only two votes out of approximately 300 were cast for the second premise. It was by a landslide vote that the council adopted the biblical view that Christ was pre-eminent, that Jesus Christ was not a created being but the son of God and finally that Christ was God incarnate.Good movie, bad history.

could have been better,"1st we'll start with the simple things then get to the more complicated stuff. acting performances: not the best performance by hanks,excellent work by Ian McClellan and Audrey. these are the most notable, the other actors (molina and co) were just fine. when i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that the time has finally come for Bethany to breakthrough and become a really heavyweight actor joining the elite of Hollywood but that didn't happen mostly because the movie have ruined the character that we have read and sympathized with. i think the biggest mistake was making this movie a 2h something. of course most pros and script writers would disagree saying that there are certain rules when you adapt a novel, but this novel was truly unconventional in so many ways. it isn't enough that its turned into a movie it has to be turned into a truly great movie. because i believe that the success to the box office was a tribute to the book. but how could have this movie been better? first i would make it an epic adventure like pirates of the Caribbean or lord of the rings. because turning it into a thriller is of no use, its the most read novel in the history of literature! so its not a surprise that teabing is the murderer or that Sophie neveu is the ""decsendent"" of Jesus Christ. so having a breath taking epic adventure full of riddle's and mysteries traveling through time and space to find what jack sauniere has Left his grand daughter after his death. another point is why is this movie only two hours something? it easily could be four hours! and it wont be long because what we enjoyed the most about the novel was Dan brown's ability to end every page with a cliff hanger, so its not long. as long as their is action taking place and as long as this action adds something to the story it cannot be considered unnecessary. an example is in the movie where langdon is asked to explain the pentacle on sauniere's body. langdon says it has nothing to o with devil worship. while in the novel he goes on for pages analyzing how this star evolved from being a sign of goddess Venus into a sign for devil worshipers. this doesn't only supply the reader with interesting interpretations but also makes the reader safer so that he becomes more shocked when he finds out langdon is actually a suspect. the longer time langdon spends explaining to fache, the more shocked will be the audience to find out that is a suspect. to sum it up the film failed in bringing the dark and tense mode of the novel to life. but thats because Ron Howard wanted to deliver a message different than the book's. the book is an invitation to renew our faith, while the movie is the conclusion that Ron Howard has come to after reading the novel. our faith is good, and helps us the way it is regardless of the historical truth (the well scene). Kenneth Brana would have been great as Robert langdon! i give it 6",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An extremely well made film,"The task that Ron Howard was given--to explode the truth onto the world--goes off without a hitch in this movie.I have seen many critics of the book and the movie bashing it for its long run time and because of the fact that in certain parts it feels boring. All I can say is blame the author, not the director.This movie follows along with the book in a very accurate fashion--the changes that were made were mostly made out of necessity. The many twists and turns will leave a former reader or virgin viewer on their toes. Hanks proves to be an excellent casting choice for Langdon, Tatou plays a very convincing Neveu, but the two best actors in this movie by far are the gentlemen playing Leigh Teabing and Silas. Ian Mckellan cements himself into the cast of one of the greatest actors (in my opinion) ever to hit the screen in his extremely convincing performance.Don't let the controversy or critics mislead you--this movie is excellent. I am Christian and found nothing about it to be offensive. The historical references were accurate, the fictional parts were clearly fiction, and the whole movie combined together to be one of the most entertaining pieces of pop historical fiction I have ever seen.That being said, this is not something that a closed minded viewer would enjoy. If you are easily offended (I am not) or overly manipulatable, this probably isn't for you. However the overall rating people have been leaving for this movie does not accurately reflect the brilliance of this movie's creation.In order to accurately assess the quality of this movie, I rated it based upon the idea that it was its own individual artistic creation completely separate from the book.This is like Indiana Jones ""The Last Crusade,"" only a lot more real, a lot more intellectually stimulating, and with a hint of mystery. Go forth!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Yes it is offensive but...,"...it is not a bad piece of cinema as many make it out to be. I put off reading the book just to experience the movie in its fullest form. While many people have put forth an argument that it is not as good as the book, I, who have not read it, found the movie quite decent. But coming back to the previous warning, yes, this movie can be quite offensive, especially to the Church. The Church and Christianity itself is painted explicitly in very negative light and I'm not talking about the Mary Magdaline controversy. So, if you are a bit sensitive, then I would advice you to not watch this movie. But as a piece of cinema, it has been quite well directed and produced. The acting and locations are quite good. It would be mild entertainer if you could ignore certain parts of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very entertaining!,"The Da Vinci Code is a great movie to start the summer off with. Respects the storyline of the book, with one or two changes or omissions (but hey, as it was it lasted 3 hours, so...), but overall, everything is pretty much as one would have expected it to be when reading the book, it's fast pacing, twist turning, and fun, filled with good historical details and conspiracy theories that are not necessarily true (most have been talked about for many years, many many other books and other movie (such as Last Temptation of Jesus Christ). Personally, I love the ideas it presents, the idea that Jesus was a man like every other, who loved and lived, who had a life makes everything so much more real than what I've been taught my whole life. Added to that a gorgeous French and European backdrop, conspiracy theories of the church, secret organizations with famous intriguing members, all add up to what I think are 3 very fun hours. Also, good acting on behalf of all actors. Never really understood all the criticism, considering after all that this is a work of fiction, both book and movie!!!!!!!) No one has said that anything presented in the movie is the absolute truth, so just go and enjoy it as what it is... a very entertaining and engrossing movie, specially for those who love treasure hunts and the such.

the bible.. fact or fiction?,"Well talk about a movie to really make you think, well folks this is it. I mean the Bible, Jesus,Mary Magdeline, the Pope, just to name a few, the Knights Templar, The Crusades. It's a lot to take in but let's try, I can buy the fact that their could be a conspiracy i mean just look at the Catholic Church, now i was raised protestant, and haven't been to church in many years, after being made to go as a kid, but the point is, the corruption in the church, Jesus was 33 when he died, you mean to tell me he never had sex,, course he did, he was mortal i believe, him having a kid, i'll buy that much. I liked the first 1:45 of the movie, then well it seemed to me that too much was revealed at the wrong time, making it less than suspenseful after that. I loved the character of Silas, played by Paul Bettany, Tom Hanks character i liked very much. seeking the truth, very studious, always thinking, i respect that. I absolutely think Jean Reno shined in this movie, he is one of the best French actors today. I think that this movie came too quickly after the book, I haven't read the book, but i will someday. The movie took us to magical places. Westminster Abby, the Louvre, just to name 2 .

Why much publicity for so little!,"I just have seen the French version of the Da Vinci Code yesterday and I have been as surprised as disappointed. Why all this fuss about this movie? Moreover, how can this far-fetched story trigger such controversy about Christian religion? As example found in the same kind of story/thriller a film such as National Treasure (2004) is much better done and seemingly benefited of a budget up to its pretenses, which is not at all the case with the Da Vinci Code. Dialogues, actors and rhythm are unsubtle. Good guys, like the bad ones, are much stereotyped. I am French and not Catholic, but I sincerely wonder why the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei feel their image and reputation are threatened by this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty good story,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the story. While it is a long movie, the pace kept moving so nicely that you don't even realize it takes 2.5 hours.The movie does stay true to the book, although some may consider this a chance for the movie makers to bring more life to the characters and the dialogue. My personal feeling is that most (not all) people who didn't like this movie did so for reasons other than being entertained.From this disenfranchised group comes a lot of discussion about the basic facts and premise of the movie that Jesus had a child. Well, logically speaking a Jewish man living at that time period of Jesus's age would have probably been married. But with all that aside, if you just go to be entertained for a brief period of time, this will do the trick. I certainly am not one to agree with critics, either movie or literary, so am glad that this has been getting the attention.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Seek The Truth,"When respected American religious symbology expert Dr. Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre by the French version of the FBI, led by Captain Bezu Fache, he soon discovered that he is the #1 suspect for the murder of a historian Langdon had been scheduled to meet with. Assisted by a French cryptographer and government agent named Sophie, Langdon is challenged to decipher a chain of cryptic codes and puzzles, all the while trying to stay ahead of Fache's lawmen in a chase through the Louvre, and out into the Parisian cityscape, and finally across the channel to England. Can Langdon and Sophie decipher the nature of a secret dating back to Leonardo Da Vinci and earlier before those responsible for the historian's murder add them to their hit list? Like many people, I've read the book, which was really good with a decent ending. It's actually one of the better books I've read. I had my own perspective on the book and ran through the scenes in my mind as a chase thriller. What I've seen in the movie might not be close to this perspective as I thought as I hoped.Like National Treasure, I wanted this movie to be a chase thriller. I wanted it to be thrilling and suspenseful like another other chase movie. Let me say this: The first hour was a let down. It was not suspenseful or thrilling. It was rather boring and uninteresting. It could've been a lot better. Well, it should have, after what the book has set up.With that being said, let's move on to the remaining of the film (the second full hour). Now, it gets interesting. The boring string score you heard in the first hour gets more involved and suspenseful. There's more action and it's more intriguing. Since the second half of the movie is more than the first half, I liked the movie.Tom Hanks' performance was decent, not at all that great. On the other hand, I liked Audrey Tautou's performance. The supporting casts, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Paul Bettany, were also decent. I didn't really mind the revisions in the film. It wasn't annoying or that at all different from the book. I have to say, though, that if I had not read the book, the movie would have been confusing.This isn't a great adaptation as Harry Potter, but it is decent. The movie had some good special effects, great production design, and some good cinematography. Yeah, I liked National Treasure a lot better but if you're a fan of the book, you might as well see this and hope what you get is good.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just a lot of nothing,"There's nothing wrong with the Da Vinci Code that a new director, screenwriter, cinematographer and editor wouldn't have cured. Fundamentally, it's OK, but the problem is the amateurish feel from beginning to end. It's much like a Movie of the Week on network TV. It's just...lackluster. And I didn't read the book. And I'm an atheist, so I don't care about the religion one way or the other.Ron Howard's direction on the past has ranged from workmanlike (Apollo 13), to good (A Beautiful Mind), to truly awful (Backdraft), and this is well down on the scale. He seems in part to be hamstrung by his devotion to particular actors; Paul Bettany has yet to turn in a bad performance, but here takes attention away from the main plot line. Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon is fine, but the character has nothing to do, leaving Hanks holding an empty bag with his huge burden of acting history...and perm. It's weight without substance, and more, is poorly paced and just badly shot by Salvatore Totino whose credits include, well, nothing of note, and are unlikely to get any more illustrious from here on out.The screenplay, by ""Daniel P. Hanley"" and Akiva Goldsman is just lousy. Both are longtime Howard collaborators, and rumours are rife that Hanlet is a pseudonym for Howard. I don't know if the book was this jerky, but the film is a bumper car of stops and starts.But the worst offenses are from editor Mike Hill, another longtime Howard crony. At 149 minutes, there's at least 45 minutes of total fluff he should have cut. Length is not a substitute for content. It just makes it feel longer than it is.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Da Vinci Code on the screen,"I do not know the book. the theories of Dan Brown remain for me at the half way between blasphemy and childish games. but the film is enough to regret the presence of Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou in the adaptation. because the story is too unrealistic and its only virtue is to present words and hypothesis and myths and plots in chaotic manner, for impress and create appearance of profound work. because it is pure entertainment who desires be more that. because it is out of logic and only one of many adaptation of a bestseller of the moment who could be the modest version of Wikipedia. so, a form of adventure film. or less. because the essence of genre is absent and all is reduced at the actors who, in many scenes, are out of role.",,Anonymous,Mystery

My point is, from this we could conclude that you'll either love it or hate it. Wrong! Now that I've seen the movie, I must say that I found the story interesting but nothing more. I thing that all those headlines like Shaking of foundations of Christianity"" are stupid. If you are a religious man and you believe what the Church says, then no book or movie can make you feel other. If it can, then you are a complete idiot. This movie has a great story and... that is pretty much it. Too bad that a great actor like Tom Hanks who was in so many wonderful movies like Forrest Gump"", Cast Away"", The Terminal"" and probably in one of the best movies in the history of Hollywood, The Green Mile"", didn't put in a better performance than this. I won't recommend it because I think there so many top quality movies to recommend, and this is not one of them.

Faithful Adaptation,"I work at a movie theater and one of the perks of the job is seeing movies before the general public. However, I rarely partake in this act because quite frankly, most movies nowadays don't interest me. However, this was one movie I had been waiting for for the last two years. Having read the book (and it's prequel, the even better (IMO) Angels and Demons), I could not wait to see this movie. Unfortunately, I left the theater last night a little bit disappointed. I know that 9 times out of 10 books will always be better than the movies, but I really thought, considering the source material, that this would be one of those rare exceptions. Now, I'm not saying that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't (despite what the critics are saying), but I expected more. The characters (with the exception of Teabing, played masterfully by Ian McKellan) lacked character. Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon was nowhere near as charismatic as his novel counterpart, although I don't blame Hanks for that. I blame the script. Despite being the lead character, Langdon didn't seem to have as big a role or nearly as many lines as I would have imagined. Another gripe I have with the film was that it didn't nearly get into as much detail about Da Vinci's art as it should have. The painting Madonna on the Rocks was especially neglected. However, the film does succeed in recreating that treasure hunt feel from the book. The chases, the twists, the turns, are all recreated, for the most part, faithfully.I think people who come into the movie cold will most likely enjoy the movie most. My manager who previewed the film with me and some other co-workers absolutely loved the film and she said that she was on the edge of her seat the entire movie wanting to know what happened next.As for the controversy, all I'm going to say is that in the bookstores this book is in the ""FICTION"" section.

Don't bother with this movie if you liked the book,"Terrible adaptation of the well known book. The script just could not figure out a way to translate the book into a story that makes sense on the screen. The intricate details of the book were either skipped or rattled off glibly as badly written dialog. Bad casting of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno in the lead roles led to acting that range from average to dismal. Hanks looks nothing like the character described in the book and was obviously chosen only to boost ticket sales. He simply falters in this role despite how talented an actor he is.

A lesson in mediocrity,"Yes, the old rule still applies; the book was better than the movie.Its not that the film was 'bad'. It just wasn't good. Instead it was lackluster, simply going through the motions. Its as though Ron Howard and screen-writer Akiva Goldsman were creating this movie with the assumption that everybody and their grandmother had read Dan Brown's book and really just wanted to see what was on the page translated into images - its as though they knew that nobody expected much more from them than a competent translation from book to film. Unfortunately Tom Hanks in the pivotal role of Robert Langdon does not seem to have translated into most reader's conceptions of Brown's character. I agree with the general consensus on the casting of Tom Hanks; he's too old and not savvy enough; in the book Langdon is described as being like Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones, this is so far from being Tom Hanks its laughable. And it seems Hanks didn't have much confidence in himself either; his apprehension comes across, which means a huge chunk of the Langdon persona is missing from Hanks' portrayal. Most reviews I have read take a bigger bite out of Hanks than what I have just done, while agreeing that Audrey Tautou's talents are underused but she is bearable. Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany have been hailed as the film's saviors; but personally I think all the actors come across as being pretty run of the mill. All are undoubtedly talented; it's just that 'The DaVinci Code' seems to have put them all to sleep.This is a very long film too; 149 minutes. I was yawning after about 40 minutes. While watching the film I was trying to imagine how someone who had not read the book would perceive the movie. Somehow I doubt it would manage to hold interest. I think the only reason I stayed awake until the end was simply to see how certain scenes translated onto the big screen; the mystery, for anyone who hadn't read the book and knew how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together; wouldn't have been particularly enthralled",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite entertaining,"I went along to see this film with a completely open mind - I had never read the book so only knew what the general theme of the story was.

I must disagree with them. OK, it's not great art and will never become a classic of the cinema, but it holds up as a reasonable thriller and is quite acceptable for an evening's entertainment. The cast puts in an acceptable effort to keep the plot rolling along at a good pace. I must add that the film has not made me want to rush out and buy the book and I really can't see what all the fuss is about (that's probably because I'm a non - believer).

Also, despite the over simplification, the movie is very loyal to the book.I don't know if there's such a low rate due to people feeling offended for the religious topics depicted or because it could have been overhyped at the moment but I think it is a solid 7.For anyone who hasn't read the book this movie can be watched today perfectly well even though it's about 17 years old.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Somewhat Disappointing and Confusing,"I think the books are fun. They get into issues of art and secret societies going back ages. I'll admit that Dan Brown misses the point sometimes on some of his set-ups. But like most fiction, especially the genre he belongs to (I will throw in the likes of Preston & Childs), there are liberties taken. I'd like to know where those places in Game of Thrones are on our earth. Silly. Well. There is no scientific or historical accuracy in these films. The author created a world where evil has existed for centuries and he makes up a situation where this evil must be circumvented. I think what has happened here is because Dan Brown is not considered a fantasy writer, his work gets attacked as if her were a scholar. That trickles down to the movies and makes people so emotional. I liked the review by the woman and her boyfriend who had never read the book. They were willing to let their prejudices go. I didn't care much for the sequels, but there are other reasons for that. I think Hanks was quite adequate and the move is reasonable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not deep, not Good and not the book! ...but it made money","I really enjoyed the book. It was a thundering good read. Okay maybe the story lacked consistency and depth, but that doesn't matter: it did what it was meant to do - it entertained. For all those people who poke fun, pick holes or spend ages listing the errors, I have but one response: you are missing the point - it's fiction.So as you can see I was hoping for an entertaining and absorbing movie. Alright they were going to have to make the puzzles a little harder. I mean was there anyone who failed to solve the anagrams or mirror writing at first sight? (One criticism of the book that is hard not to concur with) In addition the script writers were going to have to be resourceful, since suspense would be difficult to engender given that the story was so well known and the plot admittedly a tad linear.Unfortunately the movie missed the mark by a country mile. Where the book was fast paced and enthralling the film was slow and uninvolving. The dialogue was trite and unbelievable and the plot completely mismanaged.The book certainly simplified the subject matter and adjusted facts to fit the plot, but it never insulted the reader - it assumed a knowing intelligence and a willful suspension of belief. The film however was crass and insulting in its treatment of the audience and the way it negligently failed to even bother to try and paper over the cracks and, indeed, chasms in what plot it allowed was extraordinary.As far as I can see there was but one single intent in making this movie - to make money!",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Weather fiction or something more, it has been done as well as any film ever has, and will be as enjoyable to the viewer looking for an escape from reality for a few hours, or those looking for a hidden or deeper meaning. The plot is complicated and fast moving and has twist and turns that keep you constantly guessing right to the bitter end. The film is not suitable for young viewers, due both to the complexity of the plot as will as moments of graphic violence.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The books is always better than the film,"Hey guys! This movie should be seen and is good for what it is, but the book was way better. Good point I can say were, the cinematography was great, the locations were cool, excellently shot. Silas frightening entrance in the Château Villette had me jumping off my seat. Paul Bettany did a great job with his European accent. However some questions must be raised with the screen play. Where was Sophie's brother? Where was Sophie's love for her grandfather? Why was Langdon arguing with Teabing when discussing Mary Magdalene in Château Villette? What was the point in having Sauniere not Sophie's grandfather? These things just would have made the overall script tighter and the 2 1/2 hours more enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Da Vinci code was such a let down,"It did somewhat, go along with the book. The book had action to it, had yo on your seat at times. Made you think a little. The movie... well... it was boring. Of course i didn't expect anything new to be in the movie. BUT, i expected more from Tom Hanks, who i now believe wasn't the right person for that character (though i normally enjoy Hank's performances). This time he fell short of the mark. The entire movie fell short of the mark.I've seen make up do far better to make up an albino as well, this guy was not made to look like one. You can see him being tormented by the past and being called a ghost... this man looked far far from a ghost of any sort. I've seen movies where they created an albino out of a regular person and they were able to do it well. Another let down.Ian.. well.. he's always brilliant in what he does and did a great job as usual, he salvaged the film as best he could. But in the end, the movie was too low keyed to be worth watching.Sad, i enjoyed the book. Though, the book really is a rip off of an older book. The tale is still interesting, though i am unsure as to why anyone would change a belief over the tale. Or if someone did believe such a thing, why would it really matter in the scheme of things? Jesus being married and had a child would not change a thing for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you keep an open mind and watch this film for what it is, you'll enjoy it","After a year of waiting for this film's release, I finally got to see it yesterday afternoon, and I have to say that I really did enjoy it! To be honest, I can now understand the negative reviews it has received since the Cannes film awards ceremony - I can't even explain what was wrong with it. I suppose it had something to do with the pacing, and the two main characters did seem a bit one dimensional - but then again, I thought exactly the same when I read the book! Sir Ian McKellan (as Sir Leigh Teabing) and Paul Bettany (as Silas, the albino Opus Dei monk) were the best, by far! They really made the entire film, in my opinion. They were both excellent and nobody could have played those roles any better than they did.When I had read and listened to reviews of this film, there were lots of comments on the audience laughing at a certain part (I can't remember which) and also people found the line ""We need to get to a library."" Now, is it just me or does that just mean that people are just more easily amused than ever? I didn't find anything about this film whatsoever. Unless I missed something.Also, there is no way that this film should have been rated a 12A!! They should have kept it as a 15. For one, it meant that I had to sit in the theatre with a gang of kids no older than 13 giggling and screaming (mainly when Silas kept jumping out on people) at the back, and walking up and down the stairs and in and out of the theatre. Seriously, why would kids that young want to see this film? No offence to them, but I really doubt they even knew what was going on. I suppose them walking in and out of the theatre continuously and giggling and messing around proves that they were bored - or perhaps it was their first time at the cinema without their parents. I don't know. But another reason is the violence. We all know that 12A means that children under 12 can watch the film with a responsible adult. There is no way I would take a child to see this film. The flagellation scene at the beginning is a bit graphic - it could be worse, certainly...but it was enough for me to cringe. So yes, they should have kept it as a 15.But that's my only complaint :) I walked out of the cinema, not totally blow away by it at all, but me and my friend did have a very in-depth conversation about the whole Jesus/Mary Magdalene theory and I even took her to the book shop so I could show her the portrait of the Last Supper in detail. And even though I thought I wouldn't see it again on the cinema, today, I have to say, I've changed my mind and want to see it again a.s.a.p All I say is, keep an open mind! Just watch it for what it is, and you will enjoy it!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Appreciate this movie for what it is.,"I made the mistake of watching the movie after reading the book, and I was disappointed, but I watched it again a while later and enjoyed it much more. The movie itself is great; it's just sometimes difficult to separate books from their movies, so if you haven't read the book or seen the movie, I would recommend watching the movie first. The book is by far more detailed than the film, naturally, so anything you don't understand can be explained in the book.It's a good movie. The casting and acting is all fabulous, and even though I was a little unsure about Tom Hanks as Langdon at first, I did eventually get used to the idea.

An epic in proportion,"Hello there, Well where to begin - Not a bad adaptation to film, in fact this is one the few films i have seen where the Director pretty much stuck to the whole narrative structure from the Book. Which is good but i also think he had to do that to sustain the uniqueness of the story. The actors played there parts to the core. I am a great fan of Tom Hanks and seeing him after so long was a Joy, however i did have some reservation on his character because Robert Langdon was much more enthusiastic about this whole dilemma. The other important characters were very much like the people in the book - Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany (Who was spot on).The film produced some interesting qualities that the book didn't have Vice Versa such as the exquisite special effects and added Flash Backs and more. They managed quite well to show the whole history behind the paintings, Da Vinci and Jesus Christ. Which would have not been an easy thing to do, because it was a complex story to understand from the beginning. The whole out look of the film was very much the way as i imagined it perhaps because these locations where shot at were actually real places.It took time to dwell into the film and i felt the film could have been a little fast paced but other than that the film does justice to the book and justice to the screen play. I say the film is Epic in proportion because it had that very olden day touch and large in Canvas feel. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stop being biased,"OK guys, time to stop crying. I'm a Christian too and this is just a story. Just a fictional story.

James Bond meets Carrie's Mother,"I went to the film to see what all the fuss was about. I just about burst out laughing in the early scenes when I realised this James Bondian film was being taken as actual fact by some people.The evil, handsome, masochistic, religious nutcase, almost albino monk Silas, played by Paul Bettany, ranks up there with the best of the Bond villains.The Lourve in Paris dripping with French flavour and French dialog gave it that snazzy, international, ultra-wealthy, Bondian flavour.Ian McClellan, as a grail scholar, was a hoot to watch and a treat to the ear to listen to, especially his line ""starting with him"".The movie had more plot twists and double crosses than an Agatha Christie mystery. You never knew who the good guys were even after the movie ended. I have never seen a movie with so many competing sets of villains, each of whom is convinced he is the good guy. You experience the movie from the point of view of the bewildered Tom Hanks, a mild mannered university professor swept up into the supercharged world of Christian fanaticism, where faith justifies any crime. Hanks seems to be saying over and over to himself ""What the heck is going on? Who ARE these people? Why are they doing this?"" This echoes your own bewilderment. However, the bewilderment is not merely irritating, but tantalising. You figure that any moment you will figure it out.The reason the movie is controversial is that it puts not only individual Christians in a bad light, but the entire religious establishment. Both the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" are equally nuts in this movie, fueled by ridiculous self-righteousness and exaggerated importance of trivia.To me, it was absurd people would kill each other for centuries over a difference of opinion whether Jesus had a daughter born after his death.The rather strained narrative sections use a novel cinematographic technique of showing history reenacted in a surreal sort of hologram, with a cast of thousands. Christian viewers had their noses rubbed in it as Hanks and McKellan reviewed the dark side of the history of the church, though Hanks lies in claiming science supports the existence of a historical Jesus.I found myself wanting to shout out to the actors to ""look out"" since again and again they took no precautions whatsoever as danger closed in on them. It just about drove me crazy how many times the protagonists were such dolts when it came to self-preservation.Many things rang false to the point of being silly, e.g. the use of Halmark Greeting Card English on supposedly medieval Italian artifacts, and the initial premise, that a dying man would spend his last hours composing an elaborate religious treasure hunt for his granddaughter, starting by carving clues into his body, or the utter lack of security on the famous paintings at the Louvre.There are some delightful politically correct touches, such as the advantages of the tiny Smart car, and the use of penis symbolism in the military.It's a long movie, but you won't be bored. Just the locations/sets alone are enough to keep you entertained.There are a few realistic scenes of ritualistic self flagellation and mutilation. I had to look away. If you take young children, take appropriate precautions to avoid terrifying them.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A definite puzzle that takes some working out but is this a puzzle you'll want to revisit again and again?,"I can understand the upset and the controversy this film dug up and still does now. The ideas behind Da Vinci and his hidden codes were first introduced to us a few years previous to this film, by novelist Dan Brown and whilst I have not read that book, it seems this film is less an exciting and intelligent piece of medium to sit through and more so a slap in the face to those who have spent countless hours, days, weeks and months actually reading the bible. The Dan Vinci code does, I suppose, feel like a big budget Easter egg hunt  ironic then how something like an Easter egg hunt (something linked to but not directly involved with Jesus Christ) should be used to compare to a film about the supposed myth that Jesus Christ actually was.I think it's quite sad when a film takes on a difficult and challenging subject matter but invokes mocking and ridicule more so than discussion on a constructive nature. But then again, it's not like I immediately took to this film because I felt under-whelmed. Instead of being presented with an argument, having the argument developed and then being given an oppositional reading, I got a blockbuster inspired film with chase scenes, characters with guns, espionage and criminal underworld activity - I'm not sure how honest to the book the film is but if Brown has written all of this also, then it makes me think he's trying to do a Bond or a Bourne but uses religion as a front for the story instead of The Cold War or amnesia.The critical analysis begins as soon as the film begins; Robert Langdon (Hanks), who it would seem is the reoccurring hero of Brown's books, gives a lecture to an audience of multi-ethnical students about symbols and how they can mean different things: the Nazi symbol with Far East religion and the peace symbol muddled in with something else. ""Tonight, this will be our quest""  that is he will investigate these codes and clues and get to the bottom of it all, but is he speaking to us the audience? The students are all of different ethnical groups and nationalities; maybe we, the watching audience, are the hall of students being told what to expect from the very off. The theme here being 'all is not what it first seems.....' (cue eerie yet tacky music).And so Langdon goes on a journey. He is ripped from his world of lectures, students and book signings and thrust into a world of criminals, police and espionage when I was really expecting a world of intrigue, argument and debate. The one scene that demonstrates this is when Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen) goes off on a rant at his mansion presenting us with The Last Supper drawing and gives us his little insight into phallic challis meanings. Hanks plays Langdon with a stern face and a downbeat voice, he is a rabbit in the headlights but it is not Hanks' fault  he has nothing to work with; in fact I preferred his performance of the exact same nature in exactly the same situation in Saving Private Ryan (a man torn from his world and placed amongst war and everything that comes with it).The major problem with The Da Vinci Code is that it just does not inform, nor does it really entertain. The film might be quite fun, if you can understand the language of Latin; it might work, if you are lightening quick with anagrams; you might be engaged, if you know your ancient history and your facts and figures. The film might even work if you've either read or have a general knowledge of the bible, but toward the end and especially after Teabing's little rant you'll just feel insulted. Thus, it's a case of insult the one demographic that may be intrigued by your film: not a good idea. In fact for most of the film, we needn't even look at the screen but just listen to the apparent argument as well as facts and figures that are apparently being presented to us.It is a shame that the best parts of the film must lie within the opening and closing twenty minutes with most of the in-between stuff just filling in. There is a scene when Langdon and his female sidekick Sophie Neveu (Tautou) are about to be executed in the back of a lorry; it works and is suspenseful but these should not be the best bits of the film. Similarly, the same situation occurs in a church; the camera cuts to 'on high' as some pigeons flutter and disturb the gunman  the chance to escape presents itself. Another good scene, as is the exchange between three people over an enclosed coded map. One question, were those pigeons from 'on high' an act of divine intervention? All seemed lost but a coincidence saves the day; perhaps this little inclusion of a composition and an idea isn't actually there, maybe it is  but that's the theme: all is not what it first seems.There are other flaws that double up as interesting ideas. Silas is brilliantly played Paul Bettany, a religious freak who must inflict pain on himself but I doubt God will approve of the nun killing. The film unravels its plot points and twists in a fashion that forces you to merely accept them and move on than really give you a chance to appreciate and acknowledge them. By the time the denouement involving a certain character has arrived, The Da Vinci Code has used up all of its best scenes and put to bed most of its best characters. Still, at least it was better than Dogma.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent film!  Detailed and emotionally charged.,"What a wonderful wonderful film. Highly intellectual and will be of special interest of those who know religious and European history. This really teases the mind. I did not read the book and yet fully followed the story line with it's enormous amount of historical data. I was held in complete suspense as the story unfolded it's self.The film is fully Ron Howard. Wonderfully shot, emotionally charged and intellectually appealing. Tom Hanks is at his best, fully allowing you to suspend you state of disbelief. To add spice to the cast, Ian McKellen is superb. Now place Audrey Tautou in the mix and you have a cast with wonderful chemistry.You do not have to religious to appreciate the possibilities of this story. Especially with the very ego centric and political religious organizations that abound around us today. They all seem to have the matra of ""Hurray for our side"". In the real world, the church has long been known to hide secrets of history, as with the more well known issue of books being removed from the official bible. Even the catholic ""bible"" is different from the ""standard"" bible. The point is there is enough known politics of the church to fuel the possibilities and provoke the mind.Ignore the critics on this one and GO GO GO.

"Skip the Movie, Read the Book","The Da Vinci CodeTotal- 4.6 out of 10Sound- 8/10 Vision- 8/10 Design- 8/10 Acting- 4/10 Story- 3/10Skip the Movie, Read the BookBy this point you, or someone you know has read the book, The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown. I broke down and finally read it too, to get ready for the movie since I figured that a movie with Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellan, Paul Bettany and Jean Reno can't be all bad. Flat out, this is a case where the book is much superior to the movie, although that's not really saying very much. The Da Vinci Code is a second rate story trapped in a third rate novel and it's much worse on screen since all its flaws are magnified to the size of 100 foot screen.There is no chemistry between the main characters, at all. This is a real shame since Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou look great together on screen but they don't look like they had a lot of fun making this movie. Both Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon who is a Harvard professor of symbology (a discipline that doesn't exist and just seems to be an excuse to sound like you know something when you really don't know anything) and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, a French police cryptologist aren't convincing in their roles. They both sleepwalk through their parts and look bored delivering the plot boiler, pulp fiction-like dialog. In the many chase scenes there is never a hint that either Langdon is being chased by the police for murder or that Neveu is risking her life and career helping the accused murderer of her own grandfather. The tension that should be in the movie is totally absent.As a viewer, you never really feel a bond with the main characters, but you really feel something for the supporting actors. I think Ian McKellan's portrayal of Leigh Teabing was right on. He completely stole the show and obviously didn't take the movie seriously at all and completely hammed up his role of bête-noir in the story. His explanation of the Holy Grail in his French castle estate is probably the best part of the movie. Paul Bettany as Silas the albino assassin monk is menacing and frightening. I really wanted his character to come out a lot better in both the book and the movie since he has the most interesting story of all the characters. I do think the two scenes where we see him making penance and scouring himself are a little much and those scenes probably lasted too long for the movie's good. Jean Reno as Fache, the French police detective is great too playing a relentless detective who isn't like Javert and sees his mistake in the end. Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa has some good moments too and does fine in his role.Having filmed on location in Paris at the Louvre, in London at Westminster Abbey and at the famous Lincoln Cathedral that doubles for The Temple Church, director Ron Howard couldn't go wrong. The cinematography great is and so is the sound. The flashback visual effects that Howard uses to illustrate the past history as Langdon or Teabing explains the history and back story of the movie is very effective but it made me want to see more of the Crusades or more about the Knights Templar. Ron Howard is good at making big cinematic gestures but somehow he forgot that the whole movie is a big chase from Paris to London and as I said above the view doesn't get the feeling that anyone is ever in danger or there is anything really at stake. The movie is about half an hour too long and could have used some work in the editing room to make the pace of the movie from a drama into a thriller, which the movie wants to be. The music by Hans Zimmer really sounds like it should be in a thriller but without the action on screen the music falls flat and just sounds like it was taken from an Indiana Jones movie.After seeing The Da Vinci Code, I have to wonder what the fuss is all about. It's just a novel or a movie and not a very good one on either count. Anyone who is taking this fictional account at all seriously has to I remember there were a lot of yawns in the theater and everyone left very quickly as they were talking about how underwhelmed they were about the movie. If you're really interested in this, read the book, or read Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which Dan Brown liberally took his ideas from, even going so far to name Leigh Teabing after Leigh Baigent who is one of the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail. The Da Vinci Code proves the old phrase of the book being far better than the movie to be true at least in this case.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A flawed but still entertaining adaptation,"Let me start by saying that I'm quite a fan of Dan Brown. His books, while often over the top and not very believable, do have a lot going for them: lots of suspense, high pace, interesting facts and theories, and fun characters.Ron Howard's movie adaptation stays remarkably true to the book, so many of the things that apply to the novel apply to the film as well. That means that if you're looking for something really deep or thought-provoking, you should look elsewhere. But if you want to be entertained, you could do a whole lot worse than watching the ""Da Vinci Code"".For the most part, I've found DVC a reasonably fast-paced and fun action thriller. After a somewhat slow start, it actually becomes fairly suspenseful roller-coaster ride full of twists and turns. The fast pacing and constant stream of information that is poured over the viewer almost hide the fact that the actual plot as such is even less believable than that of the book, though. The ease with which the main characters elude the police at every turn and solve the most complex riddles in mere seconds is really a bit hard to grasp.That being said, having a 125 million dollar budget certainly helps the movie. For one, the budget really shines through in the production values: DVC is beautifully shot and very atmospheric.Secondly, it allowed the makers to hire a very talented cast of actors who mostly do a good job. Ian McKellen is obviously having the time of his life and steals every scene he's in. Jean Reno does yet another cliché French cop part, but he's very good at that part so I don't mind. And Audrey Tautou is just as lovely as ever. Oddly enough, Tom Hanks is surprisingly disappointing. His Robert Langdon goes through the movie almost as a zombie, devoid of any kind of emotion. Paul Bettany as Silas didn't really work either...he wasn't nearly as frightening as he was supposed to be.In the end, DVC is a reasonable adaptation of a good book. It's for the most part an beautiful, well-made and entertaining action thriller that contains some amusing theories. It might have been better with a director and script-writer who were willing to take a bit more risk and/or add a bit more of themselves into the movie instead of sticking so closely to the book, but it's still solid entertainment *** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not bad - but not outstanding,"After hearing some bad reviews, I was sceptical about this movie. However, I was surprised - but only because my expectations were low.First of all, I really was not particularly impressed with the book. All comments about the plot aside, I simply found that Dan Brown wrote like an accountant - it opened well, but degenerated quickly into very bland prose. The direction took a similar turn. It opened rather well, but I found that towards the end, I felt entirely bored with it. I expected something with a greater climax - it didn't seem to go anywhere. Visually it is very stunning - but whilst the direction is competent, it is quite bland. The historical sequences don't add much to the plot, and all it does it break up the endless talking.Secondly, some of the casting was very good. Ian McKellen was very good as Leigh Teabing, and got a few laughs, although, I must admit that the casting of Paul Bettany was completely inspired. He really was very good as Silas, and his final scene was really compelling. Alfred Molina's role was smaller, but he did a good job with it. However, I felt that Jean Reno was not a strong enough villain. I was expecting a much more powerful villain - although he did impress me in one of his later scenes. Tom Hanks I found also was a bit lacklustre - his character didn't seem to do anything other than run around a lot and crack all the codes inordinately quickly. Audrey Tautou was very gorgeous, but despite the fact that she was meant to be the cryptographer, she didn't seem to have much of a role in the actual detective work; she just stood there and looked astonished.Whilst the Da Vinci Code just about works on paper, the major difference between the book and the film is that you can't pad the film out with pages of description. Everything had to be explained through talking, which meant that the whole film boiled down to two hours of wooden dialogue. The Latin and French conversations seemed to be thrown in simply to make the viewer watch the screen.Whilst this film is definitely worth seeing, don't go in with high expectations, and you might just be surprised.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Expected One?,"It is a brutal, bizarre and ritualistic murder in a fashionable Parisian Meusum, which initiates notable director Ron Howard's sensational film, The Da Vinci Code. Based on Dan Brown's controversial book which purports to trace Jesus's Maravingian's blood line through the centuries on into the modern era. It begins with cryptologist Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) visiting France, lecturing and book signing when he is suddenly jolted into a dangerous and certainly puzzling high speed police chase which begins pin-ball style in the wet streets of Paris and flying across and into scenic Switzerland, Rome and even historic England. Accompanying, Langdon, is mysterious policewoman Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) who helps Hanks and learns to understand the mysteries of her own involvement. Chasing Langdon is Interpol Inspector Captain Bezu Fache, (convincly played by Jean Reno) who is seeking not only to capture the good doctor, but to destroy him and his quest. Adding to the murderous and intricate pursuit are church fanatics like (Paul Bettany ) as Silas and religious Zellots like the infamous Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina). In addition there are other menacing arch-types like, Andre Vernet (Jürgen Prochnow) and superb arch-villain Sir Leigh Teabing, played to the hilt by Ian Mckellen. The film's fine casting holds up well enough, despite Hanks's long tooth appearance. Vintage film buffs can readily see this film suspiciously mimics National Treasure. Difference is Nicklas Cage sought lost treasure, whereas Hanks seeks only the Holy Grail. Still, the great cast lends credibility to a otherwise dubious storyline. All in all a fun film with no harm done. ***",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"It was  as I expected - absolutely pants! I was hoping the film would humanise the characters a bit more because they were completely unbelievable in the book, but alas not! Hanks and Tattoue were so one dimensional and completely forgettable  no substance to their characters at all. Not surprising because their dialogue was them just explaining stuff! Ian McKellen however was brilliant! He camped it up big time! And I'm sorry but I thought Paul Bettany was good despite his bad reviews! I tell you what it reminded me of  you remember those educational videos we used to watch at school? We'll it was like one of those  but with good actors!

Code blue,"'The Da Vinci Code' was a big bestseller, not, generally, a sign of great literary merit. The author Dan Brown's method, as well as one can detect from the Ron Howard movie version, is to bombard you with arcane-sounding information about Christianity, the divinity of Jesus, signs and symbols, the Priory, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and of course Leonardo Da Vinci, who's woven in as an officer of the Priory and unifies the story, to a degree, because it begins with a murder in the Louvre (wasn't Da Vinci an artist? and doesn't he have a painting or two in the Louvre?) -- and to add absurd and quite unbelievable twists, in the interest of -- what, exactly? Well, keeping the story going, I guess. Some who read the book say it looks very foolish on screen. Yes, it does. One doesn't need to read the book to see that. One wonders if this movie will bury the book or revive it. Certainly with the libel trial in London and the pore-opening publicity about ""anti-Christian"" content, the book has so far done well for the movie's box office.What's 'The Da Vinci Code' a story about, exactly? It could be regarded as simply a murder mystery, but it's both much more ambitious and much less successful than the usual detective story. Brown's revisionist account of the Council of Nicaea and claim, at least for the purposes of the novel, that Christ's divinity was a matter of general dispute at the time of the Emperor Constantine, and that Jesus started a blood line with Mary Magdalene, that this was covered up, that the Holy Grail is really a feminine symbol -- the blasphemy gets lost in absurdity and the tangled web adds up to very little, but it keeps Ron Howard and hapless viewers busy and befuddled for two and a half hours. All of this is too preposterous and silly to deserve to be considered a threat to anyone's faith, but the fact that Christians have objected to Brown's book and to its being made into a movie has been amply capitalized upon by the Hollywood promoters (See Frank Rich on the op ed page of Sunday's NYTimes -- May 21, 2006).What happens? A guy gets murdered, pursued by a faceless monk, and flays himself on the floor of the museum. A Harvard professor and expert on symbols named Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who's conveniently in Paris to give a big lecture (conveniently in English) is summoned by a certain French detective (soon replaced by the main detective, Bezu Fache, i.e., the trusty Jean Reno -- looking bloated, and wasted here) to help out with the symbolism of the cuts the murdered gentleman has made in his body -- and the story is on its jagged way. Clever Prof. Langdon may be, but he needs help, and it comes in the form of a French police cryptographer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).Langdon and Neveu proceed to lecture each other through the rest of the movie, augmented by an old friend of Langdon's, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McClellan, who shouldn't be here; but who should?), a sort of expert on the Holy Grail who's supposedly in search of that mythical object. What sinks the movie for any intelligent viewer is that it treats us as idiots. It explains the obvious and claims the most ludicrous absurdities to be true.Brown's story demonizes the ""prelature"" known as Opus Dei, to a degree toned down, it's said, in the movie -- but Opus Dei in the movie still includes homicidal self-flagellating monks, most notably the albino madman Silas (Paul Bettany), whose use of the cilice, a way of digging nails in one's leg, is gruesomely illustrated in a scene that would appeal to any masochist and shows off Bettany's hunky nakedness. Silas comes in every so often to start up our pulses, which tend to die down with all the tedious explanations that make up the bulk of the movie.Langdon is a professor of ""symbology,"" which Walter Chaw accurately describes as ""a malapropism invented by idiots so as not to confuse their flock with real words like 'semiotics' or 'epistemology.'"" He's a debased -- horribly debased -- version of Joseph Campbell -- as if Campbell's unifying humanism were reducible to riddles and word games. The movie does a bit better with its monsters -- Silas, and a couple of initially kindly-seeming figures. But the screen-time belongs to the boring explainers, and Hanks and Tautou make the least sexy couple imaginable.Reno's casting as a daring detective in a mystery involving murderous monks makes a kind of mindless casting sense, since he played the same thing -- in the person of the intrepid Commissioner Niemans in Matthieu Kassovitz's rousing horror-actioner 'Crimson Rivers.' The sequel, ably directed for visuals by Olivier Dahan but less well for character, also stars Reno as Niemans and is full of FACELESS, HOMICIDAL MONKS. Either of the 'Crimson Rivers' films provides five times the satisfaction of the talky, absurd 'Da Vinci Code.'",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A brave but failed attempt.,"The book takes nearly 600 pages. The film lasts about 130 minutes plus who-knows-how-long in credits. So that there was plenty of time for the book to advance its theories and show how the codes were broken. But there just wasn't enough time for that in the film. So we were left with long periods of talk and inaction, then a few minutes of fairly over-the-top action to make up for it. Hence I felt that the film dragged. What did come over very strongly is the frightening belief that if a ""believer"" has different views from another ""be-liever"" but one with a different faith, then the second person is wrong  God hates him, and he deserves to be: framed for murder; killed, tortured  who cares? And if you truly believe in a certain God, then it's great to murder provided you also flagellate yourself and wear torture implements. But if you treat this film purely as fiction (which is quite likely what Dan Brown intended in the first place), then it lacks pace and surprise. By the way if Leigh Teabing really was the master criminal (or teacher) he had several opportunities to do what he did earlier on. The so-called climax and surprise identity of the teacher, was just wrong. In book as well as film. This film is advertised as 150 minutes. The credits started rolling at 130 minutes. I didn't time them, since I really have no interest in who supplied the donuts or did the washing up. But surely they didn't last 20 minutes!(I kept hoping that someone would put a notice on the fridge saying: In fridge, in plastic box, next to the baked beans. That would have saved a lot of trouble.)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mostly Harmless ... inoffensive, but not a bad film.","Well this was not a bad film at all. I went with three other people and everyone liked it immensely.One could call it inoffensive, since the subject matter has potentially explosive content.But, that's what Ron Howard tends to do with what he's given, take a message and make it palpable for a wide audience without getting everyone angry. He's too nice perhaps.Still, the film got me right away, and I was pretty much glued to it the entire length.I had not read the book, although I am very familiar with the subject. Yes! Dan Brown, should pay the people who wrote Holy Blood, Holy Grail, because that is all their idea! Dan Brown, did however write a marvelous story, that is entirely his own. Brilliant stuff. So borrowing ideas is not a crime, but perhaps he should have included footnotes. I liked how the historical flashbacks were done as well, as washed out black and white.Silas, (Paul Bettany) pretty much carries the movie. Some of the scenes were just skin crawling creepy. Perhaps there was a great film lurking in there, had the film sustained the intensity of the Silas scenes, it could have been a masterwork.Still it's an important film, as the subject matter raises questions about the origin of a faith that was in fact, taken in a completely other direction 3 centuries after it's inception.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Controversial Topic Hidden Inside a Fun Thriller,"I remember this movie causing quite a ruckus during its release.The controversial topic hidden inside it gave it quite a press, some for good, some for bad. However, I believe all the noise was unnecessary, as the movie never for a second tries to pass itself as something to be taken seriously.Still, it is undeniable that the writing of said controversy is very clever and extremely captivating, definitely the driving force behind what is otherwise a simple, albeit fun, action thriller.Dan Brown, the writer of the original book series, also worked in the movie, and is very clear how some characteristics of its writing were transported for the movie, both the good and bad ones.The good ones are the very well written and captivating characters, the plot twists, the clever mysteries, the luxurious settings and the dramatic urgency that is always present in its work.The bad is the simplistic, at times completely unrealistic, action scenes and lack of consistency in how the institutions inside the movie work.In the end, it is a fun movie with a very clever topic as its central piece, but not nearly as dramatic and controversial as people make it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Movie's depiction of Langdon,"I liked the movie more than I thought I would. It was fairly entertaining and moved pretty well. The casting was kind of awkward though. I really didn't like Tom Hanks as Langdon. For some reason, he just didn't seem to resemble my vision of what Robert Langdon would be. I liked the guy from the Professional as Fache and I liked the guy who played Teabing. But, Sophie, although very pretty, seemed to struggle a little too much with her English to put on a convincing performance. Maybe that was intentional to be authentic? But, I don't think so. But, to the point, the biggest thing that disappointed me was the movie's depiction of Robert Langdon. I didn't like the fact that he was depicted as a defender of the Christian faith. Now, I'm sure Christians would not see it this way at all... But, he kept referring to all of the theories that Teabing and he would bring up about the Sangreal as ""myths"". I'm not arguing that they are or aren't myths, I'm just saying that this is not how he was depicted in the book. I also realize that changes need to be made from the book to the movie for it to work on screen. But, in my mind, this change was made to pander to the Christian world and paint a more ""open"" picture. The book clearly has Langdon as a ""believer"" in the Sangreal ""myth"". But, the movie pits him in direct contention with Teabing and his thoughts.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Also praise has to go to Paul Bettany who played the role of Silas better than i had even imagined.

Da Vinci Code,"The movie, while good, did not capture the gripping, fast paced action I experienced in reading the book. After reading the first few pages of the book I just had to finish reading it. The movie moved along smartly, but not at the Indiana Jones pace that I was expecting. Tom Hanks didn't fully convince me that he was Robert Langdon although he didn't appear as Forest Gump either. While, in my opinion, the book was outstanding the film was merely good. I would recommend the film to people who have read the book, but not to those who haven't. The film does not do justice to the book. The Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction and should be read or viewed as such. It is entertainment pure and simple. The book and its forty million readers are tributes to Dan Brown's story telling expertise. The movie left out the anticipatory angst to which the always pressured main characters were subjected in the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What was all the fuss about?,"I have not reading the book and I thought that the film would live up to the hype around the book. I was completely wrong, it is a very dull film and is very muddled in places.

The story is stupid and I have not got a clue way there was a huge fuss about it and loads of television programmes have been made about it as it is ridiculous and only an idiot would believe it too be true. It is too long, miscast(the worst performances from Hanks I have ever seen) and poorly directed (especially the action). If you want to see a better film along the same lines watch any of the Indiana Jones films or even National Treasure starring Nichalos Cage, which is him after lost treasure but is just lot more entertaining.

"As Trite As Religion Itself. A Bland, Overlong & Convoluted Conspiracy Theory.","As tripe as religion itself, Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code manages to create a sense of interest in its opening moments and is involving to a certain extent but the longer it goes on, the more absurd it becomes. Convoluted, inflated & packed with provocative Christian allegories, it's simply a series of nonsensical twists & turns that goes on for far too long.The story of The Da Vinci Code follows an American symbologist & a French cryptographer as they team up to investigate a grisly murder the former is suspected of. With the help of clues present in Leonardo da Vinci's works, the two attempt to connect the dots and end up discovering a religious mystery that could shake the very foundations of Christianity.Directed by Ron Howard (best known for Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind & Rush), The Da Vinci Code is intriguing at first, opening with the event that sets its story into motion, but it starts getting more n more confusing as the story progresses and its endless barrage of exposition crosses that fine line after which you just don't care where it's headed and wait for it to end.While the storytelling aspect suffers from multitudes of issues, the technical aspects make the ride a little less frustrating. Set pieces are meticulously detailed, camera-work is fluid and captures each moment in a clear, concise fashion, and Hans Zimmer further enriches everything with an excellent score. Editing, however, is messed up and is unable to provide the level of transparency the picture required.Coming to the acting department, the film features an impressive ensemble in Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno & Paul Bettany but their respective characters lack the required depth. Hanks is in as Robert Langdon and is surprisingly wooden in the role, Tautou is often clueless & confused, not to mention that there's virtually no chemistry between the two. And the only good performance comes from McKellen.On an overall scale, The Da Vinci Code garnered as much controversy as its source material at its time of release but it's one overlong, boring & bewildering conspiracy theory that isn't even worth the time or money. Whatever interest was generated within its first act goes out the window in the next, following which the story heads into the pretentious zone and unleashes one laughable twist after another before finally concluding on an unrewarding & forgettable note.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nice Piece of Fiction,"As an extremely devout Catholic I had to think long and hard before deciding to watch this film for fear of being offended.I needn't have had my fears - none of them were realised. I viewed the film for what it is - a piece of fiction and another angle on the story of Jesus Christ.Nothing could rock my solid faith and this film didn't even raise a speck of dust. At the end of the day it's just a ludicrous story and in no way should be taken seriously.I enjoyed it very much indeed and was amazed that I'd sat through 2 and a quarter hours by the time the credits rolled. It is rare that a film grips me enough to prevent me from continually clock watching but this film did just that. It was entertaining from beginning to end and I though everyone played their part very well indeed, especially Sir Ian McKellan.Several of my church friends refuse to watch this film but I can't think why. Probably their faith isn't profound enough and they fear this film may make them re-think their beliefs. I was much the same when I first heard about the film and the associated controversy with my church but after time I realised my faith was strong enough and was in no danger whatsoever of being swayed by the screenplay of a fictional book.I can honestly say, as a devout Catholic, that I enjoyed this film very much and, ironically, it has helped to deepen my faith even further. If anyone starts to question their faith after watching this film then I would advise them to watch The Passion of the Christ and get the true story of Jesus Christ.Thanks.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not as good as the book, but still thrilling...","I must agree with most people who've seen the movie: it's not as good as the book. But still I enjoyed it very much. I watched it with my brother yesterday. He hadn't read the book, but even though he didn't completely understood the story and required some clarification at times, he still thought that, and I quote his words here, it was 'a kick-ass movie!'.The beginning of the movie I felt was too hastened and too quickly for people who hadn't read the book. After about fifteen to twenty minutes the tempo slowed down a bit to a more understandable level. Like I said before, my brother did require some clarification at times, but that was partially solved by the cinema itself. They gave us a small list with some keywords like Opus Dei, Leonardo Da Vinci, the Priory of Sion and among other things the Knights Templar.The movie could have been a whole lot better if it had followed the book the letter, but in most cases that's impossible with book-to-film adaptations.

Who would have thought-a mystery thriller about historical religion!,"I just left this wonderful film and want to put my unadulterated thoughts on paper-having purposely not read any viewer comments on IMDb. I probably am one of the few in the western world who have not read The Da Vinci Code so I am writing purely about the film I just watched. Earlier in the week I saw another superb movie, The World's Fastest Indian and it too was brilliant but for enormously different reasons-it was kinda like comparing Titian to Picasso-both brilliant painters but having little in common other than the paint on the canvas.Ron Howard directed a superlative action movie: fast paced, doors that open onto unexpected tangents with unexpected characters, historical depth and unusual motivations. In short, I found the movie a first rate thriller with huge depth and wonderful acting. Ron Howard brought out the best in Hanks, Tautou and especially Ian McKeller. I enjoy visual movies greatly and I thought that Howard used the camera to its very best. There was much camera movement and interesting useful flashbacks at points needing further elaboration.The visual beauty of the film was enhanced by Salvatore Tortino's beautiful camera work as cinematographer. For some reason, on this film, I noticed the blurred backgrounds of the many closeups called for by Howard-really startlingly beautiful closeups of big shots of people.Religious extremists will be outraged by the underlying philosophy of this movie but that philosophy plays a small part in the movie. From an anti-religion person like myself, The Da Vinci Code was an excellent mystery/thriller made wonderfully delicious by its subject matter-a two thousand year old mystery.Now I will read the novel and then go to the movie at least one more time. I have been a critic of American movies in the past, and from today's previews before The ...Code I will remain so, but this film is the exception that proves the rule. Watching, The ...Code was a great experience and I recommend it to everyone except religious extremists.This morning I sat through The Code again and enjoyed it far more than I did the first time two weeks ago. I enjoyed: Howard's direction even more; I thought his camera angles and shot selection perfectly suited the film; I enjoyed the acting more than at my first screening; I was very impressed with the editing and was most impressed by the script writing after having read the book in the intervening weeks.All concerned should be extremely proud of their efforts!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A solid adaptation, but as its own film it lacks substance","Time and time again people have criticized movies like ""The DaVinci Code"" with that movie- bashing mantra ""it's not as good as the book."" To say that this doesn't apply to Ron Howard's adaptation would be wrong, but it does deserve, in a few areas, more credit than it is given. It is a strong adaptation of a best-seller, but does little else to make it a great movie.First of all, a movie is a movie and book is a book, and as such there are things that make good books good books and good movies good movies. With that said, the key to an adaptation of a book to a movie is to take an already good book and translate it so that it can also do what good movies do. With DaVinci, this movie does a few of these good things. A good movie is visually interesting and Howard's greatest strength is bringing images and art to a novel that is strongly art-associated. To understand Brown's books better is to look up and see the images of the art he mentions. Howard also visually creates the historical explanations that are simply dialog in the book. That, and the dark, mysterious nature of the book comes out in Howard's visual choices.Another signature of a good movie is good characters. The trouble is Brown's novel is so plot-driven, that only the book could allow someone telling this story enough time to give insight into the characters. Howard decides accordingly that the plot is most important here, and Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's talent goes to waste and their ""normal people"" characters suffer as a result. They become mere pawns of the greater themes, theories and ideas the book has founded its popularity on. The only character who gets time devoted to him is Paul Bettany's devoutly religious and murderous character Silas. Him, and Ian McKellan's quirky Sir Leigh Teabing, another theorist on the sacred feminine subject.With a plot-driven adaptation, 'DaVinci' and especially Ron Howard can only do so much, and though I'm not one of them, anyone who is unfamiliar with the book can enjoy the movie more on plot and theory alone. Especially being released in a time where the book is still incredibly popular, I don't hesitate to believe audiences who read the book expected new light to be shed on the story through film, not something a straight adaptation can provide.So if you're looking for a movie to strengthen your love of the book's ideas, you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours of a book put to the screen, this movie does a more than satisfactory job of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty Decent Movie,"Overall, for those who never read the book (like me) it was a good movie. A few moments where you sat there and went ""Huh?"" but a little bit later things were explained, and a good few moments where people jumped out of there seats. All in all, the story holds your interest to a certain peak, but its not an action flick or anything for those idiots saying ""this movie sucked! There were no explosions! I'm gonna go beat it to wrestling videos"". Its what would be considered an ""intellectual thriller"" with as many twists and turns as a merry-go-round. I gave it a 9 only because I was one of those people who thought that maybe there was a little too much information, but afterwards I knew it was necessary.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than snobs say it is :),"I'm really perplexed at the backlash against this movie. It seems like quite a few rather disdainfully snobby literary types don't like that the book was popular and are thusly taking it out on the movie, no? I can only picture the self-absorbed critics laughing at the climactic moment in the movie--which was neither funny nor poorly done. If you give yourself an attitude to stay distanced from the movie, you will assuredly do that--teenagers who think they know everything are capable of doing the same during ""The Godfather"".It isn't a Shakespearean tragedy, but it is a fun adventure/mystery that awakens the imagination and fictitiously connects historical figures and art in a really interesting way.The book was of that caliber and the movie did a fine job of capturing that quality. I'd give it a 7 / 10. Not nearly one of the best movies, but an entertaining and imaginative bit of fun.Also, if it causes someone to research art and history more--and more importantly IMO, question a faith in a book of preposterously false myths written by ancient man--it's done a service to humanity!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I will no doubt watch this movie many times (for entertainment),"I should preface my comments with the statement that I hold no particular set of religious beliefs (or disbeliefs) - the controversy surrounding this book and movie are superfluous to me. That said, I was late to read the book, but having done so, I was impressed with the author's ability to weave a story that could gain and hold my attention as a reader (I have since read several of his other books.) I am glad to say that the movie fulfilled my hopes in this regard; Ron Howard and the stellar cast he assembled kept me in my seat with my eyes on the screen and my ears at attention.The movie (and the book) convey a story that utilizes elements from the action, suspense, mystery and drama genres. Achieving the proper balance of these disparate styles is difficult without becoming heavy-handed or clichéd, but I am pleased overall with the results. Dan Brown has a writing style that seems well-suited to (and perhaps actually intended for) transcription to the screen, albeit with a Hollywood sensibility. I am not surprised that the movie was received poorly at Cannes, indeed, I was more intrigued with the fact that it was presented there at all - it does not strike me as the type of story or film for the 'artsy' crowd (not that there's anything wrong with 'artsy' films!) I think it safe to say that anyone who watches this movie without too many preconceptions will find many aspects to enjoy.

Worth the wait.,"After reading the book at breakneck speed several years ago I was interested to see how the movie would develop the characters and the detailed historical background which provided the necessary information to follow the plot. I thought Ron Howard did a masterful job of bringing the viewer along so even one who had not read the book could know and understand what was happening.While disappointed that many media reports panned the film I found that the movie was reasonably true to the book, created the same sense of suspense found on the written page, and moved at a pace much quicker than I was led to believe. The actors played their roles well, although I thought Audrey Tautou's character could have been a little bit more forceful coming off a little too naive and demure. Funny though issues like the length of Tom Hanks hair neither added or detracted from the movie and to me he made a very believable college professor. Jean Reno and Ian McKellen were up to their usual standards and fit their roles perfectly. Paul Bettany was new to me but he nailed the part of Silas creating a truly sinister and frightening character.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved the book - Movie disappointed,"I thought the actors did an absolutely wonderful job in their roles, I absolutely love Paul Bettany and I completely lost him as he became the character of Silas. (It impresses me when I can completely lose an actor in a film, and see only the character instead of the actor.) The others did a wonderful job in their respective roles as well, the acting itself gets 10 stars from me, I have no complaints there whatsoever. Having recently devoured the book in just a little over a day, the movie as a whole just didn't work for me though. I believe this is primarily because there were so many, many discrepancies between the book and the movie. At times it was like a completely different story was being told on the screen from the one I'd read in the book. I had a difficult time enjoying the movie because the differences were so glaringly obvious to me - some little, some absolutely huge. I understand that often things are changed here and there to make a movie fit into the time they have available to them, or to make it work better, but I just found the changes to be too much to do the book any sort of justice. On the other hand, my husband, who has not yet read the book, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. He said for him it was similar to National Treasure, a movie he loved. When The Da Vinci Code first opened I'd heard them say on the radio that the movie couldn't possibly live up to all the hype, but that if you went into it with no expectations you'd enjoy the movie version of the story. Apparently I went in expecting it to be too similar to the book, without that expectation perhaps it would have been more enjoyable for me. If it were a standalone movie I think I would have enjoyed it a great deal more because what ruined it for me were the changes to the storyline. From our experience it seems it would be best to watch the movie first if possible, then read the book afterward to learn the details. Either that, or if you've read the book already, be prepared that the movie isn't quite the same story as the one told in the book. I certainly didn't absolutely hate the movie, and would like to watch it again now that I'm prepared for all the changes to the storyline.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent adaptation,"I will not be getting into the gist of the movie...book sold 60mil copies ..and by now you all know...I also will not argue the possibilities...but simply judge the movie on the merit..having read the book so... here are my thoughts I think ian mckellen was not really believable as a bad guy/mastermind...he could have been...but he seems to smile throughout the movie...didn't really give me a badguy feeling(like in x-men) silas was very good...although i'd prefer a bit more brutal/gory (like in the book).Hanks and Tautou were fine, although there was no chemistry...u would expect them, as they solve the riddles, to more finish each other's words..jean reno's role was BS...in the book the way he was described and the dialogue went..you could feel his presence...in the movie he basically had useless dialogue...I think special effects/flashbacks were by far the best part of the movie...they weren't confusing or scrambled but fairly clear...I know what you gonna say....you cannot compare book to a movie..and its true..where are very very few movies that are as good as a book my guess.The biggest problem is with the adaptation and cutting material...they left out a lot of flashbacks...so that the terror/anticipation you feel when you read, you don't feel it here(the whole scene with opening the safe box...was a joke/could have been done a lot better).Also, i didn't like the french speaking policemen or Latin(Italian?) cardinal/silas...least they could do is give us some kinda translation in the subtitles (the whole 2nd plot about betrayal or the cardinal and such would have made it a lot more layered, like in the book)...like that scene when they found them at mckellen's place..obviously the armored car had a GSP..i guess they talked about it in the policy office...but its a guess...if they had some sort of subtitles it'd been clear.perhaps making this a 3 hr movie would have been implausible since most ppl who did not read the book won't sit through a 3 hr movie and producers who put that kinda money for it,...wont risk it a nice.director's cut would be nice...adding 30-40 min of footage..more flashbacks to her childhood would have added necessary ambiance.also...in the end when they show the reason she stopped talking to him...i always thought it was different than in the movie...more of some sort of sacrifice or the killing or maiming perhaps",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was a feat by the script writer to make sure the complex plot and conspiracy theories were clear while keeping the pace moving.

The locations looked great too.There has been a lot of complaints calling this boring, slow and woodenly acted. I disagree. It's not going to change the world but then we didn't expect it to.

Drop Expectations and See a Great Adaptation,"I'm seeing a lot of lukewarm responses to this film, but I think the reason why is all the speculation that went along with people as they went to see it. In my opinion, that's what kills most good films: people have presupposed expectations of a film and when the film goes in a different direction, then they just write it off as stupid or pointless because it doesn't match what they were thinking. I feel this film is suffering from this syndrome.First of all, let's consider the director: Ron Howard. The films he has made in the past have been geared towards pleasing a large audience. This is what he brings to this film. He took the heart of the novel and preserved it in the film. Therefore, allow me to take issue with some of the comments made about the film being too wordy. The book itself is very wordy. It's a concept novel that contains a bunch of what-if situations strung together into a mystery/thriller, and requiring a whole lot of explanation. The film is a perfect reflection of what the book was all about. To spice up the large amount of exposition, Howard puts in filler footage so we can more easily imagine what is being described. Works great for me, because the only expectation I had going into the film was that I would be able to see what the boom only described.Second, let's consider the actors: Tom Hanks. I love him; I'll admit that right now. I remember seeing ""Splash"" and ""Bosom Buddies"" as a boy, and I've grown up watching his films. My comment to my wife as we left the theater was that I felt he really did a good job of portraying the character of Robert Langdon as there weren't a lot of the idiosyncrasies (such as facial expressions, voice, etc) that are trademark Hanks (only one that I recall from the entire film). Taotou was perfect as Sophie, the young person coming to terms to what her grandfather was all about. And my wife and I agreed that Jean Reno played the perfect Fache; we cannot imagine anyone who could do a better job with that part. Ian McKellan may not have met the book's physical description of Tiebing, but he was excellent in the film using a wide range of emotions (I loved his display when Hanks and Taotou arrive at his place).Thirdly, we have to keep in mind that there has been a lot of hype over the premise of this movie. However, I think it's important to point out that none of that hype was touted by the filmmakers. Both Hanks and Howard simply stated that they wanted to make an entertaining film, and that's just what they did. The fact that so many people protested and made a big hullabaloo (great word, eh?)needs to be forgotten before entering the theater.One things to keep in mind is the source material for this film: it came from a book. Being an English teacher, films based on books are a kind of specialty with me. I have seen many failures, some near-misses, and a few stellar entries. This film is one of those that sticks closest to its source material. It keeps almost perfect pace with what the book developed; the buildup and relaxing of tension/suspense is mirrored exactly. The expository sections that have to be there are there, and yet enhanced by the filmmakers to make them less dry. This is one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.I, for one, loved the film (my wife, for another, loved it also), and I am hoping it is really successful because I would love to see ""Angels and Demons"" on the big screen sometime in the near future.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Mixed bag.,"After seeing a early screening of the DA Vince code, i was left with mixed feelings.After reading only the beginning of the book (due to my library demanding it back because of its popularity) i only knew the story up to the point of the ex cape from ""The Bull"".The film, on the other hand, although faithful to the book, is a mixed bag. In parts it excels and really gets you thinking about THE POSABILITY, in other parts, it fails to convince me, even just for story wise, of the main plot line.Having only read part of the book, its hard to compare the too.But i did find it very predictable. SPOILERS AHEAD: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN SPOILER FREE About 20 minuets into the movie, i knew that Sophie was the decedent of Christ and that Teabring was the teacher. The moment they arrived at his home, i automatically knew, simply from his obsession. Also, the confrontation on the plane between Sophie and Silas cemented my suspicion that Sophie was not the protector of the secrete, but the secrete herself with the words ""Every breath you take is a sin"".END SPOILER Overall, the film, although entertaining, is long, and drags on in a lot of places. i simply loved the history visual effect, of how when they went to the church in London, they had the past mixed with the future, an image i saw in my minds eye many a time when i went to a historical place. It was almost odd seeing something for real that had only been in my minds eye, and it actually living up to the image of the mind But, overall, the plot itself, the whole Christ is married, etc, didn't really sell it to me. Sure, there is theories, and its not completely imposable, but, i just don't understand to this day, what the big deal is if he did have a child. Why cant he be the son of god and still be a man? Idk, i guess people need to believe only what they want to, and feel threaten if they might be wrong.Overall, its a odd film, mealing its great in parts, and lame in others. I guess its worth checking out, but i don't know for sure if it will receive a home on my DVD shelf of honor (as i like to call it) when it hits DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just Another Book Turned Movie,"I read the book about a week before the movie came out, so I went into the movie with high expectations, maybe too high.The movie was mediocre at best. It oversimplified many things that could have used less time explaining at the cost of entertainment. There were many key scenes in the book that did not show up in the movie, while I have taken budgets and time restrictions into account, it all started with the script, which could have been much better.This was definitely not Tom Hanks best movie, he was given many lines that made his character sound like an idiot. For an expert in symbology, he wasn't to bright.For a movie that has had so much force behind it for months from churches and atheists alike, I expected much more.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

good movie bad critic,I personally thing that this movie was very entertaining and the critic was undoubtibly not in the target auidiance. Personally i think he is a little too set in the ways his parents raised him he cant separate his religion from his life and this makes him unable to to enjoy the movie. Then again when i think about it i have more of a omptimistic outlook on things allowing me to see the best in any movie. So maybe through the eyes of another the movie can be boring and misunderstood but thats just something for others to think about.

Bordering on the tortuous,"This should have been an absorbing if not great film. I'd not read the book and taken all reasonable steps to avoid press coverage and interviews, so the plot was fresh to me at least. But it was a long, drawn-out affair, with historical detail shovelled inelegantly into the lives of characters who didn't really seem to develop any identity, nor any convincing interest in each other. There were some ingenious plot ideas hidden in there somewhere, but perhaps even this lengthy film did not have the space they needed to be revealed in a manner that did them justice.Perhaps this was simply an unfilmable story - better suited to a quality many-part TV adaptation perhaps, if anything at all. Pity though.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could of been done better...,"The Da Vinci Code, perhaps the best book I have ever had the privilege to read, and when the fact I heard a movie was going to be made I swore. How can you make a movie that would live up to the book? I have never seen it done, and this movie is no exception.The casting of Ian McKellan was an inspired choice, as was Jean Reno as Fache, Audrey Tautou was not what I would call my first choice, but she carried the movie along okay, even though her accent did get in the way of some dialogue. Now for Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks!...who the heck in their right mind would cast him as Robert Langdon,...I pictured Dennis Quaid myself.What made the novel's ending work so well was when they were at the Rosalind Chapel, you never discovered the hidden documents as they did in the movie. It was one of the great twists in the book, you think they have discovered it, but alas, it had been moved, but Sofie discovered her grandmother and her brother,...which was only hinted at in the movie. The way it was done in the movie just threw me out of it completely, I was going to say the movie was acceptable, but the whole Rosalind Chapel sequence could have been done better. Also her grandfather was her grandfather in the book, not just a man who took care of her at birth. Some other subjects from the novel, such as the sex ritual, where not explored in enough detail in the movie. It was just there to be there and for those who have never read the novel it was just plain confusing and seemed out of place. Which was how the movie was like for some friends of mine that have never read the novel. They were confused and lost, always leaning over and asking me questions. The dialogue was terrible,...the whole script in general should have been redone...Dan Brown should have written the screenplay,...usually authors adapted their works better for the screen themselves than to have someone else do it...(a good example of great adaptation is Arthur Miller's The Crucible) I was highly impatient for this movie to be release, but now that it has happened, I feel disappointed and disgusted on the way Hollywood as treated one of the greatest mystery novels of our time. The only thing I found really enjoyable was Hans Zimmers score, which at the end was beautifully done. My bet is the only Academy Award this movie will be nominated for will be Best Score, but the Razzie Awards are going to have a field day.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Informative but not entertainment,"I went to see the movie with my wife, who very frequently falls asleep in the middle of a mediocre performance, but this time she was alert and enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Personally - we have both read the book, I read it twice - I agree with the criticism concerning Mr. Browns skills as a writer. Having said that, I have to point out that the poor writing, though making the directors and screenwriters work more difficult, also provides the movie makers with the leverage needed to sophisticate the dialogue. Ron Howard and his team haven't quite succeeded in making the substance lacking dialogue any better, but the movie is nonetheless more palatable in this respect than the book. Maybe the movie as such is a bit too informative for the average American viewer and requires some education in history beyond that of the local school system. Tom Hanks' performance as professor Langdon has been criticized for being dull and dimensionless, but hey, the man portraits an art historian and symbolist! What do you expect, Indiana Jones? On the contrary, Mr. Hanks' somewhat hapless personality build of the witty professor in the middle of a situation beyond his control is in my opinion well founded and skillfully performed, a more action movie-like approach would have spoiled the idea completely. Ms. Audrey Tautou, the doll-faced french actress with the very winning smile, does not fail, either. She is somewhat lost and perhaps a trifle emotionless in the beginning, but she does rise to the occasion and ends the movie with a skillful touch of comedy. Jean Reno, reliable as ever, makes a fair show of a problematic character and deserves to be complimented. Ian McKellen works with great routine but is not fascinating, though genuinely British in both speech and attitude. Paul Bettany is downright scary and draws a very believable picture of the effects of religious fanaticism on the individual. Which brings us effectively to the point of discussion on the heartrending cries from various friends of our Lord, who feel that both the book and the movie are sacrilegious and should be burned - with the author, naturally. At this point I usually toss the ball back to the critics and remind them of the fact, that if our Lord finds Mr. Brown's or anyone else's books or other works offensive, he will deal with them in his own good time. No human interference is needed, as this is one authority you cannot escape from, right? Should some mortal authority find himself annoyed or even offended, that's OK, but limit your indignation to fair and pertinent criticism.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but not great...,"Like many people, after reading the book, I couldn't wait to see this film on the big screen. I think in general, for people who hadn't read the book, people will find this film quite good. For those who have read the book, they will realise that they have changed/left out a lot of the film. The authenticity of the film, I thought was quite good. I really liked the way they had the central French characters spoke to each other in French....Small little observation I know, but I like these little things. As for the acting, I think we can all agree that we have seen both Hanks and Tataou in better roles. In the beginning of the film Hanks seemed stiff, he loosened up a little but both lacked the chemistry needed for the role!...Tataou, as well wasn't at her best, but given the fact that this is her first major film role being spoken in English, she can be forgiven!....Personally I thought the age gap between Hanks and Tataou was too great for people to totally except a possible relationship. The best acting in the film came from the non-central characters, being Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina and Jean Reno, Paul Bettany also gave a really good performance playing Silas. In general, this film is good, nothing at all what is built up to be, but still worth the watch. Those of you who have read the book, get ready for some ""odd"" changes, you will find yourself coming out saying ""in the book it wasn't like that etc..."", if you haven't read the book, sit back enjoy the story that has caused so much (might I add unnecessary)controversy!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly Good!,"Having enjoyed the book without being blown over by it, I decided to see the film although I wasn't particularly excited. Most of us would agree that Hollywood often ruins good stories, but The Da Vinci Code didn't suffer such an indignity. The film is a surprisingly good rendering of the book.Though the main characters deliver somewhat lacking performances, the peripheral characters are triumphant; particularly Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany as Leigh Teabing and Silas respectively. Certainly, there are those skeptics out there who have a tough time accepting the seemingly outlandish leaps made by the main characters in order to solve the mystery. Yet, if one can manage to put aside her skepticism momentarily, she will certainly see a plot of thrilling intricacy.The film certainly calls some common Catholic beliefs into question, but it also acknowledges traditional points of view through Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon. It is a terrible shame that such a great number of Catholics (many of whom make up the 17% of voters who rated this film a 1 without even seeing it) seem incapable of reckoning with opposing beliefs. I encourage everyone to see the film as a work of fiction rather than as an actual affront to Catholic traditions.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Did not live up to the hype.,"There is a cardinal rule to writing good fiction - SHOW, DON'T TELL. Large parts of this film seemed more like a lecture than a story. If you can imagine having all the right ingredients to a good casserole - and then turning over food preparation duties to a bad cook - you have THE DA VINCI CODE.This cannot be Ron Howard's finest hour as a director nor Akiva Goldsman's finest hour as a screenplay writer. The writing either had no emotion behind it or Howard's direction was non-existent. Either way, there's only so much a veteran actor like Tom Hanks can do in such a scenario.P.S. As a non-Christian and a fan of Hanks, I was predisposed to ""like"" the film when I saw it. I didn't. The only good thing to come out of this film is that fundamentalist Christians dislike it just as much as fundamentalist Moslems (Jesus is considered a prophet in Islam) - giving the two religions a common bond that could inspire better understanding between them.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well done considering the amount of information in the book,"I know, I know; there is a lot of talk about the controversy surrounding this movie. Here is the basic point. I believe in God and I believe that Christ is the son of God, who died on the cross for my sins. The work of fiction (the book) was an engrossing and extremely entertaining read (as were Dan Brown's 3 other books, Angels & Demons was exceptional).The movie was very well done. It managed to carry the major themes of the book while keeping the film moving where it could have been very bogged down. Kudos to Goldsman for the screenplay. The acting was good, the storyline engaging and the plot twists well handled. All in all, I have to give this film 9 out of 10; being that there can only be so many films that rank as a 10 and this is just shy of that level of perfection in my mind.Please, get off your high-Christian-horses and understand that this movie and book were not attacking anything. They are works of fiction based on a legend that has been around since the 12th century. Do some research (just a little) and you will find that there are numerous books available regarding the knights templar and the secret that they protect. Most of the theories are a stretch and may be considered sacrilige if you are too touchy, but if you look at this subject as a study of history, you will find that it is an extremely interesting subject.THE MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT! I will buy it on DVD. I hope for Angels & Demons to be done soon. But, I guess that will create more unnecessary hysteria from christians who cry blasphemy without reading the books first. Ah, so what, If The DVC was this good, Angels & Demons will have to be great.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I mean crap, c)was able to recognise mirrored writing and word ""APPLE"" one page before the characters did figure it out, and that's saying something as I am not a native speaker (just look how dodgy is this comment). To do it some credit I can only say that this is not the worst book I have red (still may be the worst among those I have actually finished reading).To cut it short: For me it is a feeble, but reasonable MOVIE on it's own right, it is the weedy BOOK that gives it a bad connotation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's good,"OK I know it's a long movie based on a book that has a lot of theory in it but I say u give it a shot! I mean,I do know it might not be action packed as in huge car chasing,gun fire once every 2 min or bombs going off every once in a while but the movie is very well made in my opinion and for the history,mystery and religion fans ,for those who like intelligent movies this movie is the right thing. Not to mention that it has some great actors in the main roles : Tom Hanks ,Audrey Tatou,Jean Reno,Ian McKellen and others should be proof enough that this is indeed a good movie. What I don't know is if it's best to read the book first or see the movie.There are some advantages to having read the book first because some passages and explanations are missing from the movie and it would have probably been impossible to introduce them anyway. I believe that Ron Howard is a good director and he does have experience with movies based on books,biographies or historical events . Also I feel that the movie should not be judged by people in order of their religious beliefs, as some tend to, because the author of the book and the ones who made the movie are not making you believe in their theory ,they just want to create a good story ,with an interesting plot based on some scientifical research that may or may not be fact. The book is in the ""FICTION"" category and so is the movie and I simply can't understand why some form opinions(good or bad ) even before seeing it or reading the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The marvelling mystery of religion,"After a suspicious murder at the Louvre, Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) and detective Sophie Neveu (Tautou) are on the run whilst they attempt to uncover the mystery of the Holy Grail.Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code broke barriers with audiences all over the world for its unashamed approach to religion and the concept of what the Holy Grail truly is amongst the ongoing battle between Opus Dei, The Church and the Priory of Sion. Brown certainly has sparked hefty debates but a film adaptation was always inevitable and when released, it caused as much as a storm as when the book was released.The storm that came with this in 2006 was an ashamed feeling of disapprove for the way director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman approached this astonishing story. This was banned in numerous countries for its strong opinions and depictions of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene but the uproar came for the film itself. Badly made, unfaithful to source material and atrociously acted and directed, Da Vinci fell into the category of the world's worst blockbusters. Personally, amongst all the negativity, I rather enjoyed watching two fine actors looking to solve a delicate mystery.There is no doubt that whatever your beliefs, the book is well scripted with a sharp and intriguing motive to keep you hooked right till the shocking finale. Even the long winded debates were interesting as we learnt of different groups in Christianity and the film took all the heavy ideologies onboard in an attempt to portray the book as was written.At two and a half hours, this film somehow leaves out a vast majority of debated conceptual significance but the importance is all relative come the end. For someone who enjoyed the book, I find the simple explanation as to why this movie ""failed"" is that it leaves out this hefty amount of debate.Tom Hanks was criticized for his blunt performance and sadly, the hype was right. There was no spring as there was in Big, no drama like in Cast Away. From the book, it seemed Langdon was a more spirited soul that exuded adventure but there is something lacking here. Tautou is buoyant and necessarily silent in all the right places gives a good pairing along the way with Hanks; one of the final scenes exceptionally sentimental.Ron Howard, who was also slated, delivers an unsurprising style of mystery. His continuous use of close shots for unsurprised expressions do nothing to help the feel of the film, which means the reliance is all on the plot, which is enjoyable and still exciting.Yes, it isn't the book but as with the Harry Potter series for example, we all came to our own conclusions and drew up our own imagination so it was never going to be perfect. Da Vinci Code is a good film with a strong conceptual plot that generates debate and excitement.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Solemn and gloomy.,"""The Da Vinci Code"" was OK. It wasn't a great movie and I don't think the book could be made into a great movie. The book was too much about ideas, word games, anagrams and puzzles that are better read than seen. The movie suffered from too much dialog used to explain the plot. Movies are visual and time taken for long swathes of dialog tends to be boring. In this movie Ron Howard chose to fill the exposition periods with many jump shots and extreme close-ups that I found irritating. In fact the movie is filled with jerky cuts and extreme close-ups. Given the lure of the locales used in the movie I expected to see some nice shots of the Louvre and old cathedrals but what I got was some quick overall establishing shots then it was back to the extreme close-ups and jerky camera. Why make a big deal about where the movie was filmed and then hardly use the setting. Most of the shots in the Louvre could have been done in my family room. Put some old painting on the wall with the actor's head in front of it and presto a museum shot. I disliked the look of the movie. It was very dark and gloomy and the active camera work tended to be irritating. The latest trend in movies is to have a very mobile, jerky camera maybe used to add interest to an otherwise boring scene but for me it detracts from the scene and cheapens the movie. If you need a mobile camera to keep the audience entertained maybe you should rethink the scene. Many, many, many wonderful movie scenes were filmed using a static camera where the actors created the interest not the motion. Tom Hanks was miscast. I like his work but he is best as an everyman caught up in extraordinary circumstances not as a supposed expert who looks mostly befuddled. Audrey Tautou was OK. She is attractive and did a competent job but there was no spark in her performance. Ian McKellen was the best thing in this movie and scenes containing him were highlights. The rest of the cast was competent and forgettable. Given the hype of the book this movie could never live up to the expectations. Unless my watery coke got turned to wine or I was levitated out of my seat the movie would have been a let down. I read the book, ( a good airplane book, not at all great literature), and I wonder if the movie would have been better watched cold. I based my rating on the movie alone since most movies made from books are a disappointment. I would have probably been more entertained if the story line was discovered as the movie unfolded instead of being known and anticipated. It's worth a watch but it is flawed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What happens when you approach to the deepest secrets of the Catholic Religion?,"This is a movie of 7 stars based on a 10 stars book.This great novel has been constructed all with real historic characters, real places and real pieces of art, but the events are fictitious. What makes you feel a movie in which your religion basis are questioned?, well, for me as catholic, it made me open my eyes, and finally love more the faith and ethical values of it. The historical data of the life of Jesuschrist can have been manipulated by men in past years, but the feeling of having a more human Christ as a basis of our religion is beautiful.The movie is the story of Robert Langdon, an expert in symbols (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist (Audrey Tatou) in an investigation about the murder of the Louvre's museum curator; these events start a quest trough codes, symbols, clues that are meant to resolve one of the most uncovered and deep secrets of the catholicism. The polemic facts shown here to the religion and specially to the Opus Dei have been matter of large discussions, research and opinions after the book was published.This movie is far from the quality of the book, and some parts of the book are changed, it could have been a better movie, maybe if a different director had took the challenge. But taking these polemic subjects to the screen is memorable, for a time when you have to open your mind, and hold to the really important things of life.Tom Hanks has a very bad acting, Audrey Tatou does bad too and Jean Reno is pretty normal, Ron Howard directing is terrible!I recommend that if you haven't read the book, then don't watch this movie, because it can spoil it. But after that, watch the movie, so you can place visually in the art pieces, places, churches and all the things that you constructed in your mind while reading.7 star for this movie, great locations, filming and composition of the characters, but lack of heart and passion to go deepest in the subject, and for not achieving the level of an incredible book.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

an OK achievement in a book-to-screen adaptation,"OK first of all I read Dan Brown's book and actually had a great time while at it. I don't consider him a great book writer but he certainly knew how to keep me interested and entertained, and for that I give him credit. I don't want to get into the whole Christianity thing that's going around the movie's plot, as I feel that it is a fiction novel and an intriguing theory, regardless of how offensive it may sound to some people (it is one's right to free speech, isn't that what everyone was shouting at the danish cartoon terrorists?). Anyways (sorry for drifting away) the movie stays true to the book's story most of the time, changing only a couple of minor details that won't really matter in the long run. The whole plot seems very compressed tho as there is a lot to go trough and not a lot of time to do so. This results in some underdevelopment of most of the characters, and there's a feeling of shallowness to them, as much of their background is rushed trough in the middle of the action. Also some lines from the book have been forced into the script, resulting in a couple of poorly acted scenes, but other than that all main actors did a very good job, specially Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen. All in all it's a cool movie, despite of all the flaws. If you haven't read the book, and don't take the whole religious thing too seriously, give it a try, it's far from being a bad movie.

Finally an Intellectual Film,"After so many mindless films full of sex and violence it astounds me that there is so much objection to one that provokes thought and further study of religion. As others have said, it is FICTION, it is a THRILLER. It is ENTERTAINING.I think Da Vinci Code is thought provoking and very intelligently done.Only the history that is fact is presented as fact, and what is not fact is presented as THEORY, with the exception of the bloodline of Christ, which is of course the point of the film and book. The book and film both give us a look at what it might be like if this theory were true. And it could be. There is nothing to prove or disprove it. It's just a theory and Dan Brown isn't the first to think of it. It also isn't the first film that blended history with a little artistic license.Oh and yes, I am a Christian. I am not offended. I would be very disappointed if the talent of these actors, this director and this writer can be overlooked because people can't handle a little controversy. I was thrilled with both film and book.

not so much...,"while i respect the leading comment about this film, i have to say we walked out after 1.5 hrs- 45 minutes later than we had first discussed leaving. I respect Ron Howard and Tom Hanks very much, and I adore Ian McKellan, but it seemed such a waste of talent here. Admittedly, we have been saturated with the History Channel's renditions of Beyond, Behind, Over, and Around ""the Da Vinci Code"" and I believe this is why we felt this movie was God Awful. The acting is wooden and stilted, and the fact that everything is explained in cue-card style is annoying. I realize there are those who have not read the book and may not have cable, and perhaps to them there is a modicum of curiosity. But to the 40 million who bought the book (not counting those they lent it to) it is tiresome and pedantic and pedagogical and dull. My husband fell asleep, and I could not help throwing up my hands in dismay. Even the rote explanations were tiresome. While I respect being faithful to text, there comes a time when one must forgo the banality of recitation. Just before we decided to leave the theatre ( a $30 waste to us) I said ""maybe the action will start and he won't ask or explain anything else"" and boom... a rote and long winded discussion of something I already knew! again, I believe much of my problem derives from saturation with information re: the premise, but regardless, I felt the talent was wasted to make a plodding replica of an intriguing idea.

Dodgy Da Vinci???,"In a packed cinema (it is opening weekend)I waited in anticipation of THE summer blockbuster. Having witnessed several adaptions before after reading the book (Potters all, American Psycho, blah blah) I wondered what the afternoon would hold in store. Especially as I found the book extremely entertaining and a definite page-turner.The store (unfortunately)was replete with a large helping of average. The practically catatonic audience were only stirred to the occasional titter raised by Sir Ian McKellan, who clearly decided that he was going to get in a bit of early practise for panto season. The normally elegant and alluring Audrey Tatou looked decidedly uncomfortable most of the way through, and Tom Hanks bore a puzzled look all the way through the film, even when he wasn't deciphering a puzzle. He just does not fit at all. Perhaps he was working out whether he's going to pick up an Oscar nomination or maybe he'd left the stove on? Only Jean Reno, Alfred Molina & the superb Paul Bettany as Silas (Yes, I know Opus Dei don't have monks) looked as if they were giving it their full attention.The film is decidedly flabby somewhere and in definite need of a visit to the gym. Which aspect (be it director, screenplay, editor, leading man etc.) I shall leave up to you. If the execs decide they want another Brown conversion, perhaps the slightly better 'Angels & Demons), then they need to look seriously at some personnel changes, if they want it to do justice to the page turners that Brown produces.I'm sure it will make the money; it's just a shame that in so many aspects it falls flat.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What on earth was that!,"I just came back from the movie. HORRIBLE! Sure, it's not among the worst movies, but when you have heard and read so much about a movie, you expect it to be at least at a decent level. But this one really sucked. I don't think I've seen a movie of this standards (world-famous, high-budget, starting ticket pre-sales a week before the premiere) executed so badly and giving the impression that everybody was in a hurry to finish the shooting, that it didn't matter how bad the scene was, they wouldn't bother re-shooting it to get a better result.It was also a pity seeing well-known actors, supposed to be of very high standards, acting so badly. It was really disappointing for me, I hope it was because of the hurry in which they were to finish shooting. I couldn't also expect a worse direction, which was unfortunately prominent throughout the whole movie.Not having read the book, I thought the whole scenario was based in some good ideas, but in the whole it nearly made you laugh. But I guess I could attribute this as well in a very very bad direction, which made each scene seem as emerging from a cheap comedy.P.S.

"Certainly interesting,and fairly engaging. It's only hindrances are is,it's too talky at points.","The Da Vinci Code is a film,I expected to dislike,mainly due to my lack of interest in the subject,but to my surprise,despite it's over length,The Da Vinci Code managed to satisfy me for the most part. It's not that I don't believe in god,cause I actually do quite a bit,it's just the whole subject really didn't seem to keen for my interests. The film is very low key for the most part,keeping the action and suspense to a minimum,focusing more on, the plot and dialog. While that isn't necessarily a bad thing,I did however,want them to get on with it a couple of times. The locations are absolutely beautiful,as are the set pieces,it created a nice atmospheric type mood to the film. I had heard how Tom Hanks was miscast as Robert Langdon,and how he played it too straight. I thought he was a key component to this film,he and Audrey Tautou shared chemistry and charisma together. The film itself is quite confusing sometimes,and hard to follow|The twist at the end came out of nowhere for me| but I managed to find The Da Vinci Code,quite the interesting time waster. I don't think it's a film that deserved to make well over 200 Million at the box office,but it was a decent film.Performances. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of all time in my opinion,but I was a bit worried,due to the criticism of the reviewers. Thankfully to my relief,he came through as always,with his special brand of charm and undeniable charisma. He was the main component to making this film work,he gave a sly show. Audrey Tautou started off rather mediocre,but got better once the film got going. She's classy,with the looks to boot,I enjoyed her performance. Ian McKellen is superb here. You can't take your eyes off of him,whenever he's on screen,not only that,some of his banter with Tom Hanks, are some of the film'best scenes. Jean Reno is pretty good as the bulldog type cop,he did fine with what he had to do. Paul Bettany's performance as Silas,may come across as over the top to some. I however found it to be mesmerizing,and thoroughly creepy at times. Alfred Molina& Jürgen Prochnow have small roles,but as always add some class to it.Bottom Line. The Da Vinci Code isn't something,I'd wanna sit through again,I don't think,but it certainly passed the time amiably.

Don't see the movie if you haven't read the book,"Do not watch the movie if you have not read the book! If you do, you'd be jipping yourself of the better of the two. Out of five stars, I give ""The DaVinci Code"" movie a three and a half. The movie, in general, is enjoyable to watch. The first 30 minutes can seems almost a blur, as many events go by really quickly. People who have not read the book will probably be like ""What what what? What's happening?"" I find the movie enjoyable bcuz it's nice to see things that you've made up in your imagination come to life visually. I would have liked to see a bit more chemistry between Langdon and Sofie. In the book there's this unspoken attraction between them that is not portrayed in the movie. I kinda missed that sexual tension, not that it takes anything in particular away from the movie. The ending of the movie, however, is actually better than the ending of the book, which kinda leaves you like ""ahhh!!!!!"" Also, there are some things that are shown in the movie, but not explained, like the very graphic sex rite. People who have not read the book may think it was a quick pornographic scene to make sure you're awake. The definitely needed to be more of that characteristic Dan Brown elaboration and explanation. In conclusion, the movie is worth seeing only if you've read the book. If you have already read the book, go see the movie. It's not something you'll have a carnal urge to see again, but it's just nice to see some of the scenes in the book come to life on a screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Catholic Church's worst nightmare, Cracking the ""Code"" reminds me of a long, boring history lesson that dreads on and on...","**1/2 Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Alfred Molina. Directed by Ron HowardAfter all the buzz and people scurrying about to get their hands on Dan Brown's copy of ""The DaVinci Code"" and skim through each page exasperating at it's wonder. I for one have not read the book so I won't continuously talk about it in comparison but what I do have to say is, if the movie is anything like the book I won't be reading it very soon. As was everyone, I was excited about Ron Howard's adaptation and teaming with his producer-pal Brian Grazer, how could they fail?Robert Landon (Hanks) an ingenious professor in the art of symbols is called away to investigate a murder in the (gorgeous) Louvre. With Sophie Neveu (Tautou) helping him along the way, they may find a secret leading them to the paintings of Leonardo DaVinci. Which may in turn shake down the forever truth on Jesus Christ and Christianity. As a cop (Reno) tries to take him down for the murder inside the Louvre, Langdon seeks aid from his aging pal (McKellen). Together they try to spring the trap and discover the truth or just crack the code.I was indeed disappointed by ""DaVinci Code"" I was mislead and may have misread the trailer. Most of the scenes, not including the ones with DaVinci's artwork, dragged on and on with no end. The movie was a little boring and not worth the buzz let alone the 2 hours and 30 minutes of Church gossip.

Symbols are a language that can help us understand the past,"Little did Robert Langdon know that he would be defining his quest when he stated:""Understanding the past determines actively our ability to understand the present. So how do we sift truth from belief? ... How do we penetrate years, centuries of historical distortion to find original truth? Tonight this will be our quest.""Jacques Saunière (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is killed for a secret. He leaves a mysterious message for Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). Langdon and Saunière's granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) become partners in a hunt for the Holy Grail. But time is running out for them as they are being hunted down by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) for murder. Whom can they turn to for help? Maybe Sir Leigh Teabing (Brilliantly played by Ian McKellen.)This film relies heavily on the viewer reading the book before viewing it. Sometimes they go out of their way to follow the story. At other times, we get a Ron Howard interpretation of Dr. Robert Langdon and his amazingly distracting hairstyle. Other than that, it is better than not having a movie at all. And as with all formula stories, it is always the last person you would suspect.The extra features can get a little boring as they keep repeating the same thing over and over in sound-bite form. They keep talking about people that never made it on the film but never say that these people are or show their tryouts.This is a beginning of a series of films based on the series of books by Dan Brown.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty Good Thriller,"I never read the book but found the movie to be quite entertaining. An interesting mix of fact, fiction, and speculation. The controversy presented was nothing new to me. I am troubled by the reaction to by people who are not only unwilling to ever question or challenge their own beliefs but also would censor the rest of us as well. If you are interested in learning more about telling fact from fiction in both the movie and Christianity in general I would recommend the books ""The Lost Scriptures: Books That Did Not Make It Into the New Testament"" and ""The Nag Hammadi"" an English translation of some of the gospels suppressed by the church.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not a masterpiece but not a disaster either, Da Vinci Code will leave you entertained...and thinking","Every single time that religion is depicted on film, there will be a problem and plenty of controversy behind it. It happened with Dogma years ago, Passion of the Christ not too long ago, and now with The Da Vinci Code. Now, apparently, I totally missed the memo that I was supposed to thrash this film to no end because it's confusing, boring, repetitive, and a written catastrophe of epic proportions. The Da Vinci Code is far from that; it is nowhere near as a bad as critics say it is. While the writing is different from the book (what book-to-film adaptation isn't?) and the directing is a bit flawed, this is still an entertaining murder mystery that requires an open mind and a will to receive a plethora of background information that will be revealed throughout the lengthy movie. It is rather obvious that critics and most of the public were ready to fail this motion picture from the moment the title is revealed.While it still isn't as shocking or as much of a page-turner than the original work, its Howard's fear of a backlash that results in this being different from Dan Brown's instant best-seller. Like Ron Howard's critically acclaimed Best Picture winner A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code frays away from shocking even more in order to avoid a recoil that will result in fewer people watching it. The weakest part of the movie is the writing and the pacing, which is what keeps it away from being an excellent film yet gives it potential in becoming an eventual box office success-turned cult hit (The Matrix). Anyone expecting an accurate description of the book will leave disappointed, even though some of the differences are actually pretty minor, and some actually result in the movie being a bit better. Lack of romance in the movie is a breath of fresh air as it goes against the average drama that needs to throw in some random love story in between the carnage. But, the first part of the film is built up way too slow, too much dialogue and pointless trivia can be found all over the place within the first half hour.Pacing is ruined because of this. Clocked in at over 145 minutes, The Da Vinci Code has the potential of giving you that nice, long nap that you've needed. Fortunately for us, the pacing totally picks up in the second stage, when the two main characters run into a crucial character, Sir Leigh Teabing. After they meet, the movie picks up and does not let go except for a few moments of slowdown. Ironically, the best action sequence involves a short yet satisfying drive towards incoming traffic while avoiding the enemyin the beginning of the movie. But, don't expect to just sit there and watch, thinking is required, learning is required, and so is the fact that this is all fiction and in no way is trying to question your faith. Actually, The Da Vinci Code does not question or bash any religion, it is an obvious fictitious tale. But when a thing such as God and Jesus is questioned, no matter what the circumstances are, we will have chickens with their heads cut off gawking obscenities at the body of work.It is about Faith against Fact, Fiction against Non-Fiction, Science against Christianity. This is the sort of stuff questioned constantly in the hit show ""Lost,"" but it is presented in a more underlying manner, which is how it avoids the smoking gun of the public. Da Vinci on the other hand, is not afraid of such a touchy subject, even though Ron Howard obviously is. There is an entire portion of the book left off the movie, just so that it doesn't add to the negative hype. Another reason why The Da Vinci Code the movie failed a little is because Howard also underestimated the intelligence of the audience, as his clue-leaving skills from A Beautiful Mind sadly results in the majority of the public figuring out the plot twists before they happen.If there is a reason to watch this movie, it is certainly for the acting. Tom Hanks though, he really couldn't make his character that interesting, as hard as he tried. Robert Langdon is not that memorable a person, he is just another person jumbled in a religious mess. His assistant throughout the film is Sophie, played by unknown actress Audrey Tautou, whose previous works are mostly foreign movies. The best performances come from the supporting cast, especially the unrecognizable Paul Bettany as the amazingly creepy and psycho monk whose views on God and whatnot is just scary. Sir Ian McKellen also shines as the friendly and intelligent Leigh Teabing. Other notable performances come from Alfred Molina, and Jean Reno. The acting here is above and beyond the average summer flick, and runs this movie when the writing is running out of gas and Howard is taking a break from leaving obvious clues.Bottom Line: Risky, but not risky enough. Decent, but not decent enough. While it is not a horrible disaster, it does stand just a few steps above mediocre because of a few flaws here and there. A different director could have been better, and a better writing staff could have quickened the pace of the movie and also cut back on all the worthless dialogue that happens from time to time. We do have some Oscar-worthy performances here though, and we do have some beautiful, beautiful scenery to marvel at. While the Indiana Jones movies are much better in terms of hunting for religious artifacts, this movie isn't as bad as what the bitter critics have been showcasing as. The Da Vinci Code: Enter with an open mind, leave entertained and ready for discussion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Poorly executed with no payoff... a waste of time,"The tension in this film is so clumsily handled that often times Howard gives himself away before he intends to, the brief edge-of-your-seat moments are ruined by obvious hints at was is to come next and by long digressions into seemingly irrelevant information. Alternately, the character development seems to be an afterthought. Back stories are handled as absurd flashbacks that, when the film finally comes to fruition, actually have little or nothing to do with the trajectory of the story. For instance, Tom Hank's character, Robert Langdon, is claustrophobic, but he spends most of his time in wide open church spaces or in the comfort of Leigh's château. His claustrophobia only acts as an artificial attempt at tension in a couple of scenes on planes and elevators, but it has not significant effect on the outcome of any of the supposedly thriller-moments. As for Paul Bettany's character, Silas, Howard has cast him in the role of a ghost... again. Perhaps Howard doesn't know what else to do with him other than make him into some caustic phantasm that wasn't meant for this Earth. And if that isn't bad enough, near the end of the film he actually declares, ""I am a ghost"" just in case you didn't get it. I'm afraid that Howard is a one trick pony who revisits glowing letters from A Beautiful Mind because he simply wasn't equipped to direct this film.I myself went and saw this film out of curiosity having no real penchant for the book, but an interest to see how Tautou and Hanks could handle a thriller with so much buzz and controversy surrounding it. Don't waste your time, even though I didn't expect to love it, I certainly wasn't prepared for how clumsy and boring it turned out to be. Tautou is far more appealing as French shut in with an overactive imagination and Hanks more charming as a slightly dim southerner with a heart of gold.

I've read the book (lucky of me that I borrowed it from someone) and I hoped Howard was going to make an improvement out of it or even make it somehow more bearable, but nothing!

A lot of the actors were on autopilot though, namely Hanks and Reno. Bettany and McKellen put in good, solid performances.Some things were just a bit convenient to me, not to mention one or two plot holes but I really can't be bothered going into them here. I also don't understand the controversy here - did the Church whine regarding the first and third Indiana Jones movies?Anyway, there were one or two moments where it seemed like the end but it continued for just a little longer, and character development was somewhat thin but not completely amiss.All in all, not a waste of a night out, a definite critic-proof movie, although more of an OK thriller than a revelatory, iconic piece of work.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Da Vinci Code - don't do it!,"Where to start.....For those of you that just want to get a quick impression of the movie without having to read a full commentary, I will start by saying that it is truly one of the most God-awful (no pun intended!) movies I have ever seen - perhaps with the exception of the Julian McMahon 'erotic' movie Magenta (but then air guitar music is always a sign of a bad movie!). At no point throughout the pain-staking two and a half hours of the movie, does Ron Howard capture the atmosphere of the book. In true Ron Howard style he steers away from delving into any dark territory, preferring to capture every scene with an air of lightness - which may also explain the (mis)casting of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Tom has this Harold Bishop quality (an aging wobbly-cheeked jolly fellow from Ozzie soap Neighbours - for those of you who aren't familiar with this fab TV masterpiece!) about him which is completely misplaced for the portrayal of a character such a Robert Langdon, who is described as such an intellectual, stiff upper lip kind of man with a much sterner and deeper voice also than that of Mr. Nice Guy Tom Hanks. Having said that, Audrey Tatou made Tom Hanks look great. As much as I loved her in Amelie, she was terrible in this movie, as she delivered each and every one of her lines completely flat! (which is probably more a reflection of the crap dialogue the actors were given to work with, than the actors' own abilities) It seemed as though Audrey Tatou (and the rest of the actors for that matter) was holding the book below the frame and just reading her lines directly from it, which also says something for the movie's adapted screenplay, which seems to have been forgotten in a desperate attempt to pump the movie out as quickly as possible - rushed casting, rushed screenplay - the only thing that wasn't rushed which could have been was the damn movie, which dragged so terribly! The dialogue in the movie appears directly from the book, with seemingly no attempt to adapt it for the big screen - lesson 1.01 - what works in a 600 page book does not necessarily work in a 2 and half hour movie - having failed to appreciate this lesson the dialogue is often cringe-worthy and endlessly expository. Had Ron Howard focused more on capturing the sentiment and tone of the book, then perhaps it wouldn't have been necessary to have the actors spew endless pieces of dialogue, as a result of which the viewers may have been spared of Audrey Tatou's painful delivery! As a side-note, Sophie Nevue would never use the word ""kid"", nor would Robert Langdon say ""wow"" - it seems therefore that the vain attempts at adapting the dialogue in the book totally missed the mark anyway! I could potentially go on forever, but as the movie accomplished that and I'm still shattered from the experience I will spare you + I have already wasted 2 and a half hours of my life watching the monstrosity and so I am now ready to close that chapter! On one single positive note, Ian McKellen was fantastic yet again - but then that guy could make 2 hours of buttering bread look good! So in summary, spare yourselves (and your pennies) - enjoy the book and avoid the movie at all costs!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Con Hid Vice, Det","It was utterly predictable an outcome - a much anticipated screen adaptation of Dan Brown's indeed horribly written, but quite entertaining (and even somewhat thought-provoking - quite a feat for the area of contemporary mainstream entertainment) in terms of its plot, and certainly humanistic in terms of its message, ""The Da Vinci Code"" turning out to be a disappointment. What has become a surprise is the extent of it. Actually, it was an announcement of Ron Howard to become a director on this project that instantly turned a cheerful anticipation into a concerned apprehension. Mr. Howard is commonly known as a conscientious workman, but nothing more than that. While in this case some real creativity was needed. Well, judging by the result, even the director's not quite imaginative craftsmanship seems to have been seriously exaggerated.The way in which the movie is made clearly suggests that its creators assumed that their potential audiences were acquainted with the book. I might be mistaken, but it's immaterial - a good portion of those who wound up as the viewers of this one, if not the overwhelming majority of them, WERE familiar with it. So I wonder if it ever occurred to the creators that they were actually supposed to come up with some idea in order to overcome this unfortunate circumstance? And if you come to think about it there was only one approach that gave a chance to stay faithful to the book and, at the same time, provide people with something which wouldn't reduce their experience to a dubiously entertaining undertaking of getting themselves acquainted with a weather forecast for yesterday.To illustrate this point allow me a brief deviation. For any sentient viewer the ending of M. Night Shyamalan's minor ""ghost"" masterpiece is more than predictable - after all the answer is being delivered in plain words somewhere in the middle of the movie. Nonetheless, the finale with its ""revelation"" works out superbly and is indeed quite overwhelming. It's just that it's rather strikes you with its dramatic than surprising effect. That was exactly the way to go on this occasion.The similar shift of emphasis - enigmas giving way to drama - might have saved this adaptation. Through creating a dense atmosphere, arranging meticulously all elements in every scene, introducing, if necessary, sensible alterations to the original developments, and engaging some real acting it was possible to try to shift accents from mysteries to the dramatic meaning behind their resolutions, characters' feelings about them and gradually transpiring behind each of those events the general message. Thus it was possible to repeat the effect as it occurred in the process of reading of the novel - despite the fact that, strictly speaking, none of those revelations would be something actually new to the audience. Consider, for instance, Mr. Shyamalan's ingenious use of a chain of subplots for deviating our attention in a very organic way from contemplating the obvious truth and creating the perfect emotional landscape which in turn is then used to sweep us away in the end. So it can be said that such an accomplishment was well within the capacities of a mortal. But, obviously, far beyond the abilities of two creative ""corpses"" who teamed up here to write and direct.And , unfortunately, what we are offered instead as a result of their joint efforts is just an idiotic recountal of the novel's well-known events in pictures - obviously meant for those who failed to develop their reading skills. And properly speaking those pictures suck. The performers exchange their lines in a hasty manner which would be more appropriate for a first reading rehearsal. As to Mr. Howard's directing skills in general manifested here they simply seem laughable up to a certain point in the movie. After that point it ain't even funny anymore. Though the director has certainly managed to provide one single contribution to all the original mysteries - when for some profoundly enigmatic reasons decided to make Jurgen Prochnow with his ""a working class hero is something to be"" looks pose as a refined French aristocrat.It also should be mentioned that Mr. Brown had probably made a mistake when he rejected the initial proposition to turn his book into a TV production. Had the material been properly rendered it might simply have exceeded all the reasonable time limitations applicable to a theatrical release. As it is the movie does the same thing - but in terms of its quality. And now what can be said? - A CON HID VICE, DET.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Review,"I was intrigued to see the film even though I thought the book was a real disappointment and a waste of trees and time (you can see my book review here: http://angusabranson.livejournal.com/326531.html Saturday 9th July 2005). I've said for a while that I thought it would be a better film than it was a book (which is something I will rarely say as books give you so much more that is not captured on celluloid) so was interested to see the film despite all my opinions on Mr Browns lacklustre novel.I've also been surprised that the film has been fairly universally panned in the press. I've not seen a positive review of it as yet and many places have called it this years dullest film. I, strangely enough, now find myself defending Mr Browns novel. For starters I guess they haven't read the book. The book is hardly an action thriller. It's a 590+ page book that covers the event of ONE day. The book is slow, the book doesn't give the reader anything real to think about - just leading them from one encounter or discovery of a bit information to another. THE DA VINCI CODE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A FAST PACED FILM!I also find myself flowing against public opinion once again.Public Opinion on the book: Loved It Angus Opinion on the book: "" the book is actually about as controversial and ground breaking as a book as Busted is to Punk rock.""Public Opinion on the film: (So far) Found it boring Angus Opinion on the film: Far better than the book and actually pretty enjoyableYes that's right folks. I, Angus, Hater of All Things Brown ""LIKED"" the film adaptation.And it is an adaptation. They have changed a number of things from the book (as with almost all adaptations) some of which are for the better others of which are not. Maybe because at it's core The Da Vinci Code seems to have been written for the big screen as well as airport lounges. Maybe it's because I prefer wasting a couple of hours at the cinema than several nights reading a bland piece of fiction. In any case I enjoyed the film.Yes, it is slow paced. But, as I mentioned before, anyone who has read the book should be expecting this. The ideas and settings suit the big screen and have been very well handled by Ron Howard (yes, he of Happy Days fame). Tom Hanks does a fine job as Robert Langdon - won't be getting any Oscar nominations for it, but he portrays him well and once again comes across as a good actor - Audrey Tautou (whom I've loved since Amelie) is still sexy and lends Sophie Neveu an added element of charm and sex appeal, Ian McKellen is brilliant as Sir Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany is an excellent Silas (the albino monk).It was odd seeing Alfred Molina playing Bishop Aringarosa as whenever he came on screen I just kept thinking about Doctor Octopus! Jean Reno (who was excellent in Leon/The Professional - depending on which continent you live on) put in a disappointing performance as Captain Fache. I can't really put my finger on it but he just didn't come across as well as he did in the books. This is probably partially because of some changes they made in his storyline.I had to smile at a couple of scenes (mainly street scenes in Paris) as the director must have done some homework because some of the location he uses (that aren't mentioned in the book) are actually fairly important in Templar history. One in particular near Notre Dame :pOverall I was surprised by the film. Despite my views on the novel - and the fact that I feel they changed a few of the good bits in the transition - I found myself enjoying the film and would certainly recommend it to people as long as they like slower paced more thinking films.I can't believe I've actually said good things about this! If you've ever thought about reading the book - don't. Go and watch the film instead. If you want a proper book dealing with the Templars and conspiracy theories go and read the excellent Focaults Pendulum by Umberto Eco instead. That is something that deserves the title of 'Masterpiece'.School Report: B (Ron Howard somehow made a bland book into an interesting film)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An honest movie that does justice to the novel,"I read the novel a month ago and since then had been eagerly waiting for the May 19. A novel-based movie can never be as good as the novel itself. At least I have seen none. Novel has space where locations, thoughts, ideas can be described virtually without any limitation on the number of pages but my friends, this is not the case with the movie. A movie has only limited time and to present the novel in that time is no easy task. With that I would say that Ron has done indeed a great job. I would agree that the choice of the cast might not be the best but he did a great job of making an honest movie that does complete justice to the novel. I would rephrase that Don't try to compare it with the novel but I think Ron presented the big picture and key aspects very well. Locations were amazing. This is not Tom Hanks' best performance neither it is for Audrey but they are not bad. I think the movie has bad rating because of (i) biased audience, (ii) people comparing it with the novel, (iii) people who have not read the novel and could not understand what was happening owing to the fast pace. The overall impact of the movie is superb with the best possible way to film the climax.I would highly recommend this movie. Go, watch and find out for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie,"Great movie! It's a little slow moving but it sets up for future events with ease and tends to go along with the book a lot better than most of the book based movies lately. The character's backgrounds could be better and more vividly described but overall I'd have to say Ron Howard did an excellent job taking the characters from the pages and placing them on the movie screen. The actors that were chosen to play the roles of the characters were almost flawless in how they interpreted a particular character's thoughts, feelings, and personality. Overall I'd have to say that if you have a tough time really following the overall scheme of the movie you should probably just see Over the Hedge instead.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was really GOOD!!!!!,"I thought the movie was Great! After reading all the negative reviews I was afraid the movie was going to be a flop. The book was fantastic and now that I have seen the movie I can say the movie was fantastic too. The acting was good, the movie moved along just like the book and I couldn't see any deviation from the book. Most of the people who came out of the theater before me had only good things to say about it and as I left I heard people telling the next group going in that the movie was good. I still can't understand all the negative hype. I understand the religious issues but in my opinion if you are grounded in your faith, as I am, then this is just an entertaining movie not something to shatter your Christian faith. With that said I would recommend this movie. If you like a good murder mystery then go and see it. But What If????????????????????????",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"So, what's all the flap about?","Look. Dan Brown wrote a mystery thriller. He researched it using some revisionist themes and built it on an earlier novel and it became a best seller. Good fiction always spins yarns on bits of facts and figures and then weaves them into patterns to excite our fancies and footsies. The more fantastic, very often, the greater appeal. In the case of his novel, it worked. But, is this novel based on hard evidence? C'mon. It's a novel. If one takes it seriously as an exposition of esoteric beliefs, arcane knowledge and sinister conspiracies, that is one's problem. Ron Howard made this film because he likes meaty, twisty plots and got a great crew together to do it. Tom Hanks is great, as always, so is the very lovely Audrey Tautou, Paul Bettany is creepy, Jean Reno is intense, Alfred Molina is sneaky and Ian McKellen is slimy. The film is lively, fast-paced, follows the story line of the book and if anyone's offended, that's their fault for making this tale more out than the novel it is. The end product is an entertaining movie and thanks again, Ron Howard, for giving me my money's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ron Howard's THE DA BORING CODE.,"Just when I started to think that Ron Howard was getting interesting with A BEAUTIFUL MIND and the underrated Cinderella MAN he goes back to his old ways of painting by the numbers. Once again, he proves he has no style with this lame duck movie, THE DA VINCI CODE. I never read the book, I had no idea what the story was other than it had religious over-tones and still I wasn't thrilled or surprised for 2 seconds. If the end is supposed to be a twist then I wasn't surprised...it was so obvious. Everything about this movie is mediocre and ordinary, from the dull screenplay to the bland acting (Tom Hanks looks pained and the usually charming Audrey Tatou can't act in English)....And there are fine actors in this film...What happened here?...I don't understand. Maybe it would make a better TV mini series, but as a film it was forced and pretentious without any right to be. Now, Ron Howard seems like a good man, so I don't mean to insult him, but as a director he has no style or imagination. I obviously can't recommend this movie. I'm not at all a god fearing Jesus-freak so I'm not biased in that sense. I guess the only way that I am biased is that I prefer better films. Don't bother with this one unless you feel you must rent it eventually.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

totally dispensable movie,"I read the book, and I liked it very much. So I watched the movie, and I just don't get how they could mess it up like this. There were several scenes which only made sense when you read the book, otherwise they just look totally stupid and seem to connect the plot line which would have had a whole if these scenes weren't there (and they boost the feeling of a stupid action-flick).But worst, probably to strengthen the sympathy for our ""hero"" Langdon, they gave him abilities which -in the book- Sophie had. In the movie, Sophie is reduced to a stupid little girl just asking questions so that someone explains to the viewers what they need to know.To sum it up, for those which didn't read the book, the movie will be unintelligible and look like a stupid action flick with a treasure hunt, but they won't understand what the treasure is and means. Many scenes and decisions made can't be comprehended and the message of the book (may it be right or wrong) is not to be understood.For those who read the book however, the movie will be dispensable, because it doesn't reach the depth of the book and is altered in some really annoying ways (i won't mention cause that would spoil the movie). They did anything to make Langdon look perfect, which in the book he was not. This elevates him (mostly at the expense of Sophia) to a Hollywood-Hero.The story has lost all depth and they made (out of the really extraordinary book) a totally normal, stupid but entertaining treasure-hunt Hollywood action flick without any depth.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Must set some sort of record...,"My God! But this film is dire. Tom Hanks and what's her name could easily be replaced by shop window dummies for all the difference it would make!

At no point did I find myself in any doubt of the outcome, nor did I care about any of the laughably two dimensional characters.One can only suppose that the director and cast all decided 'Well, everyone on the planet has read the book (apart from me apparently) so why bother doing anything more than go through the motions and take the money?'.The only relief is Ian McKellen's having a bit of fun with his not terribly convincing role.Awful - if enough people bother wasting their money going to see it it will surely go down in history as one of the least significant, most boring films ever made - even the soundtrack is mind numbing!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Despite an awful beginning, it's a pretty good movie","Well, another blockbuster rises in a lot of movie rooms spread the world:The Da Vinci Code...As a fan of movies with great investments...of course i ran into a cinema to see that one.. First of all, i'd like to say that i read the book, so my expectations was about a great job, because that story was easy to transport for a movie set...(it's fluid and dynamic...) Talking about the picture, we can see some disappointing things: In the beginning, the story told, was too fast(some people that were watching with me, realized that too),and Tom Hanks, was a little bit confusing in his ""work""...he was a little embarrassed with all that speech, about symbolist and that audience behind him, was disgusting..i have to tell...seems like people taken out of streets that never saw that pictures and opinionated about that..for God sake,they were too superficial... After that,when Langdon(Tom) received an advise asking him to go to Louvre Museum, i felt some insecurity action between Langdon and Fache(Jean Reno)...seems like chemistry was awful in the set... In Louvre action, all things happened too fast, something that was cleared in the book, that never happened in that way...It was like Langdon and Sophie were genius...and somewhere, somehow,they had a mystical power to discover everything that happened there...another time...a superficial sequence... In the bank, things get a little bit better,Langdon and Sophie seemed more connected and with some tenderness between them...Finally the movie become to take off, and begins to satisfy the audience... After that,when Langdon and Sophie searched for Teabing, things get a lot better and the picture, becomes more substantial with all flashbacks about Langdon and Sophie lives'...It seems that director Ron Howard could make himself comfortable after that point... Well, i won't talk about the rest of the movie because i don't want to freak out other people that wants to see, so let's talk about the cast: Tom Hanks-I Think he had a disappointing performance here,he is much better in other movies,and with no time to improvise he seems a little bit robotic...just in last five minutes you see how great actor he is... Audrey Tatou: A lovely surprise...i thought that she won't have ability to act with Tom...but she's much better than he is in this movie...Deep performance...a lot like Sophie in the book... Ian Mckellen:Maybe, the best actor here...got all maniacs of Teabing and transported well to the screen...Excellent..I will see X-MEN:The Last Stand,in some way because of him... Jean Reno:An slightly disappointing performance...i fought he would be better...Maybe next time... Paul Bettany:He is perfect...Great...An Oscar nomination isn't a grievance for this man...All movies that i saw him, he's acting great...Excellent work...He deserves stardom... All other performances were good too,and besides that,they weren't so important...

Movie gave more life to my reading experience of the DVC,"Ron Howard and his cast gave me the chance to have, once again, some of the guttural quivers that I experienced when reading the DVC. It was exciting to see my wife enjoy this thriller as much as I did. Whether or not Jesus has descendants amongst us is not a problem for this one-time Baptist Minister.I find it almost oxymoronish that many must find Jesus to be God for their faith's confirmation. My reasoning is that for Jesus to have been the adequate sacrifice for all human sin, he would have had to be perfectly and literally human. If he were Deity, the sacrifice is totally incongruent.I have written an article that treats a view of Jesus that might be thought provoking for the less timid souls. It is called.

The book and now the film have raised a great interest to the history of Christianity,"Dan Brown's book is a very gripping one. And the film based on it is made in a good quality way with the great actors. I heard that it's not interesting for those who have read the book. No, the film caught me from the very beginning and didn't release me till the end although I've read the book both in Russian and English. Someone wrote in internet that the both of the main heroes are sexless - no sexual feeling aroused between them during the whole plot. But they are dogged by the police, they have to solve one puzzle after another they come from different worlds and the only thing which is united them is the Saint Greal. The authors of the film are also condemned in long and dull lecture about the history of Christianity etc. My husband told me that he would be glad if they told a bit more about all that as he had heard a lot of new things and it was made rather gripping in the film the whole that scene in Teabing's house. And one more thought. How can the book or the film damage the basis of Christianity? They just have raised a great interest to the history of Christianity and to art by the way too. A lot of people try to read more about the subject, to see the pieces of art in original and to know about the artist much more... I liked the film and would advice to see it. The actors are great and the producing is not bad too. Even if the basic idea of the book and the film is absurd (though I don't think so) the authors of the both book and film make us think.

yet another nicely done blockbuster..,"i just had the chance to watch the movie at the Cannes opening, and being in the company of the crew in such an amazing room usually puts you in a positive mood. I was interested, also, because I think i'm one of the few ones that have not read the book! Hey, I do like reading, but tried a few pages and it's really not my style. I thought this little introduction was necessary.So, what about the movie, now? Cinematography is quite stunning - camera movements and sceneries are just beautiful. Editing is slightly conventional, but feeds a good rhythms. Acting is not overwhelming, with the exception of maybe of Bettany - but that's because of the nature itself of the story - a running puzzle-solving thriller. Surprises are frequent (at least if you have not read the book, i guess), only sometimes easy to anticipate. So far, quite good.What really did not impress me, then? Well, the plot is slightly weak - the ""codes"" are not very amazing (actually i found the ""code"" part very disappointing). The history about Opus Day and Priory of Sion (not going to reveal anything about that) is interesting, but the film does not manage to pin it down to its real value, as the action is taking away too much of the attention. The characters are onlt OK, missing some deepness, lacking moments of weakness, ambiguity; really not all-round.All in all, a couple of hours of entertainment, a theory about Church which is worth listening (but please, it's only a movie, don't make too much noise out of it!!!), deceiving enigmas which are more of an excuse to show different nice locations, good actors a little underexploited by only OK characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The lowest point in the movie comes near the beginning and that is but a single line. By the end, you have forgotten this small problem and have moved right along with the story.

Great Disappointment,"I could not wait for this movie to come out. I was so psyched up to see it that I had sleepless nights because of the anticipation! Imagine how I must have felt to finally take my seat in the cinema and having the lights dim...I became so caught up in the thought of the movie that I completely forgot my criticism about the book! When I first read it, I thought ""WOW, what an interesting story! Pity about the predictable ""Goosebumps""-type plot, though."" I had read somewhere that Dan Brown said the film sticks very close to the novel, and boy does it ever! All the people who criticized Chris Columbus for sticking too close to the page for the first two Harry Potter movies have to be very thankful that Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman Didi't have a shot at it. For the most part, The Da Vinci code literally translates the novel from page to screen. That is, they translate the STORYLINE, in my opinion the weakest aspect of the book. The thing that kept me reading late into the night was the interesting codes being cracked and the wonderful intellectual treasure hunts around art and history.Instead, we get the boring, predictable storyline that skips over the code cracking in a ""Bee Season"" type of way. Added to this, we jump so suddenly from location to location that it all just becomes a blur. Don't get me wrong, the pacing could have been quicker, but at least tell us where we are, won't you! The characters were so shallow, even though Akiva Goldsman tried (and failed) fleshing them out a bit. Quite frankly I Didi't care about one of them, except maybe Sophie, but only because I love Audrey Tautou. Tom Hanks was terribly miscast and his funny hairstyle was just plain distracting.I suppose my main quibble with the film is that it was done in a very unimaginative way. This is the sort of novel that needs to be reinvented when being adapted for the big screen. Purists may want to kill me now, but honestly, why watch a movie if you don't get anything new you couldn't get in the book? Other than this, it was quite an enjoyable night out. I Didi't feel I wasted my money, but I really did expect more from (Academy Award Winner) Ron Howard. Although, I would give him another Oscar for managing to make a movie feel RUSHED and SLOW at the same time!!! That takes some doing.And finally, would it have killed the cinematographer to shed a little more light on the wonderful location, the Louvre? I couldn't see any of the paintings, it was so dark!

Just OK,"This is not a great movie and it's not going to win Tom Hanks another Oscar nomination, but I quite enjoyed it. There! I've said it! I enjoyed it. I do appreciate that it's really rather naff to admit to liking this movie, but truly, it's not as bad as the critics made out. I've passed worse time in a cinema on a Friday night after a long tedious week at work. Had I seen it at a time when my brain was functional, possibly I would be less kind.I won't go through the plot again, so if you are one of the ten people on the face of the planet who don't know what it's about, read another review. The story premise is interesting, and ties together some history, lots of myths and many half truths in a way that suggests it could be plausible...maybe. It seems to get people riled up for some reason I can't quite fathom, but then I'm not a practising anything, let alone Christian.I read the book, which I thought was just appallingly written (yet somehow I couldn't put it down...) and I thought the movie stuck to it pretty closely. Probably too closely, as some acknowledgement that the screen and the page are different mediums might have helped the rather leaden dialogue. But the action trots along briskly, the editing is good, and the French actors all did their stuff in a suitably Gallic manner. I rather enjoyed Jean Reno's impersonation of a bloodhound, and Marie Francoise Audollent stood out in a small part. There were some pretty pictures of the Louvre's glass pyramid, and it made me nostalgic to see Lincoln Cathedral (a few miles from where I used to live in England) standing in for Westminster Abbey. Apparently the Abbey wouldn't let them film inside, but Lincoln Cathedral will do anything for money and the Chapter House, as shown here, is certainly worth a visit.As for any controversy - it seemed to me they bent over backwards to be non-controversial, with Hanks character Langdon, and McKellen's character Teabing giving lengthy expositions of balancing opposing views to the point of tedium. In fact, the movie would have been improved by more controversy, not less. Sir Ian was wonderful, worth the admission price alone. Without him, the movie would be very dull and I get the feeling he's had rather a lot of fun with it. But far and away the best reason to see The Da Vinci Code - as opposed to reading it - is because you will be spared Dan Brown's terminally banal prose.Not too bad a movie.

Like The Book ...Good But Not Great,"The trouble with making a movie out of book so wildly popular as The Da Vinci Code is that we all knew (just knew!) it'd have problems. Detractors will lambaste it for the pages of the novel that had to be cast aside for the sake of film time (the movie is still 2 hours and 29 minutes, though) and any changes to characters or plots (all of which have happened.) But when you transfer a book to film, a certain amount of trust has to go to the screenwriters; a level of trust that basically says, ""Please don't screw this up! But give us a good story that'll engage film audiences!"" I've read The Da Vinci Code and I must say that the book was interesting, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I was continually astounded to see it on the best seller list month after month after month. I kept asking myself, ""Did I miss something? Was it really THAT good?"" Maybe. Either way, however, I approached this film with a fairly high level of trepidation. ""Will the movie be over-hyped, too?"" I'm happy to say that this is an adequate film (thus my thumbs up rating.) But I don't believe it'll stay in theaters as long as the book stayed on the best seller lists.The film DOES follow the book surprisingly well. Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He's in Paris autographing his latest book when a police officer approaches and asks him to come to the Louvre. Once there, Mr. Hanks discovers that a murder has taken place. A curator that Mr. Langdon was supposed to meet that night was murdered and his body desecrated. But it appears the dead curator desecrated his own body. But why? Sophie Neveu, a young detective played by Audrey Tautou, arrives at the scene and soon Mr. Langdon's life begins to unravel. Trapped by the French police, a murder investigation in which he is the prime suspect, a secret society of ultra-worshippers known as the Opus Dei, and a group of Templar Knights in hiding, Robert Langdon is quickly whisked into a life of puzzle solving in order to find a secret that could unravel Christianity as we know it.Much controversy surrounded the film before its release. The main controversy was from albinos. Amazingly I heard nothing from this group while the book was out, but now that the film is here, they've emerged from the woodwork. Why? I'll let you all think about that one on your own.There have been complaints, too, that the film is ""too slow to get going"" or that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou gave wooden performances. I didn't see that.I will complain about Tom Hanks in this role, however. I'm sure Ron Howard and he work together comfortably after their previous collaborations from SPLASH to APOLLO 13. But I just couldn't swallow Mr. Hanks as the prime character. There was zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Tautou, and his long hair was well nasty looking (like it needed a good washing.) He's getting up there in age and I think Clive Owen or some other up-and-coming actor would've been a wiser choice. My two-cents",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So dark the con of critics...,"I'm thoroughly confused by the negative reviews this film is getting, particularly from schooled critics. Each to his own, without saying, but the audience at the packed screening I attended appeared to uniformly lap up this terrific thriller. Such a marvelous conceit for a story, and surprisingly well executed by Howard. Are our collective attention spans really so dire that hearty discussion of ideas feels like 'excessive exposition'? There was nothing at all languid about this piece. Howard actually harnessed the visual form to make 'history come alive' as it were. Earth shattering, no. Thought provoking escapism, yes.

But, then again, I guess I didn't let that matter, I threw down my eight and a half bucks anyway, so I can't really complain.I'm with a lot of people in agreement over the casting (or miscasting of the film). I've always enjoyed Tom Hanks' work, and have no impartiality to him whatsoever. He's just not right for Robert Langdon, long hair or no. Same goes for Ian McKellen, another outstanding actor, again though, not quite right. Heads up though for Audrey Tautou. I'll watch her in anything.In the end, was it worth it? Hmmmmmm.......

"""The Da Vinci Code"" Suffers from a Repetitive Narrative","""The Da Vinci Code"" is the third film Ron Howard has directed since his masterpiece ""A Beautiful Mind."" Howard makes no mistake about crossing over to his roots and implementing techniques similar in his Oscar winning film. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is much like John Nash (Russell Crowe) with one big difference; Langdon has no psychological problems that nearly ruin his everyday life and the people around him making him far less sympathetic. Langdon has a phenomenal ability to break codes. He's, supposedly, merely a master of symbols, but when some random guy he's never met writes something that is incredibly insignificant to his life, Langdon cannot only figure out that it's an anagram, but he can break it in a matter of seconds. Who ever said stupid people go to Harvard? This Langdon is a genius and he figures out anything even though he's put in a situation he has never prepared for and is completely new to. As he cracks the codes, Howard uses the same highlighting techniques to show us what he's looking at as he did with John Nash who looked at a bunch of numbers and found a strategic pattern sequence, proving to be ""the best natural code breaker I ever saw."" Well that guy hasn't met Robert Langdon. This guy is so good at breaking codes he can figure out somethings in code in the first place.""The Da Vinci Code"" has potential, but it's also extremely ambitious. Where ""The Da Vinci Code"" struggles is not only with the thrilling chase of finding the truth and the hunting of people who try to expose them, but for the fact that it tries to come off as realistic when it's utterly unrealistic as it relies on a barrage of coincidences and false interpretations of history. ""The Da Vinci Code,"" surprisingly, becomes boring two hours into the film as the quest of Langdon feels unrelenting. We feel the film has come to a rest once we find out the big secret that isn't all that impressive or shocking, but it keeps going and going and going. Not only is it repetitive, but it's long, drawn out, with one chase after another and one guy popping up after another. After about an hour it gets to the point where the entire country is chasing Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu, who somehow always seem to slip past these dumb, bozo-looking cops. In certain parts it becomes extremely ridiculous. For a long two and half hours Langdon and Neveu discover something, then are nearly captured (Sometimes getting caught and pulling a James Bond, and escaping capture), then finding a hiding place to talk about the discovery they found before nearly getting killed. This same act happens about four times. That's the plot for the first 2 hours and 20 minutes. Discovery, chase, escape, talk about discovery, then discover something else, and repeat. Since they never get caught, we get the feeling that they will always trick out, step aside, and out smart the clumsy nation that is after them. This is not at all thrilling and the endless talking is going to put people to sleep even if this stuff is pretty interesting. Some may argue it's not supposed to be taken seriously, but it doesn't come off as fantasy. It comes off as a fantasy trying to be realistic.The best parts of ""The Da Vinci Code"" come from the style, the smart source material, and some of the performances (most notably, Paul Bettany who also popped up in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and gave a very strong performance there). Bettany is incredible and delivers one of the best acting performances of the year as the tortured Silas. Silas, is the man doing Gods will. He's unknowingly killing people for the wrong reasons, but because his church saved him he believes he's doing good. He believes and trust them so much because they reached out to him when no one else would. He even inflicts pain upon himself to serve penance for all things he does for the greater good. He's a mislead soul, lost within the corruption of the powerful. He plays this role to perfection that could have easily gone over the top. He plays it with the perfect balance as he's not too restrained where he's not believable and not too far over the top where he's laughable. Too bad Tom Hanks' mullet is incredibly distracting and the furthest thing I think of when thinking of a Harvard scholar. Hanks is merely average here. The look, style, and cinematography are truly mesmerizing. The flashback sequences are phenomenal and the art direction is on an Academy Award worthy level. There are many different locations in many different cities across many centuries and the look every time has its own feel that adds to the film. The source material is smart and dumb at the same time. There are some historical inaccuracies, but it's a mildly well written script with a lot of great myth and mystery. The material is both a strength and its greatest weakness. There's quite a bit in Ron Howard's film, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" to like, but there's also a lot to hate. A lot more.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
French Agent and American Professor travel as fugitives through Paris on a mission to discover the secrets of an ancient legend.,"The DaVinci code was a solid remake of a thrilling book. It has been held up to a standard far too high for a film of this sort. The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, although a fascinating and exciting novel, is far from a Pulitzer Prize work of literature. Thus, the movie created in its wake, should be held to a similar standard: a mystery thriller. As far as a thriller goes, the DaVinci code is fabulous, on par with many of the motion picture remakes of Stephen King novels. The movie tactfully depicts the author's intricate and captivating novel and is exciting to watch. The DaVinci Code is not an Oscar winning piece, but is that an appropriate expectation? Taken for what it is, a fun, interesting, and exciting journey through history, the DaVinci code is a good film and is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I was expecting more,"I am still thinking about this movie. I truly believe that Ron Howard tried his best to stick to Dan Brown's story, but this cut out his own creativity. Let's start with the acting. Tom Hanks does a decent job (it goes better as the story develops), but he did not have a good partner: in my humble opinion, Audrey Tautou did not do a good job at all. She said in a interview that she was not too excited about the movie when her name appeared on the list of likely actresses to perform Sophie. Well, you can see that in the film. She looks out the picture, saying his words without conviction and with a thick French accent that makes her hard to understand sometimes. She had already done DIRTY PRETTY THINGS (Stephen Frears' film, in English) with good results. The kind of production that DAVINCI was deserved a better training in her English skills, I believe. Maybe Ron Howard is not that good at directing actors, it is the only explanation I can think of, regarding the couple Hanks-Tautou. Tom Hanks tries to do his best. Ian McKellen, wonderful as sir Leigh Teabing. Impressive, Paul Bettany as Silas. Jean Reno is OK, quite natural as a tough French police officer. I loved the flashbacks in the movie. They are definitely an added value. I imagine that Mr. Howard did not have too much freedom to create something of his own based on Dan Brown's book. On one hand, he might have risked of disappointing fans, but also it is true that all the elements (riddles, phrases, signs, symbols, etc.) are intrinsically and intimately related that it would have been a huge mistake to scramble the whole just to change a few details in order to be ""original"". The suspense is good (I had read the book) and you are caught by the intrigue of the story. Anyway, I prefer a literal adaptation to the screen that the disaster that was THE NAME OF THE ROSE. At the end, I imagine that the tissue relating all characters become a little bit confusing for those who have not read the book. I give the film 6 out 10. I also was expecting more. Perhaps a more aggressive direction and going beyond Dan Brown's lines: what about (a scene that I imagined when I read the book) Jesus putting his hand on Marie Magdalene's womb during the Last Supper and saying: ""This is my body... This is my blood...""?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
DaVinci Code is the worst movie ever made.,"DaVinci code is the worst movie ever made. I am hesitant to even call it a movie because it lacked almost everything that is required to make a movie. The book was written poorly I admit (like the fantasies of a pre-pubescent twelve year old) but at least it was interesting.Despite the shocking script, despicable direction and appalling acting there was still something missing from the film. B grade action stars like our friend Michael Dudikoff know more about drama. Maybe it was the fact that the movie is all exposition and no narrative. The dialogue is contrived, conversations are put on solely to drive the limited plot and the liberties the screenplay takes to further the 'dramatic' content turn the story from something that was a plausible theory in the book to absolute non-sense in the film.No member of the catholic church should boycott this film, it will do it for itself.I am slowly coming to the realisation that I can never have my two and a half hours back but who do I write to for my 15 bucks? Here's to the only film that would make a negative box office take if distributors gave back money to unsatisfied viewers.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An opportunity missed,"""The Da Vinci Code"" has been a publishing phenomenon. Even before the film version appeared, the novel had been translated into 44 languages and sold an utterly amazing 40 million copies. Rarely then has a film been so anticipated by millions and then so panned by virtually all the critics. In truth, I had hoped that this would have been one of those very rare occasions when the movie would prove better than the book because the novel contains some interesting plot elements but is appallingly badly written. Sadly I have to record that the critics are right and my hope has been dashed.Tom Hanks, as the American professor of symbiology Robert Langdon, sports a strange haircut and speaks as if he has a cold, while gamine Audrey Tautou, as French cryptologist Sophie Nevue, struggles somewhat with her first English-speaking role and accomplished actor Jean Reno - here playing the policeman in charge of the murder investigation - is underused. Only Ian McKellen, in a rather camp and breathless performance as the Holy Grail expert Leigh Teabing, really impresses.I had thought that the movie might soften the portrayal in the book of the Catholic Church and more especially the Opus Dei organisation and that it would ease back on the self-punishment inflicted by the albino monk Silas, but there is no sparing of Catholic sensibilities here. Indeed the film is remarkably faithful to both the substance and the style of the book - and this is mainly what dooms it to such tedium. The movie, like the novel, has little characterisation, is excessively wordy, and concludes in a limp and most unsatisfactory manner.Director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer can do much better than this (""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Apollo 13""), so I blame Dan Brown. He wrote the book, he was executive producer on the film, and he even supplied a bit of the music and some extra codes. The film look quite good - with location shooting in places like The Louvre - and sounds good too - with music from Hans Zimmer - but it is too long (two and half hours), too dense, and poorly written and paced. In spite of these serious flaws, I suspect that the movie will still do well enough to recoup its considerable investment and will push the novel back to the top of the best-seller lists because so many people have a restless urge to see patterns and meanings and conspiracies even when there are none.",,Anonymous,Mystery
It wasn't bad...It wasn't great.,"I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code but frankly this film didn't pull through. It strayed from Dan Brown's novel more than most people are currently stating. Ron Howard made a serious mistake when he decided to cut out some of the original depth to make the movie. Honestly, I was impressed after I saw it. That may sound odd but I don't think any other director could have done better considering the book was so amazing. It would have been hard to make it any better than this film. Nonetheless I would waste your money on this mistake, read the book instead, it was magnificent. The characters weren't exactly what I'd expected either. I was very impressed with Tom Hanks performance but I was amazed by Ron Howard's depiction of Sophie. He made her seem weak and vulnerable, which just isn't the Sophie Neveu of Dan Brown's novel.Despite these issues if you ever see the film on TV when there isn't anything else on it will be a well spent 2 hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing- A Missed Opportunity,"The problem was always going to be how to get the ideas in the book across to a cinema audience , Howard manages a workman like job of this, but I felt viewers who may not be familiar with the story may have been confused by some of the ""leaps"" made in the explanations.Saying that it is very faithful to the book but Sadly Howard fails to capture the energy and tension of the novel and some of this has to be down to his choice of Hanks as Robert Langdon. Fine actor that Hanks is he just doesn't cut the mustard in this role, The Langdon character in the book comes across as slightly more dashing charismatic and occasionally Heroic , Hanks I'm afraid came across as a bit of a plumb !. Audrey Tautou is excellent and was everything I imagined the character of Sophie to be , Mckellen again does a superb job ,and Paul Bettany tremendous. The Loctaions were superb and Howard uses some techniques he first employed in ""A Beautiful Mind"" .Its amazing how this film just does not capture the spirit and breakneck pace of the novel , which heaped revelation upon revelation on the reader and rather like ""24"" left you wanting more after each chapter.Alas Howard and Hanks really were a bad choice for this film and some the dialog feels rather clumsy. If You haven't seen this or read the Book my advice would be read the book . If you see this you'll wonder what all the fuss is about.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid and entertaining...,"Now I'm one of those people who loves the book mostly for the subject of the mystery.And therefor I simply had to see this movie.So should I make the usual comparison with the book or just review the movie?I always try to make the best of a movie for what it is. And in this case the word ""thriller"" usually is attached to the movie... but as I see it this movie is more of an adventure movie... with a more realistic background than Raiders of the Lost Ark and Tombraider... but the story is still a treasure hunt.The character work is not superficial but not that deep either, some efforts have been made to develop our main characters, but nothing big. This is probably an effect of the clearly much discussed storyline. Silas and Bishop Aringarosa is where Dan Brown himself have made most back story to show their common background...unfortunately this doesn't get as much attention as Sophie Neveu and partly Robert Langdon. But all characters are believable... and Ian McKellen is a joy as Leigh Teabing.I for one misses the story line of Silas and Aringarosa and later Captain Fache... there is a lot of good material in this story... Ron Howard has been able to make Silas a tragic villain for sure but Silas's background and why he suddenly is the loyal servant of a bishop doesn't make it... I would love to have seen more of this... and the line ""I'm a ghost"" could have been used more as to show this difference between his old violent self and the new ""angel"" self. And the last turn of betrayal by Aringarosa and Fache turning his back to Aringarosa does nothing to make Aringarosa seem more human and tragic... he becomes more evil. I can understand why Christian would have something against the movie over the book where he is much more human, they make the church seem much more cold and calculating in the movie.As for story.. it is highly entertaining and well put together. It is actually one of those few movies where we don't end in lose ends. We get a nice closure on most subjects. Akiva Goldsman has been able to write a rather solid script where the important things survives and only useless subjects doesn't make it. we get the story we need, but then again not much more. This is the way a movie work. I feel it is always important to view a book and a movie of the book differently. Some things just needs to be dropped and changed to make it a working movie. And for Da Vinci Code they make it work.The Length of the film is rather long, but I actually forgot it. The pace of the film is not fast but far from slow... we get a lot of information over a short period but the mood of the film is slow, the ""car chase"" from the embassy where the music and the fast pictures make huge contrast is a good example and I sat there impressed i stead of one the edge of my seat. It is a slow fast movie, unlike most movies being fast. But with a lot of fast movies a lot happens to fast and we get to much information and at one point one sits and things ""when is the movie over anyway?"", in Da Vinci I instead was able to just enjoy the movie!Over all this is a solid movie for what it is, not as a mind changing movie, but a highly entertaining movie with a story line that just seems to make people go nuts. A shame actually, for once some people ought to see a movie with out making it all real!It get a 9 from me!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Vastly Underrated,"I'm a writer; I spend most of my leisure time either reading or writing. Frequently when I compare an original literary work with a successive motion picture, I often fall into the purist view that the book is better. There have been some exceptions to this rule: Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" direction is better than Tolkien's writing skills (and I'm a Tolkien fan, if you can believe that) and Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"" is somewhat better than Reverte's The Club Dumas.In my opinion, Dan Brown is a mediocre writer who discovered pay-dirt with an innovative, controversial story. His writing skills are not literary, but close to dime store level. He's passable, yes, but definitely not in the league of moving and profound writers as Norman Mailer, K Vonnegut, or Thomas Mann. The novel, The Da Vinci Code, and it's prequel, Angels and Demons, are fast reads and fun. They deliver an escape while you are sitting on a subway on rush hour.With the over-hype of the novel, we suddenly have the inevitable attempt at a motion picture. Usually these revisions are mediocre (at best) or fall by the wayside. Yet, in the motion picture ""The DA Vinci Code"", we have a visual depth that the literary relative of it falls completely short of.I watched the motion picture, enthralled by the visual artwork and the intricacies of plot. It was soberly done, even with the controversial casting of Tom Hanks in the lead role. Hanks is usually (to me) overbearing and self-important in his later roles, and he doesn't stop here, however, he is believable - more believable than the Robert Langdon from the books. Tom Hank's Langdon is smart, reserved, and appears to be exactly an intellectual in reality; the Langdon in the novels comes off more as a McGuffin to move the story along, rather than experience it.I'm a big Gandalf fan, but I'm not a Mysterio fan, so my reception of Ian McKellen's performance in this movie is neutral. I think he's interesting here, but somehow more aloof and somewhat more of the X-Man villain than the wise wizard type. Therefore, his performance at least comes off somewhat wooden.The cinematography is enough to enhance the shots, but are somewhat lacking (in a minor consideration). The exotic locales are hard not to keep a deep aesthetic luster, even if they'd been shot with a VHS camcorder and sent in to ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". But I think you get my point.The movie is cerebral and smart, the book a puzzle with gimmicks. Don't go into the theater as the novel fan, but as someone who enjoys a movie to stand on it's own. You'll find this motion picture stronger and more satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good job Tom...,"The movie The Da Vinci Code was a good dramatization of the novel The Da Vinci Code.

An Intelligent man that knows his theology, applies his knowledge to decode the Da Vinci code. wow. Great rising action to fulfill an even better climax and is rewarded by an excellent ending. What more can you ask for?All in all, it was a great script lead by an even better cast. Cinematography was almost Identical to my imagination when I read the book. I think it was had the potential to reach a very diverse range of audience. those who do not believe so, all I have to say is its under the FICTIONAL section. So just take the story for what it is, which is a story plain and simple. Don't over analyze. Its simply not fair to the cast or the director.Audience prepare yourselves.

Bad Novel Awful Film,"While it doesn't appear to make sense for somebody who loathed the book to watch the film, I did decide to keep an open mind given the cast. What a mistake! The book's bad enough, not because of its ""controversy""; I'm not religious at all, and I actually find the concept the book goes into quite interesting. However the novel, if you can call it that, is such a poorly-written ham-fisted attempt at a trashy pulp fiction mystery with one of the most obvious ""twists"" in literary history, you'd actually feel sorry for Dan Brown if he wasn't so filthy rich.The sole reason the book has gained popularity is because it's so easy to read, and the reader can feel intelligent and thus good about themselves because of this. Much like U2 is a band for people who don't really like music, The Da Vinci Code is a book for people who don't really like reading. A bookcase with this novel in is otherwise bare.So onto the film. I thought maybe they'd be able use one of the book's many weaknesses (its lack of any sort of depth) as a strength if they were adapting it. Not at all, the wooden acting from people who should know better; the style over substance cinematography, the useless flashbacks - it was like an episode of Lost but slightly LESS believable.No doubt this will sell loads and loads of tickets, because today supposed controversy is much more important than plot, acting and entertainment.

Absolutely a Must-See!,"I was honored to have seen Da Vinci Code on the 19th of May, the first evening of its release. I was thoroughly titillated by the dialogue's ability to bring forth an interesting story. For the life of me, I cannot fathom all of these 'critical"" remarks and spoilers. The movie carried me along, without one boring moment. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the book (which I found to be a disappointment, though not surprisingly so. I had read Angels and Demons, Brown's earlier book, having been pulled into that largely because of my interest in the theme of dastardly doings at The Vatican. I'm afraid it's a matter of an attraction one sometimes feels for what one experiences as an atrocity in the modern world -- a vortex of unchecked power reaching across our physical and spiritual lives. I've escaped intellectually but still have a fascination for how someone would portray darkness within this institution and get away with it. Ron Howard did a perfect job of it. I take exception with criticisms of casting. Tom Hanks surprised me in being well-suited to the role. I liked the portrayal of Robert Langdon as less than a super hero who (refreshingly) doesn't end up screwing the female supporting /lead. The lack of special effects that could have overcome a thought-provoking story was impressive and well-judged. I fear that we are facing a generation of critics who grew up with special effects and don't recognize the beauty in telling a story through dialogue. This is art. It made me a listener and a thinker -- not that I had not thought on such subjects before. In that the film was perfectly balanced between action/story/dialogue it was divine. I suspect that some bishops have been in touch with chosen critics who are incapable of reviewing the movie objectively. The other three people with whom I watched the move -- two of whom are published authors -- were as notably impressed as was I. I don't believe that I stand alone and hope that the voice of those who actually see and appreciate the movie can be heard above the din of those critics who pan the film. It's worth every effort to see this film. If you are addicted to action, you will be glad to hear that at least on two occasions you or those all around you will be heard to gasp, scream or otherwise testify to the the film's ability to wake you up and startle you. Silas was fascinating, as fascinating and as much an extreme example of what we can become if we embrace the more radical practices and ideas of some powerful arms of the Church. If these things make you uncomfortable, consider yourself blessed. They are real and have no place in the light of day.

I am not too impressed by Tom Hanks as an actor but the French lady playing Sophie (luminescent I thought) and the French cop were excellent. Since Teabing's arrest (forgotten his name but a great character - looked like Peter O'Toole) the movie lost momentum and the last 15mins were very slow. Of course the theory of Christ's bloodline is contentious, but so again is the divinity of Him and the virgin birth. But that is a matter of personal belief.

I try to write as many reviews as possible, but I can certainly say that this movie is under rated.Tom Hanks does (as always) a pretty good job at portraying the protagonist, but as some other reviews also made certain of is it the dynamic between our lead and the supporting role that is one of those things that bugs you as a viewer during the watch.The movie has good originality and scenes feel fresh and engaging. As a non-native English speaker I appreciate movies that take time to develop through action and don't standalone tells the story through conversation. One of these instances came as they meet the character played by Ian mcKellen. They have an almost ten minutes long conversation where they talk in each other's moth and really important information of the story is spilled. This totally lost my interest for the rest of the movie as I missed certain parts of this conversation. Sure they show some things ""trying"" to make it easier to understand, but the overall cutting and conversation just ruins the whole movie.A movie that I think will start to get a better reputation down the line, as more and more people stop reading and instead take the easy way out, watching the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ferociously, Agressively, Sadistically Boring","When the credits rolled on this rolled on this miracle of movie-making, i was shocked. I had just watched a movie that offered zero excitement, zero character development, zero anything interesting. It is a veritable engine designed for the sole purpose of making its audience as miserable as possible, and it accomplishes this quite admirably. There is truly nothing good at all about the film. From the lame, unimaginative, obvious script, to the pervasive, ever-intrusive score, to the innumerable pointless scenes that offered nothing in the way of character development or plot. When your big ending twist is something so ridiculous as the one in this, and I have absolutely no reaction to it, something is wrong with your movie. I was writhing in my seat i was so bored, and by the ridiculous last scene, i felt tears welling up in my face i wanted it to end so bad. Please, for your own sake, do not view this film. Consider yourself warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The movie was exceptionally cast.....except for the director.,"Having read the book twice, once around when it came out, and then again when i bought the paperback, i thoroughly enjoyed the book. I loved the characters, the plot, the time line it followed, everything. The movie, I can't really say the same. I thought it was a decent adaptation, though there were a few glaring omissions that would have made it much better, and a couple characters who's parts were drastically reduced who were larger characters in the book. Though the characters in the movie i found were cast very well. Though i would have liked to see someone else as Langdon, i thought Tom Hanks did quite well, as he always does. Audrey Tatou(sorry if i butchered her name)I found did very well as Sophie, and never have seeing her act before, i thought she did very well. Paul Bettany was impeccable as the misled Silas. I thought Aringarosa could have had a larger part, and how they twisted his storyline i did not like, though Alfred Molina did well with what he had. And what can i say about Ian McKellan that hasn't been said before, this man can do no wrong. He always takes what he is given and makes it his own. His scenes were the funniest, and truly got the character.The only part cast that i had qualms with was the director, Ron Howard. Why would they give this highly controversial(whether you believe it or not)story to him. This man makes family movies. He washes down what he can to make it less a controversy so that it panders to everyone. I felt that just about anyone, including Lucas could have given this story a better treatment. My choice would have been Scorcese(again, sorry for butchering the name)to direct given his record for making ""His"" movie, not the ""Studio"" movie. Even Roman Polanski could have done well, and would have had no problem directing in France, though England would have been problematic.All in all, the movie was decent for an adaptation, i wouldn't recommend it for a night movie, don't waste the 10 to 12 dollars, see the matinée.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film about ideas,"I should firstly state that I have not read the book so my review does not have that perspective as a point of comparison. This is a film about ideas even though most of the ideas are fake. In the context of a film that does not matter to me as films create their own fictional worlds anyway, we know that from the outset. It did stimulate me to look up things as I watched, such as Da Vinci's The Last Supper and the various religious sects, most of which turn out to be real in one sense but invented in another. The world that the film creates bears little resemblance to the real world but is definitely worth visiting.

While there are also flaws to the film. Such as the inaccuracy's concerning Christ being mere man and that HE was married to Mary.The facts are the true beliefs of The Bible concerning Christ, which is believed by billions worldwide. Not this film's opinion. Yet in a cinematic opinion Da Vinci Code is a masterpiece! That should've deserved Oscar wins for best picture for the year in 2006. But due to the inaccuracies.

Good Movie,"This movie is a fiction, but I felt down the story which I am made to think whether it is a historical fact. The mystery of Christ which is hidden in The Da Vinci Code. The hero and his company receives the code that Mayor of Louvre left and starts trip of the demystification. They solves a code one by one, and I was excited in the moment when those points and points are in one line.I wanted to go the Louvre after watching it. There may be the mystery that Da Vinci left in the present. If you like urban legend, you will be favorite.

don't judge a film by the book cover,"I have been a fan of Dan Brown for some years and have read all his novels, The Da Vinci Code being the first. The book is extraordinary. If you allow the story line to be 'believable' then this is a thrilling ride(in words that is). Then the film comes out, clearly commissioned on the very high crest of popularity and controversy. This in effect is both the film's success and downfall. It is clear that when a book excels from the dialogue it generates, it cannot be completely recaptured on film without making it unwieldy and over long. It therefore must be seen as a film in its own right. Any attempt to compare it to the book is misleading as both media have their own strengths and limitations. Before you see the film therefore, do not presume that it is going to instill the same sense of awe and wonder (afterall you already know what message the film is trying to convey if you have read the book !) part of the success in the book is the newness of the ideas. Assuming the film will have the same impact as the book is a bit like opening the same Christmas present twice expecting it to have the same feel.The film itself is good, the storyline is faithful to the book and the set scenes are handled with some panache (Ron Howard's experience in these scenes come through well). I agree with some critics that the dialogue at times is weak and the chemistry with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatu is woefully thin, but these are offset by the wonderful Paul Bettany and the ever reliable Ian McKellern.If you have read the book then enjoy the film as a fair representation of the key ideas, if you haven't read the book, then be prepared to be thrilled by a film with a stunning message, watch with an open mind and an open sense of what you want in a film and you may well be surprised at just how much you enjoyed this controversial film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Da Vinci Code mystifies its audience through a stimulating yet bloated script.,"Controversial for its proliferation of the ""mythical"" Priory of Sion and fraudulent ideology that Christianity is built based upon a lie, there is nothing quite like this to stir up religious warfare. Quite often my opinion is in the minority, and we visit that zone once again because I just adore this film. Yes, there are gaping plot holes and heavy hand-holding as the mystery unravels, but sweet Mary Magdalene it is so incredibly absorbing and interesting. It is one of the few conspiracy theories that stimulates my ageing brain. A symbologist is the prime suspect in an investigation for the murder of the Louvre curator, however the victim left encoded clues that soon start to unravel an ancient mystery. Religion is the catalyst for death. As long as one God is said to exist, people will continuously murder in his name. Brown's perspective for the radicalisation of faith and the centuries of unnecessary deaths all in the name of Christianity is a sentiment that I also share. However, regardless of my (or your) religious views, this mystery is still thought-provoking and paced meticulously well. It consistently involves you, allowing you to wrap your mind around the enigma that is the ""cryptex"". The adequate amount of both informative plot points and character backstory allows the story to be intuitively engrossing. Small details in Langdon and Neveu's past allows them to be somewhat relatable, yet it never felt unnecessary. These scenes, whilst prevent the characters from being completely one-dimensional, become important to the mystery. Hanks and Tautou were functional, they keep the narrative moving. Applause for McKellen though, as he was simply scrumptious. The twenty minute dissection of Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" was mesmerisingly fascinating. Praise for Zimmer's score should not go amiss, particularly the final track ""Chavalier De Sangreal"". Within the perplexing nonsense, there are underdeveloped sub-plots. Opus Dei was underused, especially the talented Molina. Still, nonsensical hooey fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Dear God, that was awful.","I have never read the book, or heard any of the idea behind the Da Vinci Code. As a result of the hype surrounding this film, I thought I'd jump onto the Da Vinci bandwagon with everyone else. And that was one of the most disappointing films of all time. Almost as bad as King Kong (remake). A big lead-up to a DULL ending.Tom Hank's performance is poor. Possibly the worst I've ever seen him. With performances like his in Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, it doesn't even seem like the same actor.Audrey Tatou. A fantastic (and stunning) actress. She's reasonable in this film, but has potential to be so much better. For her first MAJOR English-speaking role, it's just disappointing.The highlight of the film for me was Paul Bettany's AMAZING performance as SILAS. Saved the film really, but it was too little, too late.Save yourself from this film, unless you're a Paul Bettany or Audrey Tatou fan.

Good exciting  movie,"three of us caught a 6PM sellout. The audience was tied to the movie throughout.of my three, two thought the book was better, I understood plot points from the movie I had missed in the book. The movie is incredibly faithful to it, leaving out a few details to fit within movie time limits.The photography is excellent, the Louvre and Paris looked beautiful and mysterious.The principle actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were understating their acting throughout. They hardly broke a sweat or were shaken by murder and mayhem swirling about them. At first I was troubled by the matter of fact way they go about cracking the code.

A ho-hum effort from an incredible team,"When you begin with Ron Howard and Tom Hanks, throw in a pretty girl and some incredibly talented ""character"" actors like Ian McKellan and Jean Reno, you probably would expect a grade A movie. The best I can give it is a seven, and it probably deserves that much. Hooray to Howard for not including much sex (one brief scene flashes on the screen in black and white) in a movie that has Tom Hanks pretty much mopes his way through a maze of religious demagoguery that combines reasonable historic truth with unreasonable religious fiction.Having been one of the few who never read the book I might not catch everything, but the movie simply takes too long to get where its going, and even then the muddled ending left me questioning if it was an introduction for a sequel or actually had a meaning?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
it's really confusing if you didn't read the book.,"This movie is pretty good, but confusing because I hadn't read the book. The plot is alright, but some parts are just too long... when they're explaining stuff... (there's a lot of stuff to explain). When I read the book afterward, I was like, ""Oh...OK."" It was good how there was no romance thing between certain people, because that would've been weird. It's an interesting thriller/ mystery thing, although it lacks action. They shouldn't have cast Tom Hanks as Langdon, though. He didn't really capture the character for me. The monk dude (Silas?) is hot. He's the hottest person in the movie. He totally saved it ( although I forget the actor's name)and made it worth the LONG sitting. I failed to mention that this movie is long. All in all, It's very interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Negative reviews have more to do with fear of religious right,"Negative reviews of this film have more to do with critics fear of the religious right than any minor flaws this movie has. Is 'Da Vinci Code' a great film? Probably not, but it's a darn good film and Ron Howard stays very close to the source materials in the major points and while it relies on a great deal of actual history for elements of its back story it never claims to be anything more than a work of fiction. All performances are solid, the pacing allows for character and story development and the action pieces are exciting with out stretching believability too far. If Catholics and other Christians could accept 'The Passion' as authentic despite its reliance on works outside the Gospels and its overwhelming antisemitism then they have nothing to complain about in a movie that never attacks Jesus. As far as Albino's complaints, they do get used a lot as villains in cinema and 'Powder' hardly makes up for a stereotype based only on their skin.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Da Vinci  Code is Good but not Great,"I went to see the movie ""The Da Vinci Code"" with my brother opening week. He has read the book but I hadn't yet. I am a fan of many of Ron Howard's films and thought this could be one of, if not his best, picture yet. I am a little disappointed after viewing the highly speculated film. It was way over hyped. Don't get me wrong, the movie was not terrible but quite entertaining. It just did not meet up to the standards that the media had set prior to the film's release. It was a good movie. It just wasn't that amazing, spectacular, breathtaking, intriguing film that you see so very rarely nowadays. It was one of those movies where you walked out of the theater and you thought about it for a little while but then it would never cross your mind the next day, or the following week, or ever really. It was not memorable. It was a good movie, but that was about it. Save your $10 or $8 and rent the movie for half the price.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Everyone's a critic...a fine film that hits the mark,"Adapting a successful novel is a difficult task that greater directors than Ron Howard have failed. The screenplay for ""The Davinci Code,"" is a high achievement. Little is kept out of the film and that which is changed ensures the books themes and pacing are true. The use of flashbacks to give some of the novel's depth to certain situations (especially including Sophie's upbringing) were perfectly placed and well paced). Howard's use of visual effects to help the reader through a scene--first used in ""A Beautiful Mind,""--were valuable to the pacing of the film.The casting is also spot on. Tom Hanks is being unnecessarily trashed for his portrayal of what is, by my account, one of the most poorly developed characters from a best-selling novel in decades. And I read a lot of novels. Dan Brown uses Langdon in ""Code"" for the second time, and thus, dispenses with some element of character development. Upon reading the novel I believed Langdon to be a very dull, essentially empty character. I thought only Tom Hanks or Kevin Spacey could fill the role of a peaceful academic caught up in an out of control situation without resorting to stuffed shirt foolishness. (Russel Crowe as Langdon would have been idiocy...I would NOT have seen that film.) Hanks appears to do an apt job of stuffing Langdon's turtleneck and getting out of the way of the story...which is this film's real selling point. Audrey Tautou made herself future millions, Jean Reno is great as Fache, Molina is very strong as the bishop, Bettany is adequate as Silas, and McKellan is a scene stealer as Teabing.I've wasted a lot of units of $9.50 at films in my life, this was not one of those films.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But the acting is wooden, and the dialog anything but natural, it's Tom Hanks worst role since Bonfire of the Vanities in 1990. This is The Da Vinci Code for dummies.Ian McKellen does a great job as Teabing, and looks to be the only one who has a fun day at work.

"They had a chance to re-inspire people, but failed utterly","was a well done film with good acting and direction. But if you are expecting to be inspired as you were when reading the book, you will be disappointed.Like the Harry Potter books, the book 'Da Vinci Code' caught the public's imagination and drew us into a wonderful world of ancient intrigue via the paintings of Da Vinci and the various organizations depicted like the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, etc. as well as opening up for public discourse some questions about the role of the sacred feminine. The hunt took us to exciting places full of rich history and tremendous architecture. It inspired people hugely in many different ways.The film focused on none of the elements from the book that made it so unique. Rather, it pulled out incidents of violence and highlighted them, beginning with gratuitous scenes of flagellation, taking us far too often into the murky madness of Silas, and bombarding us with a cops and robbers fugitive hunt that offered absolutely nothing new for the viewer.It was uninspiring. Compared to the book, it was insipid.Whereas the Harry Potter films succeeded completely in bringing the books alive on the screen so that viewers were transported visually into the same wonderful ambiance created in the books (except for the one stupid bus scene), the movie Da Vinci missed the point entirely.With Ron Howard as the producer, I don't know how this could have happened. I was gratified when I knew he was going to be in charge of the film. Did none of the people involved with this project have any idea of what they were dealing with?

"a worse kept secret, no more","I must confess that I actually paid full price to see this movie upon its release early June - this pains me tremendously since in spite of my best intentions and the constant nudging of my friends to get some value on my ticket purchase, I could not stay awake. I must've fallen asleep a dozen times during the course of the film! As I can't remember the last movie I snored through, I chalked up this snooze fest to being too tired to sit through the film, lack of decent dialogue, no screen chemistry between any of the actors, preposterous plot zig zags, one too many sloppy action sequences, and zero comic relief. I appreciate absurd fantasy as much as anybody, but there wasn't anything remotely funny or intriguing that I could ream out of this dud. True, I was asleep for almost 2 hours, so could it be that this film was more than a succession of busy nothings? Well, I had my second chance to view the Codeand this time I didn't have to pay extra! It was the featured movie on my flight today and I was somewhat gladdened that I'd be able to make a final judgment on whether this film had any merit whatsoever. Good news is that I managed to stay awake this time. Could this be attributed to the fact that the ride was very bumpy and without a real meal, I was suffering the pangs of hunger? Sad to say, this overwrought tale was not the meal ticket it could have been. It certainly provided no brain nourishment at all. Upon second inspection, my initial assessment was validated. This movie is devoid of basic ingredients required of any passable movie: intelligent plot, credible characters, comedy, a slice of life What were Hanks and Tautou - two of my favorite actors – thinking when they signed up as automatons for this feeble, fetid potboiler? Truly, the best things about this film were the villains. Each of them - especially Silas and Sir Teabing – was a zillion times more fascinating than either Sophie or Robert ..unless of course you have a curious empathy for one-dimensional, muppet-haired, sanctimonious numb-skulls.So I've completed my penance for falling asleep the first time and I've also reconciled myself for giving this film one star things are indeed looking up this year!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This movie is definitely not boring, just bogus","New York Times critic A. O. Scott filed one of the first reviews of this movie, from the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday the day before opening. The film was not released ahead of time to reviewers, which, by conventional wisdom, signals a turkey. Scott kvetched about how boring it was. There is no ennui. The film kept me jumping with ambushes, chases and plot twists to keep my adrenalin level high.The contrasting scenes between 21st century Europe and medieval Europe in flashbacks are eye-catching. Hanks is low key, but he's usually low key, whether he's a high school teacher turned captain overwhelmed by battle and responsibility or a lone castaway on a Pacific island using assorted washed-up cargo items like a deflated basketball to keep his sanity.If you want to see how bogus Dan Brown's story is, check out the History Channel this week for programs on Opus Dei, Leonardo DaVinci and other topics suggested by the story. How much more powerful this story would have been if it were more grounded in fact! And certainly a case can be made from facts in the Gnostic gospels and other sources for all that is suggested. There has to be worldwide hunger for a better understanding of the Christian mythic monopoly given how a book with such awkward writing could sell some 65 million copies.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"""O' Draconian Devil""","Finally I can cross The Da Vinci Code off my list of movies to see. While I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, I was on the fence when the prospect of going to the movie came up. In the end, I realized it needed to be seen on the big screen, and I'm glad that was the decision. It, of course, paled in comparison to the book, but all in all was still a successful adaptation, staying true for its entirety. Unfortunately, because it stayed so true is why it wasn't a masterpiece.I give full credit to the actors, each did their role justiceeven Tom Hanks as our hero Robert Langdon, the one character I went in not thinking was perfectly cast. Jean Reno and Ian McKellen were brilliant as Captain Fache and Sir Teabing respectively, Audrey Tautou and Alfred Molina brought credibility to their parts, and Paul Bettany encompassed the albino Silas perfectly. Bettany truly stole the show and it's a shame many of his scenes were cut in the adapting process, leading him to just be a villain with only small shades of the misguided, lost soul he really was. I am also thankful that the filmmakers made the Hanks/ Tautou dynamic more of a friendship then budding love affair as it was in the book. The age gap of the actors was just too much for it to work and by thinning that relationship; it made the characters more believable in the scope of things. Ron Howard made a good directorial choice in guiding his cast this way; it's too bad he didn't alter anything else.Howard fell into the Chris Columbus rut with The Da Vinci Code. As Columbus showed with his first two installments in the Harry Potter saga, staying word for word to the source material does not a great movie make. Text and film are two separate mediums that must be molded unto themselves for complete success. Howard seems to have been so preoccupied with pleasing the Dan Brown fanatics with a faithful adaptation that he forgot this movie was his baby to do with as he pleased. Yes, the direction has some very nice visual flair evidenced with the fading of current action to past happenings, beautifully done on the crossing of the street towards the end where buses are going through swarms of walking pedestriansbut overall the text from the book has been lifted to the screen, more as a book on film then a piece of cinema. What this movie needed was a shot in the arm like the resurrection Alfonso Cuarón created with his Potter rendition. While still true to the Prisoner of Azkaban's essence, Cuarón was able to put his stamp on the film by adding atmosphere and a sense of foreboding visually rather than falling back to what worked on the page.Critics complained upon release that The Da Vinci Code preached rather than revealed, which I must agree with in part. It's not that there is more exposition in the movie than was in the novel, in fact there is less. Because of the need to shorten the text to allow for a two-hour movie, scenes must be sacrificed. However, here they were too afraid to do any cutting, instead the filmmakers condensed. Whereas while reading we are brought into the hunt, listening to each character's ruminations spanning chapters as they slowly crack the newest puzzle, on screen we are given solutions practically in the next breath as the question itself. This lack of methodical pacing makes it seem as though we are being taught because we don't get to be a part of the unraveling. So, this isn't a bad adaptation at all, it is actually near perfect. The real truth ends up being that the novel just was not a good candidate for the cinematic conversion. Sometimes engrossing prose works because of its medium and unless a director comes in to capture the essence and create a film out of it, rather than of it, we are left unsatisfied with a result that never truly takes form to stand by itself as a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Controversial but entertaining.,"When The da Vinci Code was published as a novel in 2003 there was uproar from virtually every corner of religion. Three years later when the film arrived non of that controversy had waned.It's fair to say that if the film didn't have a weight of Hollywood big hitters Tom Hanks and Ron Howard behind it then it would probably never made it to the screen.Fortunately it did and what we get is a hugely entertaining mystery, which unless you've already read the book holds onto its secret right until the very end.Looking back now you can appreciate the film even more so, the cast is solid and the film moves along at a rapid pace, it never seems to drag even with its 2 and a half hour run time.Despite the controversy surrounding the storyline and the pretty much unanimous mauling by critics the film went on to huge success with cinema goers, earning close to 800 million in ticket sales.Angels & Demons followed 3 years later as a sequel (although it actually came chronologically before in the novels) 7 years later Inferno arrived and although a decent film, it didn't live up to the success of the previous 2 films.It will be interesting to see if either The Lost Symbol or Origin see Tom Hanks once again return as Professor Robert Langdon.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
