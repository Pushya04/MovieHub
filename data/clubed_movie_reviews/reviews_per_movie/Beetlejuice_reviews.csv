Has a crazy rhythm all its own,"It may take two or three viewings to warm up to ""Beetlejuice"". It has a kooky, cockeyed sensibility and a rhythm that is by turns easy, lazy and frenetic. A charming couple in New England die and come back to their beloved home as ghosts, determined to rid the place of the horrendous new tenants. Possibly the most benign and engaging performance ever by Alec Baldwin; Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Sylvia Sidney are also very appealing. The new couple from New York who take over the house (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) aren't as well written or thought-out as the other characters and some of their bemused, dry-ice comic lines take a few seconds to reach you. Of course, there's Michael Keaton, wildly comic as Betelgeuse. I recall hearing comments back in 1988 that Keaton wasn't around enough to make the picture worthwhile, but that's only if you watch the film for the fast quips and sight-gags. Keaton is truly wonderful, but he's also bombastic, and I felt there was just enough of him to satisfy--it's really not his story anyway, it belongs to Baldwin and Davis; Betelgeuse is used as a horny, vulgar punchline. Director Tim Burton is very careful not to overload the movie with raunch; he is surprisingly careful in setting up this story, and he works magic within a dubious scenario: a comic fantasy about dead folks which ultimately celebrates life. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Keaton the ghost with the most.,"Considering he's not in the film that much and the film is named after his character he steals the whole show when he appears front and centre. He is so good you're amazed by him I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Carrey didnt use Michael Keaton's performance as Beetlejuice as a template for his fantastical cartoon character Stanley Ipkiss in the The Mask.
Love the B Movie special fx and the Shake Senora dance scene.
Little peave though was Betelgeuse/Beetlejuice dilemma. Wish they explained it a bit better thought I was having a dyslexic turn kept checking after all these years in was reading the name of the film wrong, kept stopping the film to check the title. The only downfall.
All in all funny and out there film. I'd just watch it for Keaton's performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots and lots and lots of fun,"This is a great movie to simply watch and enjoy--no need to think or analyze--just enjoy the silliness and cool factor of this nice film.A young couple living in their dream house (Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis) are accidentally killed and thereafter live as ghosts in the home. Some time later, a family of freaks (Jeffery Jones, Catherine O'Hara) and their disaffected daughter (Winona Ryder) move in--much to the ghosts' chagrin. That's because instead of respecting the lovely home's charms, the parents want to turn it into a pseudo-intellectual freak house. However, Winona somehow is able to see and communicate with the ghosts--but her parents can't believe that they exist or that they're doing anything wrong with the house.The dead couple try to scare away the family, but their attempts are really lame (and funny) and this only makes the weirdos want to stay even more! So, out of desperation, they seek out the most evil and obnoxious ghost, Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton) to help. The problem is that although Beetle Juice is able to scare anyone, he's also a total maniac and once let out, he's amazingly difficult to stop.The film abounds with many things you'd expect to see in a Tim Burton directed film--weird special effects, an odd set design (after the weirdos transform the house), fun and a definite ""cool factor"". The actors do a fine job as well. Additionally, the script is smart and fun. While some might find this too dark a film for young kids, for older kids and adults, it's mighty entertaining and silly. Plus the music is just so darn infectious and fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"AND IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER, EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT! (that's not just a quote)","This is one of Tim Burton's best films. His sophomore effort shows the story of a married couple (the Maitlands played with good degree by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die accidentally off a bridge and wind up the target for a upper-class family (including a young yet well played Winona Ryder) and a weird yet scary ghost (with the most) named Beetleguise (or Beetlejuice in a scene of laughs) played to immense complexity by Michael Keaton. Sure this plot may sound a little anti-climactic being mainly gags and not really a focused story, but so what? In a film where you see sandworms from saturn, shrimps that attach after calypso and a nut who has seen the exorcist 167 time (insert quote here), why bother with a plot. Great fun every time I watch. Reccomendable to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!","One of my favourite movies of all time. It's a Halloween classic. Spooky, funny and very rewatchable. I am waiting for that moment when I forget this movie again and get to rewatch it. Beetlejuice is a creativity booster, an inspirational, in an artistic sense, film. The sets, the wardrobe, the props - everything inspired me as a kid and made me love those dark-romance, Tim Burton motives.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Burton's true masterpiece, and one of the ten best 80s movies.","Watching this one more time on TV yesterday reminded me of the first time I saw it all those years ago at the movies when Tim Burton was just the guy who had directed that funny Pee-wee Herman movie. Walking into 'Beetlejuice' then, without knowing anything about it, was an amazing experience. Along with 'Blade Runner', 'Blue Velvet', 'Videodrome', 'Brazil', 'Paris, Texas', 'The Terminator' and 'Repo Man' it was one of the most astonishing and memorable  movies of the 1980s, an era dominated by Hollywood dreck like 'Flashdance', 'Top Gun', and 'Footloose'. The whole Bruckheimer/Simpson/Spielberg/Hughes zeitgeist that dumbed down popular movies as never before. Movies like 'Beetlejuice' were a glimmer of hope in a truly awful period.The big question is - how does it stand up today? The answer is better than ever! In fact I would argue that 'Beetlejuice' is Tim Burton's most successful and least compromised film. Everything about it is perfect. A great cast lead by the very appealing and likable Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the newly dead Maitlands, a star turn by Michael Keaton as the gonzo ""bio-exorcist"" title character, and strong support from Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and especially Winona Ryder (a performance that really put her on the map), as the new occupants of the Maitlands house. 'Beetlejuice' juggles gruesome, trippy and genuinely witty sequences, and ends up becoming one of the freshest and surreal movies to find a mainstream audience since the heyday of 60s/70s ""head"" movies. Forget Burton's more recent hit and miss big budget efforts, and try this for the real deal, Luis Bunuel meets Tex Avery meets George Romero, and then some! 'Beetlejuice' is a blast!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Now this is life after death!,"You gotta figure that only Tim Burton could come up with this! An ultra-zany story of rural couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis), who accidentally get killed and witness a tasteless couple moving into their house, forcing them to hire ""bio-exorcist"" Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton), is truly something else. With a new joke almost every minute, the movie never gets dull. And how about that soundtrack? ""Day-O"" in the most morbid comedy ever? Yep, it's all here. Great support from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones as the tasteless couple, Winona Ryder as their disaffected daughter Lydia, and Sylvia Sidney as afterlife counselor Juno, make this one of the coolest movies of 1988!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice FU#KN' Model!!!!,"This is by far Michael Keaton's best performance. Every time he comes on the screen he displays such an eccentric performance that it rivals Jim Carrey from 'The Mask', only without as much help from computers. If his role calls for gross he brings revolting; pushy he brings offensive; witty he brings hilarious sarcasm. One of my few complaints is that he doesn't get enough screen time, although he does have a large portion of it, most goes to Gena Davis and Alec Baldwin.Tim Burton's directing is great. My favorite scene by far doesn't even have Michael Keaton in it. Anyone who has seen this will remember it as the dancing dinner scene.This is a classic. If you haven't seen it then you must've'e grown up under a rock or born before I was.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton's sophomore feature cements the director's iconic style with a joyfully inverted take on haunted houses and ghosts,"In the idyllic small town of Winter River, Connecticut, Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) are a happily married couple who are content to fix up their house while on vacation from working the local hardware store. However, on a routine drive the Maitlands inadvertently plunge their car into a river trying to avoid hitting a dog in the road. Upon their return home the Maitlands start noticing odd things such as not remembering how they returned home and eventually discover with their inexplicably acquired book The Handbook for the Recently Deceased that they died in the river and are now ghosts bound to the property. A bad situation is rendered worse when their home is sold to the yuppie Deetz family consisting of stressed architect Charles (Jeffrey Jones) who hopes for peace and quiet, Charles' tacky socialite would-be artist second wife Delia (Catherine O'Hara), and Charles' gothic death obsessed daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). As the Maitlands try to scare the Deetz' out of their home to no avail Lydia begins seeing glimpses of them, however a fast talking lecherous con-man named Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) offers his services as a ""bio-exorcist"" to the Maitlands to get rid of the Deetzes, but Beetlejuice may be even worse than they are.Following the success of Tim Burton's debut film Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Burton became bankable enough for Warner Bros. That he became attached to the long stalled in development Batman. While Batman continued its turgid development Warner Bros. Offered Burton a number of scripts many of which he hated including the infamous Hot to Trot. Eventually Burton was given the script to Beetlejuice and decided it would be his next project. The script, originally written with a much darker and less comic edge was reworked by written Warren Skaaren and gave us the final darkly comic toned end result. The film received positive screenings from test audiences and upon release the film became a sleeper hit opening at #1 at the box office and staying there for four consecutive weeks ultimately making $74 million in North America alone against its $15 million budget which gave Warner Bros. The confidence to formally greenlight Batman which would only make Burton and even bigger name than he already was. Beetlejuice has become one of Burton's most iconic films as its undeniably the first film where Burton's signature style is fully on display (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure had glimpses, but it wasn't quite the Burton we all know). Visually creative, darkly funny, and incredibly quotable, Beetlejuice has become a classic for a good reason.At its core, the movie is a culture clash of two exaggerate types with the Maitlands represent humble, nice, down to earth people while the Deetzes represent the garish tackiness of obnoxious urbanites who revel in excess and inanity and even when they come to small towns to ""get away from it all"" their thoughts turn to ""how do we make this more like where we came from?"". Burton loves larger than life characters and he does well with the over the top likable Maitlands and the over the top tacky Deetzes but we also get a more grounded core in Winona Ryder's Lydia who despite being positioned as a gothic outsider, is also ironically the most normal and down to Earth one of the group and serves as our proxy through which we experience the supernatural shenanigans. Baldwin and Davis are both incredibly likable and have fantastic chemistry as Adam and Barbara, and Catherine O'Hara is delightfully over the top as she voices her disgust with the Maitlands home and mutilates it along with her buffoonish and foppish interior designer Otho (Glenn Shadix) who's very much a jack of all trades and a joke at all of them. But of course, we can't talk about Beetlejuice without discussing the titular character and he steals every scene he's in thanks to the manic energy brought by Keaton to the role. Very much a Bugs Bunny by way of the Cryptkeeper, Beetlejuice is repulsively funny as he's essentially this fast-talking conman with vulgar appetites and lecherous leanings that he doesn't even try to hide that culminates in a satisfying climax where everything is fully unleashed.Beetlejuice is an inverted take on Ghostbusters with the crazy surreal imagery that would become part and parcel to many a Tim Burton production. With sharp clever writing, beautifully ugly visuals, and memorable lines and characters it's no wonder why Beetlejuice's legacy has endured as long as it has.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't say it!,"Despite an interesting premise and several impressive, unsurprisingly strange sight-gags, 'Beetlejuice (1988)' isn't really all that engaging. It isn't bad, but it doesn't quite grip you in the way it should. It isn't particularly funny, for instance. It's also somewhat undisciplined, with a plot that seems to operate on an ""and then this happens"" logic. Of course, the thing has its more successful moments. Keaton is good as the eponymous creepy character, bringing a lot of unnerving energy to the role. Baldwin and Davis do a good job of playing an everyday couple forced to cope with an inconceivable situation, too. The film is at its best when Burton's signature weirdness is allowed to run wild, with stop-motion monsters and grotesque make-up galore. It can be a very visually pleasing experience. It just isn't all that entertaining as a whole, though. It's hard to say why, but it just isn't all that compelling. 5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton is awesome!,"Tim Burton's Beetlejuice is a great film. The director was given free reign to make his own film visually and it is great.

ghosts against ghosts,"In 1988, prior to the inordinate success of ""Batman"" (1989) which would line his pockets, Tim Burton bequeathed this work which is from his own words: ""a comical version of ""the Exorcist"" told from two dead people's point of view"". I have never been a fan of William Friedkin's masquerade marred by extravagant, ludicrous special effects.There are also special effects in ""Beetle Juice"" and they constituted the main attraction for many viewers when the film was released. But unlike Friedkin's enticing work they're much better tapped to serve as complements for the needs of the story but also to depict the beyond after death for Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin. On this point, one recognizes with pleasure Burton's trademark. The filmmaker had visibly pleasure to recreate a quirky vision of hell enhanced by extravagant scenery with rather loud colors and populated with funny monsters. This hellish universe has the look of a public services office.Another positive thing about ""Beetle Juice"" is that it never really falls into the excessive or the very grim and genteel humor is also an asset for the film. The story has genuine looks in its beginning but takes a derivative direction as the film advances and certain characters verge on the space of cardboard characters. But the actors seemed to be well aware of this problem and perhaps that's why they offer subdued, enjoyable performances. But the prize for the best actor arguably goes to Michael Keaton as the grouchy, dangerous Beetle Juice, absolutely unrecognizable under his make-up.""Beetle Juice"" hasn't got really its place among Burton's seminal works like ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Ed Wood"" (1994) or ""Big Fish"" (2003) but if the filmmaker's set of themes and stylish job is your cup of tea, why not give it a chance?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice,"This starts very well with an original and interesting take on the afterlife. The prospect of two naive but likable ghosts having to learn their haunting skills on the job was delightful. As was the depiction of a monstrous bureaucracy behind the scenes, not far removed from Terry Gilliam's Brazil.Had the second half proceeded along these lines, this would have been a true classic.Alas, things start to go downhill with the appearance of the title character, one of the most annoy characters in cinematic history, not made any better by Michael Keaton's mannered performance. One is grateful that he does not put in much of an appearance.The film then abandons any attempt at intelligence to instead go in for a lot of gimmickry. The reaction of the family to the dinner table haunting could have been made plausible if the haunting had not been so wildly over the top. Nor is it clear where Baldwin and Davies acquire the ability to control humans and create disembodied hands. They do not demonstrate this skill anywhere else.More overblown (but unfunny) scenes kill any willing suspension of disbelief leading to the rushed and clunking finale.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Creativity at its best,"With ghosts and the dead, one would normally anticipate a horror movie loaded with screams and gory figures. But in Beetlejuice, we see a new dimension humour being experimented with.Taking into the account that the movie was made in 1988 with limited special effects, Beetlejuice could be simply labelled as ""creativity at its best"".Tim Burton is a pure visionary and with this movie you cannot help but appreciate the amount of creativity he has and his ability to translate it to screen.Acting is top-rate from all fronts. One can't help but admire promising young Winona Ryder - a flower ready to bloom.It would take a couple of viewings to be appreciate the movie in totality.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A landmark supernatural comedy as well as being a refreshingly flaky fantasy,"Beetle Juice may be strange and oddball at first, but like several films I have seen over the years, it could well grow on you. Essentially it is a landmark supernatural comedy as well as being a refreshingly flaky fantasy crammed with wit and invention, that I think is one of Tim Burton's better films along with Batman, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. It is also a marvellously imaginative view of the afterlife as a ghoulish extension of mundane earthbound problems. The visuals once again are absolutely wonderful, with dark cinematography, imaginative sets and zany special effects. The script are filled to the brim with one-liners that are funny and somewhat demonic, the score from Danny Elfman is fun and the direction is pretty much superb. And I loved how offbeat the performances were, with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis suitably low key as the recently deceased couple who want to rid their new home of human pests. Speaking of those human pests, Catherine O' Hara proves herself fantastically pretentious as the artist whose creations come to life in one of the film's most memorable scenes, and Jeffrey Jones and Winona Ryder are also memorable but it is Michael Keaten as Bettelgeuse, the unstable freelance exorcist who steals the show who portrays the character as unique and completely and utterly insane. Overall, unique, imaginative and lots of fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice,"Keaton steals the show as the title character in this off the wall comedy from director Burton.

Not Enough Beetlejuice,Beetlejuice has a weirdly small amount of screen time in a movie called Beetlejuice. Love the Claymation and special effects. Also love the film's depiction of death as a bureaucratic hellscape with a multitude of stupid and confusing rules.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Bit Dated But Still Awesome,"Many older movies date not so gracefully, and when you watch them after awhile, crappy video effects, or bad montage and cutting are so obvious that the whole movie turns sour or very silly. Beetlejuice aged gracefully, thanks to a huge injection of healthy humor, spellbinding star cast, excellent calypso songs, awesome plot and very cynical twists in the story. You saw it, you know it. What else can be added to this great film? Winona Ryder is very cool choice here, she is dark, moody and way way out there, but her deep sense of humor helps her get through all the initial sadness. Great work by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin also add much to the whole crazy vertigo of gags, jokes and laughs. Good camera work also helps, and even old-fashioned video effects do not spoil the party and do not steal the infectious joyousness of the story. Highly recommended",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inventive and Fun take on the Afterlife,"RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by Tim Burton, ""Beetlejuice"" chronicles the story of a couple (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis) who accidently perish after moving to a quaint Connecticut town. They find themselves sentenced to ""haunting"" their former house where they try to scare the new wannabe swank couple out (Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara), but they find that their Goth daughter is more curious than scared (Winona Ryder). Michael Keaton plays the eponymous madcap ""bio-exorcist"" while Glenn Shadix is on hand as the new couple's interior designer.This was Burton's debut on the silver screen and the first half is hilarious entertainment mixed with some interesting insights on the afterlife. The movie puts its best foot forward, but the second half isn't as compelling and I think the title character is more annoying than amusing.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in beautiful East Corinth, Vermont, and (studio) Culver City, California.

Am I missing something? Because . . .,"Beetlejuice is one of those films you feel guilty about not liking more. Sounds daft, I know, but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie, but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean, Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton, right, and an early masterpiece, right; and Michael Keaton in the title role, delivers a barnstorming performance, right; and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated off-the-wall, wacky humour right, with loads of imaginative special effects, right. And anyway, everyone, and I mean everyone thinks it's really, really good and really, really cool and just, you know, brilliant, I mean really, really brilliant, right. So if you disagree and, you know, you don't get it, it's your problem, man, because everyone else thinks it's really, really cool and really, really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really, really good and really, really brilliant. The real problem is that I don't think I even have a problem — I just don't think Beetlejuice is quite as good as everyone, and I mean, everyone, right, says. It's rather like Robert De Niro's performance in Mean Streets: everyone says it's pure genius, then you see it, and you think: aren't they exaggerating just a little, I mean, just a little? It's good, yes, but . . . Beetlejuice is this film I had heard so much about, which was truly original and with which Tim Burton first made his name (or something). But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out, and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV, I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for £4, which is my sort of price, in it went into the shopping basket. In the event, I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player (i.e. my iBook) until a few weeks later, but when I did, I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now, it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there, because, quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton re-wrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre, although I would be hard-pushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example: the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't. Then we are presented with the Deetz family and their camp interior designer and again the characterisation is so broadbrush that you wonder just at what level the whole thing is being pitched. Well, actually, it doesn't matter. This is cartoon stuff, except that it doesn't feature animation but acting. OK, fair enough. Then we get to Keaton giving an undoubted tour de force but in an odd sort of way it never really takes off. We are informed that at one point he was someone's assistant but his behaviour became so extreme that he had to be let go. Well, perhaps I'm being a little over-pernickety here, but I want some sort of back story which would help flesh out Beetlejuice. But all we are led to believe is that he should, on no account, be invoked. Naturally, he is invoked, but oddly the film finishes quite soon afterwards (in an ending which involved a deus ex machina of such obviousness that I would bet my shirt the writer simply did not know how to end his story. In fact, apart from the fact that one could dies and wants to scare another couple out of their home, what was the story. When the film came, I was even taken by surprise: was that it? I thought, for although by now Beetlejuice had already been running for 90 minutes odd, in a sense it was only just getting going. But no, that was it, like it or lump it. Perhaps, I am expecting too much. Perhaps I am being too serious. Perhaps I should just relax and get into the spirit of the film (and no silly pun intended there). The trouble is that Beetlejuice could have been so much more. We often say that so-and-so was more than just the sum of its parts, and hope to indicate that it included an x factor which raised it above the rest. Well, for me Beetlejuice is, in a sense, less the sum of its parts. It seemingly has everything, but . . . Oh well, I'll just have to firm a sub-group of those who don't think this is the best thing since sliced bread.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Unique Characters & Story, To Say The Least","This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character ""Beetlejuice""- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who has almost always played nice, cute people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a ""haunted house"" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.Overall, a unique and entertaining film.

Beetlejuice... Beetlejuice... Beetlejuice...,"I've seen almost every Tim Burton film. He's by far one of my favorite directors of all time. Each movie is so stylistic, gothic, and heartwarming (even Sweeney Todd). But it all started here - Beetlejuice. Right from the start, you see the different ""Burtonisms"" that you see in every Burton movie. Tim Burton has a unique art style that's easy to recognize. And like all his other movies, Beetlejuice really delves deep on very human issues despite the fantasy aspects. And of course it's not a true Burton movie without an enchanting score by Danny Elfman.Good directors seem to know how to cast their films perfectly. Beetlejuice is no exception here. Catherine O'Hara is a true standout in this movie as Delia. Of course the star of the show is Michael Keaton as the demon himself, an iconic performance if there ever was one. But the only other that can be deemed as icon as Keaton and Beetlejuice is Queen Winona Ryder as the ever iconic Lydia Deetz. Winona's career truly started here, and since this movie she's been worshipped by every little strange and unusual outcast in the world. Even 30 years later she's still praised as a 90s legend and gothic icon and it's always a joy to see her portrayal of Lydia.When people watch Beetlejuice, I feel like Adam and Barbra's storyline is overshadowed despite them being the main characters with the most screen time. Beetlejuice and Lydia just rightfully steal the show, however the dead couple's plot actually gives interesting insight to Burton's concept of death in the movie. The rules for ghosts and the afterlife are well thought through and add a great level of lore to the story that may go underappreciated.What should not be underappreciated is the musical adaption of this film. I have to add this here at the end because Beetlejuice fans need to know - the musical is actually amazing. When I watch the movie, all I think about is the musical. When I listen to the musical, all I think about is the movie. Alex Brightman and Sophia-Anne Caruso as Beetlejuice and Lydia simply brought magic to the characters we already knew and loved, both as great tributes to the original cast while giving their own Broadway spin. The songs are fun and have already become essential to my Halloween playlists. And the musical overall is the perfect celebration to the this iconic 80s movie that continues to be symbol for every Halloween season.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The direction on a macroscale is very gothic and campy, and shows glimpses of a style that Burton will later be known for; The direction on a microscale is pretty good as the performances help move the movie, but still feel very 80s camp; The storytelling is a bit linear and 80s, but has a lot of the gothic charm you see from other Tim Burton filmsStory: Pretty Good
The concept is pretty interesting as it is somewhat of a satire on the horror/haunting genre; the plot structure is pretty linear and simple, but the exposition feels too short; character writing is good as Beetlejuice is such an iconic character, and the remaining characters have clear wants and relationshipsScreenplay: Pretty Good
The dialogue is very over-the-top and humorous; the humor is pretty good for the most part as it makes the movie funny; the symbolism is somewhat prevalent as it deals with issues of death and grief and it is a satire on the horror/haunting genre; the foreshadowing is pretty prevalentActing: Pretty Good
Alec Baldwin: Pretty Good (Plays the lead well and works well with Geena Davis)
Geena Davis: Pretty Good (Plays the lead well and works well with Alec Baldwin)

Catherine O'Hara: Good (She has her signature comedic motherly charm)
Winona Ryder: Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the emo daughter well and holds her own well at such a young age)
Michael Keaton: Good to Very Good (His over-the-top, raunchy comedy helps make this an iconic character and performance)
Rest of the cast: Decent to Pretty Good (They are more just background characters, but help support the main cast)Score: Pretty Good

Beetlejuice,"Beetlejuice is the movie that marked Tim Burton as a director to watch. It allowed Michael Keaton to freewheel his comedy chops at a higher level.The combination of Burton, Keaton, composer Danny Elfman, the production design and animation in this movie convinced Warner Brothers that this was the right team for Batman.Adam Maitland (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) live in their dream house until they one day die in a freak car accident.When they come back to their home they find out that they are dead and have been for some time. Their house is now occupied by another family who plan to bring big changes to it.The Maitlands are unable to scare the family away. Only Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) sees them and understand their predicament.They then bring in a bio-exorcist ghost Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) who runs amok. Now the Maitlands have to rein him in.For Hollywood, Beetlejuice is bizarre, freaky and surreal. It has a manic and pervy performance from Keaton. He is very much a supporting character here as the villain in this creepy comedy.Burton plays homage to other horror films, he brings in veteran Sylvia Sidney as the afterlife spiritual guide who knows all about the chaos Betelgeuse could unleash. The afterlife as a civil service bureaucracy seems to be inspired from Powell and Pressburger.The special effects might have now aged, a lot of it was stop motion animation. The dark inventiveness of the movie still stands up.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Michael Keaton is perfect as the perverted Creepazoid,"How can anyone who has seen this movie not like it. Michael Keaton is perfect perverted creepazoid Beetlejuice who lives in the attic of a house along with a heap of other ghosts who have difficulty adjusting to the fact that they are dead.Beetlejuice is one of those characters in film you are either going to love or hate.I've long been a fan of Tim Burton. His movies are almost always weird, but there is almost always something endearing about his work. His films are almost always entertaining, and Beetlejuice is probably one of the more obvious examples.If you really think about it absolutely nothing happens in this movie. For those of you who've seen it, think about it.If you haven't yet seen it, just watch it for Tim Burton's really weird and wonderful imagination. It really is what makes the whole movie.This movie is a big departure for Michael Keaton. I found it really hard to believe he was actually a comic actor, but he is hilarious here and he is another thing that makes it worth watching.Just be aware this movie's story is almost nonexistent.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quick Review,"Beetlejuice is a different family movie, that requires a pretty much grown up family or those ones that are into horror films. Its quick, its unique and above all its hilarious and lovable as hell!Tim Burton's stop motion is extraordinary yet again (surprising no-one) and the overall performances are from pretty good to great! The Sylvia Sidney cameos are probably the best parts of the movie. She has by far the best lines. Also, Michael Keaton is great, but Alec Baldwin and young Winona Ryder have a more normal role and managed to be memorable as well!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome!,"`NICE ****IN' MODEL! --(Honk!)(Honk!)' -Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton)The Maitlands are young newlyweds, happily getting by in their little New England town, that is, say, until they both get killed in a car accident. Returning as ghosts, they find the afterlife to be a surreal world, where the dead suffer the same problems as in life (just amplified to a crazy extent).  Assigned to haunt their old home, the find the job more than troublesome, as the Dietzes, a disturbingly trendy couple from New York and their depressed, gothic daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder) move in.  Unable to scare these people away, and sick of seeing their home renovated (i.e.-`gutted out'), the Maitlands hire a `professional bio-exorcist' by the name of Betelgeuse (played very well by Michael Keaton), to extract them. Cartoonish mayhem ensues. This is Tim Burton's 2nd movie and it is a laugh riot.  This is definitely worth seeing",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton's spooky tongue-in-cheek vision effectively sells this Gothic horror comedy in life,"Mixing elements of Gothic horror and comedy can be a tricky stunt to pull off. Director Tim Burton however, manages to do just that in more than ways one. And if you know the director well enough, you'd know that resorting to usual Hollywood conventions isn't part of his norm. We are talking about a director takes his quirky vision and places it full-throttle to create an entertaining horror-comedy feast that supplements both laughs and scares. His vision is what makes this quirky, yet effectively engaging Gothic horror piece work. Imagine a world where Michael Keaton played a goofy green- haired lunatic that made The Joker look like a cute little snuggle doll by comparison. This concept is brought to life in this infectiously bizarre comedy- horror salad that see Burton exercising his signature style to full extent, pushing the boundaries of youngsters' dark imaginations, but not without having his tongue in his cheek. This film follows Adam (played by Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (played by Geena Davis), a married couple who are driving on a bridge when they swerve off-course while dodging a poor little dog. When the fall ends up killing them, they wake up in the afterlife where their house is being a sold by a family consisting couple Charles and Delia Deetz (played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara respectively) and their emo teen daughter Lydia (played by Winona Ryder). Since they (Adam and Barbara) are ghosts, Charles and Deila can't see or hear them. However, it is Lydia who has the mysterious ability to communicate with them. In an effort they scare the family out of there house, the couple must cross paths with an erratic, fast-talking clown only known as Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton). It is only too bad that the clown has a more devious plan they do more harm than good.Wacky and peculiar are the most suitable words to describe what kind of ride you are in for. But as this is Tim Burton, bizarre is what most people should expect. This features Michael Keaton in a role that defies against the usual good guy tapestry that he would resort to later on his career. Keaton exercises the role of the quirky clown-being with appropriate over-the-topness and macabre-type comedic energy that lends plenty of humor to leave audiences snickering beneath the dark Gothic nature of his character and the film itself. The movie has moments of laughter, but most certainly not in the way that will leave you busting your gut with guffaws. After all, it is dark humor that defines the underlining comedic tone while the spooky imagery triumphs over the absurd wackiness. To be more specific, the vast portion of the imagery lies within the world of the afterlife where Adam and Barbara encounter deceased victims who have faced very unpleasant deaths such as a man who has been burnt to meat, an elderly lady who smokes and exhales through the slit in her throat, a headless man, and a later sequence when one of the characters is tasked to pop her eyes out of her skull. And yet this film somehow managed to pass with a PG-rating in an era that introduced the PG-13 rating by the release of the war film 'Red Dawn', not to mention that Keaton also drops an F-bomb in one scene. Nonetheless, Tim Burton brings an expert hand at keeping things moving, and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis sell themselves in their roles just fine. If there is any detriment to Burton's vision, it is, of course, time as the special effects he incorporates some sequences such as the lead couple being chased by a giant sandworm has grown hideously outdated. And the musical number at the end feels somewhat out of place. But whether Burton is trying to frighten us with his nightmarish imagery or amuse us with the quirky nature of the characters, particularly the eponymous character, he is always inviting us in for the laughs.Beetlejuice is an entertaining piece that mixes comedy and horror in an eccentric fashion that truly works. With all grotesqueness that showers the film, some may question whether it makes for an appropriate children's movie. For my answer, probably not without parental guidance unless the youngsters who dare to watch this are immune to nightmares induced from Tim Burton's campy visual imagery. But with the macabre humor injected into the film's veins, there is enough camp to make for a nice treat for both adults and preteen children alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Accomplished Tim Burton Movie,"A Great Idea, Good Script, and Wonderful Cast. What more do you need?Answer - TIM BURTONHe successfully creates a fantasy world for the living and the dead to share as only he can. This combined with solid performances from the entire cast and of Course Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, you know your on to a winner.Keaton Brings Beetlejuice to life in this hilarious comedy, as he is called upon to help some ghosts excorisise the living from their home, with unpredicted results.This movie quite simply gets funnier every time you see it, and there is literally nothing else like it, that i have seen.Terrific 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good,"It's certainly not a movie that will please everyone, but for those who like a good black humor and want to see something different from what we're used to, it's a full plate. The jokes are great, especially the ones about the government office, and the dinner table scene where everyone starts to sing and dance is just hilarious.The story has nothing to do with it, and even in some moments the script leaves something to be desired, as the simple fact that the meaning of the couple's ""life after death"" is not clarified, but that, analyzing more deeply, it can be purposeful showing that the death is meaningless. And this can be seen in the part where the joke is made where Barbara (Geena Davis) tells the social worker that she is not happy and she is told that of course she is not happy because they are dead, showing that the couple does not have to be satisfied with death, simply accept it as it is.The look of the movie is amazing, especially all those creatures of the most varied forms. They make us wonder where they got so much idea to make ""dead people"". The soundtrack does its role very well with a dark and unpretentious feel at the same time, making it clear that it doesn't want to frighten you, but it doesn't want to be comical either. All the characters are great along with their portrayals, especially of course the unrecognizable Michael Keaton (Beetlejuice).It's not a film to be taken seriously (and he doesn't take himself), but it sure is an incredible option for those who are saturated with films with that same formula as usual that doesn't risk anything for creativity. The movie doesn't hide at any time that it's bizarre, and that's what makes it so good. Tim Burton definitely knows how to make the bizarre interesting.Film viewed on the 2nd to the 3rd of September 2021.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why aren't more films this original?,"This is one of the most imaginative, creative and unusual movies I've ever seen. Yes, even for Burton. I mean, the man is a cornucopia of ideas. I'm not sure what I expected this to be like, but I could easily not have gotten it right even if I had countless guesses. The plot is marvelous, and develops nicely, always retaining interest. The pacing is spot-on. I never really wanted this to end, and it somehow both left me satisfied and hungry for more of the same. The characters are magnificent. The ""feel"" of one of his productions is definitely there, and without it seeming too much like one of his others. The acting is great. The music, both Elfman's scoring and in general, all excellent. The humor varies, and I, personally, did not find everything funny, but quite a bit of the material that worked had me laughing an awful lot. The visuals, as we know they will be, when Tim is helming it, are invariably well-done. The effects are perhaps outdated today, but they still work and do so well. And honestly, as I watched this, I was far too entertained to care if I could tell how they did this or that. The dialog is well-written, with several clever lines. The designs are rich. The details... wow. There are some grotesque images in this, a little language, moderate and strong, and a suggestive thing or two. The DVD features a theatrical trailer and a music-only track. I recommend this warmly to any fan of Tim Burton and his style. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun ideas and premise, but lacks plot and hilarity","Beetlejuice was the second big budget film from visionary Tim Burton and is the first film were you see some of his later trademarks come in. The film is packed with dark comedy, comical horror, offbeat performances and Gothic visuals that have become a mainstay in most of his movies. It has a lot going for it, but the execution holds the film back.The story focuses on young couple Adam and Barbara Maitland who are killed in a car crash, yet they live on as ghosts in their home. Problems arise when a strange family move into the house and any attempts to get rid of them prove to be useless. The only solace the Maitland's get is with the young daughter who happens to be able to see them. The Maitland's are left with no choice but to hire crazy 'Bio- Exorcist' Beetlejuice who guarantees to get rid of the family. The premise is an extremely inventive one, the idea of ghosts expelling humans does sound very funny and starts off well here. The problem lies within how it's told as the film loses focus the longer it goes on. The film lacks coherence as a lot of things come from nowhere and aren't explained well.The cast all do solid jobs. Alec Baldwin is very good in a reserved and very naturalistic performance as Adam, he comes off as a likable everyday person which means the ghost scenario genuinely confuses him. Geena Davis also puts in a very good turn as the laid-back and sweet natured Barbara. She too has a real sense of likability to her and the chemistry between her and Baldwin comes off as sincere. Winona Ryder is good as the goth inspired daughter Lydia. Ryder does have a good screen presence and comes across as innocently charming. Catharine O'Hara is excellent as the eccentric and obsessive Delia, she has a great sense of comic timing that is put to good use. Jeffery Jones is also great as calm Charles. However Michael Keaton steals the show as the equally bizarre, wacky and hilarious title character. His energetic expressions, exuberant delivery and knack for physical comedy work brilliantly here.Visually the film is a typical Burton one with bright designs mixed in with the Gothic styling he usually goes for. The ghost world that is created is really imaginative and the colour scheme used adds to the supernatural theme nicely. The humour is a problem with the film. At times it doesn't go as far with the comedy as it should do which means that most of the comic sequences are wasted while when does go comically over-the-top, the calypso scene, it just feels forced. The scenes in the afterlife offices and the ones involving Beetlejuice were the only ones that had the ability to draw the laughs naturally. The comic horror aspects are used effectively and balance out with the straight up comedy well. The special effects are very weak too. They are extremely dated and the usage of Claymation looks very fake these days. The music from Danny Elfman is quite good and carries that quirky dark sound that works perfectly well with in the film.On the whole Beetlejuice does have a fun premise and a brilliant Keaton performance, yet it lacks a fluid structure and truly funny moments to become anything great.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Keaton IS God,Absolutly Hilarious!!  Micheal Keaton must have had the greatest time doing that movie.  It is one of his best.  Watch the scene when Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis first see him on TV and he's doing the commercial.  I laugh so hard every time I see that.  It's a 10 for sure!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than I thought it would be!,"I was a little skeptical when I started the movie, just because movies, and especially comedies from this time period don't always age so well. I was surprised to find how engaged I was through the whole film!I had very little context for the plot or actors in the movie other than Michael Keeton played a weird guy called Beetlejuice, and even that was just from the trailers of the new ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice"". Adam and Barbra are very likable and easy to root for. Lydia is a good contrast to both the couple and her parents, being moody and brooding. After Adam and Barbra make it to the weird afterlife waiting room I understood the tone and atmosphere we were going to get. I think you either engage with that kind of aesthetic and vibe or you don't; if you do then this movie is really fun, if you don't then this movie is probably pretty ridiculous.I loved the costumes! Lydia's excessively black and dour look, the simple clothes of Adam and Barbra, the pretentious look of Delia, and all of the ghosts looking as they did when they died really injected character into each roll. Whether you like Tim Burton or not, he knows how to make an aesthetic.The effects were charming in that corny 80s way, clearly being leaned in to throughout the movie. The sets are either really tactile or otherworldly which made the difference in the living and the dead feel real. I love when Barbra and Adam dig up Beetlejuice, you can see the layers of corkboard and fake grass that make up the ""ground"" in the model town. Details like that are all across the set, costume, and makeup design of the characters and locations.Keeton is gold. All of his dialogue, punctuated by a truly wild and outlandish performance, was a delight. I also really loved Sylvia Sidney as Juno, with a cool detail that as she smokes the smoke comes from her slit throat. She is our rule-giver to the newly dead couple and adds some maturity and gravity to the world.Of course the dancing scene was very funny. I feel lucky that I had no idea it was coming and had never seen it before so it hit in the way it was supposed to.Plot-wise, the movie is very thin and this is where my troubles with the movie lie. We are warned multiple times about the dangers that come from summoning Beetlejuice, but nothing bad really happens when he is conjured. He tried to marry Lydia, which she clearly didn't want, but I was expecting more of an existential or deadly threat I guess. Barbra and Adam also seem to really adore Lydia which I felt wasn't completely earned. I get why they like her; Lydia treats them like people instead of props or a way to make money. Yet after their second meeting with Juno, Barbra says she can't go through with scarring the family away, their entire goal for the whole movie, because she wants to be with Lydia. It just felt a little forced to push toward a resolution.Charles, Delia, and the rest of the cast at the dinner party and the resurrection of Adam and Barbra are very light on character. I also never quite figured out what Otho's motivation was in dealing with the ghosts.Overall I really enjoyed it. I wish we had spent more time fleshing out the rules of the world and characterizing the secondary characters, but the visuals, dialogue, and performances add up to a new Halloween tradition for me!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great comedy from Burton,"""Beetlejuice"" is a great artistic vision with a hilariously bizarre premise. The entire movie is so original. Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, and Jeffrey Jones play very well in scenes that are like nothing you've seen before. Keaton shines as the title character and his physical humor(along with great special effects and costumes)kept me laughing the whole movie. This was the initial movie that opened the door to Burton's world which is dark and fascinating. A great movie experience with very funny scenes. RATING: ***",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Morbid fun,"Tim Burton is quite the visionary. He has a knack for the dark, strange, and off-kilter. He also has the ability to creatively combine such elements with comedy, and yet also leave behind an aura of existential reflection. His films often create some sort of deeper emotion in the viewer, making a lot of his films dramas disguised as comedies. However, put all that to the wayside because Beetle Juice is just Mr. Burton having fun. The movie is about two people who die before going on vacation. Their ghosts remain in there house, where they must live for eternity. The problem arises when a family of nutty art freaks move into their house and start to take it apart and give it their own ""artistic"" flare. In order to get rid of these people they call upon the undead conman Beetleguese (pronounced beetle-juice like the title of the film). Wacky and grotesque situations occur from here, taking us on a bizarre ride.Tim Burton's true artistic form comes through most of all in this film. The design of the characters and settings in this film are very cool. Particularly the spirit world, which is set up as a busy public office, reminding me a lot of a DPS office or a post office. Of course everything has some sort of ghostly flare to it and everything is very fun to look at and admire the work put into designing these aspects of the film. Then of course the people in this spirit world are equally crazy. The rule of thumb is that the way you look in the spirit world is the way you looked when you died. So I'm sure you can guess that there are some interesting looking people in this world. There's everything from a shrunken head victim to zombified football players who evidently died in some sort of crash. All of the main characters, especially Beetleguese himself, look very strange and off the wall, giving the film its consistently morbid yet humorous feel.That tone is one of my favorite things about the film. Obviously, the whole film deals with death. But this morbid idea is made into something very fun and different. The film is never depressing or overtly morbid, instead it's a sarcastic kind of morbid that makes you laugh at the irony of the whole situation these characters get themselves into. It also helps when the characters are the same kind of satirical oddness. All of the characters are very unique and very fun and the cast does a great job portraying it.Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin play the two leads, Adam and Barbara. They do a great job as the quiet newlyweds who don't want a lot out of life, but end up getting mixed up in so much more than they bargain for. They open the film very well, but it really gets nutty when the new family moves into their house after they die. This new family of three consists of two bizarre parents played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara. Jones plays Charles, the short tempered father who wants nothing more to relax in his new country home. Catherine O'Hara is the mother of the family, Delia, who is an aspiring ""artist."" Her character makes a lot of fun of the artists in this world who take abstract art way to far, so much that it just looks silly and makes no sense at all. She is neurotic and high strung, making her a hilarious character throughout the film. A young and beautiful Winona Ryder plays Lydia, the Gothic daughter of the family who is very into self-expression through bizarre and overzealous clothing. Then of course there's Michael Keaton as Beetleguese who is so grotesquely entertaining from start to finish.I can't say a whole lot about this movie other than it simply being fun. It isn't a life changing film. It is brilliant and it is far from one of the best movies ever made. But it is definitely fun and holds plenty of entertainment. I got plenty of laughs from the film which is carried very well by a funny cast playing great characters. Tim Burton creates a fun visual experience in Beetle Juice so I wouldn't recommend missing this film. It's well worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining movie,"I enjoyed watching the movie throughout, and it is really fun. The story is pretty great with a ghost couple wanting to keep their house the same while trying to scare off the new inhabitants of it. It builds up really well with their deaths, them learning about the afterlife, and meeting with Beetlejuice. I like the creative on the afterlife with the desert-like landscape, the waiting room for the ghost, and the visual of the movie. The movie has a charm to it with its presentation and how it tells the story. I also do think the relationship between the characters are pretty good on how they connected with each other and how it effects the plot. It is also entertaining to watch Beetlejuice being a maniac on how he acts and the stuff he does throughout the movie. I have to be honest that I didn't laugh at any humor in this movie because it is not my type of it, but the movie is still entertaining throughout. I found the characters to be pretty great in this movie, and the performance was amazing, too, like Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, and Catherine o' Hara. I found the special effects to be really great in this movie. The makeup effects for the ghost look amazing on how much work they put onto them and how creative they can get with each of the ghosts you see throughout the movie. I also like the set designed when the ghost couple enter into a different place with is both creative and memorable to see it. There are other great practical effects in it, like the sandworm creature and the Beetlejuice snake like creature.Beetlejuice is an entertaining horror comedy movie that I have fun watching and is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,"Beetlejuice is a cinematic classic that stands as a testament to Tim Burton's visionary ability to blend dark comedy with whimsical storytelling. Released in 1988, the film exudes a unique charm that remains captivating decades later, thanks to its inventive narrative, unforgettable characters, and distinctive aesthetic.Michael Keaton's performance as the titular Beetlejuice is a masterclass in eccentricity and unpredictability. His portrayal of the mischievous bio-exorcist is chaotic, energetic, and utterly iconic, commanding attention in every scene. Keaton's vivid characterisation has cemented Beetlejuice as one of cinema's most beloved and unconventional anti-heroes, delivering a performance that lingers long after the credits roll.The narrative centres on a recently deceased couple, played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, who find themselves navigating the peculiarities of the afterlife while haunting their former home. Their attempts to rid their house of its obnoxious new residents lead them to summon Beetlejuice, setting off a series of hilariously macabre events. Winona Ryder's portrayal of Lydia Deetz, the gothic teenager with a penchant for the supernatural, brings both heart and relatability to the film. Her deadpan delivery and quirky charm make her a standout in a cast of already memorable characters.Burton's signature visual style is on full display, with outlandish set designs, imaginative creature effects, and a surreal aesthetic that perfectly balances the eerie with the fantastical. The use of practical effects and stop-motion animation gives the film a tactile, handcrafted quality that adds depth to its unique world. Danny Elfman's playful and haunting score further enriches the atmosphere, creating an auditory backdrop that complements the film's quirky tone.While the pacing occasionally falters, particularly during the more chaotic moments dominated by Beetlejuice's antics, these instances are forgivable due to their sheer entertainment value. The film's irreverence and unconventional storytelling may not appeal to every viewer, but for those drawn to offbeat humour and originality, it remains a cinematic treasure.In conclusion, Beetlejuice is a near-perfect fusion of horror, comedy, and fantasy. Its quirky narrative, standout performances, and visually arresting style make it a timeless work of art. Decades after its release, the film continues to captivate audiences, offering a wildly entertaining journey into a world where the macabre meets the whimsical. For those yet to experience this ghostly romp, it's time to say his name three times and dive into one of cinema's most delightfully peculiar masterpieces.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delightful Comedy,"In New England, the couple Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam Maitland (Alec Baldwin) is in love for each other and for their beautiful house. While driving back home from the town, they have a car accident, falling from a bridge into a river and dying, but becoming trapped afterlife in their home. When their house is sold to Charles Deetz (Jeffrey Jones), his wife Delia (Catherine O'Hara) decides to redecorate the place with new painting and furniture. Barbara and Adam unsuccessfully try to scare them, and they become connected to their Gothic daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder), who is able to see them. However, they decide to hire the services of the ""bio-exorcist"" ghost Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton) but when they see how dangerous he is, they call-off his services. But Beetle Juice wants to get married to Lydia to definitely return to the world of the living.The first feature of Tim Burton is a delightful comedy, where he introduces a calling card of his dark style with nice characters in a very funny story, great makeup and special effects and a stunning and hilarious performance of Michael Keaton. The annoying music of Danny Elfman is the only negative point of this highly recommended movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Fantasmas se Divertem"" (""The Ghosts Have Fun"")",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Special Effects in Search of a Plot,"When I recently reviewed his 'Big Fish' on this board, I stated that Tim Burton is generally at his best directing quirky, offbeat films such as 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood' or 'Big Fish' itself, and less entertaining when he moves into the mainstream. Having since then seen 'Beetlejuice' for the first time, I realize that there are exceptions to that general rule. 'Beetlejuice', a black comedy about the afterlife, is hardly mainstream Hollywood fare, but I also found it far from entertaining.The central characters, Adam and Barbara Maitland, are a nice-but-wet young couple, who live just outside an idyllic small New England town in one of those huge, rambling weather boarded mansions that looks as though it has been taken straight from an Edward Hopper painting. After they are killed in a road accident, they return to their house as ghosts. The view of life after death in this film is an unusual one, which has little in common with Christian eschatology or with traditional ghost stories. The dead are compelled to return to the house where they lived during their lifetimes; if they attempt to go outside they find themselves in a desert landscape populated by monstrous worms. (This imagery was presumably derived from Frank Herbert's science-fiction novel 'Dune' and the film that was made from it a few years before 'Beetlejuice'). They can, however, contact other departed spirits who can help them cope with the trials of the afterlife by, for example, leaving them a copy of the 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased'.The Maitlands' main trial takes the form of Charles and Delia Deitz, the pretentious yuppie couple who buy their house. Irritated beyond endurance by this tasteless pair, the Maitlands, attempt to scare them away, but their efforts prove ineffectual because the only member of the family who can see them is their daughter Lydia who, far from being frightened by Adam and Barbara, takes a liking to them and befriends them.Like another reviewer, I was struck by the thematic similarity to Oscar Wilde's 'The Canterville Ghost', which deals with the attempts of a ghost to frighten away an American family living in his ancestral home. (In that story too the only person to befriend the ghost is the young daughter of the newcomers). Wilde's story, although it has moments of pathos, is also a satire directed against both the traditionalism and snobbery of the British aristocracy (represented by the ghost) and the materialism and brashness of the American nouveaux-riches. 'Beetlejuice' also contains some satirical material, chiefly at the expense of the pretentiously bohemian Deitzes, who redecorate the Maitlands' house in a garish modernistic style and fill it with Delia's abstract sculptures. (It is never explained why a couple with such radically contemporary tastes would actually want to buy a Victorian mansion in the first place). Modern art, however, is a notoriously difficult subject to satirize, largely because it is impossible for the satirist to come up with a concept which is more extreme and exaggerated than the artists' own ideas. Delia's sculptures might look like pretentious tat, but one can see aesthetically similar items in established museums or in galleries bearing price-tags marked in thousands of pounds. Lydia, a follower of the then-fashionable 'Goth' cult, claims that she can see ghosts because she is 'strange and unusual'. The film loses the chance to make the point that the Goth movement, like most teenage cults from the Teddy Boys to grunge, was not so much strange and unusual as an alternative way to be conformist.Satire, however, is largely abandoned when the title character enters. Despairing of their own ability to scare away the intruders, the Maitlands engage the services of Betelgeuse, a 'bio-exorcist' who specializes in helping ghosts rid their properties of the unwanted living. (Although the film is called 'Beetlejuice' the name of the character is spelt 'Betelgeuse'; I can only presume that the producers wanted to change the spelling to something more user-friendly and failed to realize that we actually see the name written down several times in the film).From this point on the film becomes an ever-more frantic slapstick comedy as Betelgeuse makes increasingly manic attempts to get rid of the Deitzes. Betelgeuse is played (in bizarre makeup) by Michael Keaton, in one of the most frenetic, over-the-top pieces of acting in the modern cinema. (Even some of Jim Carrey's efforts look restrained by comparison). The other characters fade into the background, and any attempt at a plot degenerates into a series of stunts and gimmicky special effects. The film certainly shows evidence of Tim Burton's vivid visual imagination, but he seems unable bring any discipline to his talents. 'Beetlejuice' is an inventive but disappointing film, even when viewed as a pure comedy, and lacking the wisdom and philosophical insight that Burton was able to bring to 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Big Fish'. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice is Burton's seminal and programmatic work,"Beetlejuice was Tim Burton's first mainstream film to show the dark yet colourful style which was to become his trademark.  The commercial successes of Batman, Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas show how his sense of alienation and the comic developed, but Beetlejuice is where it began and as such represents all that makes Burton a great director.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horror? Are you joking?,"Some people regard Beetle Juice as a horror movie. This is actually not true -- it would be true if Wes Craven directed it, as planned -- but it isn't.Burton, Rider and Keaton proof immediately to be a great team, and the jokes, especially the handbook for the recently deceased-gag.

Funny and amusing horror comedy in which a pair of  ghosts hire a peculiar exorcist,"A surreal , grotesque farce with continual surprises about an ultra-nice couple (Alec Baldwin , Geena Davis) of recently deceased ghosts who contract the services of a ""bio-exorcist"" called Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton, the title character is named for a bright red star in the constellation of Orion, Betelgeusein) in order to remove the obnoxious new owners of their house , and they contract him to rid of all trespassers for a price . The fantastique exorcist only be contacted when his name is correctly pronounced three consecutive times . Among those who feel the need to hire are a couple of newly-dead who are confined to a living hell in their own home which is being invaded by obnoxious new inhabitants , a family of post-modern art-lovers , formed by a marriage (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara who was a replacement for an ill Anjelica Huston as Delia, on the set she met her future husband, production designer Bo Welch who created the inventive set design) and their rare daughter named Lydia (Winona Ryder ; though also auditioned for the role Juliette Lewis , Diane Lane, Sarah Jessica Parker, Brooke Shields, Molly Ringwald and Jennifer Connelly all turned down the same role) . But the things go wrong when the maniacal BeetleJuice works his own magic .Bemusing film plenty of humor , easy fun , cheesy scenes , special effects galore and strange situations . Michael Keaton steals the show as the repulsive and raucous Bio-exorcist , he spent only two weeks filming his part in the film , which lasts 17.5 minutes out of the 92-minute running time . The highlights of the film are the unforgettable Calypso scenes that result to be priceless images . The original script was a horror film , and featured Beetlejuice as a winged, reptilian demon who transformed into a small Middle Eastern man , subsequent script rewrites turned the film into a comedy and toned down Beetlejuice's character into the ghost of an wise cracking con-artist rather than a demon. Winona Ryder is astounding as the Gothic adolescent with a death complex and majoring in weirdness , while Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are amusing as the yuppie marriage . The picture packs eye-popping and colorful cinematography by Thomas Ackerman . Lively and amusing musical score by Danny Elffman , Tim Burton's usual .Not surprisingly, the movie's impressive box-office success created plans for a sequel: Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian. A script was commissioned and Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder both signed on to reprise their respective roles, but Tim Burton lost interest in the project and went on to direct Batman and Batman Returns instead. As late as 1996, Warner Bros. was still trying to get the original sequel concept into production but a finished film has yet to materialize.The motion picture was well realized by Tim Burton , giving a quirky vision of the afterlife and showing his usual weird touches . This unstructured but habitually delightful live action cartoon will appeal to Tim Burton fans . The supernatural comedy was a huge and surprising box-office hit, which in turn led to Burton being entrusted with the reins on the hugely expensive Batman (1989). Although his least personal film, it was one of the most successful movies of all time, and gave him unprecedented power in Hollywood considering the originality and adventurousness of his work thus far. ¨Edward Scissorhands¨ (1990), another hit, saw him at the peak of his creative powers and established a fruitful working relationship with actor Johnny Depp. ¨Batman returns¨ (1992) was a far darker and quirkier film than the original, a reflection of how much creative freedom Burton had won . And although Ed Wood (1994), his loving tribute to the life and work of the legendary Worst Director of All Time, Edward D. Wood Jr., was a box-office disaster, it garnered some of the best reviews of Burton's career .",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An amazing trip to the afterlife.,"In this film, we will visit the afterlife through the experience of a newly deceased couple who, to their own despair, sees the home of their dreams invaded by a new family. Thus, to evict them and regain possession of their home, they decide to scare and haunt the newcomers, which can be challenging for a rookie ghost. To do this, they have the help of experienced ghosts and two unusual allies: the daughter of the new house owners and another ghost, deeply unorthodox and expert in the art of scaring the living.The film is a classic comedy of black humor, which plays with death and life in the beyond, just as it makes a great mockery to the pseudo-intellectuals of American society. The movie is very funny. I confess I had never seen or heard of him until I found him, by chance. Directed by Tim Burton, there are a lot of elements that we associate, almost instinctively, with this director: an unusual plot with offbeat themes, a comedy difficult to please everyone, out of the box sets and costumes and a refined, fun and contagious soundtrack.The cast did a great job. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin have done well in the role of the ghost couple. They interact very well with each other and have created a positive and credible romantic chemistry. Besides, they're funny. Michael Keaton has the most difficult and original character here: the spiritual de-worzler Betelgeuse (Beetle Juice), an irreverent, talkative and daring ghost who loves to scare humans and promises to be truly difficult to control when he's released. Winona Ryder, once a regular in Burton's films (remember ""Scissorhands""), is quite good at playing the rebellious daughter of the new owners of the house, which, for a reason the film never explains, has the ability to see and speak with them, as if she were a medium.Overall, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Very funny, contagious and cheerful, it will surely drive anyone to laughing laughter.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wacky Horror Picture Show...,"A wacky Tim Burton at a time when his muse Johnny Depp was still the thug-arresting hearthrob of ""21 Jump Street"", a sweet Geena Davis, a boyish Alec Baldwin and practical Gremlins-like special effects... well, if ""Beetlejuice"" doesn't scream 80s, I don't know what it does. This is a little gem of horror mixed with comedy that might delight every member of the family though I suspect kids who've grown up after the 2000s might find the film a bit too silly and childish... a complain they'd share with eminent critics of that era such as Ebert and Siskel. Both deplored that the titular character brought too much obnoxiousness to an already loaded story and they got rapidly tired of his antics, but didn't they think the same of ""Ace Ventura""?I think ""Beetlejuice"" is a film that might disorient the first-time viewer because of its constant swinging between fantasy and horror and naughty comedy, but I suspect this is the kind of experience that grows on you if you give it a chance. Michael Keaton as ""Beetlejuice"" might be a tad too prankish and annoying but thankfully he only appears midway through the film and meanwhile, the main characters had already won our hearts. I agree that the relationship between Baldwin and Davis brings a certain sweetness to the film sometimes at the expenses of the plot. I couldn't really accept that such lovely persons would indulge to scare the new occupants on their residence just because of some disturbance... especially since they aren't played by the least likable actors either.Jeffrey Jones aka Emperor Joseph aka Ferris' archenemy Rooney is a serene father who wants to contemplate birds and enjoy his nest of serenity, Catherine O'Hara, aka Kevin's mom is the lady of the house eccentric sculptor who won't have any intruders disrupt her oasis of artistic creativity and finally, Winona Ryder is the emo malcontent adolescent who grows an interest on the former residents, if not a liking.In fact, if we except the nasty decorator Otho, the character who comes the closest to an antagonist is Beetlejuice himself, though his main purpose is to get the house rid of the family by operating let's say an exorcism from the other side. The premise is interesting but the film is filled with so many enchanting special effects and funny scenes that a new character popping up near the end wasn't a necessity. As hard as it is to imagine the film without Beetlejuice, it's funny that the film's most memorable moments don't feature him. But I won't get too nitpicky, Keaton is obviously playing a career-defining role and I suspect if it wasn't for his performance, he might not have caught the attention of Burton for his next project (a clue: it's another special effect movie with a one-word title starting with ""B"").Keaton is certainly as wacky and crazy as his cartoon adaptation but his performance is too straight-forward and doesn't call for subtlety, a pity for a film that contains so many inspiring moments such as the afterlife bureaucracy and the memorable case-worker played by a chain-smoking and scene-stealing Sylvia Sidney.At the peak of its creativity, ""Beetlejuice"" is a fantastic and spectacular fantasy entertainment filled with hilarious moments: a great twist at the end of the opening credits, a hilarious choregraphy with the ""Banana-Boat Song"" and a funny waiting room sequence involving a silly-looking creature with a shrunk head. The film won an Oscar for Best Make-up but oddly enough, it didn't garner any Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedic Actor to Keaton. I must admit his performance never really bothered me except for one moment that carried a lot of gravitas (when the couple's ghosts started to age and their bodies turning into skeletons), the scene hit a really sensitive chord and it did so well that I really wanted someone to get rid of Beetlejuice instead of the humans. For that scene in particular I would agree with Ebert's criticism.But with some perspective, ""Beetlejuice"" is a fun product of its time, with a right balance of humor (mostly visual), heart and special effects, and these aspects work so much that the cynicism brought by the titular character might feel like the real intrusion. There are moments where the house looks overcrowded and the humor overdone but ""Beetlejuice"" is still one of these little classics of the 80s, and time did justice to the little films of that glorious and extravagant decade.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sadly, a quarter of a century later, the film isn't anywhere near as much fun as I remembered it to beThere are plenty of creative ideas and director Tim Burton's morbid style is much in evidence, but the film as a whole proves to be far less than the sum of its parts—a series of quirky, macabre, but not very funny gags with little in the way of a decent story to tie it all together.

Makes death look like a lot of fun,"It's only his second movie, and yet it is obvious Beetle Juice is pure, unmistakable Tim Burton: macabre, darkly comic and crammed with weirdos, not least Michael Keaton's career-best performance as the perverted titular ""bio-exorcist"".But what does a creature like that actually do? Well, it depends on who requires his services: in the case of Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), a recently deceased married couple, he is supposed to get rid of the ""terrible people"" (Jeffrey Jones and Helen O' Hara) who have taken over their house. As his employers will soon discover, though, Beetlejuice doesn't exactly play by the rules and has an agenda of his own, a fact that could cause more damage than expected. Unless the new owner's daughter, the death-obsessed Lydia (Winona Ryder), finds a way to stop him, that is.Burton was famously accused for favoring style over content in his two Batman films (fair assessment, but they're still awesome), something that can't be said of this black comedy: the visual element may be incredibly strong, especially in the fantasy sequences, but the director never loses track of the wonderfully witty script, taking the audience with him on a trip that, similarly to his later work Corpse Bride, paints a merrier portrait of the afterlife than we are used to imagine, albeit with the occasional grotesque scenarios and people.Oddly enough, the extravagant imagery is also where the film shows its biggest limit, as some of the special effects have dated quite badly, most notably a stop-motion animated snake that attacks Adam and Barbara in an early nightmare scene. Such shortcomings, however, are compensated by the consistent twisted humor and a committed cast: Baldwin and Davis are amusing in roles few people would imagine them playing, Burton-regular Jones is a reliable source of laughs and Ryder's ""troubled"" teenager (not like her Heathers character, though) is a neat and charming counterpoint to her heartbreaking turn in Edward Scissorhands, also directed by Burton. But it is the underused Keaton (about 18 minutes of screen time in an almost two-hour long movie) who deserves the hot spot in the audience's memory: he is twitchy, rude, dirty and VERY naughty - nearly too much for a PG feature. And if that isn't enough, consider this: Burton wanted him and no one else to play Batman because of his work in this picture, and the result was the finest celluloid Dark Knight until Christian Bale took over the suit. That's gotta mean something, right?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Strangely, the actual Betelgeuse character is a small role, but Keaton is so bombastic and wild, it's enough. He's excellent. The focus of the story is on Baldwin and Davis, who are attractive and very believable as a married couple. Sylvia Sidney, Dick Cavett, and Robert Goulet have small roles, and they're all great.

But the one that stands out the most is Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. In a masterful portrayal and brilliantly acted despite being underneath all that make-up and costume. This is a true tour-De-force for Keaton with his best performance of his monumental career. The negatives I have for it is the story is not well understood at least for me.

Great Halloween Movie.,"Review:
'Beetlejuice' is an American comedy-horror film directed by Tim Burton. These types of movie are what I wish Tim Burton would have stuck to and wish he did more of. This movie hit right home with me with the creepy Halloween feel, but also being a comedy that you could watch with the family. Yes, it has some moments of coarse language and some overly creepy scenes, but overall, I would say it's a holiday classic for the family to enjoy.
The plot revolves around a recently deceased young couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who become ghosts haunting their former home, and an obnoxious, devious poltergeist named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) from the Netherworld who tries to scare away the new inhabitants (Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) permanently.
The acting may take some getting used to when watching a Tim Burton movie like this. It's well done in the case that the actors don't take you out of the movie and play all of there characters very well. But it's done in a way that is structure to the story that Tim Burton specifically wants to tell and it's original to its stories. The acting in this movie wasn't as play-like as some others are, but it sill didn't feel like I was watching a typical movie. I'm not trying to make this out to be a bad thing at all, I love the way I feel when watching these movies, it makes it feel more personal that the director wants to be different and have his characters stand out. My personal favorite in the film has to be Michael Keaton's portrayal of Betelgeuse, which I suppose is a good thing considering the name of the film. The way he can come off to be a complete dick, but also being super charismatic when trying to get what he wants to fantastic. Also, not to give anything away, but there is a wedding scene at the end of the movie and is amazing.
One thing that could have been turned into a negative and made this movie out to be called dated it the fact that they use stop motion when trying to do CGI, but I love it. Not only was it because of the age of this film, but it's Tim Burton M.O. All it did was turn a Tim Burton movie and make it feel more like his.
Overall, this is a Halloween movie that is on my list to watch every year. I think anyone can enjoy this movie for what it really is.

An All-Time Great!,"Michael Keaton is hilarious in this wonderfully bizarre tale of life after death.  One of the best things about the story is that it develops well with its central characters, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about the new people moving in.  In Beetlejuice, the title character played by Keaton is a supporting character. In fact he doesn't make his first full appearance until an hour into the movie, by then its highly anticipated and I guarantee it won't disappoint you.  In this way, the movie doesn't beat you to death with one character's antics the entire time like Ace Ventura.  Instead it has a great plot and solid execution, so when Keaton's Betelgeuse comes onto the screen its extra special and tons and tons of fun. Burton's directing is solid, Danny Elfman's score is marvelous, and Keaton simply turns in the performance of a lifetime.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wacky, zany, and crazy fun far out weird film!","1988's ""Beetlejuice"" is one film that is atmospheric and it skews one's view of the world with odd shaped houses and different characters everyone is in their own little world. Director Tim Burton who is a master of this method living in the clouds(Burton even borrowed some from the Pee Wee Herman movies). Still aside from the sets and graphics, the story involves a couple Adam(Alec Baldwin) and Barbara(Geena Davis) who suddenly become deceased only later haunt their dream house when a new couple move in with their future seeing like daughter who can communicate with the dead. The scenes are far out funny and silly really wild and crazy from the head demon ghost played just fine by Michael Keaton. Overall the film is a fun okay watch yet not one of Tim's blockbusters as Burton's 1989 ""Batman"" is his best ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beetlemania,"A sequel, 36 years later, which, by the way, I didn't see, but surprised me by including three actors/actresses from the original film (Keaton, O'hara and Ryder), was the necessary pretext to review this 1988 Beetlejuice, which was, truly, Tim Burton's first big success (Pee Wee was a misstep and before him there were only short films, which became notable only after the director gained fame).Even with the technological nostalgia with which we see 36-year-old visual effects, and a handful of famous actors and actresses, the film highlights the script's weaknesses that it always had, although with the additional attraction of showing, for the first time, the Tim Burton's fantastic creative universe, which would make him one of the most successful directors/producers in Hollywood, in the following decades.A nostalgic, almost archaeological journey into Burton's healthy cinematic madness that still makes for enjoyable entertainment, nearly four decades later.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Does not age well,"I have been hearing about Beetlejuice for years and I am a Michael Keaton fan so this film was on my watchlist. I was quite let down by how bad it was. This is hard to watch and it is like watching a disaster unfold before your eyes. Mindless, silly and nonsense comes to mind after watching this film. Also it does not help that this film is being watched so many years later when CGI and effects have really moved on. It adds to the lackluster nature of it. I could not get into it. Despite a legendary cast and good director this film is a real dud.

Tim Burton goes big time,"Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) are a young happy couple in lovely house. They die in a car accident and are left stranded to haunt their home. The annoying advant garde Deetzs (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder) move in, and the Maitlands are helpless to scare them off. Finally they get a specialist Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) to excise the living from their house.Tim Burton is a complete original, and this is the first tastes of his quirky visual sense. It's too obvious to say this is an original vision. Consider that it is so original that nobody really has done anything similar since other than maybe Burton himself.The great thing is that the story works as well. It's funny. It's cute. It's heart warming. I love the characters, and the actors are all great in their performances. Of course Michael Keaton goes crazy in this one.

He's the ghost with the most,"The original Beetlejuice (1988) directed by Tim Burton is a great film, and there might be some things I say about the movie that people have already said; because this is a good film, and I like the cool creepy style from the director and the great performance by Michael Keaton in the title role, I decided to rewatch the film because I felt like it, which is why I can say it still holds up to this day. The film Beetlejuice (1988) is funny and entertaining with great performances, well-done stop-motion animation, great practical effects and sets, a fun creepy tone, cool ways to explore the afterlife, a great antagonist, and interesting rules about how the dead operates or coexists with the living; the film runs at a good pace with the couple dying and learning about the dead, and then calling Beetlejuice for some help that backfires, which shows that ghosts trying to get rid of the humans in the house instead of the other way around is a good twist on what we essentially have seen before.I liked Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the couple Adam and Barbara and thought they were very likable main characters who happen to die and get put into the weird afterlife, I also liked how since they were new to the rules of the afterlife, they are learning things at the same time as we are and we come to learn more about them, why they like their house, and why they are trying to scare the family moving in to leave; I like the interactions between them and Lydia Deetz who finds out she has the ability to see the dead, and how Lydia tires to prove she is not crazy by proving there are ghosts in the house. Lydia Deetz played well by Winona Ryder was a good character, though she seems like a normal kid who is into dark stuff, she becomes more of a likable character, and you like seeing her on screen; the rest of the cast in the Deetz family are entertaining and funny in their own weird way that can either make sense or no sense, like Catherine O'Hara as Delia Deetz who had quite a bit of funny scenes along with her having some kind of profession as someone who likes to do art sculptures.Michael Keaton is excellent Beetlejuice, though he is not in the film that much, he is still entertaining and funny throughout the film with him still having that funny humor and entertaining personality because of some quick jokes or the weird things he tends to do when interacting off the rest of the characters; for most of the film he is just in this model graveyard in a model Adam made, which is done well with great effects. It is great seeing this film use practical effects and stop-motion in certain monster designs or when Beetlejuice is doing weird things, along with the film using models and sets that were looked good along with the cinematography on how they show it and the way they do the sandworm sequences; but what you expect from a Tim Burton film is a score by Danny Elfman, and the score by Danny Elfman is still excellent to listen to, other than that there is not much of an issue with this film other than maybe an occasional dated effect or song.The film Beetlejuice (1988) is funny and entertaining with great performances, well-done stop-motion animation, great practical effects and sets, a fun creepy tone, cool ways to explore the afterlife, a great antagonist, and interesting rules about how the dead operates or coexists with the living; the film runs at a good pace with the couple dying and learning about the dead, and then calling Beetlejuice for some help that backfires, which shows that ghosts trying to get rid of the humans in the house instead of the other way around is a good twist on what we essentially have seen before. This film is already a classic for most people, and it is a film that is good to watch around the Halloween season because of the cool and creepy tone of the film; this is why people like it all these years later, because it is a simple creepy and fun movie you can watch and rewatch over and over again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just watched it. Again. For the I don't remember how many times.,"As you can see in the title I just re-watched this movie. It has been a long time since the last time, and I remembered I used to enjoy it a lot. On IMDb I saw that once I gave it a 10 so I knew I needed to re-watch it. I was not a mistake. Boy did I have a good time seeing this movie again, being invested with these wonderful characters, and being both in love, disgusted and creeped out by Betelgeuse (Yes, this is how you spell his name). I just love this movie and can't get enough from it. I now agree with me from the past that gave it a 10. This movie deserves a 10, for delivery of pure entertainment full of interesting world building, fun characters (even the Deetz's which you love to hate) and well thought out designs.

Visually entertaining,"This movie, about the spirits of a deceased couple who are harassed by an unbearable family that has moved into their home, is a good, dark comedy movie!After being impressed by the first act, it can get slightly bland a few times for the rest of the movie because the story takes time to develop. There has also been given much room for hit-or-miss humor and ""filler"" moments"", which is a mixed bag.However, the movie is super creative with its visuals! It is amazing how much effort that has been put in the visual and practical effects in each scene, and that makes the movie somewhat entertaining for the whole runtime, which is the main reason for movies, at least to me.Despite some slow moments and mixed humor, this movie remains a visually stunning dark comedy.

His ramblings throughout the film sounded like nothing more than a busted chainsaw.  I literally found myself getting more angry as the movie progressed.  The entire concept of the ""Dark Candy Land"" only added to the level of complete and utter stupidity.  Also, the end of the movie was absolutely fitting.(very pathetic and very annoying)  In conclusion, there was not one redeeming quality in this entire film.  It was terrible from beginning to end.

Indoor Outhouse,"Hyperbolic as it may sound, there has never quite been another film like Beetlejuice. Vomited from the maniacal mind of Tim Burton, before his name became tantamount to an adjective, the film is such a flurry of paradoxes that it really shouldn't work. But work it does, not so much bending genres as warping and distorting them like the monstrous pantomime faces scrunched by its ghostly protagonists – a ghoulishly zany live action cartoon filled with wonderful weirdness, and an unequivocal 80s classic.Only Burton could transmogrify the horror of life after death into a rambunctiously mischievous fairy tale, but the snarkily cheerful Leave it to Beaver New England introduction proves a perfect setup to the ensuing punchline of the afterlife. Naturally, in the hands of dear Tim, the true horror of death lies not in the exquisitely realized, gruesomely surreal Dune-like wasteland of horrific stop motion leviathans, but in purgatory ultimately functioning as a garish, never-ending bureaucratic waiting room, with drawling receptionists thumbing copies of pedantic instruction manuals. The horror the horror!Indeed, for all its zaniness and Tex Avery-style slapstick, Beetlejuice is a film brimming with surprising heart and cleverness. Burton has always been at his pitch-black, satirical best ripping apart ideologies of 'normal life', and he has a ball equally taking jabs at our goodhearted ghostly protagonists (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, both charmingly flustered), who are tickled pink by the prospect of a 'staycation' cooped up refurbishing their home, or the house's posthumous inhabitants (the deliciously demented Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara), who tastelessly claw at postmodern décor or oafishly Machiavellian capitalism, goaded on by their preening design consultant Otho (the note-perfect Glen Shadix). By contrast, it's pretty easy to sympathize with their goth daughter (Winona Ryder at her surly, adorable best), who cheerfully pens suicide notes beginning with ""I am *utterly* alone"" before it was cool.This all goes without mentioning the film's star attraction: Michael Keaton, as the titular sh*t- disturbing Bio-Exorcist. Keaton's career-defining performance is truly on another level of comedic genius, as he roars through the film like a Tasmanian devil Rumplestiltskin, riffing, swearing, crotch-honking, and guzzling scenery like the demonic snake he eventually transforms into. It's a tantamount to Keaton's wacky, manic charisma that he's barely in his own movie, and yet provides one of the most unforgettable filmic characters of all time from essentially an extended cameo.And yet, the film's most bizarrely impressive accolade is, in spite of this cauldron of seething, seemingly antithetical weirdness, Burton has managed to stir up a strangely, unprecedentedly feel-good film. Somehow, in its mad tornado of satire, gorgeously oddball visuals, and adventurously eccentric performances, seasoned with Danny Elfman at his infectiously bouncy best, and sprinkled with a couple of Harry Belafonte Calypso dance numbers for good measure (naturally), Burton's Gothic ode to the afterlife couldn't surge with more life and vibrancy. Beautifully grotesque and morbidly heartfelt, for audiences familiar or inexperienced, it's unquestionably worth reciting the name three times, and uncorking the spectacular insanity of Beetlejuice.(It's show time!)-9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"He's Twisted, Bent, And Ready To Rent!...","Director Tim Burton's BEETLEJUICE is one of the funniest supernatural-horror comedies ever made, and one of the most original.

"The main problem with ""Beetlejuice"" is that its supposed main character, Beetlejuice, or ""geuse,"" doesn't seem to hold any relevancy to the plot. He's there, but why?","The main problem with ""Beetlejuice"" is that its supposed main character, Beetlejuice, or ""geuse,"" doesn't seem to hold any relevancy to the plot. He's there, but why? He doesn't really make up the film at all. His total time on-screen is probably about thirty minutes, yet they play him up as if he is what the film is about.The film starts off with a newlywed couple, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, moving into an old house in the middle of nowhere. However, their lives are cut short after they die in a car accident.But their actual spirits are far from dead. They are attached to their house, and they cannot leave, or ""sandworms"" will kill them. Er, kill them more than they are killed already, I suppose. I guess Tim Burton didn't realize that dead people can't die. Anyway...Soon, a couple (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) move into the home with their gothic daughter, Winona Ryder. They redecorate the home, much to the dislike of Jeffrey, and pretty much change everything about the house.This makes ghosts Geena and Alec mad, and they want the new occupants of their home out. As Baldwin says in one scene, ""Do you want to have to eat breakfast with these people for the rest of our lives?"" I'm not sure if this line is meant to be funny, since they are already dead, or if it is supposed to be serious. It's hard to tell in this film that confuses the dead for the living many, many times.So the two ghosts take a trip to the other side, where they learn from a dead counselor that they must scare the owners out of the ghosts' old home if they want them to leave.The couple of ghosts try this haunting thing in an effort to scare the new home-owners out of THEIR home. But, unfortunately, O'Hara and Jones only find the supernatural figures living in their attic amusing and see it as a profit.The two ghosts are left with no choice. They call upon Beetlegeuse (Michael Keaton) to help them rid the house of its unwanted occupants. Beetlegeuse is called upon by saying his name three times, a technique later to be ripped-off in ""Candyman."" He comes, he tries to rid the home, but in the process causes a lot of mayhem.But here's the catch. Beetlegeuse comes in about an hour into the film, which is only some 90 minutes long. You do the math. He is not in the film nearly enough.The beginning is quite good, but they should either have a) sped up the beginning a bit more to fit more time with Beetlegeuse in or b) made the film a half hour longer, which would probably have been a better choice. Michael Keaton is wild in his role, and entertaining. His sporadic and crazy personality is a mix between Ace Ventura and Jerry Lewis, only ten times funnier.. And I would liked to have seen him some more before the credits started rolling.The film takes too much time setting everything up, when, in fact, it could have been set up in half the time. Beetlegeuse just doesn't get enough screen-time, and because of this, he seems like an empty character that pays nothing to the plot, even though the entire film is named after him. He comes, he scares the people twice, and then he disappears. Credits.If you really analyze the film, you will realize that with Beetlegeuse (the character), the plot really gained nothing.  He doesn't really pay anything to the plot at all. He scares the occupants once or twice (which wasn't Keaton but visual effects one of the times). This could have been done with someone else. He saves the ghosts from dying at the end. This could have been done by the dead counselor from the other side.Of course, that wouldn't have made the film any good, but my point that is Beetlegeuse really didn't need to be in the film. The writers could easily have put existing characters in his place to do actions he performs. This is bad for a film that is named after a character who barely appears in it at all, and really pays no relevancy whatsoever.The writers apparently wrote themselves into a corner with Beetlegeuse (the character). What does his character give to the plot? What is the relevancy? Nothing, really, as I said before. They should have skimmed on the other characters (like the dead counselor) and played up Beetlegeuse a bit. Then the film would have been a whole lot better than it is.I suppose the sheer originality of the film makes it worth seeing, and one of the scenes involving a group of people being possessed and singing and dancing is very funny. But again, the filmmakers should have taken more time to write Beetlegeuse into the script before they started filming.3/5 stars -John Ulmer",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A child wonderland, mature nightmare","It is always amazing to think about our childhood as a different era. We like to think of our infant years as living life as a different person. After recently watching this film, I found this to be inevitably true.At a much younger age I had the privilege of watching Tim Burtons 'Beetlejuice' and was taken aback by this wonderment of fiction versus reality. Ghosts, ghouls, a freaky child, a scary woman and a clown-like rogue who everyone can't help but love - Beetlejuice. Sounds like the perfect recipe for a good comedy, well not if you're over the age of ten.Beetlejuice - revisited was a disappointment. I was alarmed at the wooden performance given by Alec Baldwin as Adam, a man who is recently deceased and has to face life as an immortal along with his wife Barbara - Geena Davis. Now I do understand that it is a family comedy and brilliant acting is not essential but I was alarmed that he actually agreed to star in this film.The story is pretty straight forward. Adam and Barbara become the undead, and a new, obnoxious family move into their home. Adam and Barbara still live there, but as they are dead they cannot be seen, except by the family's goth-like daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder.) The couple take a liking to Lydia and she begins to help the couple in their distress. They are unable to come to terms with their new selves and are drawn into dealings with the great 'Beetlejuice,' a helper of the recently deceased. However, as time passes Beetlejuice's antics as a troublesome rogue become too much for everyone.Overall it is a good film for children, it has the impish comedy seen in films like 'Home Alone,' and it would most definitely occupy a younger viewer. An advantage is that it stars Michael Keaton as the indelible 'Beetlejuice' and his performance is worthy of a look., as always.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loony surrealist classic!,"Tim Burton's Beetlejuice was not marketed as a surrealist film when it came out, and as such no one remembers it for the batshit crazy journey into the absurd that it treats you to. It's touted as a slightly subversive, yet also vaguely family friendly ghost romp, and yes, that's the jist of it, yet hidden beneath the lines that people can read between if they are keen enough, is a completely organic stream of nonsensical, almost dreamlike events, threaded together by a shaky theme of life after death. Michael Keaton portrays rambunctious zombie bio exorcist Betelgeuse in a face smacking, loony toon of a performance that's the best of his interesting and varied career. He's a whackjob wonder, a perverted pile of silliness with a mean streak a mile long and a penchant for all kinds of bizarre paranormal mischief. He's called to action when a quaint, naive New England couple (gorgeous Geena Davis and an oh so young Alec Baldwin) perish in an auto accident and are looking to rid their home of its insufferable new inhabitants. They arrive in the form of gag inducing trendy NYC interior designer Otho (Glenn Shadix RIP) who acts like he walked right out of a satirical episode of South Park), Charles (Jeffrey Jones the lovable bugger) and Delia Deetz (a spastic Catherine O Hara) and their cutie daughter Lydia (an emo Winona Ryder, one of my first movie crushes ♡♡). They walk right in like they own the place (well.. they kinda do) with dastardly plans to remodel it to their eyebrow raising yuppie fashion fanaticism. Baldwin and Davis see no other option but to summon Keaton, by saying his odd name three times. After that, all bets are off as Betelgeuse leers right out of the astral plane to cause no end of trouble for literally everyone, including himself. Keaton soars like he hasn't since then, giving a performance that makes the Joker, the Mask and Bugs Bunny seem like introverts. There's a constant cascade of phenomenal practical effects and gooey makeup on display, as well. When Davis and Baldwin venture into the afterlife beyond their home into the cluttered bureaucracy of the spirit world, we're treated to all sorts of sights, sounds and an out of this world creative aesthetic that honestly seems like Burton entered someone's dreams on the night before Halloween and pulled out all kinds of wonder for the viewer to behold. From a DMV like waiting room for deceased souls, to a football team that doesn't realize they're dead yet, to a massive snake with Keaton's ugly mug on the end of it, there's just no stop to the jaw dropping spectacle on display. Sylvia Sydney is dryly hilarious as an otherworld-weary afterlife caseworker, and there's fun bits from Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett and more as well. For something truly unexpected, endlessly creative and undefinable, check it out. Although I assume that anyone reading this has at least seen this five times, if not more.

It Has A Charm But Is Massively Overrated,"Pros:
1. Michael Keaton (Betelgeuse) delivers an amazingly energetic and magnetic performance.2. Alec Baldwin (Adam) and Geena Davis (Barbara) have incredible chemistry together and it's that which powers the first half of the movie along.3. The set designs are well made and intriguing. They also help add to the overall charm of the film.4. The practical effects, although slightly dated, still look great in addition to adding further charm.Cons:
1. The special effects haven't aged well at all and are very distracting.2. Betelgeuse doesn't arrive properly until about 47 minutes into the movie. The film definitely picks up when he arrives as it's a little too slow-paced before then.3. The character of Otho (Glenn Shadix) is pretty much redundant. Most of what he does could have been done by one of the parents but he's given a lot of screen time.4. A lot of the humour feels dated and stale.5. How Barbara and Adam pass away is a little unrealistic and corny: there's no way a dog could have supported the weight of a car, and there's no way they would have died from that height.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This film is one of the kind!,"Beetlejuice is a Full-length black comedy film produced in 1988. The script, the direction and the overall style of the film is done by Tim Berton. The premise of the film isn't anything new - a haunted house. However, the perspective is different - we root for the ghosts and hope they succeed. The ghosts of previous house owners are played by Alec Boldwin and Geena Davis as Adam and Barbara Maitland. Those characters are written to be ""normal"". They are not self-righteous or mean-spirited, those two are average everyday people who are tossed in an unfamiliar world. Adam and Barbara, in fact, even struggle to scare the only inhabitant of the house that sees them - Lydia Deetz played by Winona Ryder. Delia and Charles Deetz are stepmother and father of Lydia that are played by Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones respectively. Those two are not horrible people in any way, but they are neglectful of their daughter. The concluding character of the main cast is the title character Beetlejuice, played masterfully by star actor Michael Keaton. Beetlejuice is a ghost, hired by Adam and Barbara to scare off the Deetz. Whenever Beetlejuice is on screen, he outshines everyone else. This character showcases everything that is great about this film: clever black humor, captivating acting and astonishing practical effects. He looks unpleasant, like a corpse, freshly dug from a grave. The practical effects that are used not only are memorable and unique due to Tim Berton's vision but also are cleverly used for jokes and atmosphere. However, some digital effects are clearly outdated, but not in a way of ruining the picture- it caches the eye, but you promptly forget about it in a minute or two.

Michael Keaton is the show,"For me, it's Michael Keaton's interpretation of the title character that makes the picture. As the free lance bio-exorcist straight from (can I say it?) hell, he brings a manic quality to the character that just cracks me up even today. To this date, whenever I hear someone say 'It's showtime', it's Keaton's showtime I'm reminded of.Some will say this is a macabre story, but it's got a strange balance of wit and humor. My favorite scene is the Da-yo sequence, seemingly coming out of nowhere with no connection to the events of the story, but it captures just the right tone to make the film enjoyable. Other little quirks like the 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased' and the 'Lost Souls Room' are curiously amusing as well. Probably the best gag in the picture was that cool tribute to Vincent Price's 1959 flick ""The Fly"", in that scene with the Zagnut Bar and the fly crying 'Help me, help me'. You just have to see that earlier picture to get it.With Alec Baldwin's recent conflicted real life history, I can't say that I'm any kind of fan of his, but he does a fair enough job here. Geena Davis is always pleasing to see, and I recall this early film appearance of Winona Ryder with some fondness. The coolest casting surprise in the movie was Sylvia Sidney as the after-life spiritual guide. Hey, she worked with some of the best in her career - Bogart, Cagney, Raft and Hitchcock - and you can't get any better than that.If you're an old time movie or TV fan, you've probably seen an episode or two of 'Topper'. Well ""Beetlejuice"" is like 'Topper' on steroids, but without the St. Bernard. You know, that would have been a good idea, so if anyone's thinking of a remake, that would be a good starting point.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most fun half-movies ever made,"This movie is well worth watching, though I think the problem more often is accomplishing NOT watching it during one of its 30-40 showings a week on Comedy Central, WGN, TBS, TNT, or the Disney Channel.I find myself watching Beetlejuice every now and then when it comes on, but have noticed that I always turn it off half-way through.  The opening of this movie, with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the daffy and clueless Maitlands, then the fun advent of Catherine O'Hara as the ditzy artist without a clue and Jeffrey Jones as her suffering and pretentious husband is an absolute riot.  As the Maitlands try to run these flakes out of their home we get a thoroughly wacky view of the afterlife.  I must admit I'm not that thrilled with the stereotypically Goth character in Winona Ryder (she is capable of much better).  But, this stuff is darn fun.  The scenes in the afterlife office are particularly fun.Then Michael Keaton positively steals the show.  And, he should be arrested for it.  Keaton plays ""the ghost with the most"", an obvious stand-up act that takes over the remainder of the movie.  Any possibilities for interesting scenes are robbed by an endless tirade of ""I'm gross"" jokes. He's not that bad at it, but it's BORING.  You rapidly get fatigued and tune it out.  It's like they decided to take several strong actors and turn them all into props.  It ruins the entire second half of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
TIM BURTON'S BEST MOVIE & A NOSTALGIC CHILDHOOD CLASSIC,"Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's best movie in my opinion, it's a funny-crazy & totally inventive supernatural comedy.We love Beetham because it's a comfort film, by now us kids have grown up & still love this weird movie. Everything about BeetleJuice feels so full of life, there's an energy that Tim Burton created, & a magic that has lasted. BeetleJuice is a timeless Classic that still feels like a nice, warm Nostalgic hug as soon as that incredible music starts playing over the beginning titles, there's a charm there, truly movie magic was created with it's own weird & wonderful rhythm. I love Tim Burton's Batman films, i grew up watching & loving them both on video, but it's BeetleJuice i come bk to more than any other film he has made, there's definitely something there that's wonderful.We all get that cosy feeling whilst watching BeetleJuice as we follow the characters around that big beautiful old house, just lovely classic stuff here.Truthfully, Burton made a real feel-good film with BeetleJuice, a film that is good-natured supernatural fun & is full of creative energy, humour & charm.That iconic opening with that awesome music score!!! Massive, beautiful Nostalgia-filled love for this film. BeetleJuice was a huge part of my childhood, i loved the movie (along with Ghostbusters 1&2) loved supernatural stuff. I also grew up on Tim Burton's Batman & Batman Returns (both Classic's). Also i had lots of the BeetleJuice action figures & i loved the animated series, so yeah BeetleJuice had a huge impact on me. I also grew up on Home Alone 1&2, there for i love that great actress, CATHERINE O'HARA & she's fantastic as fancy eccentric artist, Delia Deetz in BeetleJuice, she's fabulous & pretty much steals the show!!!Alec Baldwin has never been as likeable as he is here.Geena Davis is the best I've ever seen her here, & the most likeable. These two great actors played perfectly as the married couple, Adam & Barbara Maitland, that accidentally die in an accident & end up as Ghost's, trapped within their own house.The yuppies that come to live in the big beautiful house are hilarious, as we already know them & their iconic characters.Also, Winona Ryder (also great in Alien Resurrection) gave such an iconic performance as the strange & gothic teenager, Lydia.I also liked the chubby, bubbly & eccentric GLEN SHADIX (RIP) that popped up in many fun films (Dunston Checks In, Demolition Man, Sleepwalkeers) & in many TV series (a great Halloween-themed episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air) & loads more t.v stuff, including lots of awesome voice work for many classic cartoons.The BeetleJuice Waiting Room is iconic & so is the dance around the dinner table, so many fantastically memorable & iconic Classic scenes in this movie.This is one of those 80's CLASSIC's i grew up on along with the likes of Ghostbusters 1&2 & Death Becomes Her, among others, these were fun, spooky comedies full of fantastic special effects that were great for it's time well before c.g.i completely took over & the fx back then actually were special!!!Tim Burton crafted a beautifully designed fantasy Horror comedy, the visual look is fantastic with it's big gothic cartoony style & colourful sets & incredible creature designs, this is Burton at his creative best in my opinion!!!Burton's whacky spirit world is so creative & gorgeous to look at (amazing production design & use of colours) , he really put his demented heart & tortured soul into the creation of his spooky vision that became our beloved vhs favourite, BeetleJuice.The atmosphere is nightmare weird & cartoony strange but not in a threatening way, it's more a fun fantasy feel to the film with many creative bits popping out at you.The cast is great fun & so memorable.Especially BeetleJuice himself!!!Michael Keaton is excellent in his most iconic role as the crazy-menacing & hilarious evil spirit ""BeetleJuice"" his performance is legendary now & he's full of life for a dead guy lol, he's great fun. Of course the great Keaton would go on to become the legendary & CLASSIC, Batman.BeetleJuice is a pure 80's CLASSIC movie, i grew up loving this on video & also collected all the Awesome action figures from the movie, great nostalgia for this fun, gothic Horror-comedy.This is Director Tim Burton at his absolute best in my opinion!!!The big haunted house is a beautiful set peice & the production design of the supernatural otherworldly sets are incredible!!!Also the music is BEAUTIFUL, especially the opening scenes it's just beautifully done.This film makes me long for that lovely lost era of the 80's & early 90's my favourite times as i grew up in those simpler times with these CLASSIC movies.There's some absolute classic scenes in this film such as the waiting room scene full of freaky spirits & the big scary BeetleJuice snake scene, superb moments in a superb movie. I believe BeetleJuice to be a movie that really created ""Movie Magic"" for us kids who grew up watching it at home on video.This is one my favourite movies of all time from Childhood & it gets better with age!!!BeetleJuice is comfort viewing at it's finest.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Revisiting can be a bit disappointing.,"Is this another musical? Ha no not really, but there are a couple of songs and a lot more grotesque stuff than I recall. The music is courtesy of Danny Elfman of course, as with most of Tim Burtons films, they must really like each other. Burton has an odd view of the world, creating his own with a weird mix of cookie-cutter America, small towns, with dark under-bellies. Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davies) are a young couple living... for a short while in a typically quirky Burtonesque house. Within 5 minutes they're dead, having taken their car for a swim off a nearby bridge and wind up living an afterlife in their house, now covered with dust sheets. Not for long though, the house has new owners, the mum from Home Alone, Ed Rooney from Ferris Bueller and their daughter Winona Ryder, the only one who can see Adam and Barbara, who are trapped in the house, failing in their ghostly attempts to scare off the new occupants ruining their home. So far, it's okay, but things really are a bit slow, despite a couple of quirky scenes involving sand worms and the waiting room from hell. Until the arrival of Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, who they call upon as a Bio-exorcist to get back their home. They're warned not to enlist his help, from a chain-smoking lady with a cut throat, who tells them they ought to learn to haunt the house themselves. Which they do, but it turns out The Deets like being haunted, having poltergeists is cool, an asset, especially after possessing their dinner guests in the hilarious 'Day O' scene. Once they've unleashed Beetlejuice through, there's no going back and from here on in, it's an utterly bonkers, off the wall, surreal trip... at least in its design at least, plot-wise it's pretty mundane. Beetlejuice is loud, ugly, filthy in several senses of the word, loud, angry, unhinged, creepy, loud, annoying, perverted, loathsome, lecherous and loud. Totally at odds with Adam and Barbara's preferred way of haunting, y'know, nicely. He's the villain and as the story unfolds, it turns out he's quite pointless too. It's a mix of silly and inappropriate. It might've worked in 1988, but I'm afraid it's dated really badly. The story is simplistic, the characters universally a bit irritating, the special effects, well they're of their day and there's something to be said for that at least. It's heavy on in camera effects and trickery. The make-up department must've had a lot of fun, but I found myself having very little. I know it's much loved and it's not without it's charms. One of Burton's first outings, it's ambitious, creative and stamps his mark, there's a lot to be said for that. It now feels very much the cult film, those who remember and loved it in the 80s, will probably still enjoy it for it's stand out nature, but otherwise revisiting it can be a bit disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Half Charming/Half Over the Top,"From ""Topper"" to ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" to present day, we have had movies where ghosts occupy space with humans and even are in discourse with them (usually, only one of them). In this film, a couple of newlyweds purchase an old house and everything is fine until they are both killed in a car accident. In the afterlife, they continue to occupy the place, but, of course, the house is sold, and another couple moves in. This is disheartening as they now realize they are actually dead. We have a lot of potential here. They decide to drive the new owners out of the house, but they don't know what they can do, so they enlist an evil spirit, played by Michael Keaton, to do their dirty work. The problem is that he is totally uncontrollable and soon they are paying a bigger price than the new occupants. Of course, it's Tim Burton, so it's dark and oddly funny, but Keaton wears on one after a while, and the film slides into all sorts of gimmicky special effects. He is not the least likable, and that works against the charm of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst films ive seen. Childish. Not fun at all.,"I tought this was gonna be a comedy. Instead i was watching a childrens movie. Painfully boring.At the start this remindeded me about the series ""The good place"" (2016-2020), so i was abit intrigued by the plot.However...
First of all, its a good concept that could turn out really fun. But instead they make it so it gets very childish and lame with extremley bad jokes and a lame manuscript, bad music and poor acting.And I know it was made 1988, but the effects are really bad. Aswell the awful music in the beginning like its trying to be a live tv show or something. Really awful filming. Manuscript is awful.Aswell large plotholes that just makes this film even wierder.I can see how this film was good when it got released. But its not really a well made film, especially with this new generations watching this. One of the wierdest films ive ever seen, and not in a good way. Acting is also really bad.I can't understand the high rating.Not funny at all. I wouldn't recommend it. One of the worst films ive seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Totally Awesome!,"I'm not one of those kids that grew up on this movie but after seeing it for the first time tonight, I wish I was. Everything about it was brilliant and perfect for this time of the year. It truly is a shame that we don't see movies like this today and I think this even deserves a higher rating than 7.3 and a spot on the top 250!Who knew that Michael Keaton had it in him? He shows such range in his portrayal of the character of Beetlejuice. This is definitely a Tim Burton film and it shows immensely. The colors, the feel, the music, everything is Tim Burton. And that is a great thing. He's one of the best directors of our time and I hope he decides to create more films like this. The story is also great. Oh hell, everything is!See this movie, especially now that Halloween is upon us. You won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""You're working with a professional here!""","Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelge... dare I say it? Director Tim Burton would follow-up his directorial oddball debut (""PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE"") with another ambitious comedy, this time something very zany, grotesque and surreal in the shape of a riotous supernatural dark spoof. As a kid I grew up watching this film, hey, I even liked the cartoon series. So re-watching it again was a sheer delight. Something I would never tire of.Burton would bring his signature visual gothic flair and live-action cartoon mannerisms to enliven the shallow, dressed up lifestyles in ""BEETLEJUICE"", but what really makes the feature is the very loose performance of Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. Keaton is outstanding in bringing this outrageously rotten character to life, from being menacing, charming the ladies, or simply exorcising a wise-crack. He's truly a head-spin. While he provides a huge impact, the Beetlejuice character doesn't really get a whole lot of screen time, despite his importance to the plot's progression. It's measured in bursts, as his character is virtually a punch-line with legs. But with that in mind, I think it works because Burton never overplays his hand, which makes Keaton's conman persona effective than say overbearing. I don't know if Burton would do the same thing these days.Anyway the narrative was always about Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin's recently deceased young rural couple adapting to the afterlife, while at the same time doing their best to frighten the house's new city-folk occupants that have ideas of changing their new home to meet their own trendy needs. So in a last ditch effort to scare them off they seek help from a freelance bio-exorcist ghost known as Betelgeuse. The compulsive plotting won't surprise (even though Burton throws up an interesting view of the afterlife), but what stands out is the wonderful set-pieces (how can you not grove along to the dinner party sequence as The Banana Boat Song plays), eccentric practical effects (loved the clay-animation), inspired pastel set-designs and wrapping it all together is Danny Elfman's enchantingly whimsical music score. One colorful dimension after another, but even with its comic flourishes it still demonstrates a nasty wickedness.Add to that an amusing cast, peppered with character actors and zesty interplays. Davis and Baldwin were likably good. Jeffery Jones is enjoyably clueless and Catherine O'Hara makes a great ice queen. Winona Ryder is fittingly deadpan as the very aware gothic teenage daughter and Glen Shadix entertains as the family's psychic friend. Also showing up in a memorable part is Silva Sidney as an afterlife caseworker.""BEETLEJUICE"" is a decorative haunted house fun ride and one of Burton's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetle juice is just OK,This movie has a good premise. And really good actors. But it lacks in one actor. Michael Keaton is Beetlejuice barely shows up in this movie. And when he shows up it is really good. But the other 95% of the movie without him the snooze. The goth emo family is quite annoying even though the acting is quite good. The direction make up and set design is really good. I mean it's a Tim Burton movie how can those things not be good in one of his movies. Show me this movie is just OK and didn't give me too many laughs or too many scares it give me an OK amount. 6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Go ahead...Make my millennium""","Beetle Juice... Beetle Juice... Do you have the guts to say it three times? Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) are a newly wed couple but unfortunately an accident takes their lives. Their house is sold and Adam and Barbara are trying to scare the new owners away.

Mild dark comedy.,"BEETLE JUICE is the tale of Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis), a couple who die but don't really know it until they discover a new family moving into their house. This family consists of dad Charles (Jeffrey Jones), stepmom Delia (Catherine O'Hara), and daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). Since Adam and Barbara are confined to their old house by the powers of the afterlife, they call upon ""bio-exorcist"" Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton) to try to get the new family to move out. However, the spirits simply appeal to the family and hence, they don't want to leave. Does Beetle Juice succeed in his mission?This movie is probably considered by many to be Tim Burton's best. It's certainly one of the most popular. But I have to disagree. Though Burton is a master director and is very stylish, BEETLE JUICE just doesn't sit well with me. It's supposed to be a dark comedy, and it is indeed dark, but I definitely don't find it to be very funny. It's not that the idea of making fun of death offends me or anything (actually, quite the contrary); I just don't find the jokes, for the most part, to be humorous.Also, the special effects are incredibly cheesy by today's standards. The Claymation scenes are almost ridiculous, but add a certain charming campiness to the whole film. Burton does set up many classic imageries, however (i.e., the snake, the faces Adam and Barbara put on to try to scare the family, the entire waiting room and its occupants). And there are a few timelessly classic scenes as well--namely, the wedding, the ""Day-oh"" dinner party, and the dancing sequence at the end.The acting is decent. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are both good, if miscast. Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are also good and occasionally funny as the parents of the family, while Winona Ryder puts in a solid and humorous performance as the depressed Lydia, in one of her first acting roles. But I think it was Michael Keaton, in the title role, that completely ruined the film for me. He was certainly charismatic, but I found him to be rather annoying. I also think he got the brunt of the jokes that were supposed to be funny, but aren't. Or maybe it's because of him that they aren't funny.I thought BEETLE JUICE would be a pretty enjoyable dark comedy, but I didn't like it much. A lot of the jokes fail, and Michael Keaton puts in an extremely irritating performance. But, Tim Burton is an excellent director and manages to execute many memorable scenes and visuals. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sleeper hit.,"Tim Burton could do no wrong after risking twice, first to make this movie and secondly, casting Michael Keaton in this most unlikely role. Beetle Juice is a sleeper hit, fast approaching 20 years since its release and not really straying much from quality from when audiences first viewed it. I've seen this movie half a dozen since its release and its never become old yet. To sum it all up, if you're looking for a ghouly comic film with a bit of lighthearted fun and all around creativity, take this review to heart and rent this for Halloween.After moving in, the Maitlands, Adam and Barbara meet a tragic end and receive a handbook and guide to haunting their house. When their amateur efforts prove only to attract the new owners' curious daughter, they are tempted by a 'bio-exorcist' who is nothing but bad news.Burton was given an all star cast to work with in Beetle Juice and the creativity that came from this movie was to be the standard that we expect now from all of Tim's films. But there just isn't enough to work with in a 92 minute film. Sandworms, the world of the dead, Beetle Juice himself aren't nearly as explained enough as they would be in this day and age of information. Beetle Juice needed a sequel, though the cartoon series was just as good a fun hit as the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Burton's best,"I guess I'll be in the minority opinion here in saying that as a whole I don't think this film really works at all. It's rather a series of comic scenes and vignettes played alternately for humor and zany, oddball kookiness (the scene where the ghosts posses the house guests to sing ""Day--Oh!"" as their levitated) rather than a meaningful, coherent story. Having said that, I give it a number of stars for the enjoyable performances of Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis in the title roles, and of course especially the absolutely outstanding portrayal of the used car salesman like poltergeist ""Beetlejuice"" by the extremely talented Michael Keaton. I have literally watched only that part of this movie again a number of times just to watch him say his memorable lines like ""Hey, you're workin' with a professional here!"" or ""Now, where does a guy like me, just a regular Joe, go when he's feeling kinda 'anxious'. . .? Still hilarious now many years later (perhaps they could develop another film just around that character). Also, I have definitely liked much of Tim Burton's other work, and he's impressive in his ability to do both sweet, deeply humane movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and very dark, haunting films like ""Sweeny Todd"". So see ""Beetlejuice"" for Michael Keaton's amazing performance, but see Burton's other films to see Burton at his best.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton's funny horror is also deliciously dark,"After they die, Adam (Baldwin) and Barbara (Davis) come back to their house as ghosts and find a family is moving in and the couple try to scare them away with help from bio-exorcist Beetlejuice.Tim Burton's reputation as the darkest and most Gothic director started here with a bizarre but wonderfully different tale of the dead and is both funny, and yet psychological scary, and brings a niche to the market in a strange and sophisticated way.The film has a terrific opening with Danny Elfman's score exquisite to the bird's eye view of the town going past and the upbeat music plays right into our hands and will gear you up ready for the horror and excitement to begin.Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) impresses as ambitious Adam and has good on screen chemistry with Geena Davis (Thelma and Louise) and the pair create many laughs and are a joy to watch, especially when playing around with the sheets.Winona Ryder (Girl, interrupted) gives a great performance as Lydia, the weird and wonderful teenager, who gives the film a more serious and realistic feel against Keaton's comic Beetlejuice.The star of the show is Keaton (Batman) who plays bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, a crazed man who is evil, eccentric and enjoyable to watch, because he is weird and different, one of Tim Burton's finest creations, right up there with Edward Scissorhands. Beetlejuice is just so weird that he is almost lovable. What makes these characters work is the writing.The plot is very consistent, if seeming a bit weird and far fetched to begin, with plenty of dark humour and amazing characters. There is plenty of physical comedy and some slapstick which spreads the humour through different characters. The dialogue is pitched well, also giving some cheesy but really likable puns on the dead.The ideology of ghosts is covered well, playing on human interpretations and putting twists and turns on this idea, and making it funny through a book for the dead.The settings make this different to, with a different look upon heaven and hell, and the model of the town plays a great small yet significant setting. The colour and lighting hep achieve the dark and sinister feel of the narrative, as does the Oscar winning make up.Tim Burton has created some wonderful films in his directing career, and whereas this film isn't as powerful as Sweeney Todd or Edward Scissorhands, it is easily the funniest and a joy to watch",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Save that for later""","After re-watching the movie recently.. I can't really pinpoint as to why I remember liking Beetlejuice a LOT as a child! Probably the cartoon?I mean, you still cannot take away the weird creativity of Tim Burton's imaginative world building and interesting storytelling and details. It's raunchy, fun and very original. You have dead trapped in the world of living, a DMV-like afterlife and businessmen wanting to monetize ghostly-trickery! But I feel ""Betelgeuse"" was a bit more straightforward and simplistic movie than I remember it being. Which was a shame.. even if I had fun. But it is a classic for a reason, but I think Burton has made better films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kind of surprising that Burton sides with the yuppies.,"This is classic Burton. It has the macabre sense of humor and eccentric design. The film is much better as a piece of visual experience than as a story. The tone is dark whimsey. Overall this is everything you would want from a Burton film.I wish Keaton got more screen time because he is easily the best part of the film. He gives such an gonzo, over-the-top performance. Beetlejuice the character stays with you and pretty much everything out of his mouth is comedic gold. If nothing else Keaton is worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch this.The one thing I found odd or noteworthy is the young couple who's house is invaded-and thus have the audience's sympathy-is so normal, so suburban. . This is especially the case because the Ryder clan isn't-I think the contrast works in context but judging from the rest of Burton's film you would expect the two families to be reversed. That is the new family would be trying to de-weirdify the home of a couple of eccentrics because they are suburbanites. Maybe Burton felt the normal couple had to learn to be weird as a character arc but it isn't what one would expect given Burton's general vibe.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most wacky characters of the 80's!,"One of Tim Burton's first major productions turns out to be a huge success that introduces him to the world. Everything here has the Burton stamp, from the plot that talks about ghosts and spooky things to the production design that follows the rubric of what the director would continue to do through the years.Beetlejuice is a hilarious film with a protagonist so crazy that he doesn't even care about being politically correct.On the technical aspects, the film is well done, but it is sloppy. The photography plays with light and color, but when it needs to be properly lit, it fails on several occasions. The editing also has a couple of stumbles that are justified by the condensation of the feature length film to last only 90 minutes.If we go to the highlights, in my opinion they are Keaton's performance and the soundtrack. Two important pillars, among some others, for Beetlejuice to be what it is.Recommended for an adult audience, as it contains certain gestures and mannerisms of the protagonist that are not suitable for the little ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It could be noting else than a 10!,"This movie is so quirky and original. It can be enjoyed by everyone and is a triumph in cinema.Tim Burton delivered a movie that in my opinion will be forever his best work. Introducing so many amazing characters into one movie is difficult but Burton does this without missing a beat.The visuals are intentionally bad, only adding to the charm of the movie. The performances across the board are exceptional, none more than Michael Keaton who delivers his best performance.This is one of the few 80's movies that I believe has a real need to have a sequel. The possibilities are endless and if the original cast could be acquired this would be a huge success.In short if you haven't seen Beetlejuice add this to your watch list now. You are in for a treat from start to finish in this one of a kind unique look at the afterlife and removal of the living from haunted homes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but certain elements prevent it from being great","I first saw this movie a couple years ago when it came on TV on Halloween. I had recently seen some reruns of ""Beetlejuice"", the cartoon series loosely based on this live action movie, after not seeing any of it in over a decade (since the early 1990s, when I was probably six or seven), but didn't really like it anymore. However, I WAS impressed with this movie when I first saw it. I even found it more enjoyable during later viewings, and liked it a lot! After not seeing it for a while, I just watched it again last night, but wasn't nearly as impressed with it as I was before.Barbara and Adam Maitland are a married couple who live in a large house in a rural New England town. One day, on their way home, just as they are about to cross a bridge, they see a dog in front of them, and quickly try to stop. They don't run over the dog, but they do fall off the bridge in their car and crash into the river! They quickly arrive back home, thinking they survived the accident, but soon learn that they are dead, and if they try to leave the house, they will find themselves in a dangerous place! It gets worse when an annoying family moves in, and the Maitlands are stuck with them! The recently deceased couple attempt to scare this family out of the house, but cannot seem to succeed. Is giving in and using a fellow ghost named Beetlejuice the answer, despite warnings?!Some say that this movie gets better with more than one viewing, and a while ago, after watching it several times, I could see what they meant. However, after my most recent viewing, I can't imagine ever enjoying it as much as I used to again. I still found some parts funny, but found that most of the funny parts involve Beetlejuice, and he certainly doesn't have the biggest part in the movie. Michael Keaton's performance (as Beetlejuice) is the only one that really stands out, the other performances are really nothing special. The movie is exciting in some parts, but also a bit dull in others. Fortunately, the good in this movie does outweigh the bad to some extent.""Beetle Juice"" is a very imaginative motion picture, but that doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece. Tim Burton is a director with unique vision, and many strongly admire him, while some think he's a terrible filmmaker. Personally, I am a fan, but this is not one of my favourites of his. If you don't like Burton's films in general, I don't think this particular film would be any exception, so if you haven't already seen it, I don't suggest you ever do. On the other hand, if you are a fan of the director, and like movies that combine the comedy and horror genres, you would probably like ""Beetle Juice"". You could even like it better with more than one viewing, though this MIGHT not be permanent.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton's finest,"To me, this will always be Tim Burton's best, and it's no contest. The exact perfect combination of creepy, funny, weird and colorful. You always forget how little Beetlejuice is in the movie despite being the namesake, too. He doesn't actually show his face until exactly halfway through the movie.So much in this movie is so iconic. Everyone in the afterlife is beautiful, spinning it as a bunch of public service social workers is brilliant, the design of the sandworms is still incredible as heck, I love Delia's weird sculptures, Otho's terrible pretentiousness, the house, the miniature town, Lydia wearing a funeral veil to the dinner table, all of it.And, of course, Beetlejuice himself. What an incredible, icky character. I sometimes think about what the Genie from Disney's Aladdin did to pop-culture, but Beetlejuice here fills a very similar archetype a full five years before Aladdin. It's just, y'know, BJ is the most wickedly sleazy man you've ever known.Heck of a movie. Generation defining cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Tim Burton, the early years.","Well, to be honest, this movie was better in my memory than it actually turned out to be when I just recently re-watched it again.I really like Tim Burton and than of course especially the style and atmosphere that he always brings to his movies. In that regard this movie is also really a typical Tim Burton movie. It however is also a very early Tim Burton movie. The only major movie that he had done before this one was ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"". Seems to me that in those early days he was still somewhat searching for the right balance between the visuals, quirkiness and a story. The balance in this movie is at times still a bit off, with makes it a somewhat awkward movie at times.Still I can appreciate ""Beetle Juice"" for being the cult-classic that it is. It's certainly a different movie and obviously a very well made one. It's a fun, light-hearted movie, even with all of its heavy subjects that are actually in it. I mean after all, this is a movie about death. But death never looked so colorful and hysterical.The movie knows how not too take itself ever too serious and lots of stuff in the movie and its story simply make no sense. They simply decided not to let it. It's were part of the movie its quirkiness comes from.But of course visuals also play an important role in that. If you have seen a Tim Burton movie before and of course you have, you'll know that his movies are very visually orientated and he has his very own distinctive style. This time the movie is not just partly Gothic looking it's also obviously inspired by German expressionism. Like basically all of his movie, it's a very surreal one but above all also constantly entertaining to watch.Quite amazing to watch these days the actors that are in this movie. None of them were really big names at the time but they soon become after this movie. The most obvious names are Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton. I wished the movie had more of Michael Keaton in it as it though, as Beetlejuice. He's one over-the-top going, crazy, fun clown like character that can be hired in the afterlife as a bio-exorcist to scare out the living. But we also really shouldn't forget Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix who both were also really hilarious and perfectly cast in their roles.One of the other things that really adds perfectly to the movie its atmosphere, besides its impressive imaginative visuals, is the musical score by Danny Elfman. Ever since ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" he has pretty much scored Tim Burton's every work.Even though it is not as smooth as a movie, especially story-wise, it still is an early Tim Burton movie that is worth seeing.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetle Juice,I don't get the point to the film at all very boring,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Surreal and ingenious black comedy, one of the best!","Tim Burton is a man to be commended for his imagination, and Beetlejuice, his second ""mainstream"" theatrical film, is pure undiluted Burton. All the imagination comes out in this wonderful film. It's a black comedy, although not too dark to be called ""bleak."" In a way, it's actually very cartoonish, thanks to Burton's brilliant direction that leads to many surreal scenes. Beetlejuice himself is a marker of insanity, his contrasts to the main characters are visible from a mile away. While Beetlejuice is a filthy, loudmouthed, perverted, and ultimately quite twisted, the Maitland's are calm and down to Earth, acting much like they would had they never even died. Each character in this film has their own unique quirk, even the ""extras"" that appear in the afterlife. Many nameless characters are memorable just by their looks.With all of Burton's madness running amok, it's hard not to laugh or delight over the exquisite detail put into the films finer work. While the special effects may not ""wow,"" the stop motion is great and represents Burton's style in a very refined way, and the makeup is still impressive years later, especially the scene where Adam and Barbara are briefly resurrected. No wonder it won an Oscar for it.The biggest problem I have with Beetlejuice is that I felt if they had added a little more time on, some ideas hinted at could be realized in a better way. There are many ideas that are called attention to, but ultimately ignoured. Even the malevolent sandworms and their nameless homeland are mentioned and shown, but their purpose or origin are never explained. Beetlejuice himself raises some questions as well, where he's from, how he got into the Maitland's house, and there are some plot holes considering how to resurrect him; by saying his name Three Times, yet they never explain why *he* can't say his name, and if saying it three times resurrects him or gives him power, why does saying it again banish him? It deserves a little more explanation.Despite that, Beetlejuice is a very fun watch, and if you haven't seen it even 21 years after it's release, go out and find a copy right now!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Strangely entertaining!,"starring: Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, Glen Shadix, Michael Keaton, Sylvia Sydney, Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett and Tony Cox.Extremely nice people Barbra(Davis)and Adam(Baldwin) in a freak car accident. After the funeral, they become ghosts and try to haunt the owners of their house(Mom-Catherine O'Hara, Dad-Jeffrey Jones and strange daughter Ryder). Lisa(Ryder) can see them and gets pictures of them. They go to the death side and talk to their agent Juno(Sydney), which doesn't do any good, so they resort to bio-exorcist Beetlegeuse(Keaton). Some problems with this movie are that some of it doesn't make sense, like the dinner table haunting song, and that title character Beetlegeuse, only has around 15 minutes of screen time, only having 5 minutes in the first hour of the film. But, nonetheless, Keaton does a great job as that little evil demon, Ryder is great, Sydney is really cool, and my personal favorite is Glenn Shadix as Otho, the flamboyant plumo interior designer that thinks he can control the paranormal. Stupid, but fun!Watch for Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet as friends of the family that are invited to dinner, at separate occasions.rated PG for strong language(the dreaded F-word is used), gory violent images and some sexual refferneces. 2 3/4 out of 4 stars. 87 mins.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There Goes The Neighborhood...,"The Maitlands and The Dietzes: two families who have nothing in common except the house they both live in. So what's the twist? Well, actually...the Dietzes are a family you'd probably WANT to see dead. The Maitlands? They already are.Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) and her husband, Adam (Alec Baldwin), have just moved into a sweet little country house, when the unthinkable happens...thanks to a freak car accident, the whole line about ""till Death do us part"" has actually taken on a whole new meaning for them. But they've been parted from life, not from each other. And if you're thinking that death is all that different from the life they just left behind, think again. The Afterlife can be just as fraught with complications and peril, not the least of which finds the poor couple stranded in an 'alternative universe'-version of their house.Enter the Dietzes. Pretentious, social-status fixated richies Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and their Goth-obsessed daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder), who proceed to turn the Maitlands' quaint little cottage into an avant-garde nightmare that only Hieronymus Bosch - or Salvador Dali - could love.What are two frustrated, spatially-stranded spooks to do? There's actually a sort of ""Health and Haunted Services"" system in the Great Beyond that provides assistance in the form of caseworkers (who are about as helpful in death as they are in life), and Adam and Barbara's ""help"" comes in the form of the cynical and cancerous Juno, (the great Sylvia Sidney), who goes completely by the book...but does tip the deceased darlings off to one dangerously unpredictable possibility for a resolution of their problem.His name, as you know by now, is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) - or as more commonly known - ""Beetlejuice."" He's a caseworker turned ""independent contractor"", which means he's bad news for the Maitlands, worse news for the Dietzes, and the best thing to happen to horror-comedies since three guys named Venkman, Spengler and Stanz. Say his name three times, and let the mirthful mayhem begin!Audiences couldn't get enough of Tim Burton's uniquely twisted perspective on the world after his first major movie, PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE exploded onto movie screens, and no one knew what to expect for his follow-up. Good thing, too, because there was no way to anticipate or explain this screwy and satisfying story of ghosts being haunted by a living family more scary than they are, and the outrageous entity out to fleece them both for his own purposes, (not the least of which is to get a little cuddle time in with the languishingly lovely Lydia.)How a literal army of writers managed to put together a script this good is beyond me, but after multiple viewings, this is still Number One for the title of Funniest Frightfest around.Burton was laying the groundwork for his revolving company of players with BEETLEJUICE as well. Besides Jeffrey Jones as the nerd-alert of a husband, there's Glenn Shadix as the fey Otho, Delia's co-designer/co-conspirator in making over the Maitlands' house and the ""exorcism"" that follows, and Ryder, of course, in her breakout role which would be followed by her turn in HEATHERS, guaranteeing her status as the Eighties' ""It "" girl.And besides the trademark hallucinogenic visuals and blackly funny sense of humor, there was that casting. Bringing Davis, Baldwin and the manic Keaton together was a masterstroke of both luck and genius, and who else could take Sylvia Sidney, Robert Goulet and DICK CAVETT, put them in the same movie and actually make them ""cool?"" It certainly wouldn't be the last time he would make that feat happen, but the timing and the end result would arguably never be more perfect.BEETLEJUICE is a must-have for any movie library, whether you collect comedy OR horror. It can exist easily in both worlds...kind of like the Maitlands and the Dietzes.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful Set Design, Great Acting, But a Stumbling Story","It's 2024, and I still like this movie! All the departments - acting, design, camera, editing - worked collectively at something they all knew is special, something that drew its unique creative force from its unique director Tim Burton.Especially the art department is a pure joy, conveying nothing but love despite or - typical for Tim Burton movies back then - especially for the horror genre. And for that, Beetlejuice will never be forgotten in movie history.However, the plot and the editing haven't been able to leave the 80's.For the plot: The last decades have shown what's possible in terms of character depth and story telling. Beetlejuice stayed at the one dimensional plot and character structures of the 80's.For the editing: My only explanation for the messy cut of the finale is that the special effects footage didn't work out, so the peak events had to be cut to a confusing and way to short mishmash.So: Beetlejuice is timelessly beautiful in the art department and an interesting time capsule for the rest.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The ghost with the most,"There are so many comedies of the 1980s which provided some laughs upon their release but which all these years later are not remembered all that fondly if they are remembered at all. Beetlejuice is an exception. It may not be an all-time comedy classic but it has stood the test of time. The film has so many moments which are, if not exactly classic, certainly memorable. The movie is certainly a bit out there but it is that quirkiness which provides so much of the movie's charm. You haven't seen many movies quite like this one.As our story begins we meet young New England couple Adam and Barbara Maitland, played charmingly by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis respectively. Yes, there once was a time when Alec Baldwin was capable of being charming. Anyhow our very charming couple are rather unfortunately about to find themselves quite dead. After a car accident they find themselves back in their home, rather unsure of how they got there. They will soon come to realize that they did not survive the accident. And thus begins their bizarre journey through the afterlife. Turns out they have to remain in their home for 125 years. Which wouldn't seem all that bad...until the Deetzes move in. The Maitlands find the Deetzes, with their big plans for remodeling the house, to be rather obnoxious and our ghosts are determined to scare them away. They will get sympathy from an unlikely source, the Deetzes' goth teen daughter Lydia, played beautifully by Winona Ryder, who can see the ghostly pair and relates to them a heck of a lot better than she does to her parents.Now am I forgetting anything? Oh yes, Beetlejuice himself, the ""bio-exorcist"" as played so memorably by Michael Keaton. It's easy to go this far not having mentioned Beetlejuice because in the grand scheme of things the character really isn't on the screen all that much. But when he is he certainly makes an impression. The movie gets an unmistakable jolt of energy every time the ""ghost with the most"" shows up. Keaton turns in a crude, bombastic, manic and often hilarious performance. And to be fair Beetlejuice, the movie, is often crying out for the energy Beetlejuice, the character, provides. The movie is a little flat at times but Keaton is there to prop it up when needed. Director Tim Burton created a fascinating world here and inhabited it with some great characters. Not everything in the movie works. Some of the effects look cheap (Burton will tell you intentionally so) and the story definitely has some lulls. But when the movie hits it hits big. There are some scenes here which will always be remembered very fondly. Most notably two scenes which make great use of the music of Harry Belafonte come to mind. All in all it's a movie which should leave you with a smile on your face and sometimes that's all you really need a movie to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Tim Burton's first big jump and Michael Keaton's great charism,"Tim Burton's first movie that was focused on Pee Wee Herman's nonsenses was a rather bizarre way for Burton to begin as filmmaker. But his second feature film that has the performances of Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton lets his peculiar style out. It is with Beetlejuice that Tim Burton makes his first great jump and offers us a story about death from a rather humorous perspective. Although the plot and script are something simple or superficial, that is quite compensated with the humor that the film offers and also by its characters. The Maitland are a dead couple with enough personality, Lydia is an eccentric girl who can have a lot of love thanks to Ryder's performance, Lydia's family are peculiar characters that give a lot of flavor to the comedy of the film and Beetlejuice is the best character for his scandalous and cartonish sense of humor. Michael Keaton lets all his charisma out with his memorable character. Nor is it easy to forget the scenes of the beyond where we see quite cartoonized people according to the way they died. Makeup and special effects are an admirable artistic work. The scenes of the sand worm seem inspired by avant -garde art. The most memorable of the film is undoubtedly the Deetz dinner scene dancing the ""Day-o"" song. Beetlejuice is indisputably the great beginning of Tim Burton in the cinema after his short films Vincent and Frankenweenie and that makes it one of his best films. My final rating for this film is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Time changes opinion....,"7.0/10 (Recommend)When I was in my teenage years this movie straight up weirded me out. The Family Channel (Disney) would consistently play ""Beetlejuice"", it seemed, every weekend. No matter how many times I tried to watch it, I could never get into. Now roughly fifteen years later I've given it an honest chance, and I will say that surprisingly, it was an enjoyable movie.This feels like a simple film that doesn't do too much with anything. I don't know if the visual effects were anywhere near groundbreaking back in 1987/88, but they still hold up amazingly well thirty-five plus years later. The sets are simple. There's a nice gradual transition from normal and living to weird and otherworldly.The acting is good, and I have no complaints on the actors selected for the film. I will say it's super weird for me seeing a young Alec Baldwin. This is the youngest I've ever seen him in a film. Winona Ryder is fantastic. This is the first film I've ever seen her in and definitely stole the spotlight with her quirkiness and dark persona.Overall, the story is kind of mediocre. It's nothing crazy, but perhaps that's why it does so well. There's a good runtime, but it still feels sluggish at times. I wouldn't say anything is bad about the film it's just not an out of this world kind of movie. If you never seen the movie before, or you've seen, but just never liked it and it's been awhile. I would recommend giving it another try even though it's a weird, comedy-horror film that is visually appealing, and has an awkward story with very good characters.That's it for now.

"Beetle-J & two more,=Three's company!","When this first came out, I couldn't believe how different it was from other horror or comedy movies, or the combo of the two, which obviously is what it is, however, I have been amazed at it's simplicity of special effects in regard to the movies now. Yet it has a real artsy-goth appeal. I have thought about the movie on and off for years, then wrote what my version would be as a sequel installment on the original and expanded on the characters with a few new ones.The only real problem with this is, I am not contracted to write for Warner Bros., or Mr.Burton. But would it not be great to see a whole other chapter in the BeEtLeJuicE library, the original writers (Both late) would have probably wanted another as well.I would love to see, Keaton reprise his role as the royal, ghostly pain in the afterlife. He was the voice, the posturing, the whole attitude that made this one such a winner. He is young and strong character builder, besides who else is gonna be 'BeEtLeJuIcE' anyway?To me this is a quirky-comedic horror-romping treat, with a spanking-good cast, that would be excellent in this world of 'Re-makes' to produce a second-time around original.I say, the scenery and sets were great, I really did get enthralled with the visual and audio set up. But, due to the occult 'references' (sayonce etc) and semi-poor scripting, the lack of music in spots causing some audio dry spots, that needed more scoring from 'Elfman' than what was originally dubbed-in.

I had hoped that if anyone could push it that I knew that it would be him. He just looked at me and said ""This is gonna be hard to do.""Keaton stole this show, he is the ghost with the most babes.

When it doesn't work for them, they hire an (un)professional exterminator of the living - Betelgeuse.This is only the second movie for Tim Burton, so the atmosphere he is known for is still evolving, but already recognizable.

Boring,"Self-consciously unfunny. As far as I can remember, it's the only movie I found so hard to endure that I left before it ended. IMDb says I need to use 10 lines describing Beetlejuice in order to get this published--which is almost as pointless as sitting through Beetlejuice was, but I'll try to do it. I find some value in most films I see, but do have a hard time watching films that are dumb, silly or gross-outs. The latter category comprises most of Jim Carey's work. Ironically, he's a very talented actor, who was outstanding in Mask and Man on the Moon and even Grinch. His potty humor, however, leaves me flat. Lots of people like Carey comedies. If you do, you'll probably enjoy Beetlejuice. A Fish Called Wanda--now THAT was a funny movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun watch,"Tim Burton's unique visual style is evident from the very beginning in this quirky and darkly comedic masterpiece. The blend of supernatural elements with the bizarre creates a surreal and captivating world that keeps viewers engaged throughout the film.While I'm not always a fan of absurd humor, I'll make an exception for this one, given its creativity.I also wonder if Burton took inspiration from Frank Herbert's Dune novel for his giant sandworm. Both films share an eerie, otherworldly feel with huge creatures lurking beneath the sand.The sandworms, or Shai-Hulud, were a key part of the Dune universe and, while not as central to the plot as the sandworms in Dune, the Beetlejuice sandworm is also memorable and bizarre, adding to the film's offbeat.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of Tim Burton's best!,"Attention, K-Mart shoppers! Surely, you've heard this by now, but Tim Burton has made a sequel to one of his best movies, the 1988 hit Beetlejuice! To prep for seeing it next week, tonight, I rewatched the original with my parents, and it's still as terrific as I remember.Set in the fictitious country town of Winter River, Connecticut, the movie concerns married couple Adam (played by Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis), who die in a car crash, and quickly find themselves stuck haunting their house, unable to ever leave. The house is soon bought by the insufferable couple Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and Delia Deetz (Catherine O'Hara), and their emo teen daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). Outraged at having all their hard work on the house destroyed by the Deetzes' tasteless renovations, the Maitlands try different methods to scare them off, to no success. Very quickly, their efforts attract the attention of Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton), a rowdy freelance ""bio-exorcist"", whose methods of ""helping"" end up posing a threat to both the Maitlands, and to poor, innocent Lydia.The acting in this movie is just stellar. Alec Baldwin is very warm, inviting and compelling as Adam. Geena Davis is very interesting as Barbara. Winona Ryder is very charming as Lydia. Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are good as Charles and Delia, even if their characters aren't as well-developed as the others. But Michael Keaton absolutely steals the show as Betelgeuse. It takes a lot of talent to own a movie when you're in it for a whopping 15 minutes (and that is no lie)! But Keaton plays the role with such a wild and comical presence that he makes the entire movie worth watching, and almost makes you forget Adam and Barbara are the true stars.In addition, the movie is delightfully bizarre in terms of its script. It bursts with clever ideas at every single turn. The humor is deliciously dark in every scene, especially any scene with Betelgeuse, and the iconic dinner scene. I found myself laughing a LOT! In addition, the scenes of Lydia's interactions with the Maitlands are very wholesome and heartwarming.And, of course, in a movie directed by Tim Burton, expect some terrific visuals. The set design for this movie is high art, helped along by excellent cinematography. Also, the stop-motion animation used for the sandworms and whatnot is just first-class. It's a feast for the eyes, and really holds up today.And lastly, the music! Burton regular Danny Elfman, of course, composed a fantastic score for this movie. It's very comically tense, and even sounds peaceful whenever it needs to. Added to which, the movie uses a couple terrific 50's Calypso songs, sung by Harry Belafonte (may he rest in peace), with very special mention going to ""Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)"", used so fabulously for the dinner scene, and best of all, for the ending, ""Jump in the Line"" (which became a favorite song of mine before I ever even saw this movie!).Everything considered, Beetlejuice is easily one of Tim Burton's best movies, in my opinion, and I hope that the sequel lives up to it, even if Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis aren't returning. Still, if you're a big fan of Tim Burton, watch this movie!!!Ohh-ho-ho, and by the way... ""NICE F*****G MODEL!!!!!"" *honk-honk* :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""It's Showtime..""","The movie got good reviews on its release, while nowadays has somewhat of a cult status, but it seems it's success lies somewhere in the middle.
The script has moments where it shines as much as it has points where it misses its mark. It's an entertaining story, has great moments of slapstick and dark humor rolled together. However it has bits of oddity to it that seem not very well hashed out. For instance But it seems like the main character takes a back seat to his own movie, and when the his motivation seems unclear and meaningless at the climax.
Practical and green screen effects drive the movie magic, and it's entertaining to watch for moments of comedic effect. Sets are detailed from all different perspectives and imaginative.
The cast fit their characters well; Micheal Keaton brings the character Beetlejuice a particular bit of zany antics in line with Deadpool or Joker, and that adds some levity to a story with themes of death, suicide, and the afterlife.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An explosion of imagination that'll knock you dead,"BEETLEJUICE is an incredible exploration and unique depiction into the life hereafter, delivering plenty of laughs, friendly frights, and a great colourful cast of characters.This film is so unique and detailed in its imaginative world building and gothic-yet-wacky set design, respectively. It's a joy to watch it all unfold, from the rapid-fire dialogue to the countless visual and physical gags.All the practical effects, set design, and stop motion work are as impressive as they are admittedly creepy. The performances are individually unhinged, from Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, to Winona Ryder and Catherine O'Hara. But to put it simply, Michael Keaton as the titular bio-exorcist is sparingly utilised, and pure comedy gold.The only real downsides come down to the plot and green-screen. As with most comedies, BEETLEJUICE is quite light on story, but makes up for it in seemingly every other possible way. And there are several rare instances of noticeable usage of green-screen, but as aforementioned, are hardly there and far from too distracting.The movie is a spectacular creative vision brought to life thanks to unique writing, ingenious world-building, and a stellar cast. When in the mood for a different kind of dark comedy for almost all ages, watch BEETLEJUICE.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
he does not work well with others...!,"How can you not like Beetlejuice, one of the most quotable movies ever? The characters are well-done, from Catherine O'Hara's Delia (If you don't let me GUT out this house and MAKE it my own, I will GO insane and I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME! /  THIS IS MY ART AND IT IS DANGEROUS!  DO YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE LIKE THIS???) to Otho to Jeffrey Jones's clueless dad to, of course, Winona Ryder's alienated but sharp Lydia (Plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food / ...I myself am...strange and unusual) to the concept that the ghosts have to get the PEOPLE out of their house.  Ghostbusting turned on its ear.   The dead are nice and harmless! The living are ruthless capitalist developer city slicker VanityFair licking fools!  Death is not perceived by all the dead and the afterlife is a surreal and chaotic place where people might learn some semblance of lesson (Miss Argentina:  And I'll tell you something.  IF I knew then WHAT I know now, I wouldn't have had my little accident.)  We learn that death is subjective - ""This is what happens when you die.  And THAT is what happens when he dies.  And THAT is what happens when they die.  It's all very personal.""  (Miss Argentina shrugs).  Michael Keaton is rather handy with the quick wit, be it ""attention, K-Mart Shoppers!"" to saying he's seen The Exorcist however many times, ""And it KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT!"" There's so much more to say but not enough space.  For one of the  most charming movies with some of the best music, this is just adorable!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Visually Funny, But Lacks Consistency in the Plot","Beetlejuice is a movie that, for me, is a fun mix of humor and fantasy with the peculiar touch of Tim Burton. The idea is original and the look is unmistakable, with that characteristic Burton aesthetic that really creates a world apart. Michael Keaton is in shape, making the title character with an energy that is hard not to like.However, the plot ends up becoming a little repetitive, and some of the jokes and scenes may seem exaggerated or forced. The narrative sometimes gets lost in style and does not develop its secondary characters very well, which makes some parts of the movie drag on a little.Overall, it is a visually interesting experience with some fun moments, but it is not as striking as other works of the genre. It is a movie that has its merits, but also has significant flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""He's guaranteed to put some life, in your afterlife""","Now I love Tim Burton. He's probably the most unique, gifted directors out there. Saddest thing is, I've only seen one film by him: Edward Scissorhands, which I loved! So instead of liking the guy from one film, I researched his other works, and Beetlejuice always interested me the most. So I waited and waited, then finally watched it as soon as it started to record. And I'm sad to say that I didn't like Beetlejuice at all..Now the film doesn't deserve the one rating, but that was given from all my expectations and the fact that Tim Burton made it. It was new and unique, but something about it just gave off the wrong vibe.. The material was just so stupid in my opinion. The afterlife premise was unique, sure, but I thought it was just executed in the wrong way. Tim Burton adds in a little comic effect, which in my opinion, wasn't funny at all.. And the film is straight-up gimmicky. It relies on special effects, not funny jokes, and a bizarre atmosphere that you don't even want to be in. The characters were one-dimensional and the character of Beetlejuice (or should I say Betelgeuse?) wasn't crazy, funny, or unique. Instead he came off rude, stupid, and annoying. The way the film is based off his character alone, especially how he shows up halfway through the film, makes it bad alone.. This film was riveting. It surely hit me as a clever-WRITTEN film, but execution matters. And yes, style over substance is all here. That's a bad thing.I may be bashed and hated for this review, because I'm the only person on this planet that hated Beetlejuice. Maybe I was expecting too much, but the film just didn't do anything new for me, and the whole thing was too over done. The reason I didn't like it may always start with 'maybe' but surely enough, I didn't like it. It's sad too, because I wanted to..1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What Burton does best,"As far as ghost stories in a haunted house go, Beetlejuice is one of the funniest and most colourful stories of the dead and the living trying to coexist, buoyed by the shot of adrenaline that comes from the introduction of its titular character. It's initially overstuffed with characters but it quickly finds its footing so none of the core cast feel left behind when it's wrapped everything up neatly.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are a cute couple from the very start and they're even better when they're sharing their scenes with Winona Ryder, who's angst only makes her more likeable. However, Michael Keaton obviously steals the whole film anytime he's present, making an already strong film even better than to his sleazy and energetic nature which is hilarious from the first moment.Tim Burton's direction is amazing. His signature aesthetic is present in everything from the costumes to the sets and the general look of the film which is ridiculously impressive for his second feature. It's all enhanced by a dark sense of humour, a love of old school special effects and two standout dance numbers. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit for the weirdness of this world and so distinctly him.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Black pantomime,"After the sugary fun of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Burton made this ingenious and witty horror comedy. Bristling with imagination, it brilliantly showcases the visual style that Burton would come to call his own with comic-Gothic productions like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman Returns.Adam (Alex Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) play the recently deceased homeowners who are desperate to haunt yuppie couple Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and Charles (Jeffrey Jones) off their property. Adam and Barbara find a useful ally in depressive goth kid Lydia (Winona Ryder), before the titular 'Betelgeuse' (Michael Keaton) throws a spanner in the works.It's a pity the film has been granted a 15 certificate in the UK, because there's plenty here for kids to enjoy. Adam and Barbara's complete acceptance of their predicament (namely being dead) is a conceit usually reserved for children's films, and their ensuing antics play out like a kind of ghoulish Home Alone. But then Keaton's vile, swearing, swaggering Beetlejuice steps into shot. It's a hilarious performance, perhaps one that Jim Carrey might have a go at these days; and yet I doubt Carrey would be able to create such a magnificently obnoxious hick.The production design and make-up is fantastic. The purgatory-style waiting room scenes, with all their shark attack victims and shrunken heads, perfectly house Burton's love for pantomime black humour. Some of the 'bigger' special effects, particularly in the desert netherworld that awaits Adam and Barbara outside their front door, look dated. But hey, no amount of CGI will look this charming after 20 years.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beet-","Beetlejuice is a classic 80's Halloween film. It features a married couple who passed away whose souls are trapped in their house. It has them meeting the entity Beetlejuice who's summoned by saying his name 3 times could help them scare the people who have moved into the house back out. It is definitely one of Michael Keaton's more iconic roles. This one, Batman, and Vulture in Spider-Man Homecoming are the first 3 roles that come to mind when I think of Michael Keaton. It doesn't use any CGI as it was created in the 80's. The special effects seem alright. I'm more used to more modern films with modern CGI and feel like these special effects seem similar to modern day special effects, as good as modern day. It seems more comical than scary, as it's more of a dark comedy than horror. It isn't as frightening as other Halloween films of the time, like the Friday the 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare on Elm Street franchises. Though with the language, it should have been rated PG-13 instead of PG. A well rounded film, but should have more screen time of Beetlejuice himself.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great potential, but ends up a boring mess","This is a movie that's talked about so much that you practically know it, even if you haven't seen it; it's a pop culture phenomenon. Well, I never saw this movie when it came out in the theaters, don't really know why, just hadn't made the time to see it. I finally saw it (1/25/17) and... man, was it boring. Yes, boring.The pacing is slow, the acting is mediocre (the mother and father) and some of the jokes don't land. I love the actors in this movie, but it just seems to drag along. The special effects are dated, but rather enjoyable, so I didn't mind that at all. My biggest gripe about this movie was with Beetlejuice himself. For a movie that carries his name in the title and is acted with great gusto by Michael Keaton, you'd think Beetlejuice would be in the movie a lot more. The movie is 1 1/2 hours long and Beetlejuice is on screen for about 15 minutes! His character is not fleshed out all that well, as oftentimes we are left to wonder about his motivation. Is he a good guy, a bad guy, who's he trying to help or hurt? Beetlejuice just acts quirky and rambles on, probably in the hopes that we as the audience won't notice that he's not really doing anything. But again, it's the story itself that fails; it has bad pacing, not enough of the main title character, and ultimately it becomes a boring messThis is a movie that had great actors, a decent outline for a story and terrific potential, unfortunately it doesn't deliver on any of them. I think I would have liked this movie if I had seen it when it came out and I would remember it fondly and with a nostalgic sense of wonder. But no, I just recently saw it and nope, can't recommend it. As an 80's kid, I hate saying this, but this movie is just badly executed. Sad, it could have really been something, if they had only made Beetlejuice the main character in the movie and fleshed out the story.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Vivid, Nightmarish Machination","Beetlejuice is a film in which the concept of the afterlife is addressed in a unique, comedic, and elegant manner. The film is centered around a couple who dies in a car crash and are thrusted into an afterlife in which they haunt their own house. Eventually, the couple is forced to share a space with an Upper-Class family from New York that is set on rearranging and reshaping their home. The film is directed by Tim Burton. Beetlejuice stars Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Michael Keaton, and Winona Ryder. The supporting cast of characters includes parents of Winona Ryder's character portrayed by Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones, as well as the business and social acquaintances they bring from New York.The cast delivers a dynamic, yet homey depiction of their characters. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis' portrayals of Barbara and Adam Maitland is wholesome. They play the straight faced couple that lived a normal life, before being thrusted into the lunacy of the afterworld and the burdens tethered to death. Baldwin and Davis have a great chemistry. Winona Ryder plays off of their chemistry by being their daughterly figure, Lydia. She is a pessimist who is extremely unhappy with her home life. Ryder's portrayal of Lydia is gothic and cold, yet when a specific emotion is necessary to carry a scene she nails it; providing depth to Lydia's character. The titular character Beetlejuice, portrayed by Michael Keaton is the star of the show. Beetlejuice can be described as a wise-cracking con man exuding pure chaotic energy. Michael Keaton perfectly captures the lunacy of the show. His delivery is hilarious and jarring. Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are great in their roles as Lydia's stepmother and father. O'Hara portrays a parody of a self-consumed artist who has zero concern for her family; while Jones accompanies her as a business oriented father who is trying to keep the family positive amid transition to a new home. Additionally, Glenn Shadix lends a sense of flamboyance with his portrayal of Otho. The entire cast works together bringing the film an eccentric chemistry that works in most, if not all cases.The brightest spot of Beetlejuice is the makeup, costume, and set-design. The real world portrayal of Connecticut juxtaposes the vibrant yet masochistic portrayal of the afterlife. Fear is communicated through animation at times. Claymation is used when an otherworldly figure clashes with the real world. For example, Beetlejuice takes the form of a snake, and turns into claymation. Tim Burton's gothic, yet colorful portrayal of the afterlife is incredibly engaging. The use of colored lighting sets a playful yet grim tone. The afterlife is portrayed as a whimsical, circus-esque counterpart to the real world. There's a waiting room with a blue and green skinned people who are missing limbs. There's a man who has a shrunken head. There's a man who is flattened, communicating that he met his demise from a car accident. There are skeletons everywhere. The sight of the dead in this film is both chilling, yet extravagant. The makeup and costume design for each character is refined and elaborate. Everyone in the film has a unique appearance. Each character's look tells a story of their life and/or death. The film's nightmarish look is a signature of Burton's and still can be considered one of his best sets.The cinematography of the film is well-done. Humor and levity are shot in a way that juxtaposes the grim tone for the better. The editing is mostly great. Tension is built really well. At times, the blatant use of green screen is a distraction. Character's being showcased in odd locations such as a terrifying sand dune is poorly showcased through green screen. The sound design is incredibly cartoon-ish, further adding to the overall lunacy. Technically, this film is fun and shot in a manner that compliments the general tone.Overall, Beetlejuice is a lavish presentation of the fear and humor that comes with death. It is a fun, gothic juxtaposition on life and death, carried by a cast with unorthodox chemistry; all from the vivid, nightmarish imagination from a great director.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Tim Burton's hits his prime with Beetlejuice, but now he directs drivel...","I love Tim Burton's early works, such as Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Ed Wood.  His more recent films (Mars Attacks, the horribly awful Battle of the Apes remake) just don't have the darkly comic zing of these earlier works.  Beetlejuice is a hilarious film, and to quote the title character himself, ""...It just keeps getting funnier every time I see it!""The cast of the film is superb. The fact that the film gleefully mocks death & afterlife and that it comes off so well shows what a tremendous imagination Tim Burton has (or had). Michael Keaton (where is he these days?) is magnificent as Beetlejuice, a disgusting dead guy mooching off the dearly departed - in this case, the goofy but lovable Maitlands. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (two more we don't see much now) are perfect as tbe clueless, recently-deceased Adam and Barbara Maitland.  Winona Ryder is cynical yet sweet in her role as Lydia.

"The first true film from ""Tim Burton, auteur"" -- and a very entertaining one, too","I don't remember ever seeing this movie when I was a kid, but I did watch some episodes of the animated series around that time. BEETLEJUICE is an important film for at least one reason: It established Tim Burton's style and featured a lot of the people, behind and in front of the camera, who he would collaborate with over the next 20 years or so. It also has a fairly entertaining story with plenty of visual inventiveness and some manic touches, courtesy of Michael Keaton as the titular character. However, similar to Silence of the Lambs, the most important character in the movie isn't in it for a long time. He gets hinted about at first and shown from behind, making you curious as to what could make the dead so scared of him, but then he finally makes his grand appearance and it all makes sense. For so grating a character, the small doses you get of him actually work in the film's favor. A little bit goes a long way. What makes the film engaging and relatable are the couple who die barely ten minutes in (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and the daughter of the couple who move in afterwards and start remodeling (Winona Ryder). To a degree, you can understand the plight of these two people who, cut down in their prime, see the house they worked so hard to get be changed beyond recognition by a family with no regard for the past (albeit, hilariously so). One thing I didn't expect was the way in which the film straddles the line between horror and comedy, having expected something a little more straightforwardly funny. What I got was still quite good, with plenty of sight-gags and situational humor instead of verbal punchlines. The film also has a great sense of style (courtesy of production designer, Bo Welch), and Tim Burton's love of German Expressionist cinema becomes more apparent in his realization of the limbo world of the dead, with its long hallways and angled, off-kilter doors and windows. There was also brilliant use of stop-motion animation and models, which are still more involving than CGI will ever be. All of the performances were great, and the characters well-written enough as to be likable even while occasionally doing annoying things. The only thing that works against the film are perhaps the rushed beginning and a slightly forced (and equally rushed) ending. I can understand wanting to get to the good stuff, but a little more time with the protagonists could have only benefited the film overall. So, for not quite delivering the riotous comedy I expected, BEETLEJUICE is still a highly entertaining showcase for special effects and Michael Keaton's manic energy, as well as being Tim Burton's first true film (or at least emblematic of his style).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The portrayal of Beetlejuice by Michael Keaton was amazing, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the character now.

Michael Keaton's Leading Performance Is Hilarious,"After flops like ""Johnny Dangerously"" and ""Gung Ho"", Michael Keaton's once promising film career seemed to be on the verge of being completely dead but it was suddenly revived with the success of this 1988 Warner Brothers release.

A manic poltergeist (Keaton) offers to help the spirits rid their beloved house of these newcomers since they can't scare them themselves.

"Tim Burton getting the fantasy comedy right in the early days of his career, never to surpass it.","Beetlejuice (1988) :
Brief Review -Tim Burton getting the fantasy comedy right in the early days of his career, never to surpass it. Beetlejuice came before Burton made Edward Scissorhands, which was a fantasy drama and quite serious compared to this. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland are two of his most popular works among kids and youth (box office numbers prove that). If I have to compare Beetlejuice with these two, then it is definitely a much better film. It's just too old for today's kids, that's all, but the 80s and some 90s kids will agree with my comments. Beetlejuice is not an out-and-out comedy with stomachache laughter; it's a decent story with a light and healthy screenplay, but with a damn interesting idea. It's a fantasy-horror-comedy-adventure drama about a couple who die in an accident and become ghosts. These two deceased people start harassing the new family that has shifted into their house. They try every trick to scare them, but all their tricks fail. They are the ghosts, but they are not scary at all, and they need sheets too (a sophisticated pair like Hepburn and Tracy, lol); that's one major laugh here. The second is the family trying to make a deal with the dead. Such is the human hunger for money. Then comes the main attraction of the show, Beetlejuice. I am not quite sure whether to call him an antagonist because he never looked that demonic. All he wanted was to get out of that world, and I don't think there was anything wrong with it. The writers could've drawn a better character graph for him. Anyway, he was damn funny despite all those frightening faces and scary costumes. Beetlejuice is a kind of soft and cute type of horror film that even kids can enjoy without any fear. Maybe it's for kids more than adults. Burton may have better flicks, but this one is something special in its own right, especially when you talk about complete family entertainment.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comedy horror at it's best,"Beetlejuice is marketed as a kids film, so I thought, but it really isn't, watching it at 16 I realize that uh yeah a kid probably shouldn't watch this, but it's still quite goofy, it's like a fever dream, similar to something like the 7th Voyage of Sinbad, but it's a great classic! And a cultural masterpiece too! I hear this film referenced and quoted all the time! Beetlejuice is a great classic that os really re-watchable! And I highly recommend it! It has some really nice characters too! Some of my favorites in cinema! All in all this is a great film! Go watch it if you somehow haven't already!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Probably one of the best Tim Burton films of all time,"I've watched this 1988 American comedy film about loads of times and it's very entertaining and funny. I remember watching it for the first time on VHS when I was a kid but the film is rated 15 and it might be too frightening for kids but it doesn't matter anyway. Besides it never scared me as a kid. The acting is great especially from Michael Keaton (who played Beetlejuice as we know), Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder. Beetlejuice is just mad as a hatter, isn't he?It's probably one of the best Tim Burton films of all time. It never gets old and it will always be a timeless classic.It might be perfect for Halloween.If you are fan of Tim Burton films, you'll enjoy watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good,"Good movie.....am watching it at the moment actually.  Love to see one of Winona Ryder's first performances as a forlorn teenager.  I would have liked it better, though, if they had explained the part about death better.  in the house 125 years????? I don't understand.  And also everyone in the netherworld seems so nonchalant, where did they find out all this info?? The handbook?? and if it was the handbook, did the Maitland's just try once to read it or what?? Maybe they would have understood it better.  A lot of this movie is unexplained, but I guess it's because the writers were unsure themselves.  I LOVE Keaton's  performance!!!!! He is awesome at being a chameleon as far as different roles go!!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great from Mr. Burton,If you like BeetleJuice and the supernatural then buy this movie you won't be let down. This is a very good movie fun for all ages. See this movie is what started the cartoon series on cartoon network in the early 1990's BeetleJuice. Personally I think Micheal Keaton did a fantastic job as playing BeetleJuice I just really like this movie a lot it talk's about what the after life is like basically see Barbara and Adam Maitland die and their ghost's in the movie and they meet BeetleJuice and I'm not going to tell you the rest because you have to watch the movie trust me this movie is really good it will make you want to say BeetleJuice three times.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"I rewatched it, and it's just as cool as I remembered from my childhood, but with a slightly different feel.","A crazy, wild ride, Beetlejuice is unlike any other film I've ever seen. It's an odd combination of supernatural madness and dark humor that works surprisingly nicely. Michael Keaton steals every moment he's in with his surprising energy and hilariousness.The plot is strange, as a recently deceased couple uses the strange and chaotic Beetlejuice to try to frighten away the new occupants of their house.There are many bizarre sets and eerie, yet cartoonish, monsters, which is a hallmark of Burton's visual aesthetic, and I love it!All things considered, Beetlejuice is a fun and completely original film that successfully combines humor and the paranormal. If you're looking for something new, it's absolutely worth seeing. It's different from what I remember as a child. I always thought it's a more scarier movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

astoundingly aweful story,"This film has great performances. It is, well, creative. 5 year olds are also creative. And this film feels like it was dictated by a 5 year old kid while tripping on acid. I watched it in the 80s and did not like it. And then I gave it a full watch in 2024, and it was worse than ever. I enjoy art films, dramas, and a nice dose of Jackass is always fun. But I just am amazed how such a terrible movie could have such a large following. I will grant that the soundtrack is an excellent fun and fluttery score by Danny Elfman. There are some fun visuals. There is definitely some original filming techniques that are worthy of studying in film school. But ultimately, a horribly bad story sinks this ship for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Surreal, unusual, freakish and proud of it.","Tim Burton built his name on his macabre style but ""Beetlejuice"" is one odd movie (in a good way). But some of the stuff that goes on in this is just bananas, and that speaks to the movie's inherent personality. There some serious imagination at work here, not just the title character, but in the Salvador Dali netherworld images (complete with giant sandworm), grotesque makeup and its playful take on the afterlife. It's also got Winona Ryder at her most charming, and Catherine O'Hara's a B on wheels in this movie; oh, man. And then the unforgettable Danny Elfman score. It all adds up to something pretty great.But that's all before we even get to the crown jewel, the pièce de ré·sis·tance: Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. It'd be weak to say he steals the movie; he owns it lock, stock and barrel. He's a comic performer at the top of his game; lewd, profane and utterly without boundaries. It's one of his best performances, that's a given. Even those who don't like this movie have to admit that.But then, how could anyone not like this movie? 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice!,"Tim Burton's most twisted nightmarish movie ever is a hilarious high water mark for late eighties comedy. A great cast puts in wonderful performances. Baldwin, Davis, O'Hara, Jones, Goulet, Ryder, and especially Keaton in his most memorable charecter. Great writing, cinematography, and good special effects highlight this film. Not very many movies as original as this. I personally credit Winona Ryder's character for starting the Gothic dress trend among today's teenagers. Lots of good lines, mostly delivered by Keaton in the title charecter. Stark imagery in set design lasts long after you've seen the movie. I give it 8.5 out of 10.

FANTASTIC!!! This movie screams late 80's.........,"Just caught this movie on HBO again for the 100th time. This movie brings back so many memories of the late 80's and is also a great horror-comedy by the master, Tim Burton. I have always been a Tim Burton fan, ever since I was 7 years old and saw Batman, which blew me away. Great performances by everyone, especially (obviously) Michael Keaton, who is also great in Batman and the even better Batman Returns.

The Ghost with the most,"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. One of Tim Burton's classics of his Prime. Beetlejuice follows the story of a small town Husband and Wife. Barbara(Geena Davis) and Alan Maitland (Alec Baldwin) who everything going well in their lives. When all of a sudden they get in a car accident and later return home, only to soon find out that they have died. Now a new family the Deetz with their daughter Lydia(Winona Ryder). Not set on the idea of them living in their house the Maitland soon result and makes contact with a wild ghost Beetlejuice( Michael Keaton) to get rid of the Deetz while his first feature film Pee-wee big adventure was received positively by many. Beetlejuice In many ways was the establishment of his style. Much like the Addams family Burton took Gothic Horror and mix with small-town America. With a ton of bizarre imagery and character design. All with a blend of practical makeup, prosthetics, CG, and Stop-motion it gives this very artistic set design. From the bright white sunny look of the town to the color lighting in the afterlife. It complements the more edgy humor that the film has. The cast overall is fun Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin their relationship is sweet and you feel the chemistry between them the opening alone grab you making you think that he their gonna be the main character the turns it on you. Winona Ryder as Lydia is without a doubt one of the most iconic goth characters. Her very morbid dry sense of humor really fits the more macabre visuals. Lastly the man himself Beetlejuice, Keaton made this character, even though he's not in the movie all that much really he gets only 17 minutes. He makes every one of those minutes counts. He hands down the most memorable thing about the film. In many ways, it's like a more chaotic neutral version of the joker. Being ironic given the following year Keaton would go on to play Batman.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
cute!,"This clever little movie has two ghosts desperate to exorcise their home's living inhabitants, and tempted to hire insane ghost Beetlejuice to help out.

Burtonesque Goodness,"""We're very unhappy!""""What did you expect? - You're dead.""A delightfully irreverent and stylistic blend of horror comedy and American suburbia, this film arguably warrants a watch at least once a year, preferably around the Halloween Season.Great scriptwriting, old school SFX, and wickedly delicious satire set this film apart, even amongst Burton's many gems.In spite of the film's cheeky tone, however, it still manages to portray some surprisingly rich themes about family, love, and the dangers of arrogance and naïveté.All in all, an absolute must-watch for fans of the satirical, off-beat, and quirky.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Typically Tim Burton,"If you are a fan of Tim Burton, then you will love this movie - because it's pretty much everything you'd expect from a movie directed by Tim Burton. It's one of his earliest films - his second after ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure."" It's weird and it's quirky and it's flaky. Sometimes it's kind of funny and sometimes it's actually rather dark. Burton is a director who's very good at introducing us to these kinds of alternate realities (as you might call them) and he certainly develops a memorable picture of the afterlife!Adam and Barbara are a young couple killed in a car accident who find themselves living the afterlife back in their home when a new family moves in. They want the family out, so they decide to haunt the place and eventually along comes Beetlejuice - some sort of professional haunter (he calls himself a bio-exorcist; a guy who exorcises the living from the presence of the dead basically) who's loud and creepy and obnoxious and ill mannered - to try to do the trick. Basically that's the story. It doesn't demand a lot of the viewer except to settle in and enjoy the fun.I thought this was most noteworthy for early appearances by Alec Baldwin as Adam (the husband of the couple who died), Geena Davis as Barbara (his wife), Winona Ryder as Lydia (in one of her earliest credits as the daughter of the couple who buy the house) and Michael Keaton as the title character. You also have Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara rounding out a likeable enough cast.Still, I find this a bit over-rated. Unlike some, I guess, I'm not a huge fan of Tim Burton. He's OK, but his work is often too over-the-top for my tastes, and that definitely comes out in this movie. Keaton's Beetlejuice is especially just too much; too frenetic for my liking. It's not as funny as you want it to be, although it did make me laugh out loud once - the song and dance routine to ""Shake Senora"" at the dinner party was truly funny. And it does have a kind of heartwarming ending as Lydia bonds with Adam and Barbara and the living and deceased families seem to learn how to co-exist. Beyond that the film is just a kind of mindless romp and at times descends into incoherence. So, don't think too hard about it.But, not being a huge fan of Tim Burton's style, I guess I just find this too Tim Burton-ish to really love. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This was a Strange movie...,"Not that I'd expect anything less from Tim Burton, but this movie just felt like it was all over the place. I see the effort put into this one. The Costume Designs, the overall Stage Design, the very familiar Burton style claymation was all very impressive. There were some legitimate creepy moments in this one. I think those were the highlights for me at least.The problem that I had with this movie is the overall pacing. It legit just felt like it was rushed through way too quickly. I felt like the characters could've been handled a lot better. And I'll be honest, as far as Keaton's Role in this one, I thought he was just really strange. I could tell he was having fun, but I guess I wasn't too big into Beetlejuice's character in general. I thought Geena Davis, Catherine O' Hara and Alec Baldwin did a good job, even though their characters weren't incredibly interesting. Winona Ryder was the only standout in my mind. She had some really good scenes in this one. I just wished the character arcs were a little bit more fleshed out.I think overall, this movie kind underwhelmed me.

Say It Three Times!,"With absolute certainty, Beetlejuice is the best film that Tim Burton has ever given us, and we appreciate that. They say original is always the best, and Beetlejuice is a timeless classic of gore and lore. It's funny, scary, dramatic and you can't help but sing along and feel nostalgic watching the film nearly 40 years later. And it's hard to believe it's been that long!Everyone in this film was so young in 1988. Michael Keaton, who played Beetlejuice himself, had already been around and in various movies by the time he was cast. Geena Davis was a rising star and overshadowed Alec Baldwin, which would never happen today. Winona Ryder is still around. So is Catherine O'Hara, but she's a Tim Burton favorite and also well known as Kevin McAllister's mother from the Home Alone films. Of course, Jeffrey Jones has become infamous for reasons of his own undoing and no one speaks his name, he's essentially the Voldemort of Hollywood.Anyway, Beetlejuice was and still is a huge success. It was so popular into the early 1990s that an animated series was created for children, much like the Real Ghostbusters. There were rumors and talk of a sequel ever since this film was released in 1988, but nothing ever came to fruition until the early 2020s, then it became serious. Even Michael Keaton was up for a sequel and by the time a sequel was greenlit, he was in his early seventies.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie rules,"Beetlejuice has got to be one of the most unique and entertaining characters ever put out in the movies. Michael Keaton does a great job as Beetlejuice although it is said that he hated the character and regretted doing the movie. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis do a decent job but Keaton is the one to watch. Winona Ryder, Jeffery Jones, and Catherine O'Hara do an equally decent job but as I said before, Beetlejuice is the one to keep your eye on. With a great soundtrack by Danny Elfman and Tim Burton's bizarre talents at the helm, Beetlejuice is a classic that you can watch over and over. It is a shame that a sequel has not been made.

Outdated,"Funny how so many think of this film as a cult classic and yet I just saw it for the first time now. I have heard so much about this film over the years from friends that grew up on it and finally decided to give it a go. To say I liked what I saw would be a bit of a stretch, but I didn't hate it.Adam and Barbara, played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, are a newly wed couple on vacation in the hopes of getting away from it all. All is well until a car crash resulting in their deaths, leaves their spirits stuck in their house between heaven and earth and are left almost hopeless with nowhere to go and no one to talk to. When a new family moves into their home, harassing and reeking havoc on the now dead couple, they are left with no choice but to hire the one spirit who can spook them away.I found Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) quite annoying very early to his introduction, getting on my nerves most of the time he was on screen.I think both Alec and Geena gave good performances as well as Winona Ryder, who stood out in the film playing Lynda the daughter of the new family. I also think the film is a bit outdated for a children's audience but then again it was made in the late 80s.This film shouts Tim Burton. The gothic and horror elements he leaves in his films make him unique to other directors. He reminds me of Wes Anderson. Not because of similarities in their films but because both share their own originality and can make their films stand out. I am a huge Burton fan, watching his movies since I can remember.For the most part I thought this film was fine. My main problem was that the main character annoyed the hell out of me. Pacing was alright with a runtime of an hour and half. Some jokes landed here as well, having this film suited for older children and adults in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the Best Ghost Comedies Ever!,"Tim Burton's Beetlejuice is a morbid, zany classic that proves yet again why the 1980's was a great decade for these kind of films. It follows the same path of similar films such as The Goonies and Gremlins as family-friendly comedies with a splash of horror that provides big laughs, memorable moments, and horrific scares. I do not care that Burton goes over the top with his set design, makeup, and story. I care that me made a quotable classic for all generations to enjoy. Another reason why this film is so successful? Michael Keaton! Barely recognizable under the many pounds of makeup, he inhabited the role of the cantankerous poltergeist and created a career-defining performance that still may be his best role. And the dude played Batman.Burton first saw success with 1985's Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and in a way, both films are similar in the way Burton messes around with images. Now a ""bankable"" director, he was given many screenplays to choose from. Burton wanted to work on his Batman script, but Warner Bros hesitated to give the green light, so he had to make another film first. He became interested in Michael McDowell's screenplay, but McDowell left during the rewriting process due to creative differences. McDowell's script was originally much darker than the final product. The key death sequence was graphic, and Keaton's character's intentions were more malicious and murderous. Even though Burton's mind is often quite dark, he considerably lightened the tone which made the film work the way it did. I really enjoyed the POV from the ghosts. It is not often that the ghosts take the spotlight, so the film was given a unique feel.Out of his $15 million dollar budget, Burton only spent around a million on special effects. His unique take on the effects gave the film a distinct taste. I loved Burton's use of stop motion. When shown around in the wastelands of afterlife, the ""Dune"" like sand worms really stood out. His keen eye of his sets really went a long way in determining the final look and gave the film a B-movie feel in which Burton wanted. From the house's design to how the afterlife looked, everything is so detailed. The makeup made Keaton look so unrecognizable (and won the film an Oscar). I need to mention Danny Elfman's soundtrack. The way the two Harry Belafonte songs were incorporated into the film is just priceless. The Banana Boat song at the dinner table in the best sequence because I was crying my eyes out in laughter.Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) are a young, adorable couple who live in an old, but massive New England house. One day, as they were driving home, they are involved in a nasty accident. The two walk home and believe everything will be alright. There also happens to be one particular problem...they happen to be dead! Their house is purchased by a New York family, a family with an interesting dynamic. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) in an artist who makes grotesque works of art, Charles (Jeffrey Jones) works in real estate and has grand designs for the house, and Lydia (Winona Ryder) is the goth daughter. Adam and Barbara want the family gone, but they do admittedly find relief in Lydia. They try to scare away the family, but they fail. They decide to use people-exorciser Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) to help. But with increasingly dangerous tactics, Adam and Barbara realize they need to save themselves and the family.This is Michael Keaton's movie. If people did not know who he was before, they do now. Keaton brought lots of craziness to this role akin to The Night Shift. This character required a blend of darkness and comedy...and makeup and nailed it. He has the best lines. Just listen to his response when asked about his qualifications. He is surrounded by a great supporting cast. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are really sweet. Winona Ryder, as a really young actress, proves her acting chops here. Her character is ""weird and strange"" which enables her to see ghosts and despite her outer appearance, she has a big heart and had great chemistry with the ghosts. Also, I cannot forget to mention Sylvie Sydney. She plays the afterlife counselor Juno and has some fantastic scenes.Overall, Beetlejuice is one of the best ghost comedies you'll get to see. I like these kind of macabre stories especially when there is some comedy and relatable characters. Tim Burton makes a living creating dark, weird stories and this film was the beginning of it all. This movie also allowed the world to see who Michael Keaton is and thus allowed him to be Batman. I do want a sequel, but I do not think they could make a sequel good enough. For a time, they were going to Betelgeuse in Hawaii. Yeah, definitely would not have been as good. I do not care what anyone says, but this is an 80's classic. That ""Banana Boat"" scene would have made it a classic alone.My Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not for me but it is ok 👌,I thought I would love Beetlejuice because the trailer looked awesome and the second movie looked awesome. But I prefer the 2 Beetlejuice because the first movie is more introductory than funny or horror. Don't get me wrong I still like the movie. I liked how there was some action but not a lot of action. It was a little boring but it wasn't so boring I didn't watch all the way to the end. I love the main characters and how little funny it was.

"My first time watching it, technically.","Tonight was the first time I watched ""Beetlejuice"". The first time I attempted to watch it was, I think 1990, and I promptly fell asleep and didn't see any of it.Tonight my wife and daughter were convinced me to watch it and I'm glad I did. Tim Burton was a director that I found annoying because the quirk factor was off the charts. That all changed when ""Mars Attacks"" came out and I absolutely loved it. Ironically, my wife is a huge Burton fan and she hated ""Mars Attacks"", but I digress... The story of ""Beetlejuice"" is simple in that a deceased couple that loves their house are trying to keep everyone out of it. Beetlejuice is the lad that offers his help to clean the house of the living; reverse Poltergeist, basically.Truthfully, the time Beetlejuice is on screen, it's not as hectic as I imagined it would be and his presence was sort of meandering to the plot of the movie. Certain plot points seemed to have fizzled out and the ending felt a bit rushed, which seems to be a Burton trait. Despite these issues I had with the movie, I did find it extremely innovative and entertaining.Now I can see the new movie and have a clue of what is going on and that makes me happy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dare You Say It Three Times,"Beetlejuice is mostly a product of the 1980's, but there's something about Tim Burton's flare for the absolute absurd supernatural that gives this film an incomparable likability.Burton teamed up with his early career favorite Michael Keaton for the title character, and in turn created what is perhaps one of the most iconic performances of all time. Beetlejuice has Burton's prints all over it on its own, but with Keaton's performance, it's classic Burton. With that said, I don't know that the film survives if you aren't keen on the overbearing style of Burton. I like his movies as much as the next guy (Big Fish is in my top 5 favorite films of all time), but besides Keaton, there isn't a whole lot to ride home about here.Beetlejuice has had fans clamoring for a sequel for decades, and I'm not going to be the one to shut those hopes down. With the talented cast, especially where they all are in their careers now, a sequel could be interesting. But I never found Geena Davis or Alec Baldwin's characters to be all that interesting. As they weave their way through the weirdness of the world of death, the film just veers more into a meandering area.With all the dated elements to Burton's execution, the real gems of this film come from his unique vision. If you were to walk in on this film at any particular moment, you would be able to tell that it's a Burton project, and there's something special about that. I can appreciate a unique vision, but I just wanted more of an overarching journey than a collage of creepy and just strange sequences.+Burton's style+Keaton's iconic performance-Hodgepodge of strange scenes-Supporting characters aren't that interesting6.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Plus the characters all interact with each other great it's no wonder this movie got a musical and an upcoming sequel I've watch this movie three times now over the course of my life and I think it just keeps getting better with every watch through so even tho there are movies I find better def give it a watch.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good,"After seeing the previews I thought I'd be disappointed; it just seemed wrong. However, on viewing the film I must say the persons involved did a credible job.The dichotomy in reviewer assessments of BEETLEJUICE has, I fear, more to do with the reviewers' life experiences than the film. The movie itself is nothing that special, but it has some good stuff.I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those sombre Japanese films that were popular back in the 1960s.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Exceptional makeup can't save a dull, boring screenplay","I remembered seeing this movie in a theater when it came out. I recall the good makeup and camera work, but didn't think the story was that good. So, I watched it again these many years later and had the same impressions.The idea for ""Beetlejuice"" was quite novel for the time. And there can be little doubt about the superb job of makeup, animation and special effects. And while the idea for the plot had possibilities, the screenplay is very lame. It's a challenge to stay interested because it quickly becomes boring. So much so, that the one very good performance in the film – that of Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, can't salvage the film. The comedy is flat. What little of it I could find was dull.My five stars are solely for the exceptional makeup and artwork that went into the production. It deserved its Oscar for that, but the film otherwise is a dud.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good old spooky time!,"Just watched the film a few ago and throughly enjoyed it! I haven't seen the sequel yet but I probably will soon with my mother or bc or something. I'm not an ultra in depth review since I mainly like to just ramble a bit and get on with my day but since the film is still pretty hot on my head I'll go into more details!I really enjoy the set design of this film! The vibes of the town, house, and the attic, (ALSO LYDIA'S ROOM......I swear her room is a dream come true and something I would LOVE to have once I get my own room 🖤) are absolutely perfect and give off that perfect nice town vibe while still being a bit eerie in its own way! Outfits were something I also liked as well! (Especially Lydia's! The lace choker is to die for and I would totally love to have one to pair with my outfits!) they were all excellently designed and much praise to the costume designer who worked on it!I also REALLY loved the practical effects.....I'm a major practical effects girlie and I LOVE seeing how people can get crafty with the things we have around or given to us! And this film is a good example of that! All the stop motion and other practical things in the films I throughly enjoyed seeing!I can't think of many other ways to say how much I love this film and how funny it is! I might end this off kind awkwardly bc I'm tired and very eepy rn but know this film is a good time and you should DEFINITELY check it out!Jessicka 🖤",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unpredictable ""Beetlejuice"" is effectively odd enough to be a classic","What a peculiar film. Tim Burton's first major film was and still is anything but typical. Although his imagination only gets the credit for bringing this strange concept to life, not conceiving it, it's clear why Burton has gone on to have the career he's had. ""Beetlejuice"" blends the supernatural world with the real one and does it with a wry sense of humor the entire time. Nothing about ""Beetlejuice"" is predictable, yet it goes off without a hitch, rarely missing. That's what any truly innovative classic does.Like very few but many great characters in cinema history, Beetlejuice steals the show despite a glaring lack of screen time. ""Beetlejuice"" in reality should probably not be titled as such. The film focuses on The Maitlands, a married couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die in a car accident and find themselves living as ghosts in their large former home even after the pretentious and dysfunctional Deetz family has moved in. Finding that whenever they try and leave their house they enter a bizarre sand world full of carnivorous worms, the couple desperately attempts to scare the Deetzes away, but to no avail. They soon learn Lydia, the daughter (Winona Ryder), can actually see them.Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) comes into the picture as a ghost who claims to be able to scare the living better than anyone. Full of gusto, Beetlejuice is an inappropriate, obnoxious, outspoken and not to mention decaying figure who can only be called into the world of the living when someone says his name thrice. Keaton makes him out to be the awful creature he is, but you're definitely left wanting him more on screen anyway.""Beetlejuice"" has an amusing way of walking the line between supernatural and real. Burton gives the film a very realistic tone, in part by basing much of the action in the real world but mostly by portraying the Maitlands as normal people coping with being ghosts. The fantastical and bizarre moments are lightening fast and all the more humorous for it. As the Maitlands try initially to scare the Deetzes, suddenly a closet will open and we'll see Davis hanging and ripping her face off, but the Deetzes can't see her. The ""aw, shucks"" mentality upon failure makes it all the more amusing.Basically, what normally would be used as scare tactics are embraced as opportunities for humor. Burton decides that simply because it's the afterlife doesn't mean the tone has to fit the scary pagan image or the heaven/hell image. A bit into the story already, Baldwin's character asks out in the open, ""is this heaven?"" and the comment receives no legitimate consideration. For Burton and writers Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson, it's whatever they darn well want it to be.Then there's the random factor. After establishing ""Beetlejuice"" as a spontaneous and expectation-breaking film, the living characters all break out into Harry Belafonte's ""Day O"" at the dinner table as part of the Maitlands' plan. The unforgettable scene has no rhyme or reason, something would likely fail in most other films, but Burton sets the tone so well for ""Beetlejuice"" that we embrace the random musical outburst.The pervasive strangeness of ""Beetlejuice"" and its inability to stick to any kind of sensible or effective plot structure for its short running time make the story itself so-so. It's the tone of ""Beetlejuice"" and the memorable scenes and images it creates that makes Burton's first significant directing achievement a classic.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not good enough,"Death is a strange thing in cinema because every filmmaker decides their own way of presenting the afterlife. In ""Beetlejuice"", Tim Burton has young married couple Adam and Barbara Maitland killed in a car accident in the first ten minutes of that film. Before they died, they moved into a large country house with the intention of fixing it up a bit. Now that they have died and are ghosts, an annoyed new family named the Deetzs' have moved into their house and the Maitlands want them out. They learn about a ""bio-exorcist"" who they want to hire to scare the people away. This just creates problems however. The story continues and they become friends with Deetzs' daughter Lydia who has more in common with the ghosts than her own family. Unfortunately, the movie isn't as worthwhile as it may sound because the majority of the characters just aren't interesting enough to hold the movie together. Also, with the incantations and all the references to the supernatural, it isn't even close to my Christian values. However, it is a silly movie, all done tongue-in-cheek and shouldn't be taken seriously. Still, there isn't much of a reason to see it other than Michael Keaton's insane performance as Betelgeuse which is quite fun to watch although he wasn't in it as much as I would have liked. And as always, Tim Burton's crazy visuals and ideas are always original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth seeing over and over again,"Yes Tim Burton is a great film director.  But, this is the quintessential Burton film. You have to watch it over and over again to appreciate all of the subtle humor in it.  While Keaton was good in this role, I find it is the other performers and their lines that make me laugh the most.  Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are tremendous.  The way they nonchalantly treat the subject of ghosts is perfect Burton humor.  I have seen this movie oh about 10 times and it is one of my all time favorites.

"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice","Beetlejuice is an awesome movie, it's one of the funniest movies you'll see. I will be honest, it's a strange humor as it's a dark comedy, but it's all good.I'm not sure exactly how to start this comment other than to praise Tim Burton, Beetlejuice is a movie that was based on his idea and is still remembered to this very day. He picked a great leading male, Michael Keaton as well as to pick a very strong cast that turned into what could have been a total flop into a cult classic that will be remembered for ages to come. Beetlejuice is a very strange movie that explores life after death, turning into a ghost and having to accept that you died, now move on. But what if there was one ghost who maybe had too much fun and just wanted to rock the living world? That's what Beetlejuice is about, the one zombie that you'd love to party with once but then ignore at the next party he's invited too.Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic New England country home. Upon returning from the trip to town, however, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog wandering the roadway. The couple's vehicle crashes through a covered bridge and plunges into the river below, killing Barbara and Adam. The couple soon returns home in spirit form and quickly come to the conclusion that they are dead. A book entitled Handbook for the Recently Deceased confirms the couple's suspicion that they are, in fact, dead. Barbara and Adam's peace is soon shattered when their house is sold and the new residents arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz, aspiring sculptor and Charles' second wife Delia, and Charles' goth daughter Lydia from his first marriage, move into the home. Juno, who informs Barbara and Adam that they must remain in the house for 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out, it is up to them to scare them away. Although the Maitlands remain invisible to Charles and Delia, their daughter Lydia can see Adam and Barbara and becomes their friend. Against the advice of Juno, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, a freelance ""bio- exorcist"", to scare away the Deetzes, but they have their hands full now with this crazy psycho.Michael Keaton is such a great comedic actor, he was the perfect choice, he brought the right amount of cockiness and comedy to the role. Also Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin had great chemistry as well as the perfect Leave it to Beaver-esquire type of couple that has a hard time accepting their world as the afterlife. Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder were perfect as the Deetzes, quite disturbing and awkward. I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's a great comedy classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well-aged and still works like a charm,"So.... new ""Beetlejuice (Beetlejuice)"" is out and I needed to prepare, because it seems my wife got a serious education miss-out from year ago. I checked the rating and took my kids into the adventure with warning regarding its creepiness. It was rated PG, so it thought...why not? But probably needed to remember that there are several scenes that young kids might be afraid of.My kids didn't make a scene out of those scenes, but probably would be better not to run and see this one if your kids aren't grown enough for several scenes and lines - you should check the field before watching with the young generation, but nothing is lost through the years that passed, not even the blunt and rough animation aids, that are much better today.Take one genius mind, as Burton's, to create this vision and mash-up between horror and comedy. The lines that Keaton is firing out are like straight stand up comedy. He is held back, if you compare to nowadays Deadpool, but he is the original potty mouth and sometimes seems like the love product of Deadpool and the Green Lantern (see the connecting line to Reynolds).Anyway...this movie discovered several actors for me, as a young teenager, its comedy is brilliant, its visual vision is fantastic and the cast is so good. A classic cult movie that I still enjoyed to watch these days and also with my kids. It is so well made and written, that the only thing left to do is just sit comfortably sit, watch and enjoy.Touches gently and very smart in the connection between living and dead people and all what between them. We've got Alec Baldwin (thin and young) and Geena Davis as the married couple that didn't had the time to insert kids into their lives and from the other side - the parents that have their Goth teenage daughter, but are searching a lot of personal and almost separate pleasures.It works so well, still, after almost forty years and ages so well, even when looking with the Binoculars of the present technology, its advantages and the way it makes us judge older movies that needed to relay only on the actual idea and performance of the movie's cast - and what a cast it was.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
very enjoyable,"In this imaginative and innovative comedy Baldwin and Davis are a happily married couple who have the misfortune of adapting to life after death when they're unexpectedly killed. When an obnoxious family moves into their once ideal home, they call on the services of hyper, irksome bio-exorcist Betelgeuse whose job is to get rid of the living! Considering the movie's subject matter you might go in expecting this to be much too dark for young children, however it's disarmingly pleasant and consistently laugh-out loud funny, with an over-the-top performance from Keaton, unique visual effects that really grab your attention, and a clever, original premise. ***",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Goth meets pop,"Tim Burton's second film already featured most of the recurring motifs of his gothic fairytales: the pure-hearted but eccentric misfit, ongoing parental conflicts, the ""monsters"" (in this case, the ghosts) being gentler than the wealthy and conventional human beings, the bubblegum horror aesthetics with unique color contrasts and campy visual effects, Danny Elfman's evocative score...While the plot and writing could have been treated with far more care, Burton's visual sensibility gave birth to a whole new trend of campy but imaginative, undeniably stylish gothic cinema. The depiction of the afterlife with its quirky characters and creatures is a real feast for the eyes. The green screen scenes aged poorly, but the whole claymation work still looks impressive. Trickster ghost Betelgeuse is played by an over-the-top, almost unrecognizable Michael Keaton, but unfortunately, he doesn't get much screen time. It felt like they took too long to get to the point, but once Betelgeuse gets finally released the pacing improves drastically. It's not as polished as Burton's later productions, but still works as an entertaining old-school family film for Halloween.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Has Burton's style all over it - it's a shame that the script is poor and there are few laughs to be found,"Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are both killed in a car crash, but return as ghosts in their family home. After their deaths, their house gets sold and a new family move in; mum Delia (Catherine O'Hara) dad Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). The Maitlands do not like this family and object to some of their plans for the home and try to drive the family out of the home by employing scare tactics. When this fails, they decide to enlist the help of bio-exorcist Betelguese (Michael Keaton), but Betelgeuse proves to be out of control and the Maitlands soon begin to regret asking him for help...Beetlejuice actually starts out as an OK film; the Maitlands are both likeable enough (if a tad icky) and the idea of them trying to scare the living away from their home in a farcical way certainly sounds funny; sort of like an amusing take on The Poltergeist or Amityville Horror. Regrettably though, for me this just didn't work. Like I say, Baldwin and Davis are likeable enough and do OK in their respective roles, but the script is poor and gives them no amusing lines and not a great deal to work with. This also extends to most of the family who move into the house; the likes of O'Hara and Jones are capable actors, but in Beetlejuice their contributions are barely memorable and add nothing to the film. Shaddix seems to just be playing Associate Bob from Demolition Man again. Winona Ryder's character is explored better than the other characters, but her quirky macabre weirdness should have been used better and I was disappointed that she wasn't given any good lines either.So we've established that the script is rubbish and the story (such as it is) is rather thin, but Burton still has 2 things up his sleeve; the first is Michael Keaton and the second is the visuals. In this context, the former is certainly energetic and occasionally amusing, but he's only in the picture for about a fifth of the running time which would mean he would need to be a strong presence and side-splittingly funny to make up for the shortfall elsewhere in the film; the truth is that he isn't and I think the only scene involving Betelgeuse that I actually found slightly amusing was the scene where they were all inside the model. The visuals are indeed bright and colourful, but once again it feels like Burton's outlandish visuals are merely there to detract from all of the other lesser qualities of the film creating a style over substance feel (that being said the visuals now look somewhat tacky, but hey this film was made 30 years ago so again this perhaps should be taken in context as well).It's sad really because I think Tim Burton was definitely the right man to direct this film and perhaps that's the reason this film has a cult following, but unless you purely watch films to look at the scenery then there is little point in wasting your time here.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not as great as it could've been but special,"Tim Burton directs Beetlejuice. This film is a totally wacky ride from start to finish that all in all achieves a quite complex plot with the main story of the protagonists with their own existential struggles colliding with the introduction of the sort of villain/anti-hero whose name is hilariously spelled ""Betelgeuse"", played by Michael Keaton, an actor difficult to quite squeeze into a category, his performances are so eclectic and varied. He does a fine job, for a character very difficult to incarnate, but just like the film as a whole, it really does feel like missed opportunity, seeing the potential of such a unique character, with such a unique design/concept and humor, that even later became the object of a (fairly good) cartoon series. It's funny, very good in places, very developed and creative visually, quite entertaining, but it seems to lack on a certain level of depth and the elements at hand. Like they didn't make the best of what they had.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's showtime,"Beetlejuice is, in a word, perfect. That's not to say it's flawless (no movie is), but it's the perfect film of its breed, pure escapism and weirdness for the sake of weirdness with a touch of the macabre (okay, maybe more than a touch). In other words, it's peak Tim Burton. In fact, it may be his best movie, or at least my favorite. The plot, like all great fantasy movies, doesn't rely on a ton of exposition, instead often letting the visuals and performances tell the story. As a result, it's nice and simple, as well as easy to follow. Of course, this wouldn't work if the visuals weren't exceptional, which they are. The sets, costumes, blue screen effects, and Oscar winning makeup are classic Burton: twisted, grotesque, and highly creative. They also lead to some hilarious jokes (like the one guy who still smokes despite being burnt to a crisp) and scares (like the giant snake). Even the effects that haven't really aged that well still work because they add to the otherworldly atmosphere the film is going for. Helping matters is Burton's top notch directing and Danny Elfman's enjoyably quirky score, as well as some catchy songs. The dance number to Day-O alone is worth watching the film for.The visuals only work so well without a stellar cast of characters to react to them. Thankfully, this film has them in spades. Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis and Winona Ryder make for great straight men (straight people?), there to react to and be affected by all the weirdness, further adding to the charm and humor, as well as giving some great lines of dialogue. Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Glen Shadix are enjoyably despicable, the kind of characters you just love to hate without going too far to the point where they aren't likeable. But, the real star is Michael Keaton as the title character. Like Batman the year after, he takes full advantage of his limited screentime to create a truly unforgettable character for the ages. Everything, from his voice, to his makeup, his endlessly quotable lines, his many odd quirks, and his solid handling of the physical aspects of the role, lead to a character that provides us a ton of laughs and shows us a good time.Overall, I absolutely love Beetlejuice. It's a film that never gets old no matter how many times I watch it and I can't recommend it enough. As for the sequel, I look forward to checking it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Comedy meets horror...and it works,"His true first film, not just a cinematic starting point in general and in his personalities in particular, but a source of Burton's entire creative energy.The film doesn't really appear in any lists of best films, probably because it seems somewhat unpolished. But hey, unpolished is also a sign of quality. Another reason is perhaps a certain lack of orientation, less on the part of the work than on the part of the viewer. It's just one of those things with horror comedies, the consumer of the one doesn't really want to connect with the other. Nevertheless, The Bioexorcist was a sensational hit in the cinema at the time; there was something fascinatingly special about this difficult mixture. The difficult subject of death, realised without depth, rather as morbid gag fireworks, full of tastelessness and crazy ideas. We get quirky characters, a sarcastic look at small-town madness and big-city yuppietum, as well as some intense horror. Only the rushed and somewhat unimaginative ending weakens the overall picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Performances and Vision But.....,"Beetlejuice (1988)** 1/2 (out of 4)A newly deceased couple (Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis) are horrified to learn that a new family is about to move into their former home so they decide to scare them away. When that doesn't work the dead couple must call on a ""bio-exorcist"" (Michael Keaton) who has a few different tricks to play. BEETLEJUICE is a film loved by many but I'm not one of them. I remember going to see this film when it first came out and I remember being pretty disappointed in it. I finally decided to revisit the movie to see if it's grown on me any and it hasn't sadly. There's still plenty of stuff that I really enjoy here but in the end the film was just too cold for me. Among the stuff I do enjoy is the vision of Burton who really does a very good job at giving us a rather beautiful, deranged and surreal picture. I really loved the sets, the weird characters and of course the visions of what it's like to be dead. I'm really not sure if there was another director out there who could have done a better job because of purely a visual this film is a treat. Another major plus is the all-star cast even those who aren't given too much to do. I thought both Baldwin and Davis were very good early on as the happy-go-lucky couple but once they're dead I found the screenplay didn't use either of them all that well. Winona Ryder nearly steals the film as the strange teenager who isn't afraid of the ghost and instead turns out to be their friend. I really loved the Gothic style she brings to the role and I thought she was perfect at playing that laid back character. Catherine O'Hara. Jeffrey Jones, Dick Cavett and Sylvia Sidney are all good in their parts as well. Then, of course, there's Keaton who delivers a wonderful performance as the title character. The fast, maniac style that Keaton brings to the role is quite unforgettable and he really does a terrific job at coming off just like an animated cartoon character. I think Keaton really deserves a lot of credit because not too many actors could have played a part like this and it's doubtful many would have had the personality to shine through all the make-up and special effects. With all of that said you'd think I would be more warm to the film but I can't be. I think after a cute opening and set-up the only thing we get are gimmicks. There's not really much of a story. There's not really much to any of the characters. I'd also say that there aren't nearly enough funny moments. The entire film just strikes me as all style and very little substance.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's entertaining enough, I just thought more was coming.Michael Keaton is the star of the film no doubt, very amusing stuff from him as the titular character.

You kids and your imaginations","Beetlejuice is a 1988 dark fantasy horror comedy that follows a recently deceased couple trying to rid their home of the obnoxious family that has moved in.Directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton in the title role, Beetlejuice is one of those classic movies from my childhood that just never get old no matter how many times you've seen it. It's an entertaining film with a unique and creative story that is brought to life by a fantastic cast that delivers superb performances. Its dark comedic style is not only hilarious, but also visually stimulating with terrific cinematography. Burton captures the afterlife with such creativity and imagination that even the smallest side character will be remembered forever.I absolutely love this movie and always will. If you've never seen Beetlejuice before, I would highly recommend checking it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Tim Burton at His Finest,"What a wacky film! The premise is interesting, the cast is stacked and there are iconic moments/lines littered throughout. Tim Burton has one of the strangest minds in filmmaking history, and you either love him or you hate him.While I haven't loved a lot of his other films, I really enjoyed Beetlejuice (once I embraced the weirdness of it). I would have liked to see a little more of Beetlejuice himself, but in the end I really enjoyed the movie.Best Character: Beetlejuice

Not a fan of Beetlejuice,"I had this movie on my watchlist for a long time and decided to finally watch it. Oh wow it was not what I was expecting. What even is this movie? The beginning was actually pretty good, but the middle and ending not so much. The character Beetlejuice is unbearable to watch. I didn't like his persona and inappropriateness. I'm glad I didn't watch this movie in childhood because I would've paid less attention to the script and not realized how inappropriate some parts of the movie are. This is without a doubt the worst Tim Burton film of all time. The high ratings and praise for this movie surprised me. Maybe people rate this movie higher due to nostalgia or something.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you loved The Mask, you gotta love Beetlejuice","When I watched for the very first time Beetlejuice, I was still a young child whose only reference to the After Life World was the TV show cartoon Casper, that young ghost whose only wish is to become a little boy once again.So when my parents showed me that movie for the first time and tried to comfort me, assuring that it's not as scary as it looks, I was spooked anyway (the pun is intended).But I loved it even if I was scared a couple of times. I don't know maybe it's because that movie reminds me a lot of one of my favorite childhood picture ever: The Mask.Even if the two stories are way different from each other, The Mask and Beetlejuice share a lot of similarities. Their main characters share the same craziness, the same power to do what they want without any limit, the same way to modify their body shape as well. They are both carefree and seem to get out straight from a cartoon. Maybe Michael Keaton has been one of the model Jim Carrey took the inspiration from to play such an eccentric character as The Mask.The secondary roles are greatly played too starting with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. They have a great chemistry together and they are so sweet impersonating that young couple who suddenly dies in a tragic car crash and are forced to watch what was their home being taken over by a very obnoxious family they want out. They are not particularly being gifted into scaring this family away but that what's making them so attaching.Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix are also so good playing the new owners. My favorite is Winona by far. She's such a treat playing this young lonely goth girl who befriends Baldwin and Davis as they are the only ones who seems to care about her.Even Juno and her footballers alongside the dead staff are so hilarious to watch. The only two scenes in which they appears are so fun to watch. There's absolutely nothing to throw away about the cast performance, it's perfect.Just as this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun and Terrific Ghoul Film.,"This is fun and terrific film to watch from Tim Burton, a story about a happily married couple, Adam and Barbara Maitland, played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, who were killed in a car crash. They turn into ghosts and are trapped in their beloved farmhouse. Soon, the house was inhabited by the Deetzs, who has completely odd taste in decoration and personality and turns their home into a modern museum-like house. Unable to drive them away, the ghosts summon Beetle Juice, the Ghost with the Most, by calling his name three times. He gave the family a good haunting, but wants the family's daughter, who befriended the Maitlands. So, the movie goes on-don't want to spoil the ending.The acting is superb, and Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice is simply hilarious, with endless tricks up his sleeves. Winona Ryder as Lydia gave a hands-down performance, eerie and somber, yet passionate and haunting. The scenes involving the ""other side"" brings your imagination to a whole new level, everything you would expect in a ghost world-moving skeletons, lost souls, a moving hangman, unorganized and chaotic-looking offices (papers everywhere), a lady with her body cut in half, uneven rooms and a football team who was unaware they were dead, just to name a few. And, one of my favorite scenes is the dinner party, where the ghosts tried to drive away the family by controlling their actions and making them sing a Harry Belafonte song. Danny Elfman gave us a fabulous music score-haunting, exciting and refreshing.This is just a great movie that I could watch again and again.So, go say his name three times and watch Beetle Juice.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Juiceless.,"Terribly over-rated film that stars Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as a recently deceased married couple who just cannot get new owners Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones out of their dream house. Thus they decide to contact supernatural nut-job Michael Keaton (in the titled role) to scare the new tenants out of their rightful home. Winona Ryder is almost unrecognizable as Jones' very dark and spooky daughter. Short roles by Sylvia Sydney, Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet do nothing to help out Tim Burton's weak direction and the even weaker screenplay. Not near as funny as it would like to be. Strangely a box office success and still a favorite with many movie-goers, but not with this one. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Essential Tim Burton with a nice bunch of laughs,"Every Tim Burton picture is capable of inducing many uncontrollable laughs from the audience. On the other hand, it's also able to hypnotize through this specific Burton-y tone and visual style that characterizes all of his productions.And Beetlejuice is definitely that one picture, which actually started a sudden Burton-mania and put him on the spot as one of the most eccentric and original directors of the 20th century.When a light-hearted couple, Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam (Alec Baldwin) Maitland, unexpectedly die one day, they realize that they will be trapped in their own house for another 'couple' of years without any chances of getting out. And this wouldn't be a bad thing, if it weren't for one irritating family, which bought the home, moved in, and wants to make a few changes inside. Being two regular ghosts, the prime residents understand that the only way to get rid of the annoying new homeowners is to scare them away. Unfortunately, all this doesn't seem to be too easy, as they quickly become a sort of attraction for the Deetz clan. The only person that is able to actually see and bond with the unhappy couple is the overly weird and gloomy Lydia (Winona Ryder). She wants to help her new and lifeless friends. Yet, as things still don't go as planned, it appears that the only creature that may be of any guidance is the aberrant, obnoxious, and very impetuous Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton)Calling himself a 'bio-exorcist', he promises to scare away the Deetzes with a couple of his frightening tricks. However, there is something else on his wild mind – he wants to force Lydia into becoming his lovely bride. And this doesn't seem to suit anyone in particular.The movie has plenty of fantastically humorous gags, applied in a rather macabre and dark manner, so typical of a film created by Tim Burton. What's more, all of the creatures that appear in the otherworld scenery are hilarious and look like they were taken straight out of a cartoon (also, look for the group of dead football players - a reference to a tragic plane crash that really happened).Michael Keaton gives an incredible performance as the preposterous, ludicrous, and totally ridiculous deceased exterminator, who happens to look for some love in the human world. From the moment when we see him for the first time the movie gets on a totally different, much faster pace. He soon becomes the brightest star of the movie, with all that he says and does, and in a most amusing way.It's funny to watch Alec Baldwin in such an untypical role. I must say that even though we are accustomed to seeing him in more of action-hero-type movies, he still gives a decent performance. His character seems fairly likable, and combined with Geena Davis as his wife, the two create a couple that everyone can adore.All in all, if you are looking for some fun time with a movie that won't bore you for a second, give Beetlejuice a try. It's a Burton creation that is as heart-warming, as it is crazy and bizarre.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I am baffled by this film's popularity. The plot is weak as water, the acting is rubbish, the comedy is painfully unfunny and has nothing interesting to say about anything. The characters lack any depth, and are flat stereotypes at best. I was quite frankly bored throughout and kept asking myself when the movie would actually begin or what the point of any of it was. The visual side is, furthermore, annoying to look at. The slight influence by German expressionism is nothing more than an empty quirk present in all of Burton's cinematic disasters. If it weren't for the handful of jokes of a sexual nature, I would have thought this was a bad kid's film that anyone above the age of 12 would have found torturous to behold. Yet it seems it is the type of film that middle class individuals with an average IQ and some probably rather unimaginative degree might enjoy watching because they read it had received good reviews. In fact, I am sure this movie could serve as an excellent test to filter out all the people who are not worth talking to. Life is short, don't waste 90 minutes on this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

77/100Although entertaining on the outside, Beetlejuice does drop down into some pits in regards to its overall storyline, the final act isn't of my particular taste and, for some reason, the humourous tones didn't age really well for a classic that wasn't released long ago....Now, the natural campiness of it, I don't mind, after all, it comes across as that, ""natural"". Keaton is automatically the scene-stealer from the moment he comes along. It would have helped if the movie was a musical (something that I was startled for as soon as I found out the film wasn't even remotely theatre-esque) Funnily enough, the aspect where the film lacks in the most resides in its soundtrack.... The other performances are ok, I suppose.....Tim ""black people don't fit my aesthetic"" Burton, despite his controversies, did something somewhat particular with this picture, even if it personally doesn't hold itself up as much as it would've if i had watched this at a younger age.

The Weirdest Film I've Ever Seen- My First Time Watching Beetlejuice,"Beetlejuice is an amazing movie, but you know it is bizarre. This is probably the weirdest film I have ever seen. Now this is my first time watching Beetlejuice and many reviewers on here stated that they have watched this movie multiple times. Here's my thoughts. Like I said before, this movie is really bizarre. It very quickly leaps into the topic of death at around 5 minutes in the movie and stays that way. It happens so quickly it's pretty bizarre that they did it so quickly. Then the movie changes tones. It becomes so slow paced it's really bizarre. This movie is just so messy too. It's just got a lot of really random stuff in it and really the whole movie is pretty random. I wonder who was even in line to watch this at the theaters? The movie also has some really random and weird monsters that make it so bizarre too. Do you know what is probably the most bizarre thing of all? Beetleguese barely got any screen time, despite the whole movie being named after him. Well. Kind of being named after him. He barely has any place in the movie at all and he's just there to add comedy. This movie was just very confusing and bizarre,and that's why I give it a high rating. Beetlejuice isn't afraid to show its imperfect, flawed, messy side. This is a very bold choice for Tim Burton since this film is just so so bad it's good. This is just so boring and so messy that you have to marvel at Burton's choice. And the ending. That just feels so odd. You have to marvel at how this film was even made. I love it. They should never make a movie like this ever again. Unfortunately, they will. Say hello to Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Or Beetlejuice 2. I don't think that Hollywood can make anything like this anymore and I think trying to make a sequel of this weird movie will result in failure, but I don't know. Maybe the sequel will be even better than this one. Maybe it'll be worse but still be pretty good. I hope the sequel has more humor. Even though this movie had some humor, it didn't have that much. The only humor that happened was when Beetlegeuse was on screen, and he wasn't on screen much. That girl Lydia!! She gives me big Wednesday Addams vibes. Well, in the sequel she'll be played by Wednesday's actor, Jenna Ortega. Is that girl even human? I'm not sure. Anyway, this movie is so weird and messy that I have to honor Tim Burton for it. In all, I give this movie a 7.7 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A beginning or near beginning of many a career,"This film is a delightfully nutty ""horror"" movie. Looking back on it from this distance, it was clearly a beginning or near beginning of many a career. Geena Davis was probably the most established star, save, I guess for Michael Keaton, who chewed the scenery relentlessly. Ms. Davis was so cute. This seems to be Tim Burton's first real movie, which set the dark tone for many of his future projects. I'm thinking that this was likely the last time that Alec Baldwin was in any way charming. And this also seemed to have really started Winona Ryder along her career path. As I recall it also re-ignited some interest in the calypso tunes of the long-forgotten Harry Belafonte. The effects seem quaint these days, but were just fine back in the day. Surely just about everyone has seen this one, but if not, check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"My heads spinning, boy I'm in a daze.","With the release of the sequel, it feels right to revisit what brought us here in the first place: Beetlejuice, one of the most bizarre films of the late eighties by Tim Burton, a director known for his singular vision. The influence of Beetlejuice has been undeniable over the years, with its shades seen in characters like Jim Carrey's Stanley Ipkiss from The Mask and even in the irreverent humour of Deadpool. However, Beetlejuice stands out for being one of the first films to blend the living and the dead with comedic effect, creating a genre-bending dark comedy much like The Addams Family while exploring the afterlife with a playful, surreal twist.The narrative is simple but effective: a couple dies in a car accident and returns home only to find they are ghosts, stuck watching as a new family moves in. In their desperation to reclaim their home, they turn to Beetlejuice, a ""bio-exorcist"" with chaotic, mischievous energy. The film explores what might happen if the living and the dead could interact, all while balancing humor with a hint of horror. Burton's artistry shines through in the film's set designs and characters, blending his signature gothic style with eccentric, almost childlike wonder.Beetlejuice has earned its place as a cult classic, thanks in large part to its imaginative world and the standout performance of Michael Keaton. Although Beetlejuice himself appears sparingly, Keaton's portrayal is unforgettable-his manic energy and devilish charm dominate the screen, leaving the audience always wanting more. It's no wonder Burton trusted Keaton with an entirely different role the following year as Batman. The teasing nature of his limited screen time makes Beetlejuice even more magnetic, and it's clear that Keaton's performance is the film's heartbeat.Tim Burton's Beetlejuice not only showcases his unique vision but also set the tone for future films blending dark comedy and the supernatural. Its imaginative world, unforgettable characters, and Michael Keaton's iconic portrayal ensure that the film remains a defining moment in late 80s cinema, one that continues to influence and inspire today. Alongside Keaton, the extravagant cast includes Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Catherine O' Hara and Jeffrey Jones. However the gothic most secluded of them all giving a very real performance amongst the outlandish dinner party we have Winona Ryder.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best. Film. Ever.,This will never stop being one of my fave films of all time. So quirky and off beat in all the best way. Winona Ryder is freaking incredible at being the weird kid everybody wants to be friends with. Animation honestly still holds up today because it's just so bizarre. Characters are so well developed whilst being dead which is pretty impressive and the Shake Señora scene will be forever iconic. I hope to god they never attempt to make a sequel/remake of this because nothing could touch its bizarre brilliancy. Also shout out to the costume designers because Lydia's wedding dress is an item of clothing I'm still mad that I don't own.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton at his best!,"Beetlejuice is one of the finest movies from the '80s, and it's got that classic Tim Burton vibe that we've been missing since Sweeney Todd and Frankenweenie came out; and this movie has all that stylistic and visual goodness that Burton would apply to Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Batman Returns. Beetlejuice helped demonstrate Burton's ability to make dark and somber set-ups into funny romps that can still make for some spectacular stuff on the big screen.Beetlejuice is dark fun and great pop-cinema for everyone to enjoy.

"""The strange and unusual""","It's difficult to make a truly scary horror these days, simply because the staples of the genre have become so familiar culturally. A Dracula in a dinner jacket or Frankenstein's monster with a bolt through his neck nowadays appear more comical than creepy. And there's always been a fine line between what frightens us and what makes us laugh – in both cases it's the twisted and the offbeat. Perhaps this is why horror spoofs have the potential to be so rich and enjoyable.Beetlejuice takes a cunning idea for its story, with similarities to classic afterlife fantasy pictures like Here Comes Mr Jordan, but with an Addams Family slant thrown into the mix. The development of this plot was not a straightforward one. Michael McDowell's original script was much darker and more violent, and somewhat more complex. As well as adding a good-natured comedic tone, the Warren Skaaren rewrite is incredibly succinct in its storytelling. The Maitlands are introduced with expert brevity – in just a couple of minutes and a few lines of dialogue we know all about their idyllic lifestyle, and their only regret being that they don't have children. The narrative then wastes no time in killing them off and getting the real story going. How many lesser pictures would have faffed around for ten or fifteen minutes before getting to this crucial plot point? Integral to the overall look of Beetlejuice is its having been directed by Tim Burton. Credits may go to various individuals for production design and visual effects, but it's fairly clear they are all working from Burton's own sketches. In interviews Burton often claims to have little formal knowledge of classic cinema, but his tribute to German expressionism is especially clear in this picture, although for Burton it is largely employed for his own bizarre aesthetics. Incidentally I also spy a nod towards the work of Dutch painter Vermeer in the shot where Lydia writes her would-be suicide note. And there's much more to Burton's visual scheme than simple design. He often begins a scene with close-ups or mid-shots, rather than a wide, establishing shot, so that we don't really get a proper impression of the space in which the action is taking place. Another ace director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus) uses a similar tactic, but whereas Forman does it to focus us more on the performances, Burton's aim seems to be largely to disconcert and disorientate the viewer. After all, Burton does emphasise the settings, throwing in bizarrely angled outdoor shots and props overhanging the foreground. Again it's all calculated to make the movie's world as weird as possible. But none of this is ever exaggerated enough to distract us from story and character.Not that we are likely to lose sight of characters when the acting performances are so attention-grabbing. At the heart of it all is Michael Keaton's wild portrayal of the titular antagonist. There's so much going on in his performance – look at the range of facial twitches he goes through in the few seconds after Adam says he has a few questions. Keaton is also a great improviser, and thought up with a lot of his own material here. You can tell when he's improvising, because he comes out with stuff you just couldn't script – example: ""Now that is why I never do two shows in a night. I just won't do it, I won't."" It wouldn't work on paper but it's hilarious coming out of Keaton's mouth. The other stand out is Sylvia Sidney who gets a small cameo. Not many modern viewers know Sidney, but she was a lead actress back in the 1930s, usually a warm-hearted romantic figure and quite the opposite of this grouchy old lady. Still, she brings the necessary memorable impact to her small but important role. Honourable mentions also go to jolly character actor Jeffrey Jones and the appropriately oddball Glenn Shadix, who sadly died last year.The icing on the cake is that Beetlejuice is filled with inspired touches that make it stand out from the crowd, little ideas that are not strictly required by the story but elevate it from some wacky spoof into a horror-comedy classic. There's the use of stop-motion animation, which Burton has long championed. Stop-motion doesn't look especially realistic, but compared to CGI it has a kind of life to it (if you'll excuse the metaphor). Then there's the complete non-sequitur use of Harry Belafonte songs. There's nothing remotely horror-themed about Day-O or Jump in the Line (apart from the tenuous link between Afro-Caribbean culture and zombies) but it doesn't really matter. Beetlejuice is a horror-comedy let loose, in which anything can happen, and frequently does. And that's what makes it so fine.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This movie elevates weird to a whole different level. But, does that make it good or bad?","""Beetlejuice"" (1988), before I get into my review, I just wanted to say this. Tim Burton is a talented film maker, a lot of the movies he gets involved in are good! However, even great film directors make a few duds here and there. ""Beetlejuice"", in my opinion, is his biggest downfall. Plus, it's also one of the top ten weirdest films I've ever seen in my life. It has a stupid and unfunny story, and the acting was embarrassing overall. This plot is, a dead couple turn into ghosts and they haunt their former house. Yep, it's every bit as basic as it sounds. That being said, in the aspect of comedy movies, a simple story is warranted, as it allows for more humor and jokes to occur. However, in the case of this film, there were no laughs and for the majority of the movie, nothing happens. The best way I can describe this so-called storyline, is weird and unsettling. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for that kind of storytelling in a film or TV show. But, it has to make sense within the context of the plot itself. All this movie does is show an onslaught of awkward fantasy sequences that make you feel completely uncomfortable when you watch it. If there's one thing a movie shouldn't do, is make the audience feel uncomfortable while watching. Probably the other biggest issue here is the lack of humor. I did not smile, let alone laugh once. All I did was sit there in stunned silence, and anticipate the the glorious end credits. Most of Tim Burton's films are known for being strange out-of-body experiences. ""Beetlejuice"" is what I imagine occurs as a result of someone's twisted pipe dream. He must've wrote it when he was high! Although, if you were to watch this movie, regardless if you do drugs or not, you would feel like you were taking them. Even though this film is 92 minutes in length, it lasts forever and you're just eager for it to end! As for the acting, it's just an embarrassment. Probably the saddest thing in this case is, this movie has a fairly decent cast! The cast includes: Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder and even more! You would think that with a huge lineup of talent, it couldn't possibly fail. But somehow, it did miserably and we, as an audience are forced to suffer from it. None of the acting is any good at all. Not even Michael Keaton could save it, and he's a great actor! But, his portrayal of Betelgeuse just comes across as obnoxious and annoying. Yes, I get that's supposed to be the nature of his character. That being said, obnoxious characters should never be the main star in a film. Characters like that should be secondary, to avoid irritating the audience, including me. None of the cast members put forth any effort whatsoever with their performances, not one! How is that possible? These actors and actresses have acted well in other media. What happened to them here? They must've just did it for the money. I could be wrong about that, but I would be very surprised if I was. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this movie. The sets/locations are interesting and give the film a decent atmosphere. However, I think Tim Burton put more focus on the movie sets/locations instead of the story, because the sets/locations are more appealing than the plot. How ironic! Right? All of the special effects are very well-done. As I've said before, practical effects beat CGI any day. There are some effects that look a bit aged here and there. But overall, the effects still look good today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman is excellent. Danny Elfman is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers and this one is no different. My personal favorite part of this soundtrack is the ""Beetlejuice"" theme song. It has a fun and mysterious feel to it, and it makes you feel like you're in a whole new world when you listen to it. Unfortunately, it just had to get tied to this movie. ""Beetlejuice"" is nothing short of a mangled mess all the way from beginning to end. It's such a crying shame, because Tim Burton is very talented. I really wanted to like this film, but sadly, it just left me wondering why they even bothered if they weren't going to try. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Beetlejuice"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, to be a bad movie. If you're looking to get into Tim Burton films, I would recommend watching pretty much any of his movies except for ""Beetlejuice"". Why?

This film, often celebrated for its quirky and silly nature, has rightfully earned its place as a cult classic, captivating audiences with its eccentric charm and imaginative storytelling.From the moment the film begins, viewers are transported into a world where the ordinary meets the extraordinary. The narrative follows a recently deceased couple navigating the afterlife, only to find their peaceful existence disrupted by the rambunctious and unpredictable bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice. Michael Keaton's portrayal of the titular character is nothing short of iconic, delivering a performance that is both hilariously over-the-top and endearingly mischievous.The film's visual style is quintessentially Burtonesque, with its gothic aesthetics, whimsical set designs, and a color palette that oscillates between the vibrant and the eerie. The special effects, though a product of their time, add to the film's charm, creating a surreal atmosphere that perfectly complements the offbeat narrative.One of *Beetlejuice*'s greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance humor with the macabre. The script is peppered with witty dialogue and absurd situations that keep the audience engaged and entertained. The supporting cast, including Winona Ryder as the morose Lydia Deetz and Catherine O'Hara as her eccentric mother, deliver performances that are both memorable and integral to the film's success.Despite its quirky and silly demeanor, Beetlejuice offers a deeper commentary on life, death, and the afterlife, wrapped in a package that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. The film's enduring popularity is a testament to its unique charm and the timeless appeal of its characters and story.In conclusion, Beetlejuice is a film that defies conventional genres, offering a viewing experience that is both whimsical and profound. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of watching this cult classic, it is undoubtedly worth your time. Its blend of humor, horror, and heart ensures that it remains a beloved favorite among fans of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Showtime!,"Over 30 years since this films release and it still astounds. The creativity, the humor, the performances, the darkness and the camp all add up to create something we just don't see these days. Beetlejuice is the kind of movie that would never get made today, it's too weird, too crazy and too original to make it to the big screen.All that said, this kind of film is likely to be divisive. It will either work for you or it won't. It'll be your kind of weird or it'll be way too out there or too campy. Regardless it's worth a shot.

Ghosts wants the living out...,"I love Burton's movies,being an ex-goth(still are on the inside)and all;)Beetlejuice is the story of a young couple(Davis and Baldwin)who moves into their dream home,a big white house on a hill overlooking a small town. However as luck would have it,they both die as their car slides off a bridge when they are on their way into town to buy some supplies. At first they don't realize they have passed.It takes a new family to move in,the somewhat neurotic Deetz's,before they completely face the fact... the Gothic daughter seem okay enough,but they still want the Deetz's out. Who would bet better suited for the task than the exorcist himself,Beetlejuice(Keaton)?Only,he's a ghost himself and he exorcises the living...I like this movie a lot,it's Burton-crazy and I have always felt a great sympathy both for the newly departed couple and the neurotic,misunderstood daughter(Ryder) who tries to become friends with the house-ghosts.An highly unusual plot,which I think any person with even the slightest dark sense of humor will enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton's Career When It Was About Peaked,"The Maitlands (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a happy young couple in a big house, redecorating to their hearts' content while another relative insists that they sell. After a minor car accident, both of them drown and the house is sold... but unfortunately the couple still ""lives"" on inside the home alongside the annoying new family. How can they scare the newcomers away?I watched this film on Halloween 2007 for two reasons -- first, because you need to watch scary movies on Halloween (although I think this is really more of a comedy). But second, because Robert Goulet had passed on a few days before, and I felt it would only be right and proper to honor the man who had made such an impression in my life after seeing him sing live in 2002.As far as I know, this film marks the first Tim Burton and Michael Keaton collaboration, before they both went on to make the two best Batman films in history (at least until Chris Nolan came around). We also have Jeffrey Jones, another regular and the music by Danny Elfman from Oingo Boingo. Winona Ryder (from Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"") is here, and this is by far her greatest role. Maybe her only truly great role, in fact, as this is the way I like to remember her... not so much as Spock's mother.Tim Burton was perfect to direct this film, giving him a range of weird and grotesque things to work with, weird clay stuff and wild architecture. It's like the peak of his career because it's as strange as ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and as dark as any of his films... all of which were perfect until he picked ""Planet of the Apes"" and his career died a brutal death (with the post-Apes exception of ""Big Fish"" and perhaps ""Big Eyes"").That is what you get here, though: comedy and the macabre, mixed together... a world where suicide victims get to spend the afterlife as civil servants... and your death wound stays visible forever. (Drowning seems to have been a good choice to avoid looking awful.) Michael Keaton at his dirtiest (think ""Night Shift"" and not ""Mr. Mom""). Oh, and Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song""... you need that.So, should you see it? The real question is why haven't you already? Any horror fan will appreciate this, as will any Tim Burton fan. The feel of this film is fun and fresh even two decades later. There is a special edition 20th anniversary DVD, which also offers a few episodes of the cartoon for some reason. It isn't great... maybe next time?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Early Burton, so not fully there yet","Juxtaposing sweetness and creepiness together to make a bizarre movie is kind of the Tim Burton brand by now but this seems to be a version of him that is not fully realized and perfected for that but still enjoyable. Keaton is the real horror here, even when mostly disguised as a perverted joker. Can't believe how utterly horrific the original script was compared to this. I can't see Hollywood producing that without making it sleezy and exploitative instead of actually exploring any themes deeply. Glad it turned out to be this instead and in the hands of Burton, even if it still could've been a bit more polished with respect to writing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Pretty Good Entertaining 80s Classic Flick From Tim Burton,"7.5/10
It's quite an entertaining film, Beetlejuice was fascinating in terms of all the weird special effects, those classic good old scary 80s incredibly creative and well made special effects, i really love it, Michael Keaton was great playing this lunatic person, Winona Ryder, Catherine O'hara were all entertaining to watch, and so do Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and while the story of it was sure silly and the more you think about it wasn't really that exciting or amazing, i mean it's entertaining enough, and i think if they use Beetlejuice more in it, it could make it even better for me, but overall Beetlejuice is still a pretty good entertaining 80s classic flick from Tim Burton.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stop motion animation at it's finest!,"By far my favorite Tim Burton movie as a kid! You can really see the effort and creativity that went into the making Beetlejuice! Few companies even use stop-motion animation anymore in favor of bad CGI! I have to say, I quite surprise that the stoic Batman, Michael Keaton portrayed, was the zany Beetlejuice just one year prior! Keaton definitely has a very broad acting range! Beetlejuice is like one of those fast-talking salesman stereotypes, but it really works! This is also one Geena Davis's best movies, although I found Davis and Baldwin to be rather bland. Honestly, you could switch Baldwin out with David Yost, and Davis with Andie MacDowell, and I don't think anyone would've noticed. Wynona Ryder is very believable teenager with an insufferable family, as intended. Overall, it was a great cast. The story is very straight forward ghosts want humans out of their house.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

We enjoyed all the ghosts spirits and random spooky elements throughout the movie, including some funny moments as well.

Geeky Randy's summary,"1980s Burton/Keaton combo you can't go wrong! Deals with a family haunted by a recently deceased young couple (Baldwin and Davis)—yes, it certainly sounds like a cliché horror movie, but the talented cast and the memorable scenes make it anything but, especially with Keaton in the titular role as an obnoxious ghost trying to permanently scare away the new inhabitants. As with many Burton films, the movie relies heavily on visuals (that were impressive for its time, but are now a tad dated), leaving the audience with a fun ride that is worth revisiting once every few years, but lacks any iconic characters or dialogue worth reciting.**½ (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!","I just got done watching Beetlejuice (1988) for the first time and I loved it. For me personally, this is the first true Tim Burton Movie.Positives for Beetlejuice (1988):
The main thing that makes this movie stand out and the reason why this is one of Tim Burton's best movies is of course the eccentric performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This guy just oozes with charisma every single time he shows up on screen. The other thing that makes this movie stand out and pop is the production value and setting design of this movie as it feels like a living and breathing character itself. I also loved Danny Elfman's musical score as it gives an extra dose of life to the movie. I also really enjoyed Winona Ryder as Lydia Deetz, who is also bursting with charisma. I also really appreciated the more grounded performances from Alec Baldwin as Adam Maitland, Geena Davis as Barbara Maitland, Jeffrey Jones as Charles Deetz and Catherine O'Hara as Delia Deetz. And finally unlike Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), the weirdness and quirkiness of this movie actually works and doesn't take me out of the movie.Overall, I had a blast with Beetlejuice (1988) and I'm very excited for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024) coming out next month.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good film,"Good film. The Maitlands are unable to scare the family away. Only Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) sees them and understand their predicament.They then bring in a bio-exorcist ghost Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) who runs amok. Now the Maitlands have to rein him in.For Hollywood, Beetlejuice is bizarre, freaky and surreal. It has a manic and pervy performance from Keaton. He is very much a supporting character here as the villain in this creepy comedy.Burton plays homage to other horror films, he brings in veteran Sylvia Sidney as the afterlife spiritual guide who knows all about the chaos Betelgeuse could unleash. The afterlife as a civil service bureaucracy seems to be inspired from Powell and Pressburger.The special effects might have now aged, a lot of it was stop motion animation.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Cosmic Corruption and Delightful Distortion,"Tim Burton's second feature film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure (1985) and made one year before he became a household name with Batman (1989), Beetlejuice is one of the Director's quintessential movies.It is a dementia of style that permeates all his work and is never more evident than in this unbridled, unique presentation of pure underground art.There is nothing to compare this film too because it is a singularly novel piece of work. Burton's animated features also present his quirky vision and the work is probably most at home in that venue. Although Edward Scissorhands (1990) might be his masterpiece.All art is a matter of taste and the art of Tim Burton, love it or not, is fully exposed in every frame of this film.

Surreal Gothic Comedy,"Tim Burton who is the master of Gothic film making and has one hell of an imagination. Beetlejuice a film example of this and a very quirky film.Beetlejuice starts with a young couple the Maitlands (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who live in a large house in Connecticut. They unfortunately died in a car accident and end up trapped in their house for a 127 years. With their death their house was brought by Deetzs, a family from New York City. The wife Delia (Catherine O'Hara), starts to ruin everything that the Maitlands had set up. They want to get rid of the Deetzs from their house. They try to scare them away, but were very unsuccessful, so in their desperation call for the help from Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton). But at the same time the Maitlands start to befriend the Deetz's teenage daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder), the only human who can see them.Beetlejuice is a horror comedy, not recommended for children. The style of the comedy is mostly physical and fish out of water situations; it fairly humorous. Michael Keaton was funny and creepy with some good speeches as the sinister Betelgeuse/Beetlejuice. Winona Ryder was good as always, and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were pretty decent in their roles. This is a very different film which Tim Burton repeats with Edward Scirrorhands. The special effects were done with heart and had a real imagination behind them; I can see the roots of Burton's animated films The Night Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.If you are a fan of Burton's work then you will enjoy this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton Gives Birth to Michael Keaton,"What Michael Keaton gained from this movie was a chance to hold our attention and earn his growing claim as a comedic actor. Burton's direction never disappoints in this thriller-comedy with playfully ghoulish overtones throughout and circus-surrealist visionary cinematography, musical accompaniment and sound effects that perform on the level of the old silent comedies of Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin.The sad thing is that unless you're watching this on a digitized remaster, you're not watching anything close to the original snap and pop. The quality of the film has not held up well compared to most remasters since 1988. Don't watch this until it's available to you on remastered HD.This is probably the best comedy of it's sub-genre, and one of the few times Michael Keaton has been intentionally funny on-screen before his edgy and passionate quirky character as Bruce Wayne (aka, Batman).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did not age well,"This movie did not age well. I know it was made a long time ago, but groping people for laughs is not OK. Sexual harassment is not funny. It's gross and distasteful. This film should stay in the vault for good.---I don't have much else to add. The plot was meandering and aimless, and the references are super dated. None of the gags were all that funny; my partner and I only chuckled at a couple of them. Some of the Dr. Calagary type sets were neat, and I'm sure the special effects were good at the time. But overall, I just couldn't enjoy it because every time the titular character came on screen, he was unbearably sexist and it was played like that was supposed to be funny somehow.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Get These Living People Out of My House,"Beetlejuice was fantastic--meaning Michael Keaton. The movie was good too, but it would've been a lot better with more Beetlejuice.When Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) died unexpectedly they found themselves prisoners in their own home as ghosts. Not wanting their home to be occupied by some sheik New Yorkers, they devised a plan to scare the new owners away. Well, they sucked at being spooky ghosts so they employed the help of Betelgeuse.Beetlejuice was a little too extreme for them, but I loved him. Look, Beetlejuice got his own cartoon after this movie, not Adam and Barbara. They were lame. They were lame on purpose though. They were this very tepid and boring couple that wanted a simple life in the country. That can't carry a movie. Beetlejuice, on the other hand, was a fast talking, witty, disgusting, and funny individual. The movie had a slow start but picked up significantly when Beetlejuice was introduced.The other characters were slightly more interesting but not interesting enough. Lydia (Winona Ryder) was the goth, hates-everything-teen that had the ability to see Adam and Barbara. Her father and stepmother were a bit more vibrant but still nothing to pay to see. The movie hinged on one character and one character alone. He was going to make or break the movie and he made it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""I'm afraid Robert Goulet hasn't arrived yet Sir""","I've discovered that it's a risky proposition to go back and rewatch the films you liked as a kid through adult eyes. Plot holes seem more apparent, your sense of humour may have evolved, your life experience can change your outlook. So I was very happy to rewatch ""Beetlejuice"" and find myself not only finding new things about the film I hadn't noticed before - but that so much of the film, from a visual effects standpoint if nothing else, still holds up.Young married couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland(Geena Davies) are tragically drowned on their way back to their Idyllic small town house. Returning as ghosts, they're horrified when a new family, The Deetz buy their house and move in. New York developer Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and his wife Delia (Catherine O Hara) arrive and she has big interior design plans for the house. Desperate, the Maitlands call on the help of bioexorcist Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) to scare the living away, but they soon discover that the solution is much worse than the problem.I mention the visual effects in the opening because they're one of the most striking aspects of the film, rewatching it today. Mostly practical or stop-motion, they haven't aged like some computer visual effects of the time (or even later) have and they're so unusual, so directly from their director's twisted mind, that they remain memorable. It's not all the film has going for it though, the script is funny and the performances are very strong too. Alec Baldwin looks impossibly young, Catherine O' Hara is a comic genius and Winona Ryder's Lydia is the prototype movie Goth girl. Michael Keaton is great too, apparently adlibbing for his life whenever his character gets a chance on screen. Some other reviews have suggested Betelgeuse's limited screen time as a bad thing, I think that's one of the films strengths. Fun as though he is, he would become a bit much if he was on screen longer.Funny, scary and brilliant ""Beetlejuice"" is a classic.

Great film that doesn't need the title character,"I had no clue what the plot of this movie was and was pleasantly surprised that the storyline was so creative and interesting. It was a great novel concept and Adam and Barbara were likable good main characters. The new family moving in and being so annoying was a great plot line and Catherine O'Hara was BRILLIANT as the dramatic artistic wife and stole the show for me. Winona was fine as the depressed moody teenager and I liked how she geled with the ghosts so quickly. My only problem with the movie is I don't think Beetlejuice was needed. He didn't add anything to the story and just felt like a side plot, so much so I was about 45 minutes in before I realised he hadn't even appeared and I'd forgotten he was even meant to be in it because you didn't need his presence in the movie. When he did appear he was just crude and gross, I guess his character might not have aged well but still, I don't think the story needed him. His jokes weren't funny and Keaton's portrayal felt like a cheap Jim Carrey. Other than the title character everything else was good.

AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! As I've got older, it has found itself a special place in my heart, and every time I dig my old copy out, it's like seeing an old, dear friend, and I stop whatever it is I'm doing, and stick it on.I think Beetlejuice is amazing. The whole movie has a sense of fun, with great lines and a great way of looking at life (and death, of course).The principal cast are all great; Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are fabulous as the straight-laced Maitlands, Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are very funny as Delia, the neurotic, spoilt brat of a woman, and Charles, her hen-pecked husband. Winona Ryder puts in a great performance as the morbid little girl lost, Lydia and Glenn Shadix is a barrel of laughs as Otho.But the show belongs to one man, Michael Keaton. He is a revelation! He is the funniest, coolest and the best thing about this movie.Everything else about this movie is great; Tim Burton's Gothic style, the score by Danny Elfman, the other actors, they are all brilliant, but Michael Keaton is breath-taking.

Tim Burton finding his style,"The second film to be directed by now legendary Tim Burton.

And they have to learn that old ghosting business real soon because in no time at all their house is sold to some real derrieres.While the film isn't quite as visually outstanding as some of Burton's future films, it's still pretty far up there in terms of set designs, visual effects and overall aesthetic. There are some scenes you could watch and not realize that this is a Burton film, but then they enter the ghost world, and yeah, there's no mistaking it for anything else.As for the story, it's a lot of fun. I like how the main couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) is just so darn pleasant and good-humoured that they find it hard to be effective ghosts. I like the young wannabe emo chick (Winona Ryder) that befriends them. I like the titular character, played beautifully by Michael Keaton. Although, as for that last one, there are times when he can be a bit... much. Like an uncomfortable amount of much.That being said, if you're going to watch this film, you should watch it for the experience. It's quirky, it's fun, it's quite a ride from start to finish.

I love the performances, Harry Belafonte's music, the location it was shot at, Tim Burton's directing, the special effects, the music, and the characters. I would recommend this film to everyone. It gets a 9/10 and it is in my top 40 films ever now.About the film: When a young couple, Adam and Barbara Maitland, pass away in a car crash, a new family, The Deetzes, move into their home. The Maitlands have become ghosts and they want the Deetz family gone because they cannot leave their home. They call upon a crazy bio-exorcist named Beetlejuice. He makes everything worse for them.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Black Comedy,"While Michael Keaton is the ""name draw"" despite his character's relatively small screen-time (and as he cuts loose in one of these occasional ""insane"" roles that Keaton likes to take on), the real focus is on the rest of the cast.  Baldwin and Davis are great as the bewildered ghosts, Ryder is great, and Jones and O'Hara (often overlooked) are great comedy actors.  There's a kind of ""anything goes"" attitude to the whole thing, giving Beetlejuice's antics a Robin Williams-sort of improvisational air (how would Williams have played the part)?  Keaton is still great though:  he doesn't even bother to try make his character likeable, but just kind of sweeps you along.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A stupid film,"Tim Burton's BEETLEJUICE is a film so over the top that it makes PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE look like a model of restraint. I'll freely admit that I hated this film from beginning to end because it's so stupidly portrayed, particularly on the part of the entire cast. Everyone in this film mugs or shouts their way through the over the top roles, and the result was that I was cringing from beginning to end. I have no choice but to blame Burton for not asking for greater restraint from the participants.The surreal plot is pretty original and that's the best thing it has going for it, but the execution is rather diabolical. Things happen and exist for no seeming reason other than weirdness, like Beetlejuice living in the toy town or appearing on TV. I was trying to get my head around it all but I never ended up doing so. I was amused to read that Michael Keaton says this was his favourite role, as his character is so generic absolutely anybody could have played the part.Sure, there are elements of interest here, including some cool stop motion effects and the usual quirky monster creations which prop up Burton films. But when the whole cast are so awful and the characters are so grating, it becomes a film impossible to enjoy. A wooden Alec Baldwin and an embarrassing Geena Davis (closer to EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY than THE FLY, unfortunately) are a case in point, although a youthful Winona Ryder is out of her depth as well.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have never studied the back of peoples head more,"I saw this in the theater almost 20 years ago with my former skank girlfriend and a friend of mine that I wish never happened, so that may have affected me negatively. The performance of Michael Keaton in a completely simple movie like Night Shift was wonderful. His performance in Clean and Sober is one of the best. In fact, although he is not my favorite, Michael Keaton is in the top 10 of all time. However, his performance, and that of the other utterly forgettable actors in this movie, leaves me bewildered. Maybe I just didn't get it, or maybe this was a horrible movie. It moved to fast, and the dialogue was unintelligible. To make a long story short, it was boring.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Needs more Keaton,"You're probably already aware that 'Beetlejuice' is considered a 'classic' when it comes to modern cinema and I don't really disagree. However, upon re-watching the eighties horror/comedy today I still level the same criticism – not enough of the titular character, aka Michael Keaton.The story follows a young couple who find themselves dead after an unfortunate road accident. Now they're forced to spend the afterlife haunting their own dream home, now infested with the (annoying) living. And, in an effort to drive out these fleshy interlopers, they enlist the help of one particularly unhinged fellow spirit, known as Beetlejuice.It was directed by Tim Burton as (arguably) the height of his career. It's wonderfully Gothic with all his best trademarks all over the place (not counting the lack of Johnny Depp). The only aspect of the film that rivals Keaton's performance are the (completely non-CGI) special effects which add to the atmosphere perfectly.Maybe today the film is looking a little dated, but it's one that you have to suspend your disbelief and enjoy it for what it was at the time, rather than compared to today's filmic offerings. I wait for the (depressing) day when I hear it's going to be remade with all CGI environments. That will probably happen, but no matter how much computer trickery they employ, they'll never be able to CGI another performance as good as Keaton's. And that's why the original will always stand out (and not just as an excuse to laugh at how unbelievably young Alec Baldwin looked back then!).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
what can you say?,"What can you say about this flick that hasn't already been said? Like any truly great film, it stands the test of time and still delivers the goods. I never get tired of the soundtrack, the wacky sets and props, the amped-up cheese factor...what fun! Why can't there be more horror/comedy flicks that measure up to the Burton Gold Standard? Even when he makes a flop, he does so spectacularly.(see batman returns). Simply put, Beetle Juice remains (no pun intended) one of the great comedy horror masterpieces. If you like this film genre, well, Beetle Juice is one of the greats. The careful balance of kooky/creepiness is well maintained, and Michael Keaton is just plain brilliant. This is one of the stellar comedic performances in movie history, and does not get the real credit it deserves. Like House, Freaks, Arachnophobia, 8-Legged Freaks, Sleepy Hollow -movies that never lose their sense of humor - Beetle Juice keeps you laughing, which is after all the whole point. Still hilarious and disgusting after all these years. Hats off to Tim Burton, the master of all things simultaneously creepy and cuddly. If you want seriously good clean gory icky cinematic jocularity, then get thee hence to a video store and rent/buy this movie! And enjoy a yummy Zagnut for your movie snack!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I would strongly recommend seeing this...over and over.,"Beetlejuice (1988) is a movie in the DVD collection that I recently rewatched with my daughter. The storyline follows a recently deceased couple who wants a new family that recently moved into their house out of their house. When they can't scare the family out themselves they call on a ghastly ghoul named Beetlejuice, but once's he appears they quickly wish they never called him....This movie is directed by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) and stars Alex Baldwin (The Departed), Geena Davis (Long Kiss Good Night), Michael Keaton (Batman), Winona Ryder (Heathers), Jeffrey Jones (Howard the Duck) and Glenn Shadix (The Nightmare Before Christmas).The soundtrack for this is absolutely epic from the openings credits to the final dance on the stairs. The feel for the movie is established right away by Burton with the background music and stays true from beginning to end. The set was so well created and the environments of every scene was perfection, especially the afterlife, sand worm world and attic. The characters are well written, cast and executed and this may be Keaton's all time greatest performance. He was made to be Beetlejuice. The special effects in this were subtle but fit the themes and feel perfectly. Winona Ryder was also a gem in this and her character always reminded me of Wednesday Addams. The ending is always fun and I loved the creative use of claymation for both the sand worm world and the possessed home elements. There's just too much to love about this movie.Overall this film is an absolute masterpiece, and all time great and a 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this...over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining!,"Beetlejuice is a entertaining movie to watch and it turned out to be a cult classic from the 1980's. Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors because he has a great view on visuals in a movie. Obviously, the sets are pretty weird here. The special effects are okay but they need better work to be in today standards.This is about a couple who dies unexpectedly. They return as ghosts and now another family moved into their house. They hire a ""bio-exorcist"" to rid of the family for good.The acting here is pretty good. Of course, Michael Keaton stole the show. His character is the opposite of his Bruce Wayne character. Winona Ryder is great as the daughter that has a great appeal to death Overall, this was a fun movie to watch and a good one to watch on Halloween. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice was unnecessary,"With Beetlejuice 2 coming out soon, I thought I should watch the 1988 one as I'd never been inclined to see it. The lack of upcoming movies means Beetlejuice 2 has to be close to the top of the list for September 2024. Wow. Short movie. And my main complaint is Beetlejuice was entirely nonessential to the movie. Take him out, and everything still works and it all ends up the same. Michael Keaton's character is like a very rude, sexually inappropriate Jim Carey with a beer belly. Again, no point to his being there. Geena Davis and Winona Ryder were fantastic. The shortness of the movie was apparent in the broken storyline. Unnecessary conversations were too long and conversations to explain what was going on and why they were ok with the whole movie premise would've been helpful. In conclusion, I don't see what the big deal was about it in the 80s. Maybe Beetlejuice 2 will be better. We'll see.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderfully Demented,"A nugget of precise mayhem that never seems to get old. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman's partnership is at or near its peak at this point in their careers, delivering a perfect blend of wildly original visuals and unusually appropriate musical cues, and they get plenty of extra help from the cast. Mixing and matching bit players from dozens of sources, it's a true ensemble piece without a true focal point. Even Michael Keaton's unrestrained performance as the film's namesake can't claim center stage for long due to constant pressure from Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and a borderline-unrecognizable Alec Baldwin. A genuinely hilarious script dances in awkward beauty from comedy to horror and back again, leaving plenty of room for scalding improvisation and keeping even the most tenured viewer guessing about what's around the next corner. I loved it growing up, when I didn't quite get every joke, and I adore it even more today.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Dead. And LOVING it!,"God knows many have tried, yet only ridiculously few filmmakers succeeded in bringing horror-comedies that are actually funny AND genuinely macabre at the same time! And yet, since the beginning of his career already, Tim Burton manages to pull this off seemly without the slightest bit of effort. ""Beetle Juice"" in particular is the most spirited horror-comedy I ever saw and possibly even one of the best comedies of the entire 80's decade! It's an incredibly energetic movie, and you gladly allow the characters and situations to go immensely over-the-top. I don't know how he does it or what his secret is, but in a Tim Burton movie, there are equal amounts of devotion going out to the comedy aspects and the make-up effects! By the rather gruesome make-up art, you certainly can't derive that ""Beetle Juice"" is also a light-headed comedy! The portrayal of the ""afterlife"" is pretty eerie and notably the séance-sequence is quite frightening. Despite originally intended to be much more horrific, ""Beetle Juice"" is definitely creepy at times. It often looks like an obscure comic book story that came to life! The happily married Maitlands  Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis - both pass away in a car accident but have to remain ghost-residents in their own house for another 125 years. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it weren't for the new owners, an eccentric New York family with the intention of giving the old-fashioned nest an avant-garde makeover. In order to scare them away, they might require the help of the too-much-too-handle bio exorcist Betelgeuse. This immediately turns out to be a bad idea, as Betelgeuse is an unscrupulous, boisterous and totally deranged lunatic. This crazy flick terrifically stood the test of time and still benefits from its great music and excellent acting performances. All the players are great, but obviously Michael Keaton will be remembered most for his sensational role as Betelgeuse. He swears, transforms into snake-like monsters, dances atop graves, visits miniature brothels and fires off some of the most comical one-liners in the history of cinema, including: ""Go ahead, make my Millennium"" and ""I'm the ghost with the most, babe"". Thanks to him, you worry a lot less about having to die one day",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"He's the ghost with the most, babe.","Tim Burtons' hilarious, visually impressive follow-up to ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" is pure 1980s fun, with fantastic special effects, superbly flamboyant design, a willing cast, and plenty of good, solid laughs. It holds up quite well today, with a generous dose of Harry Belafonte tunes to add to its ultimately upbeat spirit. It gets down to business in fairly quick fashion, and populates its story with great and memorable characters, not the least of which is our scenery-devouring title character.Michael Keaton delivers a delicious comedy performance to rival his Billy Blaze from ""Night Shift"". He's having a ball, and most of his co-stars do a fine job of playing ""straight man"" (or woman) and reacting to his antics. He plays the obnoxious, fun-loving spirit of Beetlejuice to perfection. His speech when he's asked about his ""qualifications"" is particularly priceless stuff.He's called in when newly deceased couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) find adjusting to the afterlife to be just too hard, especially when an intolerable pair played by Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara move into their old house. Eventually, Adam & Barbara find that dealing with Beetlejuice is even harder as he creates a ruckus, and sets his sights on Jones' moody daughter (Winona Ryder).Working from a screenplay by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren (based on a story by McDowell and Larry Wilson), Burton is definitely in his element, crafting a blessedly wacky and unpredictable comedy that, much like the Pee-wee Herman movie, plays like a cartoon come to life. Burton also has great fun with his casting choices; in addition to those actors mentioned, veteran actress Sylvia Sidney provides a special treat by playing weary afterlife case worker Juno; also appearing are Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett, and a very funny Glenn Shadix as interior designer Otho.It's all set to a delightful Danny Elfman score and there are some great set pieces revolving around Belafontes' ""Day-O"" and ""Jump in the Line"".This film does know how to send you off with a smile on your face. It's one of the most purely entertaining things that Burton has done.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Childish but not for children.,"This movie is definitely different compared to other movies but it's not something special. I grew up watching Looney Tunes so for me this movie is basically like one of the Looney Tunes episodes and instead of Bugs Bunny (my favourite character) there is Betelgeuse as a trickster character who unfortunately wasn't the most focused character even though he should have been therefore my score is 5. If the movie had revolved around Betelgeuse instead of the couple the movie would be an 8/10.The weird thing about the movie is not its afterlife theme and its horror style but how genre-wise I had a hard time making sense of the movie. It's childish but clearly not for kids due to horror scenes that involve extreme gore, I have no idea if the director tried to make it a dark comedy or tragedy, it's hard to tell if it's a drama so all I can say is this movie is a very soft tragedy without anything humorous. Some thought this is a dark comedy but even though I love dark humour this movie is too sad to even manage to make me smile because I see no humour in it. Dying together with your loved one when you were living a dream life and then as a ghost you got stuck in your own dream house that some strangers ruined is not a comedy subject and a movie like that being childish is not a nice thing to watch therefore if the movie wasn't like Looney Tunes episodes and if it didn't have a trickster character my score would be a solid 1 instead of 5.The movie has quantity and its complex style but I can't say its quality is decent. Still I cannot say this movie is good or bad. All I can say is I didn't like Tim Burton's style just because if this movie had to be a food it would be a little salty chocolate cake which means genre-wise the movie has no proper style (I mean genre-wise the movie is like a random crazy drunk bipolar person) and it being unrealistic make it a hard time for me to find a reason to enjoy the movie and immerse myself. While watching this movie all I could think was why the director did that and why this happened just because everything about the movie seems like it doesn't fit the movie and everything is too unnecessary.I at least appreciated this movie somewhat denies usual stereotypes and instead the movie has its own stereotypes but too bad they are very unrealistic. The movie tries too hard on being a parody of the certain stereotypes the director wants to turn into a comedy about something that's not a comedy subject and the movie fails to make me amused. In that regard the movie has a childish style that was uncalled for.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story itself wasn't bad but it just felt like I watched a handful of scenes being put together in any order which made it hard to feel engaged.I did like the overall iconic Tim Burton style and feel of the film, visually I found it fantastic especially for its age!I am glad I've watched it and would recommend everyone to do so at least once in their lives but I don't think I would personally revisit it again.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Every single one of them hit their mark, deliver their lines in exactly the right manner and help to further the plot.

If you can stand the exaggeration, and you feel how the music score makes this a great movie, but think that's just about it.Then take another look at the special-effects.All of Tim Burton's films have a special-effects angle that should be considered as dead-serious. Off the back of my head, Beetlejuice ('88) beats every one of them to the crown.

"Great Movie,Lousy Premise","I'm a big fan of ghost movies,but I do tend to go into them with a certain knowledge of ghosts and paranormal activity. This movie seems to suggest that a sub-culture exists beyond our knowledge and has been developing into a society beyond the confines of our reality. This movie is pure Tim Burton as we see the point of view from the ghosts who realize that strangers have moved into their house and have to hire a poltergeist named Betelgeuse who must have been a really obnoxious New York City cab driver before he died. Michael Keaton is the title role with the least screen time, but he is so wild and crazy with his appearances that it's barely noticeable. Winona Ryder is the psychic daughter who feels his presence. Cute and gothic as Lydia Deets, this is definitely one of the highlights of her career. Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are wildly eccentric as the new owners who viciously rearrange the ghost's enviroment and character actor Glenn Shadix puts in a great role as the wierdly eccentric kook who becomes a remorseful exorcist. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are the one-dimensional traffic cops in this barrage of humor and wildness as they experience Burton's slanted views of purgatory and the afterlife. This is where the movie really deviates from actual phenomenon and instead suggests that ghosts have civilized the afterlife instead of crossing over. I'm sorry but ""Casper"" made more sense. The movie does succeed in creating images and dark visions straight from Tim Burton's imagination and that's where the appeal of the movie lays.  The Harry Belafonte score, however, is contagious, but the overall movie has a corny but hilarious laugh a second roller coast ride to it.I give it eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

a dark and unique comedy.,"Beetlejuice is a very unique movie, but I'm not surprised. Tim Burton, master of the macabre, directed this odd movie. I have to say that this movie isn't only dark, it's hilarious. The movie is truly funny, and the blend between horror and humor was superb. It's about a wife and husband, played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, who die in a car accident. The two still live on Earth, but as ghosts. Suddenly, a family moves into their house and changes it all around into a cold and weird house. The two ghosts are now miserable, so they decide to try to scare them out. It doesn't work. They go into the spirit world to ask for some help. Their advice lady gives them some excellent ways to scare them out. It still doesn't work. But something else happens, too. The family's weird daughter, played by Winona Ryder, finds out about them. She becomes they're freind. It still doesn't stop the ghosts desire to get them out of the house, so they do something no one thought of. They called a man from the spirit world, one who specializes in these sort of things. His name is Beetlegeuse, pronounced Beetlejuice, and the scares he has in his  bag of tricks are much, much scarier than the ones the two have tried already. But they start to figure out that Beetlejuice isn't doing this for them, but for himself. He loves to scare, and he'll do anything to do it. They find out that he threatens the life of the family's daughter, and themselves. They must stop him.Although it sounds sort of like a serious horror story, the movie is a total comedy. Still, it has a lot of Tim Burton style quirkiness in it. Michael Keaten is wonderful as Beetlejuice, and once again, Danny Elfman does a great score.

"Tim Burton is brilliant, as usual...","I've seen this film multiple times, and it never ceases to entertain me. I might not say that it gets funnier and funnier every single time I see it, however, Keaton's showmanship in this film remains unmatched by any portrayal of the filthy undead that I've ever seen.  The casting is perfect, from Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara as the Deitzes, to Davis and Baldwin as the Maitlands, to Juno, to Miss Argentina, to everyone.  While Ryder's performance of Lydia was a bit rough around the edges, it's certainly great work, especially for one of her first films. There's not a single person in this movie whose performance I can't say was dead on (no pun intended). The comic timing was perfect, Elfman's score was fantastically jaunty while at the same time eerie, and of course, the scenery and direction were genius. This is certainly some of Burton's best work.  And can I just say that I LOVE Glenn Shadix (Otho)?  I think he should just be in every movie.  Just put him in there, Forrest Gump style.  The layers of this movie are infinite, and I can't say enough good things about it.  Certainly both a conventional and a cult classic.  A quintessential ""10"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's show time!,"The movies creativity is on a whole new level. It's like a patchwork quilt with so many different things around. But I do love that! Tim Burton just has that unique style of making movies. And that is why I love Tim Burton and his movies! And not only was the movie great but the musics were incredible! Tim Burton and Danny Elfman are indeed one of my favorite movie duos ever. Even tho I love this movie I still don't know how to feel sometimes, but I'm ready to live with that feeling! Also I have to mention that Beetlejuices lines were amazing! Everything he basically said was iconic! And I just love Beetlejuice as a character in general. He's so funny and brings amazing moments in the movie!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun and weird,"Beetlejuice is a family oriented movie directed by Tim Burton. I introduced this movie to my son and of course he found it fun but weird. The storyline follows the accidental death of Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis during their vacation home town in Connecticut. Their house is sold to an unbearable family headed by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and their adopted daughter Winona Ryder. Baldwin and Davis have to seek help of bad boy devilish character Beetlejuice who is played by Michael Keaton to help get rid of them. This film is an iconic movie that we all loved including the dancing scene during dinner. The funny thing is that Beetlejuice character has only fifteen minutes air time of the movie. Burton's wacky B rated special effects were cheesy but he was only given a million dollars to put it together. Overall this movie never gets old, you can never go wrong with this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ITS FUNNY & ADORABLE!!!,"Finally watched Beetlejuice months before Beetlebeetlejuice. This movie was funny, quirky, and in the end absolutely ADORABLE!!How it makes the afterlife so funny and the complete opposite of scary, is something to be mesmerized by as it completely embroils you into its own endearing little world.Barbara (Stuart Little mom) was soooo pretty, adorable and gorgeous and Beetlejuice trying to love her was soo funny!! Michael Keaton was too funny and smooth as Beetlejuice! The ""Day-O"" song scene was soo funny and good! Shocked how pretty Kevin McCallister's mom Catherine O'Hara was too! If this is what Michael Keaton is bringing back, I'm gonna really enjoy the next one in September!!! 5:00am 2.6.2024.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

BetelGeuse,"Hello Imdb review readers. This review you are reading was written on Decem 18 2022. The same date, Argentina ""won"" the 22 world cup.About: I was vastly confused and had no idea what was going on for a while. What I got is a couple somehow dies. I'm not sure how or when, and they try to spook a family out of their house. Why the other stuff happen, I do not know.Story and Production: As for story, it was confusing. It wasn't clear. The production was really neat in terms of make up, costumes and environment. The acting was good too. The effects that they used in this film beats modern day CGI 24/7.Highlight: Remembering the guy from Seinfeld, Mikey Bloomberg singing voice actor and the guy from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Genre: HorrorSoundtrack: It gels very well.Duration: A good 1 and a half. The film went by quickly, though the movie was lackluster.Do any worthless mutts appear?: Yes. A dumb dog caused the couple to have an accident and to expire, apparently. They should have made the mutt roadkill.Is this movie Worthy?: Nah. Too confusing.Should you watch this?: Nah... unless you're a ""person"" that is obsessed with the dead, then maybe this movie can make you feel high.Please don't watch this.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic Burton,"Tim Burton is a genius. I think every Burton fan on the planet will agree that this is by far one of his greatest films.The plot is quite simple. Barbara and Adam are a sweet-as-pie married couple who have a car accident and perish. The soon discover that they cannot leave their home now that they are ghosts, and become very annoyed when a new family move in to their house. The only person willing to help them get rid of the family is bio-exorcist, Beetle Juice. Asking for his help turns out to be a very bad move indeed.This movie is by far a cult classic. It's weird, unique, creepy yet funny and keeps you glued to the screen. Winona Ryder plays Lydia, the Gothic, depressed daughter of the new family and she plays the role well.If you like Tim Burton or Cult movies in general. Beetle Juice is a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will go down as one of the all-time classic Halloween movies,"This film will always hold a special place in my heart being the first film we ever rented on VHS in 1989 (yes we got technology slow in our house!) And yes i was only 12 watching a 15 rated movie (hey, most people used the three year buffer for kids!)But i absolutely love this film! Its a must watch film at least twice a year, once obviously at Halloween. Great acting all-round, but Keaton really shining in his role and takes it to another level.Its a family favourite horror/comedy that everyone can watch (just use the TV edit for the more younger kids) for the couple of unnecessary swearwords on it, but in general there is little horror and a lot more laughter at the gruesome scenes, of course kids today will think nothing of these as indeed some of the effects are starting to show their age.Its just a classic of its time and still underrated on IMDB.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

All the characters close to the common way of life (and not only the American way of life, I can assure you that) are boring while the freaks are really funny (I mean you laugh with them, not against).

End End End,"For years , even growing up I'd always heard of Beetlejuice and saw it marketed heavily around Halloween. It just looked really weird to me instead of scary or funny so never bothered to watch it. With the release of the new one and a delayed flight I decided to give it a watch. From the very start I was terribly bored and kept checking to see when it was finished at the bottom runtime clock. Unfortunately boredom at the start was the best part. It just became more and more annoying as it went. The plot isn't compelling , the characters uninteresting, and the conclusion just totally random. A lot of people seem to like Beetlejuice as a character but he's just a perverted ghost and not much more than that so I'm not really sure I get that. Definitely in the worst couple of movies I've ever viewed. The only reason I'd watch the next one would be to see if it's possible to make even worse.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dark and imaginative tale which is worth watching over and over again.,"Tim Burton is a genius.Beetlejuice may not be groundbreaking, but its definitely an original and amusing movie worth watching plenty of times.Michael Keaton is in over-the-top form as Beetleguese. Alec Baldwin holds a very likeable character as Adam Maitland. And likewise for Geena Davis (great actress). Winona Ryder is excellent in one of her earliest performances and somewhat resembles Ally Sheedy in the Breakfast Club.The films directing is truly a golden gem and Tim Burton is at his best.

Death never felt so... alive.,"My Take: Burton's wild imagination is painted all over the screen in this outlandish near-classic.Say it once, say it twice, say it thrice. ""Beetlejuice"" is really one hilarious ghost comedy from director Tim Burton, it's also one of his funniest. It's full of laughs, jolts, weirdness and everything you want in one hilarious comedy of this kind. More? Well, just see it for yourself.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis stars a as typical Connecticut-living couple who die in a car accident and great trapped inside their house during the afterlife. But when their home is bought by a family of gimmicky New Yorkers, they mistakenly aid the help of ""bio-exorcist"" Beetleguese to scare their uninvited guest away.It's both funny and scary, mainly because of Michael Keaton, who throws a lot of guffaws and jolts all in one package. Danny Elfman's weird music is fine and the lavish (and ghoulish) look at the afterlife is well-imagined and really ""to die for"".Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A caustic satire on bureaucracy from the ""Other World"" or the Magnificent Tim Burton: part one","A fantasy musical comedy. After watching the terrible (in almost every sense) series ""Wednesday"" (there is a review with friends on our channels), which was directed by the maestro of unrestrained fantasy Tim Burton (who did not do himself a favor by getting into this film product of the second Evil Corporation), I decided to review most of Tim's early works, because I love this director very much and I respect it, and I decided to start with ""Beetlejuice"", because I don't want to break the chronological order, and I've been watching this picture for a long time and forgot a lot. And so I revised it - and the picture, surprisingly, is still good, and worth the time spent on it. And here is my brief opinion for you - A caustic satire on bureaucracy from the ""Other World"". There were pluses in the picture, which influenced the final assessment, as well as minuses, which rightly reduced it. And this should be the end of such an important introduction, and move on to the essence of the wonderful fantasy black comedy being considered today.So, the pros:
1. Scenario - Once upon a time there was a Maitland family represented by husband Adam and wife Barbara, they lived in a large and cozy house in a small but cozy American provincial town. They did not know grief, but one day they got into an unpleasant situation - both died in a car accident, and now, already in the form of ghosts, they are chained to their house. And everything would be fine, but new tenants are moving into their house - the Dietz family, who are not only unpleasant people (except for daughter Lydia), but also redid the Maitlands' house. Our newly minted ghosts are not ready to put up with this, so they begin an operation to expel the Dietz family. But it's all in vain - because Adam and Barbara are kind, and then Beetlejuice comes to their aid - a walking disaster and the funniest (and a little scary) character in the whole local history. Should I trust Beetlejuice? And why does Lydia treat the dead so well? What will be the finale of this whole mess? You will know the answer only by looking at the picture from beginning to end. A real bacchanal will take place on the screen. We will be introduced to a number of characters who will be at least interesting to the viewer, who is more, who is less, but they will definitely be. The script itself is simple, so it will be understandable for both children and adults, since the humor is designed for both. The dialogues are simple and clear, the characters are familiar, perhaps you will recognize friends or acquaintances in them. There are things to think about. And the finale will blow your brain and make you laugh at the same time.2. Humor - oh, my forest hedgehog, I haven't watched such funny pictures for a long time. Moreover, black humor prevails over the rest here - and it works. And, despite the abundance of scary moments, it gives genuine pleasure. It's just a pity that there are no funny jokes and funny moments here, but I really want to see them. The main thing that the picture did was to let the viewer know from the very beginning what it is, and not lead him by the nose, trying to hide its essence. The picture begins with a black fantasy comedy, and ends with a black fantasy comedy.3. Satire maestro Tim Burton here very caustically ridicules the American bureaucracy, moving it to the ""Other World"" and increasing the emphasis on some points. All these endless queues, filling out papers, wandering through the corridors in search of the right door, the inspector's instructions and her very behavior - how similar it is to our earthly life, and no matter what country you live in, bureaucracy is the same everywhere and it drives people everywhere, which is perfectly shown here. And it is not surprising that people are looking for ways to solve their problems quickly, using the services of dubious types, a good example here is the antihero Beetlejuice himself.4. References - the picture clearly refers us to the classic fairy tale of the English writer Oscar Wilde ""Canterville Ghost"", and to the work of Frank Herbert ""Dune"". Yes, maybe not everyone noticed them, but the creators of the picture clearly drew inspiration from these works.So, the cons:
1. Lydia's act is closer to the final - it can be called at least a betrayal. After all, she asked for help, and agreed to the condition, but as soon as the danger passed, she betrayed her savior without a twinge of conscience. From a moral point of view, Lydia acted badly.2. Little Beetlejuice is the most charismatic character in the picture, his name is in the title - and at the same time he was shown so little. And this is a fact - Beatlejdus is an eccentric character, a bully, an uncouth fellow, but he keeps his promises, and Mile Keaton played him perfectly. Why is there so little Tim? Why?A little about the main characters:
1. The Maitland couple, played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, are a sweet and good-natured couple who have suffered a terrible misfortune, because of which they are now trying to save their house from new owners. And it's especially funny to watch how these kind people try to send uninvited guests away with their unconvincing tricks. Gina and Alec played great. You believe that they are real spouses, and that the whole current situation seriously bothers them.2. Lydia Dietz, played by Winona Ryder, is the daughter of the new owners of the house, goth and loves everything otherworldly, sees Adam and Barbara and wants to help them, without hurting her family. Young Winona already looks good here, and plays at a decent level, despite her age (eighteen years). Barbara and Adam will play a very important role in her story, helping in a difficult situation.3. Beetlejuice performed by Michael Keaton is an eccentric bioexorcist, ready to help everyone in need, likes to scare living people and chat. If you start talking to him, he will chat you to death, and after death he will not go anywhere, everything will chatter you until you agree to all his conditions. He's a loose fellow, and he'll scare quite well. This role was superbly played by Michael Keaton. Well done! I shake hands!I also want to mention Catherine O'Hara as Delia Dietz and Glenn Shadix as Otto.Yes, the effects don't look very good today, but the atmosphere of Tim Burton (not without great music by Danny Elfman, of course) is great, no matter how you look at it.The picture at the box office collected a decent box office, which is deserved.There are persistent rumors that the second part is expected, but I am sure that it will be a box office failure, because the viewer from the late eighties and the modern viewer are different things, and the return of Michael Keaton to the role of Beetlejuice will not help the project. It's better to let the first picture remain, like a small relic on the world film festival.My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice review,"On March 30, 1988, Warner Bros. unveiled Tim Burton and Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice in theaters. The cult hit film later claimed an Oscar win for makeup at the 61st Academy Awards. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:There's inspired lunacy to be found in the Geffen Company's Beetlejuice, a stylized comic fantasy about a freelance ""bio-exorcist"" hired by ghosts to evict a family who moves into their home. Box office will depend largely on how Warner Bros. markets this thoroughly original visual bonanza, which is sure to baffle moviegoers who favor films with a conventional narrative.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis star as Adam and Barbara Maitland, a happily married young couple living an idyllic life in the postcard-perfect New England town of Winter River, Connecticut. Like Cary Grant and Constance Bennett in Topper, their life together on earth is cut short by an accident. It is with some reluctance they finally accept the fact they are stone-cold dead.As if being ghosts weren't bad enough, Adam and Barbara discover their real estate agent has sold their house to the mundo bizarro Deetz family. Dad (Jeffrey Jones, effectively understated) is a nerve-wracked New York businessman who hungers for peace and quiet; wife Delia (Catherine O'Hara) is a quasi-artist who professes to be truly happy only when she's sculpting. While their death-obsessed daughter (Winona Ryder of Square Dance) slinks about in varying shades of black, Delia and her pompous SoHo interior designer, Otho (Glenn Ryder), raize the Maitlands' beloved property, redecorating it in the garish style of a junk culture museum.Guided by a a Handbook for the Recently Deceased, the Maitlands pay a visit to their other-worldly case worker, Juno (Sylvia Sidney), who informs them they're stuck with these urban misfits for 125 years unless they can scare them into vacating the premises. But Adam and Barbara are flops at inducing heebie-jeebies; it's going to take an expert in the field of spirit housecleaning to send the Deetzes packing.Enter Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton, under mountains of special makeup), named after a star in the constellation of Orion, a grandstanding do-badder who shamelessly promotes himself as ""the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist."" While he's sleazy looking and has all the finesse of a supernatural snake oil salesman, there's no question that he's got a bag of tricks that would send shivers up Rod Serling's spine.What happens next is as eye-popping as it is impossible to describe. And that's what makes Beetlejuice such a delight; it's an experience, rather than another helping of the same old thing. There isn't much to it, storywise (Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson conceived the idea), but it brilliantly creates a sense of wonder missing from so many current Hollywood films. Driven by director Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure) and his fanciful imagination, the film is colorful, delightfully deranged and endlessly inventive - a grand-scale funhouse that can be enjoyed by children of all ages.Technical credits are superior, a virtual who's-who of the filmmaking community. Ted Rae, Doug Beswick, Peter Kuran and Robert Short all make valuable contributions in the area of special effects and work by Thomas Ackerman (camera), Bo Welch (production design) and Danny Elfman (music) is similarly inspired. Burton's cast (Dick Cavett's weak cameo excepted) is excellent, too, with the nuthouse Keaton not-so-surprisingly stealing the show in his field-day performance as the rootin'-tootin Beetlejuice. Finally, a pop-culture antihero even Joe Dante can love",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetle Juice,"Now the second part of this movie is being shown in the cinema, and the first part was released in 1988. Of course, I didn't see this movie as a child, and I learned about it about a year ago, but I watched it last night, and now I'm going to analyze it. The plot itself, about death, transmigration of souls, and so on, is very interesting, but unfortunately, it is poorly realized. They don't show us this, they show us the whole movie, except for the unfunny humor, and the Beatles, of which they show very little, and the movie is called Beatles. Anyway, I'll cut to the chase and analyze the movie.In my opinion, Tim Burton's direction here is very bad, so with a small budget everything looks almost high-quality, but the movie is not worth watching. The script of the movie is very bad, and as I have already written, they don't explain much, they just throw us into the fire. And the ending is also not surprising, and there is not even a normal ending. The message has the same problems. But I have no complaints about the acting and the selection of actors, they played perfectly.The protagonists, the married couple Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, are not exactly interesting characters, and there is no logic in their actions. The villains and the supporting cast are also not quite memorable, I can only say about the hilarious Michael Keaton who played Beatlejuice, and about the heroine Winona Ryder, and she will be remembered for her stupid hairstyle.Dynamism 🤔, no and no again, the movie needs 1 hour of the movie to make everything more dynamic. The movie is boring and I definitely won't want to watch it again. The editing and cinematography are great, the special effects and makeup look good for those years, but the graphics in the movie are very bad. Although there is drama in the movie, I didn't care about the characters. And the humor is not very funny. The logic and intrigue are also not very good.I won't recommend the movie to you, I didn't like the movie at all, I know maybe someone else did, but not me. My rating for the movie is 4/10, it's okay. I'll watch the second part, but I don't want to, if the movie is really interesting and good, I'll write about it, and if not, I won't. I'll also add that Beetlejuice translates as Beetle Juice, if anyone is interested.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!  My number 8 movie.","I always used to love those three magical words growing up. I've watched Tim Burton's best pre-""Batman"" film over 100 times since I was a kid. I was only three years old when ""Beetlejuice"" hit the theaters back in 1988 and though I didn't see it then, it has had a remarkable effect on me. No, I'm not morbid or ""strange and unusual"", I just view it as one of the best movies I have ever seen. The special effects and make-up, though seriously dated by today's standards are still amazing. The acting is intentionally campy from what I can see. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are pretty convincing as the recently deceased couple forced to call upon the ""Ghost with the Most"" (Michael Keaton) to deal with the obnoxious family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and a very good Winona Ryder) that has moved into their home.So what is so great about it? First off, MICHAEL KEATON!!! This is the movie that introduced me to one of the most gifted comic actors of our time.I would be blown away again by his second collaboration with Tim Burton a year later in ""Batman"". He is off the wall in this movie. You can hardly tell that it's him underneath that ghastly make-up, but only his voice gives him away.Second, Tim Burton. To me, ""Beetlejuice"" is Burton's first great film and unlike many of his following efforts, really has that dark humor thing going. I mean, I love Tim Burton movies and I've seen all of them (""Planet of the Apes"", being his only ""bad"" movie). I consider Burton's films ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" to be his three greatest by far. ""Beetlejuice"" is Burton's first outing, ""Batman"" made him big, and he took a shot at critical-respectability with ""Edward Scissorhands"".Winona Ryder. My how she has grown up since this movie. Not caring too much about her recent legal troubles, I think she is one of the most underrated actresses today. I loved her character, Lydia in this movie. It's strange how her fascination with death suddenly rings home after she gets to know the Maitlands a little bit.""Beetlejuice"" is one of my favorite movies of all time and I love it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Days later, a strange and crazy family (a suffered man, Charles, his crazy artist wife Delia and his daughter Lydia) moved to their house. But Adam and Barbara don't want them to live in their house, so they decided to call a bio-exorcist called Betelgeuse, who can help them to expel the family. But there is one problem: Betelgeuse is not like Adam and Barbara hoped.The protagonists in this film are Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse, Geena Davies as Barbara, Alec Baldwin as Adam, Catherine O'Hara as Delia, Jeffrey Jones as Charles and Winona Ryder as Lydia.One of thew best parts in the film are very very funny, like the scene when Delia, Charles and Lydia are having dinner in the house with some friends and they begin to dance. Wow, that scene was really funny and I enjoyed it. Another great part in the film was the ending, when Adam and Barbara make Lydia dance after they notice she pass his Maths exam. A really cool and funny scene.Please, watch this film. It's really a typical Burton movie, you should see it. You will like and you will fall in love (with Betelgeuse?). You also will enjoy with the fantastic Betelgeuse character. But only one thing: don't say his name three times!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My favorite movie of all time.,"I would like to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie no doubt from the day it first came out on video.

That's how many times they've had to rewind and hit play.I love that although I've seen this movie so many times, I still discover something new every time I watch it. Although I should have the words memorized, somehow I don't. It's like watching a movie I haven't seen in awhile every time I see it, no matter how long it's been since I've seen it before.I can't wait to show this movie to my son. I hope he enjoys it as much as I do. I hope we can continue the cycle.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic cinema,"An amazing film, after watching which you will want to lock yourself in a dark room and, despite all the prohibitions voiced in the film, whisper the name of one of the most amazing characters.He is devilishly good, gothically mysterious, incredibly interesting and deadly sarcastic. His fantasies are filled with the most mature fears of humanity and the most reckless remedies for these phobias.He is the frighteningly real embodiment of fairy tale evil and anti-heroes. And at the same time terribly attractive.An amazingly creative movie in terms of cinematography and a very talented cast of actors. Simply great in every way!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Keaton at his best,"Beetlejuice is one of Burton's most original and best films.When a couple drown in a car accident they return home (as spirits) to find that it's been sold to a family completely different from them.  Now Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbra (Geena Davis) must find a way to get rid of the family so they can spend their next 150 years in that house happily.  They soon find help with Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), a bio-exorsist.  The results are always hillarious. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I only like the scenes with Beetlejuice in them.  Keaton is hillarious and Burton is again an amazing director.  I love the scene where the couple first meets Beetlejuice and ends with Betlejuice kicking over a tree model and screaming ""Nice f***en model!"" I give Betlejuice 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
#56,"This film follows the Maitlands, a traditional husband and wife whose lives are tragically cut short, when an accident leaves them as ghosts trapped in their own home. Their situation worsens when an eccentric new family, the Deetzes, moves in, and the Maitlands desperately try to scare them away. When their own attempts fail, they seek help from the unpredictable and mischievous Beetlejuice. However, once he's involved, chaos quickly ensues, forcing the Maitlands to confront the unexpected havoc he brings while figuring out how to handle both Beetlejuice and their new unwanted housemates. Overall, due to Elfman's whimsical score, Keatons standout performance as the titular character, beautifully grotesque makeup and costumes , and a chaotically fun yet focused story, this movie is delightful and even though Beetlejuice himself doesn't have a lot of screen time and it can be a tad too silly at times, this is a well-made dark comedy that oozes Burton's signature style, making for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Tim Burton Movie!!! One Of His Best!!,"i grew up with this movie and i must say, its very funny and Michael Keaton yet again shows his great acting chops. everyone else in it is very good and Danny Elfmans memorable Betelgeuse score is just perfect. this has got to be Tim Burton's ultimate classic.yes, Batman is a Classic all its own, but beetle juice is Tim Burton's first and most inventive movie probably ever.Burton is a genius, no doubts there.if your looking for a movie that is just pure fun and enjoyable with a dark quirky edge and want to laugh, this is a great movie to watch. i think its one of Tim Burton's best ever!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""It keeps getting funnier every single time I see it!""","How can a film not intrigue an audience's curiosity with a title like that? Beetlejuice is a necessary element to anyone who wants to learn the trademarked style of a Tim Burton film, as it is definitely one of his strangest and funniest. A young and happily married couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) bite the dust in a car wreck and gradually discover they are ghosts. Before they can get a grasp of their new surroundings and abilities, a far more annoying family (with the exception of dark but well-grounded daughter Lydia, played by Winona Ryder), complete with an equally annoying interior decorator, barge into the deceased couple's house up for grabs and put their own finishing touches to the place. Clearly, the spirits want the house to themselves, but how? To make the situation more difficult, they are egged on by a sleazy, sinister poltergeist named Beetlegeuse (Michael Keaton) to scare the pests away, always at the most desperate times. My favorite scene should go without saying... Well okay, one word: DAAAY-O! Despite the mostly dated visual effects and glaring continuity errors (especially the climax with the sandworm), there's a big pile of reasons to see this classic comedy, including the best score of Danny Elfman's career, Robert Goulet, and most of all, Keaton's performance. If you've ever wondered how anything can be hammed up to perfection, look no further than the man who would be Batman.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful! x3,"A clever opening of a haunted house story. Tim Burton paints a daunting surreal picture. That being said, the house in this honeymoon/vacation get away is reflective of Alfred Hitchcock's, Psycho. Though Barbara played by (Geena Davis) tries to defend their house against interlopers, she and her charming husband never really know what to do. The film jumps around a lot too, but I won't delve into that. After a while, it finally sinks into the mud of our emotions. The whole film is about scaring people, I get that, but do we really need to laugh at others mistakes. This is not funny! I anticipate Burton films to be somewhat like this, taking someone like Edward Scissorhands and, making that a symbol of how, we in society are to laugh at someone's misfortune. No ... not buying into it. At least, this is the main premise to Beetlejuice. A film about a freakshow. Enough of the bad stuff though. (timeout!!) I will say the best part of this film for me was the set and design. It's fun to watch these people crack up; and, if this was Burton's idea, it's genius. The table scene is an absolute delight to see on screen, and it's scenes like these that can absolutely change a bad film to something meaningful to your day. Even if you go into this film depressed you are bound to laugh at some point. Once the funny emotions come out it's the point of no return, it's on. What I like, too, about this film is that there's an operatic tone, but sadly Burton doesn't do anything with it. It would have been good to see something like this flipped into a musical. All in all, a fun and fantastic film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true classic. One of Burton's best.,"""Beetlejuice"" is a very original film, one that truly showcased Burton's potential as a stylistic director. Michael Keaton kinda steals the show as the one-liner encyclopedia Beetlegeuse. The supporting cast is excellent as well, including Catherine O'Hara as the New Yorker wife who ""must express herself"" in a house that, to her, could use a little blowtorch. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are worthy protagonists and are actually quite funny. This movie delivers the goods on an amazing level. Whether it's the humorous and novel story, the hilarious cast's efforts, the wonderful music, true Burton-esque set design, or the fact that there has never been a movie quite like this, you always get a kick out of it!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
love this!,"Michael Keaton is a great ,but sadly , underrated actor ,as his fans always say - everyone's fans say things like this. Alright. First i saw Keaton in ""The Dream Team"", a really great film , and this psycho image stuck in my mind. Once i watched the Beetlejuice cartoons, and found they were based on a film, and when it turned out that the film had Keaton as a main character , i felt it couldn't be bad! And of course it wasn't. It is madly funny and sometimes a bit idiotic, casting is great - such roles suit Keaton much more than for instance Batman (yes , i really don't like Batman , but don't blame me cause this review ain't about it :)) - and decoration and design is incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A New Funny Ghost In Town And His Name is Beetle Juice,"I think this was one of his best films that Tim Burton did in his whole life.Over 93% of people must love this great film,it should be top 205 in top 250 greatest movie.The acting was all good and funny,especially Mickeal Keaton.He was a very funny person in this film,he was born to play Beetle Juices' role.I hope he will make another part to this,and Mickeal Keaton will play his role again.If you did not see this film,go outside to a video store,and rent it or buy it.I have the movie and you should to.I all ready give the movie 4 stars.I love this movie more than Star Wars.Some of his other movies were okay like Planet of the Apes,Corpse Bride,Batman,but this beat them all.I love you Tim Burton,you are my second favorite director,next to Spiliburg",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beetlejuice made me a Burton fan,"Tim Burton is my favourite director, no question. His movies have a distinctive look and sensibility, which is peculiarly his; you only have to look at a film to see if he had a hand in it.His work is original, quirky, imaginative and very highly stylised. His eye for detail is extremely finely tuned and he is still one of the most visionary cinematic geniuses working today.I find it hard to believe now that there was once a time when I hadn't heard the name Tim Burton, but there was. It was before the release of a little movie called Beetlejuice.I was about eight when I first saw the film, and it was a revelation. I'd never seen anything like it. It was gaudy, Gothic, grotesque and great!The score and feel of the film - that of weird askew Gothic-horror carnival - are set, in accordance with Burton's vision, by fellow genii, composer, Danny Elfman and production designer, Bo Welch, who are both so on the money here, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect team. Yes, it looks a bit dated now, thanks to it's stop-motion animation, but that adds to the film's charm and is better for it, in my opinionThe script, written, first by Michael McDowell (from his original idea) then re-written by script doctor, Warren Skaaren, is magnificent and hilarious. All the characters are well-observed, fun caricatures; that's not a negative criticism - you get the impression that this is wholly deliberate.The acting from all cast members is very fine, and strike just the right note. The movie belongs, however, to Michael Keaton, whose ill-mannered, foul-mouthed, lecherous, disgusting, but somehow charming and charismatic 'Ghost with the Most' is nothing short of brilliant.Beetlejuice is one of the most fun movies you will ever see, and is a delight with its great premise, hilarious dialogue, inspired visuals and wonderful score. It's a must-see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly Wild And Bizarre Film,"Beetle Juice is a film so unique and bizarre, it could only have come from the mind of Tim Burton. The concept and plot, the set designs, the creatures and the characters are all so different it a mystery how this sprung even from his imagination. Love his work or hate it, Burton has a strong cinematic eye and one of the boldest visionaries making movies. And if there's one person who does love it and understand it very well its Michael Keaton. Sure, much of it is on the page but this a part, as the titular Beetlejuice, can only exist because of him. His manic, uncontrollably wild and amusing performance(which you wonder how much of is ad-libbed) brings a boost to the movie that makes it what it is.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic early Tim Burton film still holds up,"It was incredibly fun revisiting this film. When it first came out, Tim Burton had only done one film (""Pee Wee's Big Adventure""), Michael Keaton was still know as a comedic actor and not the versatile actor he's know for today, Winona Ryder had only two prior film credits (a supporting role in the excellent ""Lucas"" and a role in the forgettable ""Square Dance""), and Alec Baldwin had done nothing of note at this point (not even his bit parts in ""Working Girl"" or ""Married to the Mob"" had happened yet). Geena Davis was arguable the biggest name in the film outside of Keaton for having done ""The Fly,"" ""Fletch,"" and ""Transylvania 6-500."" The film also makes an early credit for composer Danny Elfman (only if fifth film) and the third film of production designed Bo Welch (""Men in Black"" ""Thor"" ""Edward Scissorhands"") who's only other prior major film was ""The Lost Boys."" So although this was an early effort by many involved, their talent clearly shows in this hilariously dark comedy. Besides the above mentioned talent, you also get Glenn Shadix (""Heathers"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") as the pompous Otho, Jeffrey Jones (""Ferris Bueller's Day off"" ""Amadeus""), Catharine O'Hara (""SCTV"" ""Home Alone""), and even Hollywood Golden Age actress Sylvia Sidney (Fritz Lange's ""Fury"" and Alfred Hickcock's ""Sabotage""). Then also throw in Robert Goulet and Dick Cavet as dinner guests for good measure, I ask, how can you not love this movie? If for some reason you've never seen ""Beetlejuice"" watch it NOW before the the long awaited sequel that's in production finally comes out. FUN FACT! Tim Burton originally wanted Sammy Davis, Jr., a favorite star of his since childhood, to play the role of Betelgeuse, but studio executives didn't like that idea at all.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Hilarious!!,"Absolutely Hilarious!! Micheal Keaton must have had the greatest time doing that movie. It is one of his best. Watch the scene when Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis first see him on TV and he's doing the commercial. I laugh so hard every time I see that. It's a 10 for sure! And why not?

Creative early Burton,"Tim Burton has crafted a number of clever films that have touched audiences in strange ways. His eccentric art form began in this quirky film. This is an artful piece of storytelling full of bizarre scenes and filled with typical Burton fun. Keaton gives his best performance to date here as the demon and Ryder is good in her role as a Gothic teen. Overall, Burton manges to keep a quirky and often humorous atmosphere over his picture and refuses to go mainstream with it. His original ideas are what helps the movie when it starts to grow unappealing to the audience. It's always got one more trick up it's sleeve and avoids self-indulgence for the most part.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Keaton,I think this is The film that Michael Keaton really showed his acting ability. As we have seen In a lot of his films that followed he has been able to play just about any character without being typecast.

Wynona Ryder is perfect in her role as Lydia, the disconnected and dark teenager.

Beetlemania (cinematheque),"This is a perfect movie because it combines everything:First, the idea of Death as a public administration is original and inventive and it's just delicious to have laughs in such dramatic times. The thematic of the haunted house is also well played because the movie brings a fresh air to this classic tale.Then, the production is visually stunning: it's colorful, playful, weird, modern and once again, we never expected such things with the thematic. As always, Danny's score really complements Tim's filming and is among his best. A mention about the two songs of Belafonte: once again, totally unexpected, totally crazy thus excellent picks for the movie.The cast is really good: for one time, Baldwin appears like a kind guy, O'Hara and Jones are sympathetic parents and Winona makes a groundbreaking debut. Keaton shows he can be a truly funny guy: compared to his brooding batman, Beetlejuice is over excited and he can delivers all his crazy lines being alone most of the time.In conclusion, nothing is dead here. It's a surprising and funny vision of horror classics and it's always good when Tim makes us laugh like this!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Ghost With The Most,"The ghost with the most himself was able to bring on good entertainment. Beetlejuice is a really enjoyable horror comedy that justifies to be an 80s horror icon. Maybe not perfect with a dated green screen background and an uninteresting antagonist, but it still manages to have a solid story, spooky and fun special effects, and highly entertaining acting especially coming from Beetlejuice himself. This would be a really good option if you ever want to watch a horror movie that combines with comedy. I wouldn't consider this as the best horror movies of the 80s, but it is worth something to make me both spooked and laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bright comedic talent shines in a dark setting.,"I hardly find death or the afterlife even mildly amusing,but what strikes me as entertaining about Beetlejuice is it's star,Michael Keaton.This one time stand up comic was apparently,unbeknownst to us the public at the time,was on the threshold of breaking free,at least somewhat,from the solely comedic roles that we had come to know him for and taking on more dramatic and challenging roles.Little did we know just how versatile he is.At any rate,Beetlejuice is the best showcase,I think,of Keaton's early comedic talent.It is with that comedic talent that he shined a little light in the dark world that we associate with the film's director,Tim Burton.I would shield the kids from this film until they are older because of it's content and language,but it's an enjoyable ride for adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story of oddballs resisting normie tedium is nice but the appeal is the bachanalia of the macabre realized in actuality by puppets, make-up and animation.

Things happen that facilitate the appearance of the protagonist, an eccentric ghost willing to do anything to achieve his own goals. The rest is known history.

Remains one of my favorites,"Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as 'Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman & Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voice-overs for Nightmare Before Christmas). So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or 'the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I couldn't help laughing!,"To say I couldn't help laughing is not to say that the film was so stupid it was funny. I mean that ""Beetlejuice"" was so funny that I couldn't help laughing at it, and that's not something I say all of the time. It starts off with a couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) crashing their car and getting back to their house and discovering they are dead and are now ghosts. What's worse, a new (and somewhat crazy) family is moving into their home, and they are so disgusted with the new owners that they decide to haunt the house and scare them off. The film gets extremely funny from there, as they are torn between scaring them off themselves or hiring a Bio-exorcist (Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton). It's hard to know what else to say, because there are so many funny parts to describe. For me, perhaps the funniest scene was watching the ghosts scare off the family by controlling their bodies into singing ""The Banana Boat Song"" around the table while guests are present at dinner. The film is silly and over-the-top at times, but it has become one of my favorite comedies from the last 20 years. It's much funnier than I expected any film of its type to be, and is probably my favorite of the horror-comedy genre. It may not be for everyone, but if you want to laugh, I suggest you check it out.***1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Movies this great don't come very often. Tim Burton rules.,"People tell me Im too friendly about giving out 10 stars, but thats not true. If a movie is perfect, then its perfect and BEETLE JUICE is flawless.I watched this movie over and over as a kid and it never got old, there was just something about it that I loved. The weird characters, the scenery, the songs it was just great.I never thought much about anything like actors, direction, production, sets and such as a kid - everything was taken at face value and that was enough.These days I am very much in to the directors and writers and every aspect of a film. Directors can just point a camera and film a scene and its OK when that happens,but then there are guys like Tim Burton. He is a director but hes more part of the scene than any actor is, his style is unique and no one can do what he does.This was his second real film following PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and that movie he didn't really show much of who he was, it was a good movie but it wasn't a Tim Burton movie. In BEETLE JUICE we see amazing colorful sets and weird characters and it's just a movie you can not take your eyes off of.It's fun and the actors are absolutely perfect. The house and the other worlds are amazing. The songs and the scenes involving them are impossible to ever forget.This movie is a comedy, but its perfect for the whole family. It has a few scenes where the language might not agree with some parents but it isn't bad. It has elements of horror too which is great and I do not know how anyone could not love it or appreciate it. One thing is for sure, any who watches it will never forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I was expecting more about Beetljuice himself,"""Beetlejuice"" stands out for its originality and irreverent humor. Tim Burton created a surreal world populated by unique ghosts and supernatural beings, providing a captivating cinematic experience. The cast delivers memorable performances, with Michael Keaton shining in the eccentric role of Beetlejuice, although his screen time is less than expected. Winona Ryder also shines as Lydia, while Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin offer natural chemistry. The artistic direction is stunning, with gothic and eccentric settings contributing to a fantastic atmosphere, characteristic of Tim Burton's style. However, one of the film's weaknesses is the lack of development of the villain, Beetlejuice, resulting in a lack of depth that may disappoint viewers. Nevertheless, ""Beetlejuice"" still manages to hold attention and provide memorable moments, though it leaves the feeling that it could have been a more impactful experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Tim Burton at his absolute best, has to be my favourite film of his. So much has gone into making the 'after life' world as rich as the living one with superb performances by all the cast.

Should be PG-13...otherwise loved it! 11+,"Beetlejuice is definitely a classic. I think that Tim Burton really does a good job at making weird movies. Basically, the plot is about a couple who die (are ghosts now) and then a family (the Deetz) move in and claim the house as their own. Join the couple as they try to kick this family out of their house. I have to say that I loved Winona Ryder in this movie. The reason that I wrote 11+ is because there's some heavy content and lots of mentions of death and references that symbolize death. There is a bit of violence towards the end and sometimes Beetlejuice acts a bit inappropriate at times.

The funny thing is, I don't remember watching it from the beginning so it must have been a recorded off TV. This was a staple for my sister and me. I've also seen this on the big screen at the Gateway Film Center.Synopsis: the spirits of a deceased couple are harassed by an unbearable family that moved into their home. They hire a malicious spirit to drive them out.We start off getting the lay of the land for a small town in Connecticut. We go to a big house where the married couple of Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) live. They are currently taking a 'stay-vacation' for two weeks and that starts today. They're bothered by their friend Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) who's a realtor and trying to get them to sell the house as it is too big for them. There's a touchy moment where the couple wants children, it just hasn't happened yet.They go into town to get some supplies for Adam's model he built of the town, but on the way back they avoid hitting a dog and crash into the river. They return home, sopping wet. A fire started in their fireplace on its own and they use it to warm up. As they do, Barbara's fingers catch on fire, but she doesn't feel it. They then realize they're dead. There's a handbook entitled 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased' that appears in their house. Adam tries to read through it, but he states that it reads like stereo instructions. When he goes outside of the door, he is transported to a desert where there are these giant sand worms patrolling.We then get a quick cut to a man reading a newspaper, his name we will learn is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton). He goes to the obituary page which he calls the classifieds. He sees the welcoming to the afterlife for Adam and Barbara.Their plan is to live a nice quiet life as dead people, when a family moves in. They are from New York. The father is Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and his wife is a sculptor and loves art, Delia (Catherine O'Hara). Charles has an odd and gothic daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). Delia's friend also joins them, who's an interior decorator and later claims to be a paranormal expert, Otho (Glenn Shadix). These two go about the rooms deciding what to do to it to renovate. This angers Adam and Barbara who try to scare them off. The problem is they don't see the things they try to do. When they try to go into the attic, our ghostly couple keeps them out. Lydia notices them from the window and tries to meet them.As this couple tries to figure out what to do, a commercial comes on their television from Betelgeuse. He offers to get rid of the family and they consider it. Adam did read in the manual that if they need help to draw a door. This takes them to a different world where it is like going to a social worker. It is there they meet their case manager Juno (Sylvia Sidney). They need to decide to scare them out or to learn to co-exist. She tells them not use Betelgeuse, no matter they do and she tells them the truth of him. Adam and Barbara befriend Lydia and must decide on how to proceed.Now I've already said this, but growing up, I loved watching this film. It's even more enjoyable now. There were a lot of jokes that went over my head that now crack me up. I will lead off that I used to work for a company that was outsourcing social work for the county. It is interesting that Otho makes a comment that if you kill yourself, you become a civil servant in the afterlife. He's exactly right because Juno and all her staff seem to have committed suicide. I never caught on and that's an interesting punishment. Despite how morbid this is, I find it funny.We also get the issue of clashing lifestyles. Adam and Barbara live a modest one. He owns the local hardware store and they have simple things they enjoy. Jane feels their house is too big and wants to sell it. Charles had a breakdown at work, but it seems like he was ruthless and great at what he did. Delia doesn't want to leave the city, but she will for her husband who was the breadwinner. It is interesting that he wants to relax, yet he can't turn it off when he thinks he has a gold mine in this new town. He even pitches things to his former boss, Maxie Dean (Robert Goulet). There is an interesting look at capitalism vs. Small town life that is clever.Going back to the afterlife, there's just a huge world here. They have a manual, rules and regulations as well as different workers that can help for different things. Since they're dead, there's also a lot of waiting. It is funny that Betelgeuse is a conman that you would see like injury lawyers or the like. The amount of back-story here is great. There is so much put into the mythology that you could do a series on it.That will move me to the pacing. I'm not going to lie; I've seen this so many times I thought it was longer. I was shocked to see that it runs 92 minutes. It was through these most recent viewings I realized there isn't much filler. We get introduced to our main couple and their tragedy happens quickly. The new family then moves in and it shows Adam and Barbara not only trying to get a hang on being dead, but what to do with them. There's good comedy here, which hurts the overall tension, but it does add to the enjoyment for sure. This isn't meant to be a heavy movie outside of our couple dying and trying to adjust. The ending is cute and works for the overall feel the movie is going for.Which takes me to the acting for this film. It is good across the board. Baldwin and Davis work so well together. They're on similar wave lengths and they seem like a loving couple. It's interesting to see in life they don't play by the norms and it is fitting for them in death as well. Keaton is great in this role. It is iconic and he adds his own quirkiness to the role. He steals the show for sure. O'Hara is great as the pretentious art person from New York as well as Shadix. I went through a phase that was like Ryder and I think she does a good job in her performance. Jones and the rest of the cast work well together to round out this movie as well.As for the effects, I'm surprised to see how well they still hold up from the late 80's. Everything I'm assuming was done practically and it shows. The snake version of Betelgeuse is creepy and we get that Tim Burton feel as he incorporates German Expressionism into real life. The office in the afterlife is great and feels like a distorted version of ones I've worked in. I think the look that Adam and Barbara take on when they think they're going to scare the family out as well. It is also shot very well and no complaints there. We get good cinematography for sure.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. Danny Elfman was in charge and he killed this one. It is funny is that a podcast I listen to used the theme song from the credits as their opening for a stretch. I never put it together. Shout out to the Podcast Under the Stairs and Duncan. Getting back to this, Elfman mixes the creepy vibe into it and it fits for what we are seeing for sure. I revisit songs from this film regularly while I'm writing.In conclusion, this is a film that I have a lot of nostalgia for, but after these last viewings I see there's a lot of depth I didn't notice. I think this has a great idea of clashing lifestyles with these two different families and seeing if they can co-exist despite it. It is interesting concept of the afterlife not being too different from what we live in now. It doesn't waste any time getting into this and the running time flies by. The acting is good across the board. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what we get is practical and there's a lot in just the aesthetic to the movie. The soundtrack is also good. It fits the atmosphere they're building. I think this is a solid gateway film that you can watch to introduce kids into the genre. There are things that will go over their head and adults can enjoy for sure. It is also lighter on the horror elements while still having them. I highly recommend giving this a viewing for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Creative Look on the Afterlife,"A unique look at what life is like after death. The movie takes you on a wild ride from start to finish. There is so much packed into this 90 minute film that it's hard to keep up.Tim burton does not disappoint. The movie is so different than any other. The costumes and makeup is very unique and well done. From start to finish your on a roller coster ride of an adventure. The viewer follows Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, a wonderful normal couple who has it all. But then they die tragically, too soon. And are left to haunt their house. With one mission, to remove the new people. It's a hard and long learning process to be a ghost. And it's a fascinating journey to watch.Lots of famous actors packed into this film. Michael Keaton manages to go above and beyond on the weird spectrum with his character Beetlejuice. Alec Baldwin actually acts as a normal stand-up guy with beautiful Geena Davis. Winona Ryder and Catherine O'Hara did an amazing job of adding in that extra spice of wild and weird. The cast is beautifully balanced. And the movie crazy creative. Some of the costumes and special effects were down right scary. I don't know about calling a comedy but definitely a spooky film. ""What's Wrong? ""We're very unhappy"" ""What did you expect?

Still One of Tim Burton's Most Unique and Original Movies,"In 1988, a then fresh newcomer director Tim Burton released his second directorial effort known as Beetlejuice. Released to a positive critical reception, the film was a huge financial hit and ended up bringing the very character of Beetlejuce into pop culture. In addition to an animated series and a stage musical that commemorated the feature's 30 year anniversary, there is now a long awaited sequel coming out this Friday with Burton and titular star Michael Keaton returning for another hurrah. So looking back at the unique dark fantasy comedy that started it all, how well does it hold up?The film focuses on a recently deceased couple, Adam and Barbara Maitland, who cannot leave their house as ghosts. After a new family moves into the house, the Maitlands contact a ""bio-exorcist"" called Beetlejuice to scare the inhabitants away. Now despite Beetlejuice being the titular character, he himself is more of an antagonistic foe rather than the primary focus that are Adam and Barbara. The Maitlands are quite sympathetic in how they resent the living intruders infesting their homes, largely thanks to Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis's endearing chemistry. While this premise could easily be used for psychological horror, Burton and writers Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren execute the film in a fairly playful comedic manner in showing Adam and Barbara attempting to frighten the Deetzes, the family's odd encounters with them, death being a complex bureaucracy and Beetlejuice himself being a cooky troublemaking pervert. Equal parts bizarre in concept and hysterical in execution, Beetlejuice manages to blend shocking pathos with surreal comedy quite smoothly.Speaking of Beetlejuice himself, Michael Keaton steals the show, hamming up his scenes any chance he gets and pulling off a lot of the film's most disturbingly funny jokes. He makes for a strong obstacle not only to the Maitlands, but also Lydia Deetz who is the only living being that can immediately see Adam and Barbara. Lydia is perhaps the second most sympathetic character in the film thanks partially to Winona Ryder's relatably emotional performance and her struggle between being an outcast in her family and wanting Adam and Barbara to live in their house peacefully. In addition to the more sophisticated Charles Deetz and his eccentric artist wife Delia, other fun characters include the prudish interior designer Otho who becomes smitten by the Maitland's presence, Adam and Barbara's sardonic caseworker Juno, and humorous appearances of Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet as straightforward representatives of the Deetz family. The cast are largely why people remember this film so fondly, and they did not disappoint in generating both the laughs and thrills.In addition to the film being darkly comedic, it also looks dark and creepy from a production design standpoint. Tim Burton himself stated that he intended Beetlejuice to reflect the kinds of cheap looking B movies he grew up on, and it shows quite well with all of the elaborate creature animation, prosthetic makeup and interior design crafted for the big screen. While the primary house reflects the seemingly laid back New England countryside quite prestinely, the imaginative afterlife sets and macabre design work are incredible to witness, accompanied greatly by Thomas E. Ackerman's ghoulish cinematography and Danny Elfman's heightened score. Also, it should go without saying that the costumes define each character so well, not just Adam and Barbara's consistently worn outfits, but also Lydia's contrasting gothic wardrobe, Beetlejuice's numerous charismatic suits, and all of the mysterious clothing around the ghouls. Slap on some banger Harry Belafonte numbers for good measure and you've got a dark horror comedy that looks as creepy as it is hysterically witty.As of this day, Beetlejuice might be one of Tim Burton's most unique and original features complete with combined dark humor and emotional pathos, lovably eccentric characters, incredible filmmaking techniques and great albeit sporadic music. Being one of the guy's more popular features in the current cultural zeitgeist, it is absolutely worth a watch regardless if you're interested in the upcoming sequel, animated series or musical all at the same time. It's always showtime no matter when you watch this flick, as it's all in good fun and pumped with just enough Michael Keaton to go around.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good aspects of the movie,"I'm usually not a fan of Tim Burton fan but this is one of my favorite movies just the personalities and kooky characters in it are so fun and ecstatic that they draw you back to the movie again and again, especially beetle juice and Lydia. Michael Katina was the perfect choice for the role he filled. I also believe that the way someone dies influences there appearances in the afterlife suck as the woman who was cut in half was actually two halves in the movie was ingenious. It gives a whole new perspective on the afterlife and the different roles that one can choose from in afterlife such as bio-exorcist, civil servant, and adviser, were very interesting. I also like the way the characters actually had a personality that they stayed true too instead of doing things that were completely out of character for them. overall i think it is a very well done and fun movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still Tim Burton's Best,"Beetlejuice, in recent years, has become a favorite for TV - it seems to be on every couple of months - so, I have seen it in bits and pieces, frequently happening upon it as I channel hop. I consider it a charming, little delight, and it never fails to create a warm feeling as I watch it. I have seen some bad Tim Burton, and some good Tim Burton, and I consider this to be his best. Also, it is Michael Keaton's best, in my opinion. It doesn't seem to be Michael Keaton, in fact, it doesn't seem to be anyone but Beetlejuice - the character has a life of it's own, transcending any actor happening to play him. Catherine O'Hara is another actor who shines here; she's a comedic force in just about everything she's done. One of the biggest delights of this gem is the inclusion of the Harry Belefonte tunes on the soundtrack - I love them.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But another family moved in and they try to scare them off, with a little help from Beetlejuice (I don't know his real name so I used this one.). Now although this movie looks really fake, this is the whole point. This is a movie that its so fake that this horror film is actually funny. Although Michael Keaton appears for 20 minutes or so, he is what makes this movie so great. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the recently dead Maitlands.

Beetlejuice - King of Corpses and Macabre Mayhem,"In Beetlejuice, Tim Burton throws a gothic, grotesque, and visually genius party. He takes a haunted house, tosses in a couple of lukewarm ghosts, and adds a pre-depressive Winona Ryder. The result? A visual fever dream where every frame drips with absurdity. Burton's the guy who puts corpses on a pedestal and makes them dance to calypso.Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice is like the Joker on a fertilizer binge. The man overacts, grimaces, and flails like he just finished a crash course with Monty Python. Every scene he's in is an explosion of manic energy and pitch-perfect one-liners. He dominates the screen so much you wonder why he wasn't cast in every '80s comedy.Sure, Beetlejuice is kitschy as hell (pun intended). The special effects haven't aged gracefully, but that's part of the charm. The grotesque makeup looks like it came from an underlit cosplay convention. Yet somehow, it works. Burton crafts a world where imperfections aren't flaws-they're features.The Danny Elfman score is an auditory masterpiece. The themes are so catchy they'll lodge in your brain without permission. And that legendary dinner scene set to ""Day-O""? Pure Burton brilliance. Elfman turns the mundane into an operatic celebration of the strange, as only he can.The plot, while simple-a ghost couple tries to oust loud, living occupants-holds its own. Burton makes up for narrative simplicity with visual creativity and absurd humor that hits every mark. You don't need a Nolan-esque twist when you've got a guy in a striped suit snacking on bugs for kicks.Beetlejuice is a Tim Burton masterclass-a love letter to the macabre and the whimsical. Despite its aged effects, the film remains an absolute classic. Funny, bizarre, and brilliant. If you haven't seen it, you're missing a gem of fantasy cinema. And remember: don't say his name three times... or do, but be ready for the consequences!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
B-e-a-utiful,"Beetlejuice is one of those films you simply have to see at least once, the comedy is legitimately funny (if a little twisted)and the characters are ones you will fall in love with.Micheal Keaton stars wonderfully as the Bio-Exorcist ghost Betelgeuse and puts his wacky acting to use to bring a great performance you will never forget. Where as the Maitlands and the Deetz's make for characters you either love or love to hate, the Deetz's with their obnoxious yuppie attitudes and gloomy daughter Lydia and the Maitlands with their lack of understanding and set in their ways attitudes make for an unforgettable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton brings us into his peculiar world once again,"Once again, Tim Burton does not disappoint in delivering a remarkable and unique world to life. The plot follows two ghosts as they try to scare a family out of their house. After failing to be scary, the pair get involved with the troublemaker Beetlejuice. The plot is engaging, funny, and full of twists. The ending is left open for the audiences (until the sequel comes out next year), but the story closes on a happy note. The story flows perfectly; no scene feels rushed or slow. The theme in this story is based around family. Throughout the film, the sense of family and connections is what allows the main characters to navigate difficult situations. The characters in this movie are no different from other Tim Burton movies, original! Beetlejuice is an absolute riot and an amazing villain. The Deetz's and Maitland's were a fun contrast of each other, and each actor brought something different to their character. The dialogue in this movie was engaging for the audience. The movie's characters were always serious (except Beetlejuice), yet the humor still came through strong. The CGI did not age well, but the rest of the scenes were ahead of their time. The setting, the home, and the rustic charm meets New York modern; it was unusual in a good way. The soundtrack was eerie and added to key scenes, contrasting the songs featured in the movie that were lighthearted and uplifting for the characters and audience. Overall, Tim Burton delivered another timeless classic that generations will continue to love.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Lets have some laughs round boy""","And laughs it what you'll have in this comic masterpiece. My golf buddies and I quote this movie 10 to 1 over ""Caddyshack"" on a weekly basis. Michael Keaton outdoes himself and proves that his ""Night Shift"" performance wasn't a fluke. Some of his lines had to be improvisation because they're just too weird and wonderful. What can you say about Tim Burton that hasn't already been said? He still delivers the goods in 2005. He'll probably never receive and Oscar because the old cronies that vote probably just don't get him. Maybe in 30 or 35 years they'll give him a lifetime achievement award. All you do is watch his movies over and over again. The best movie award every year goes to a movie you might watch once or twice at most. (I'm rambling).

Where it all started,"Tim Burton is one heck of a director. He's made the best comic book film there ever was with 'Batman', and some of the most memorable films of our time. This was his real breakthrough, a warped comedy that provides a unique world that only Burton can give.The concept is odd to say the least. A happily married couple have a car accident and die. Now ghosts, they try to rid their home of what they consider some pretty obnoxious neighbors, with the help of an 'expert' called 'Bettlejuice'.Surprisingly, it all works splendidly. Burton's world is unique and vivid, with some truly imaginative stuff going on. Michael Keaton, who plays the title role, is absolutely hilarious. He really is an underrated actor, who is damn funny when he wants to be.Considering the subject matter, it's amazing that Burton's world is still so light-hearted and interesting, but he pulls it off with a great sense of style and humor.

I don't really know why I put off seeing it for so long, but I'm glad I finally got around to it! The whole film has that great Burton style that we all know and love, only perhaps a touch more macabre than usual. Keaton completely steals the show in a relatively small role as the title character, a rude, crude, self-proclaimed ""Bio-Exorcist"". The effects are amazing, the various hauntings looked great! Baldwin and Davis both did great in their roles, especially near the end. All the creatures and characters from the afterlife were very cool. My only gripe with this movie is how long they waited to introduce the title character. Not a huge problem, but I would have liked to see more of Keaton.

Michael Keaton's Best,"Never have I seen a horror comedy like Beetlejuice before. I'm not quite sure if it's because of the PG rating or just how director Tim Burton made the character of Beetlejuice so lovable. Alec Baldwin (Adam Maitland) and Geena Davis (Barbara Maitland) play a married couple who end up dying within the first 15 minutes of the movie. They soon realize that they indeed are dead and can't escape their house. To make matters worse, their house is intruded by a new family called the Deetz who start rearranging all their personal things. When the Maitlands try to spook the family, they realize they're not recognized. So what's their solution - calling on Beetlejuice, played by Michael Keaton.What is Michael Keaton when it comes to this character? To start off, he is filthy, vulgar, and has a bad case of gingivitis; but no termites like the Grinch. Although all of these aspects are unappealing, there is something to love about Beetlejuice. What to love is the personality. Beetlejuice's personality is funny and crude because what would you do if you've lived through the black plague and seen the exorcist about 167 times? If I was him, I'd be bored with myself by now but somehow Keaton puts life into this character like he just died yesterday. Just like The Mask (1994) who wear's a banana yellow suit to a dance club, Beetlejuice's signature wardrobe clothing is a striped black and white tux; pretty attractive for a dead guy.Some other great parts from this movie are the make-up effects. Many times during this movie you will see other dead specters. What's funny about these ghosts is that the way they died is they way they're portrayed so you know exactly how they died. A man wearing a chicken- eating bib has a chicken leg stuck in his throat. A man is flat as a poster board because along his front side is a tire track. That's one of the fun parts of this movie.Another great element in this film is the score composed and conducted by Danny Elfman. Just Beetlejuice's theme song is enough to get the goosebumps going. It's not a haunting melody but it's so catchy that you're bound to start jumping around. And that's exactly what Beetlejuice does; he's always hopping around on screen.Director Tim Burton has definitely created a movie that is not like any other horror flick. With comedy coming first before horror, Beetlejuice will definitely deliver the laughs and some chills along the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
still crazy after all these years,"Even with its many existential and metaphysical inconsistencies, production gaffes, and various cheesinesses -- this flick remains on my all time fave list.

The sum effect of Burton's gem is that it really is one for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Possibly Tim Burton's magnum opus,"Beetlejuice (1988) is a dark fantasy gothic horror comedy directed by Tim Burton and written by Michael McDowell. It stars Michael Keaton in the title role as well as Winona Ryder, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis and Catherine O' Hara. This was Tim Burton's second directorial film and his first to be based on an original concept. It got very positive reviews from critics when it first premiered, and it was a box-office hit and has since gained a strong cult fan base. It even spawned a spin-off cartoon series in the 90's. This movie is also known for its use of two Harry Belfonte songs, Day-O and Jump in the Line.I remember watching the Beetlejuice cartoon as a kid on Cartoon Network, but didn't know it was based on a live-action movie until much later on. I watched this movie in 2016 after stumbling upon the DVD at the Walmart bargain bin. It was actually my first time watching it in its entirety. Before that, I saw parts of it on TV. I watched it again just recently to prepare for the new sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024).The movie follows a family of three who move from New York and into a house in a suburban area. However, the house is haunted by a ghost couple who died tragically and are protecting their house by scarring people off. They summon a bio-exorcist named Betelgeuse (pronounced ""Beetlejuice"", hence the film's title), by saying his name three times. However, this turns out to be more than they bargained for, as Betelgeuse has bigger plans.We have a set of different characters. There's our protagonist Lydia (Winona Ryder), a teenage goth girl who's also an aspiring photographer, as she's seen taking pictures throughout the movie. She's shown to be strange and peculiar and can see things that no one else can see, like ghosts. There's the ghost couple Adam Maitland (Alec Baldwin) and his wife Barbara (Geena Davis). Adam and Barbara died earlier on in a tragic accident in which their car fell off the bridge and they drowned.In the afterlife, they can't leave their house, so they try to protect their home from trespassers. They befriend Lydia, who can see them when no one else can. There's Delia (Catherine O' Hara), Lydia's stepmom who is a sculptor. Delia helps the family reshape the house in a wave of postmodern art. Then, there's Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) the main antagonist. He's a ghost who's very mischievous, and also rude, perverted and self-centered.As a bio-exorcist, he helps the people who summon him, but only does so for his own benefit, so that he can lift his curse, and wreak havoc upon the world, and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process, so he's basically the villain. He shows interest in Lydia, and agrees to help her, but in return that they get married. So, the climax involves Betelgeuse forcefully trying to marry Lydia, while Barbara figures out a plan to save her. That's about the gist of it.Beetlejuice (1988) is an excellent movie. It's very funny and scary at the same time, as well as very well directed and acted. Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton both did a great job with their roles. It has a very solid storyline and likable characters. It's also insanely creative, unique and original. There's not a single thing I didn't like about this movie, and I'd even go as far as to call it a masterpiece.I give Beetlejuice (1988) a solid 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
