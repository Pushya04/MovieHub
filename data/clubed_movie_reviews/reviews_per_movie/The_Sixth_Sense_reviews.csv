Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending,"This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.I didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A movie that will not be outclassed in its genre for years to come,"When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick.  I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience.  I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love.  The end was so surprising, I had to see it again.  The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story.  I couldn't find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.I believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently.  The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me.  This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions.  Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.  Maybe I read too much into this very wonderful film, but I believe it will be difficult to find a movie that has touched on these subjects so poignantly and so well for years to come.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Incredible,"The Sixth Sense is one of those films that rarely happens these days.  In other words, I knew so little about it before sitting in the cinema that it wasn't ruined before it started.I don't want to ramble on about it so I'll just say... absolute perfection. An incredible story that had me and my friends gripped from start to finish. The twist in the tale was totally unexpected as well.After it finished we sat through the whole of the credits and talked about how fabulous it was.  If only more films were like this.  I can't remember the last time we did that!Congratulations to all involved in this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant,"The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film, plain and simple. It is unique in that it relies on imagination and psychology to scare you and make you think twice about the world around you. The director did a fabulous job constructing the imagery of the film, and I genuinely did not know about the ending until it was revealed. Quite a shock! The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the single greatest psychological horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it are simply not giving it a chance or don't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. Brilliant",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
You'll be knocked for six,"This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realise why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.Laugh, cry, jump a mile out of your seat, sigh with relief - but not too early...

M. Night Shyalaman's standout movie.,"Cole Sear had a special gift, the ability to see dead people, his mother Lynn is worried beyond belief at the change in him, and Child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe is brought in to help him.For my money, this is still the best film from M Night. Shyalaman, since this film some have been good, some of been woeful, this however has stood the test of time.A real mind bender, this film is thought provoking, dramatic, unsettling at times, and on occasion a little moving.Arguably one of the best films for Bruce Willis, he's tremendous here, as are Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment.I would never dream of giving a spoiler away, as some have done in their reviews, there's a big moment in this film, where everything falls into place, it's very skillfully done, and a real jaw dropping moment.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best films of 1999!,"I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn't seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.THE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe's old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.The acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I've ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.The plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)THE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"I got the ending before in the theaters, but good film","The Sixth Sense has a surprise ending ( many films will use this in the following years) but it's not all about the ending ( in contrary to certain other films that I will not name to avoid spoiling). The story on itself is very interesting but the ending is the cherry on the pie. Many who saw it the first time were in disbelief: is this right...? After re-watching it several times...yes it is. The plot is almost watertight. I suppose if you want to you can always find tiny little mistakes but I haven't found any big ones.The Sixth Sense is unbelievably well cast: Bruce Willis delivers his 2nd best performance( 12 Monkeys is his best), debutant Haley Joel Osment is excellent( his performance in A. I is also excellent, other movies of his were mostly disappointing performances), Toni Colette delivers the first in a long series of Oscar-worthy performances (also see The Night Listener, The Hours, Little Miss Sunshine ao. ) and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg musn't be forgotten even though he only gets 3 minutes of screen time. Olivia Williams may be the only lesser performance in the lead cast but she still does an OK job.We can see several Shyamalan's trademarks for the first time: He uses very natural colors( brown, white, gray, beige, green) in the interiors and clothing. Another trademark for his work is the fragmentary use of a rich red color to break with the dull colors in the background. He doesn't overuse the red so it preserves its power. We can also see Shyamalan's excellent use of colors in The Village ( even more then in the sixth sense): red stands for evil,misfortune and fear while yellow stands for weakness. The Village is M. Night's third best film in my opinion (Unbreakable is the one that closest approaches TSS brilliance). It's also unbelievably well-acted, the story is strong, the settings are beautiful...definitely worth watching ( if hope you have seen it but if you haven't...you know what to do). It's a bit under-appreciated on IMDb but don't let that fool you.I'm no direction expert but I found it to be brilliant. The brilliance lies in the details; the excellent use of mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoints,...it's a delight for a filmenthousiast( like yours truly) to watch. You can feel Shyamalan is both writer and director; he knows exactly what to do with the material and which camera shot would be best for which scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the films of the Nineties,"This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn't receive at least an academy nomination.I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn't see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end? Well it totally disorientated me, my mind spinning back throughout the whole film. A fantastic punchline to my film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Another M. Night Shyamalan story,"Everywhere you hear the phrase ""I see dead people"". This goes to show how popular the movie is.The basic story is Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) Is a child psychiatrist that goes on one more try and chooses a new child Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) to help with his tendency to see dead people.After watching the movie, the first time, you will want to watch it again to see the clues you missed. It was well shot so you will be surprised at the movie from view of seeing it a second time with what you know.M. Night Shyamalan seems to borrow his stories from existing books or movies. The claim is that this is original. Not sure where this one came from but it is suggestedThe Lady Vanishes (1938)(""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" season 3 episode 10.)Bruce Willis brings this story to life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The most careful attention to detail,"What makes this film so wonderful to watch is not simply the acting, or the terror it instills, or even the plot itself.  It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character's soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they'll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
one of the greatest reveals of all time,"Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrates an award win with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Deranged ex-patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks in and shots Malcolm. Vincent then commits suicide. The next fall, Malcolm is treating distressed Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who lives with his single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he ""sees dead people"".This is one of the best reveals in movie history. It's not simply a shocking twist. Anybody can write a random twist that aims to shock people. This twist is well-planned and constructed from the first moments of the film. Shyamalan lays out not only clues but the right amount of clues. It is a twist that people are unlikely to foresee but then beat themselves for not forseeing it. He gets the perfect balance.The other question is whether this is a good movie without the twist. The great thing is that the intensity does not rely on the twist. HJO has the perfect wise innocence quality. It has great creepiness. It's a traditional ghost story and a well made one. The intensity ramps up as the ghosts reveal themselves. This would be one of the great horrors even without the twist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Masterpiece,"A perfect balance. Sad, but not self-pitying. Triumphant, but not cheesy. Frightening, but never grotesque. Shocking, but not gimmicky. Touching without being cheap. Visually it is stunning. There are some truly amazing shots, the attention to color is appreciated. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is extraordinary. What a promising career ahead of him. Bruce Willis, as a workaholic child psychologist, ought to be extremely proud of this, as it may be some of his best work. Tender, brooding, regretful, determined. Perfect. Toni Collette, is really phenomenal. I think she gets overlooked, but with any less talented actress, the film would have certainly suffered.I watched this film again recently, absolutely certain I would have lost some of the awe I had for it since last watching it on the big screen seven years ago.

"Fair enough, but not the work of genius some claim","I hate to be a party pooper, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The Sixth Sense is an entertaining film, better than some, not as good as others, but it is most certainly not the masterpiece many seem to make it out to be. (Nor, for that matter, is it as bad as many here suggest.) If anything it is an intriguing story, and not original at that - read The Third Policeman - which is realised in a somewhat perfunctory way by Shaymalan. If anything it could have been done better. When I was considering my view of the film, the word 'ponderous' occurred to me more than once, and I think that is about right. The Sixth Sense needed a more delicate touch and, well, it should have been spookier. Having said all that the young lad who portrays young Cole, the boy who can see the dead, give an outstanding performance, and for once an American director has successfully resisted the temptation to make a child more cloying than a mug of treacle. His mother also does well as a harassed single mother, and Bruce Willis shows that there is more to his ability than shooting guns and posing in sweaty T shirts. But I have to repeat: The Sixth Sense is great for a night in but not the earth-shattering Meisterwerk others claim it to be. If anything, there is any number of plot holes which become rather glaring once the film has finished and overall it doesn't quite stack up as it should. But what the hell: that would be serious is it came anyway close to being a work of genius. As it doesn't, those plot holes don't really matter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Death, Lfe, Fear and Hope","Review: The Sixth Sense, Director: M. Night ShyamalamAs a film which has undoubtedly caught the eye of the film going world, it was difficult to avoid the surrounding hype and publicity. Luckily most of the people I had spoken to who had seen the film did not spoil the 'twist' at the end, which, although is rather a laboured point by now in reviews, certainly adds to the ""Oh, I see now"" factor.The story revolves around a child psychologist played characteristically by Bruce Willis. I say characteristically, because although his portrayal is quite real, and at times touching, there always seems to be an unnerving 'Die Hard'-ness to his speech, lending the dialogue some comical qualities. Having said that, his overall attempts at revealing the vulnerable and disturbed psyche of his character achieve good results. As the psychologist, he is plagued by a particular event in his professional life which he perceives as his personal failure, and sets out to redeem himself by righting the wrong and wiping his failure from his conscience. This opportunity presents itself to him in the form of Cole Sear, played devastatingly well by Hayley Joel Osment. Cole has a problem, he sees dead people. To the outside world he is seen as a loner, a problem child, and has become increasingly isolated. Hence the need for a child psychologist. Once we have been introduced to these two central players, we are taken on a journey of discovery, as both of these characters in the space of the film will learn a great deal about each other, themselves and human nature.It is this particular point which the film attempts to address so strongly - human communication. That when this breaks down, an inevitable cycle of interpersonal destruction takes course, sometimes irreversible. This is framed within the context of a superbly told ghost story. The sheer truthfulness and honesty with which the concept of fear is expressed by all the characters, is breathtaking. Cole's' experience of the walking dead, appearing out of nowhere, Malcolm's fear of a deteriorating marriage, and Cole's' mother's fear relating to her own existential angst. All of these are played against the backdrop of the often difficult but finally warm relationship between Cole and Malcolm. Eventually, and against the odds, each character displays courage and bravery as they face up to their existential and supernatural fears.There are one or two niggling problems plot wise, but in a film where the overall atmosphere created is one which encompasses death, fear, and finally hope, it is impossible not to overlook incongruencies. Superb direction, acting and ambience lead me to think that M. Night Shyamalan has really succeeded in telling a chillingly touching story about the triumph of the human spirit.February 14, 2000 Harshad C. Keval",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Excellent thriller -- intelligent, touching, rewarding","I saw this at a preview screening, but in June, when the effects and music were in place and the final cut was available. This is the best ghost story I've seen since Robert Wise's classic THE HAUNTING. It's smart and very moving, while still having the requisite thrills. It doesn't cater to the ""jump out and yell Boo! every six minutes"" theory of thriller, but it has a number of genuine shocks (and a fabulous twist toward the end). Bruce Willis is wonderful - subdued and intelligent in his best dramatic performance since IN COUNTRY. And Haley Joel Osment is simply superb as the haunted Cole. He never overreaches or overacts. He simply experiences and reveals. It's one of the best dramatic child performances I've seen in years. If you liked THE INNOCENTS or THE HAUNTING or even GHOST, I highly recommend this film to you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Shyamalan's best film and the only film of his I consider a masterpiece,"I have to say I am not a fan generally of M Night Shyamalan's films, but I absolutely loved The Sixth Sense. It is a beautifully made film with an afterlife that is anything but angels and harps, and the score has lots of subtlety and atmosphere to it. The script is chilling, intelligent and poignant and the story complete with a knockout twist ending(easily the best and only wholly believable ending of Shyamalan's movies) is simplicity at its finest. Shyamalan's direction is wonderfully controlled, which is exactly what the story needed. Haley Joel Osment gives perhaps his best performance here, though he's superb in AI too, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mum very convincingly and Bruce Willis is suitably quiet and reflective. Overall, a wonderful film and Shyamalan's best by a mile in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Stunning drama with horrifying and hair raising images and wonderfully directed by Shyamalan,"The film focuses a child psychologist named Doctor Malcolm(Bruce Willis).One night, when the doctor and his spouse(Olivia Williams)find themselves their home, they are visited by a nutty patient and the tragedy take place. More later, the Doctor sees a traumatized young boy named Cole(Haley Joel Osment), he communicates with dead people who don't know they are dead. Cole's mummy(Tony Colette)is worried about her terrified son's nightmares ,increasing problems and episodes of acting out. Because of this, Cole is named geeky in the college where appear various dead people who ask his help.The film provides creepy scenes, a well-knit drama, grisly terror when the living dead appear and suspenseful throughout.The flick contains the more famous plot twist from cinema history, because the ending leads to a breathtaking and unexpected outcome on what's happened before. For that reason , gets a highly original and imaginative script by Night Syamalan,-also director and secondary actor, as usual in his films-, and has been copied and imitated several times, such as, ¨Stir of Echoes¨(David Koepp) and ¨The others¨(Alejandro Amenabar). Acting by main actors is top notch, Bruce Willis is magnificent as restrained psychologist and Haley Joel Osment is awesome as traumatized little boy, carrying the movie on his frail shoulders; furthermore, appear future promising actors as Mischa Burton(OC) and Trevor Morgan . Mysterious and sinister cinematographic atmosphere is well made by Tak Fujimoto and eerie soundtrack by James Newton Howard, both are Shyalaman's usual collaborators. The motion picture is produced by famed Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy(Spielberg's producers) and stupendously directed by M. Night Shyamalan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The standard for the twist story genre,"I consider this the very best twist-story I have ever seen, followed at great distance by The Others. That I am not the only one, of course, is best shown by the great spin-off, included those by the same director. And even more the fact, that none succeeded to equal, let alone surpass this movie. The movie is compelling and keeps you intrigued to the end, and the end, well, it is legendary. To me it is so brilliant, like you have seen two good movies in one. Many movies of the twist-genre, if I may call it that, do not respect the checklist for endings. And ending should wrap things up, tie up loose ends, without tearing the story we have seen so far apart (in the worst case telling the reader it was all a dream). The sixth sense does this better than any movie before or since. But before I get to that, let's start at the beginning. It started with Bruce Willis getting shot by his former patient, now a grown man still troubled by apparently non-existing phenomena. It gives the right background, since we are introduced to the main character, Bruce Willis, being a child psychologist, who has dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Or not? Was that patient mad? The rest of the story is about Bruce Willis' character seeking redemption for his failure, as he feels it, by trying to do it right next time. That chance comes with the gifted child that is showing the same problems. But before that, remember the cut? After Bruce was gunned down you see him suddenly sitting, the next fall, on a couch outside, waiting for the young boy. It struck me as lonely, and strange. Of course, in hindsight, it was all deliberately put there including the clever camera work and fall setting, as any good story should only contain things that belong there for a reason. I thought: where is the hospital, where is the wife? Why is the atmosphere so lonely, and deserted? Well we know now why, but I did not then, so this was one question, one unsolved delayed bit of information – always a good thing to keep the reader, or watcher, hooked. Also his contact with his wife: distant, short visits, monologues rather than discussions. I thought they are in a fight, but about what? The end provided the explanation: they were not in a fight, but she could not see him, and she looked sad since she was mourning about her dead husband. A very smart way of twisting a story. It is very hard to do, especially since the whole movie you have seen stays intact, even after the surprise. All you saw happened, only from a different perspective. Just when I started to think the start was too weird, I was intrigued just in time by the ghosts that came along with the little boy Bruce had as a patient. I thought it would end up like Poltergeist, the spirits entering the real world, Bruce having to sacrifice himself, redemption, end. But the real horror came from the people themselves, with of course the climax the video of the dead girl, showing she was poisoned by her stepmother. A very different approach and hard to do, but this movie succeeded in being scary without showing the obvious spooks alone, but with staying in the real world. Take 'The Others', for instance, that movie had the advantage of the claustrophobic effect you automatically get when you choose an isolated place, like the estate they were on. The Sixth Sense only had the open world, a city, as we know it, and the heroes could walk anywhere. Not easy to create a scary atmosphere, there, since the characters could just go away when things got scared, right? But they couldn't , since the ghost where all over the place, too. All the questions I had during the movie were all perfectly wrapped up in the end. I thought: why would Bruce find out now, not earlier or later, he was dead? Well, he had come full circle, he helped the boy where he could not help a boy in the past. If he would let go now, his wife could move on and she was ready, having a new boyfriend. The time was right. The boy, he came full circle too: by listening to the ghosts, he would find out he was no freak since they did exist. They were there and by listening to them he could be of use to the people that they left behind. Also his mother understood her son was just gifted and not a freak, by the somewhat over emotional scene with him telling about her dead mother showing up at some high school event, something he could obviously not have known. It is extremely hard to wrap all things up this perfect, and the reason this movie does it nevertheless, is because it showed a carefully constructed story which was possible to interpret in two ways all the time. By diverting me to the ghosts themselves, I totally forgot to bother about what was going on with Bruce Willis' character himself and his wife, and why it did not fit. It stayed in the back of my head, but the ghosts were even more dominant. Brilliant, you can only do this once. Furthermore I can add the acting is very good, and the camera-work also, especially the scene with the stepmother. So all the way to the end, the movie is surprising, intriguing and scary. It left the Poltergeist or Exorcist approach and by staying in the real world it made the ghosts even more scary, or exciting if that is the word. The end itself is the biggest surprise any movie has shown, and manages yet to leave all you saw intact, even adding a depth to the story. Perfect. A perfect story, made into a perfect movie.

Strange but ultimately rewarding,"First of all, I've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow.  I sort of agree with that, but I think it's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety(although here, as I said before, I think it took a little TOO much time).  And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.Having said all that, in addition to the pace, there were some times when I felt a little queasy, like I wasn't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say.  At other times, I was caught up in it, especially in the performances of Willis and Osment.  Then came the famous twist ending, and I will tell you that I was quite surprised, and it's making me turn the movie over and over again in my mind. I probably will have to see this again. Overall, while I don't think it's the best of the year, it is a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

**A Masterful Blend of Suspense and Emotion**,"""The Sixth Sense,"" directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is a remarkable film that expertly weaves psychological suspense with deep emotional themes. Released in 1999, it has earned its place as a modern classic, and for good reason.From the very beginning, the film captures the audience's attention with its eerie atmosphere and unsettling sense of tension. The story revolves around Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who sees dead people, and Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a child psychologist who tries to help him. The performances by both Osment and Willis are exceptional. Osment delivers a hauntingly poignant portrayal of a troubled child, imbuing Cole with both vulnerability and strength. Willis, as the supportive yet conflicted doctor, provides a grounded counterpoint to the supernatural elements of the story.What truly stands out about ""The Sixth Sense"" is its intricate and layered storytelling. Shyamalan masterfully uses twist endings and subtle hints throughout the film to keep audiences engaged and guessing until the very end. The famous twist, when revealed, is not just shocking but also profoundly affects the characters' arcs and the overarching narrative, prompting viewers to reevaluate everything they've just watched.The film delves into themes of fear, loss, and the struggle for understanding. It presents a poignant exploration of unresolved grief and the need for closure, resonating with audiences on a deeply emotional level.""The Sixth Sense"" is beautifully shot, with a color palette that enhances the film's mood and a haunting score that elevates its tense moments. The careful direction and attention to detail contribute to a truly immersive cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""The Sixth Sense"" remains a standout film in the psychological thriller genre, balancing suspense with heartfelt storytelling. It's a movie that encourages multiple viewings, as there are layers to uncover and insights to glean with each rewatch. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted tale with a perfect blend of thrills and emotional depth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I See Dead People!,"Even though everyone has everything about this movie, I'll be joining in that conversation with my review of The Sixth Sense (1999). This is the movie that launched M. Night Shyamalan's career and there's no question as to why that happened because this is movie is phenomenal.Positives for The Sixth Sense (1999):
First off, wee have to talk about the performances from the cast. Haley Joel Osment gives one of the great child performances of all time as Cole Sear. There are scenes where he is truly horrified by all of the ghosts that he sees and he pulls it off with perfection. You also have Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crow and he's so believable as this doctor who wants to help Haley Joel Osment get through his problems. Then, there's Toni Collette as Lynn Sear in this movie and of course she gives an amazing performance to where she cares about her son and she wants to know what she can do to help better understand her son. Then, you have to talk about the filmmaking of this movie which is done to perfection by M. Night Shyamalan. Whenever, these ghosts show up to terrify Cole and even they scare you. I loved how both Cole and Lynn finally get their closure to their conflict in the end. And of course, the plot twist is brilliant and I knew it before watching this movie and yet it still manages to work.Overall, The Sixth Sense (1999) is an absolute masterclass in both the horror genre and filmmaking in general. If you haven't watch this movie yet, then you're doing something wrong in your life because this movie is phenomenal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
With The Benefit Of Hindsight,"""The 6th Sense"" was a big hit in 1999, Oscar nominations, the lot. Now I finally seen it and I must say that with the benefit of hindsight, the only startling thing about the film is the introduction of the sensational Haley Joel Osment. Plus, a terrific performance by Toni Collette. Other than that, the film is a mess. Am I wrong? A clever designed twist at the end seems to justify, clumsiness of major proportions. Just look at that wake where Haley reveals the message from the dead girl. Unforgivably lame. All the jolts are underline by a vulgar strike in the music score department. Really bad. Mr Night Shaymalan got very luck in 1999 and has not been able to repeat its fortune since, no matter the obvious, desperate attempts to grab another jackpot. ""The Happening"" was unwatchable, ""Lady In The Water"" the work of someone with a an alarming mounting ego. ""Signs"" another clumsy, half cooked semi idea. Strange, how time puts things in perspective. I was recently reminded that ""The Towering Inferno"" was also, in its day, nominated for an Oscar as the best film of its day.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Film For Thinking People,"A child psychologist, played by Bruce Willis, tries to help a troubled boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, who says he sees ghosts.  This film could easily have been one of those dreadful fright night horror flicks played for cheap shocks, aimed at a juvenile mind.  Instead, the film maker chose to tell a story of fragile human feelings, and hidden assumptions.  ""The Sixth Sense"" thus appeals to a more mature audience.This film is carefully constructed, and deliberately slow, so that we can absorb the excellent cinematography, and have a chance to find clues that will help us avoid preconceived ideas.  But our assumptions are hard to overcome, and most of us are headed for a surprise ending, an outcome which is made possible as a result of superb film editing.And the acting is well above average.  I would not have cast Willis in the role of the fatherly psychologist, but he is more convincing than I would have predicted.  Osment's performance is as good as I have ever seen for a child actor.  And Toni Collette is totally convincing as the boy's mother. Both Osment and Collette deserved their Oscar nominations.This film may, or may not, have a subtext.  I found what could be one, but then I may have been reading too much into the story.  Sensitive, thought provoking, and well crafted, ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of the better films of the last ten years.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Eerie, creepy and superb","Upon first watch of The Sixth Sense, I was hooked and shocked at the same time. I expected a complete horror story, mixed with the usual gore and stomach-churning scenes we ordinarily witness in other movies with a similar theme. The Sixth Sense is anything but. It details the emotional aspects of love and devotion, as well as having to cope with being an outsider.The purpose of The Sixth Sense is to captivate us into looking and evaluating our own lives, on how we treat ourselves, our husbands and wives and our parents and friends. It details these points to graphic effect.Young Haley Joel Osment is terrific as Cole, the young boy who sees 'dead people', and portrays his emotions and his mind to an easily captivating audience. Also wonderful to see Bruce Willis turn away from his usual 'action man' sequence to allow us into the equally troubled mind of Dr. Malcolm Crowe.A divine and heartwarming film combining elements of horror and suspense has made The Sixth Sense an engaging film that is simply unforgettable. It's another firm favourite of mine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Emotional, chilling, and the end will give you shivers","What an incredible film! No matter how many times I watch it, it never loses its affect. It's the kind of horror movie that has the odd jump scare, plenty of suspense, and a plot that is intensely captivating. And then, when you get to the end, it slaps you round the face with the ultimate twist! I literally felt my blood run cold when the twist was revealed. Shyamalan does an incredible job, and none of his films since this one have ever had quite the same awe inspiring twist as this film. I recommend it highly!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Polished, efficient, derivative, inert...","Bruce Willis looks appropriately grim throughout thriller about a child psychologist who attempts to help a troubled young boy who claims to see ghosts. Surprisingly popular other-worldly yarn (surprising because the film is so old-fashioned), it goes to sometimes hokey means to get a scare out of the audience, but is nevertheless very well-made and engrossing. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the picture is low-keyed, somewhat ambitious, but not very delicate, with plot-holes and moments where there seems to be no driving force behind the narrative; for such a deliberately-paced movie, Shyamalan doesn't show much grace, only technical finesse. ""The Sixth Sense"" is like a good ""Night Gallery"" episode: occasionally suspenseful, with solid, non-showy performances, but with the general feeling that we've been down this road before. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I Remember When Shyamalan Was Like This,"Most people today criticize M. Night Shyamalan movies. That's probably going to happen when you release movies such as Avatar: The Last Airbender or After Earth, but it wasn't like this at the turn of the century. When The Sixth Sense was released, it was kind of a big deal, for good reason. The movie is not only well-directed, well-written, well-acted, well-edited, etc., but it's a classic movie and it will stay in my memory for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
alright but predictable,"This film is alright. The performances are spectacular, which makes it worth seeing. However, like all of Shyamalan's (sp?) films, it is very predictable. Personally, I saw the ending coming with about half the film still to go, and i spent the rest watching just to see if I was right. I had the same problem with the Village, but unlike the Village, The Sixth Sense was made out to be some sort of ending that will shock you. It's worth seeing, if you don't know how it ends just to see if you can figure it out. If you do know how it ends but haven't seen it, rent it just see see Bruce Willis (among many others) give really great performances.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Clever ghost story,"Award winning child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is confronted and shot by an ex-patient.  Years later he has recovered from this experience and begins to treat a child who suffers from similar problems.  The young boy, Cole, claims to see dead people and requires Crowe's constant attention - to the detriment of his marriage.  With Cole becoming increasingly scared and withdrawn, Crowe is his last hope.This film is an old-fashioned ghost story, replacing gore with a genuine spooky atmosphere.  The story is deceptively simple and plays almost innocently for the whole film until Cole's visions are revealed.  The true genius of the story isn't revealed until the final twist when we see how we have been duped by a good director!  Even without the twist, this is still a good film - the story of Cole is well done and is chilling and frightening sometimes.  However it is also quite human, as it is essentially the story of Cole overcoming his fears.Willis delivers a careful, understated performance.  His choices in recent years have been remarkably good (with some exceptions).  This is just yet another great role from a man who's career looked like it was dying after ""striking distance"" and ""colour of night"".  He hits just the right note here.  I'm not a big fan of child actors as a rule, but Osment is really good here - never falling into the ""cute child"" category.  I don't know if he should have got the Oscar, but he's still good.  The rest of the cast are good, but really it's the central relationship between Willis and Osment that makes this film.The plot may have some holes in (some ghosts hang around where they died, one comes to find Cole etc), but overall this is very good.  The director weaves an interesting story that stands on its own, but makes it even more memorable by challenging how we accept and assume things in movies by delivering a great, clever twist at the end.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Classic,"""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion.But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying.The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering ""not anymore"", after he has helped Krya.And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): ""Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.""The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Unforgettable ghost story,"A horror movie with an inventive premise, a sensitive marital drama, and a psychological puzzler; ""The Sixth Sense"" combines all of these into a deeply affecting movie. Haley Joel Osment (in a justifiably star-making turn) personifies child trauma, and his pain is absolutely heartbreaking. But this is also peak Bruce Willis working with a clockwork script and expert direction. The performances in this film are exceptional.Over the years I've made the mistake of reducing ""The Sixth Sense"" down to its twist ending (which, to be fair, is electrifying) but that is a gross underestimation on my part. There is far more to it than that, and it holds up admirably after so many years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Unique concept and approach to old fashioned ghost story telling,"Decided to revisit this classic. It was a brand new take on one of the more fundamental themes of the ""scary movie"" family of genres, life after death. M. Night Shyamalan adopted the always reliable Twilight Zone Gothic approach, but set up an all-time reverse twist finale that would have made Rod Serling stand up and applaud.This could be Bruce Willis's most understated and yet finest performances of his career. No laughing and destroying stuff; instead he approaches his role thoughtfully. It was a new side to him, and he carried himself well. He's a child psychiatrist, with a new patient, Haley Joe Osment, that is filled with angst and makes the claim that dead people are drawn to him like a magnet and talk to him. Osment's performance is emotional and oddly believable. His classic declaration about dead people ""don't know they're dead!"" is one of the best delivered ever.Ghost visitations are utilized perfectly and just often enough so that every one of them is executed with a dramatic impact and superior fright factor. Low lighting is used almost all the time for a dark, oppressive mood, which fits most of the time.Now the weaknesses. In retrospect, there are some serious lapses in logic through the course of the story. How could the ""twist"" have been concealed from the protagonist so long, without some character or action revealing the truth to him? The scenes that are meant to address this fail to explain it. There are some very awkwardly slow scenes in the story, and others that just aren't useful. These scenes are constructed to set up the shock value of the final reveal, but most of them are just plain dull.But overall, this is a fine work, complete with fine performances and an original concept that make for a good, scary ghost story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I See Dead People,"Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray who he failed to help. After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had. Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don't know they're dead.Right off, I'll say this is one of the best films ever. It currently ranks #3 for M. Night's films. I love this movie because it's a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.Yeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn't distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.The acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.If you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you.

M. Night Shyamalan's finest moment...,"I've actually only seen the 1999 movie ""The Sixth Sense"", from writer and director M. Night Shyamalan, once before. And that was back in the day when the movie was new. So I opted to revisit the movie again here in 2024.Now, I have to say that the movie's storyline is one that you definitely remember vividly from the first time watching it. So I suppose that writer and director M. Night Shyamalan really managed to put together something very unique back in 1999, especially since the memory of the movie still is fresh in memory after 25 years. But at the same time that is also the weak point of the movie, because once you've seen the movie, there is no surprise moments or elements to the storyline.The acting performances in the movie are good, and the have a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg. I really like Haley Joel Osment's performance in the movie, because he carries the movie phenomenally well, even at such a young age.""The Sixth Sense"" is a 'whoa, did that just happen' type of movie the first time you watch it. I fondly remember the unveiling of the plot twist, I hadn't seen it coming back in the day. And that alone makes it well-worth sitting down to watch the movie.The second time around watching the movie, I was looking for all the subtle clues and things that I missed the first time around. And when you know the plot, you easily pick out the minute details that M. Night Shyamalan placed throughout the narrative in so many scenes. And it really works well, because it is so subtle that you don't notice it the first time around.I will actually go as far as to saying that ""The Sixth Sense"" is M. Night Shyamalan's finest achievement in his career. He haven't gotten anywhere near this movie since.If you haven't already seen ""The Sixth Sense"", you most certainly should find the time to do so.My rating of M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 thriller ""The Sixth Sense"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Simply amazing,"""The Sixth Sense"" is perhaps most famous for its twist ending, which recontextualizes the entire story in a way that is both shocking and satisfying. The revelation that Dr. Crowe has been dead throughout the film is a masterstroke, transforming a compelling ghost story into a profound meditation on grief, denial, and acceptance. This twist not only surprises but also enriches repeat viewings, as viewers can notice the subtle clues Shyamalan has embedded throughout the film.""The Sixth Sense"" is a masterful blend of horror, drama, and mystery, featuring outstanding performances and a narrative that continues to engage and surprise audiences. Its exploration of the human condition, coupled with its supernatural elements, creates a film that is both chilling and deeply moving. Even decades after its release, ""The Sixth Sense"" remains a benchmark for twist endings and supernatural storytelling, solidifying its place in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Way Cinema Is Supposed To Work,"Is there such a thing as a ""perfect movie""? If that concept does indeed exist, than ""The Sixth Sense"" comes about as close as possibly to taking that prize. It contains everything one could ask for in a film.For a basic plot summary, ""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is prone to visions of dead ghosts and as such is not fitting in very well at school or at home. With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.Since it is easier to come at this review from this angle, about the only people who WON'T enjoy this movie are those who only like the mindless actions of explosions, car chases, and flexing muscles. Not to disparage those films or their audiences, but if that is the only kind of fare that gets you revved up in the theater, then this one might not be for you.For everyone else, though, ""Sixth Sense"" is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible. It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw-dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon! Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as ""Signs"" is excellent in its own right), ""Sixth Sense"" is the hallmark film from director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is the perfect showcase for the type of movies he enjoyed making.Overall, this film is easily in my Top Ten Films of All-Time mental list, and perhaps even encroaching on the Top Five. It is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word. If for some reason you haven't seen it, it may just fundamentally change the way you view cinema forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
a thriller in the real sense of the word,"Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia psychiatrist meeting with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can - OK, I'll say it this one last time - see dead people. While too many horror flicks have relied on gore, this one relies on the subconscious, and other things that we don't realize. And of course, there's the ending. I literally did not see that coming, although there were a number of clues throughout the movie. All that I can say is, you are going to have your mind blown. M. Night Shyamalan truly created an impressive piece of cinema history here, and of his later movies, only ""Unbreakable"" came close to equalling this one's quality.On another note, I think that it was appropriate that ""The Sixth Sense"" came out in 1999, when I was 15. It was named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the many movies that year that revolutionized the movie industry (along with ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich""). Similarly, in 1967, when my parents were 15, movies such as ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Graduate"" - all revolutionizing the movie industry - were released.

Shyamalan,"I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. (The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) ""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? ""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium."" That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A fine movie but certainly not a great one,"Although this is a fine movie, it is one of the most overrated by audiences in recent years.  Among the film's main strengths are the stunning performance of child actor Haley Joel Osment and by the young actress who plays his mother.The script is very clever but also very, very sentimental.  This is not to say that the scene near the end of the picture when the boy connects on a new level is not moving--it is.  But the ending of the story of Willis's character is more effective as a stunt than as a source of honest emotion.I will say, though, that the scenes intended to be scary are really, really scary.  This owes largely to Osment's performance, which draws us into complete identification with the haunted child at the movie's center.  It is also a credit to the screenwriter/director, though the movie's scares are never adequately integrated with the gooey emotion at the movie's heart.I recommend THE SIXTH SENSE, but I insist that it is not the ""great"" movie that current popular sentiment suggests.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A sensational movie.,The film captivates you from the very few beginning minutes leaving you at complete shock then gradually interprets things on a simple but smart level through the great performances of both Bruce and the kid Haley.

My favorite thriller movie,"I have never seen a thriller suspense film that touches me so much.
At first glance, I only stayed on the emotional resonance the film bring to me . The boy and the doctor heal each other, and the affection between family members always makes people cry. However , in the second review, I saw more details. It is obvious that the whole movie is so complete and what you get confused at the beginning will be answered at the end.
When he was a child, Haley Joel Osment 's acting skill was too explosive. Every line and expression in his eyes, is so natural and you can really feel what he think or how he feel. Later, I also went to watch ""AI"", another film he played in where his pure eyes left me a very deep impression.
Now, let's talk about the plot. The plot of this movie is very clever and ingenious. And the ending is so exciting . At the end of the film, Cole told his secrets to her mother and the existence of her grandmother. Both generations have been blessed by family affection. There is no doubt that every mother will always love her child.
And the love between Crowe and Anna, I prefer to call it an unspeakable and moving emotion deep in heart. Finally Crowe realized the truth, from shocked, unacceptable, to despair, painful, and finally calmed down. He still accepted the truth, for he helped Cole and fulfilled his wish; he could still be there with his wife in the end.
""You are never second ever"". Despite the reluctance, in the end, they said good night to each other . Tomorrow everything will be different. The movie came to an abrupt end. . . . .In order to match the theme, the overall movie is in a cool tone. The symmetrical still scene lens is left blank, and the rhythm of the whole movie is very comfortable. With the bleak autumn scene and beautiful soundtrack, the appreciation is also high.The horror and suspense effect is quite enough, but the latter is very healing. The timid friends must persist until the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Haunting Masterpiece of Emotion and Suspense,"The Sixth Sense is a remarkable cinematic experience that sticks with you long after the credits roll. It's not just a movie-it's a haunting exploration of fear, grief, and human connection. What makes it so powerful is its ability to balance a gripping supernatural mystery with deeply emotional storytelling. Few films manage to evoke genuine chills while also tugging at your heartstrings, but this one excels at both.For me, the most compelling aspect is Haley Joel Osment's performance. His portrayal of Cole Sear feels so raw and genuine that you can't help but empathize with his terror and loneliness. It's rare to see such emotional depth from a young actor, and he absolutely carries the weight of the film. Bruce Willis, too, is fantastic in a subdued, introspective role that's a departure from his usual action-hero persona. Together, they create a dynamic that feels authentic and deeply moving.The pacing of the film is another standout element. It unfolds slowly and deliberately, giving you time to sink into its atmosphere and connect with its characters. The moments of suspense are carefully constructed, never feeling cheap or forced. And then there's that twist ending-iconic for a reason. It's the kind of revelation that makes you want to immediately rewatch the movie to pick up on all the subtle clues you missed the first time.What I love most about The Sixth Sense is how it's ultimately a story about healing and understanding. The supernatural elements are gripping, but the real heart of the film lies in its exploration of unresolved pain and the ways people find closure. It's a beautiful, haunting film that resonates on a deeply emotional level.If there's any critique, it's that the slow pacing might not be for everyone. But for me, that's part of what makes it so effective-it takes its time to draw you into its world. I'd easily give The Sixth Sense a 9/10. It's a masterpiece of storytelling that's as emotionally impactful as it is spine-chilling.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Predictable, but still worth catching","This could've been a really good movie, except I predicted the ending after the first scene! Unfortunately, knowing the ending kind of negates the rest of the film. Either way, this is a decent flick, with a surprisingly superb performance put in by young Osment (who's better than Willis!). There are some pretty creepy parts, but this movie's still at its best with Willis and Osment on screen together.All told, it's a decent (and, for Hollywood, maybe even original) idea and story that's ruined by what I thought was a very revealing beginning. You might be better off walking in 5 minutes into it....",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Excellent but I don't see myself watching it again in the future,"To keep it brief, as far as cinematography, realism, and horror, I have no complaints.Though, I was never really a fan of horror films. I always just thought that they were stupid and relied too much on cheap jump-scares to impose the spooky element. But frankly, I find that this movie does quite the opposite.Sure there are a few jump-scares, but I believe that the concept and atmosphere does an excellent job at really driving the horror element. Also, the acting is nothing short of amazing, paired with great special effects.To be honest, I really just have one complaint. That being the pacing. The first 30 - 40 minutes of the movie just bored me with nothing but dialogue and setting the plot. Everything else is great, but this small flaw is enough to make me never feel too inclined to watch it again in the future. It just isn't something I'd see myself enjoying a second time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Didn't work for me,"The Sixth Sense is the movie that put certain M. Night Shyamalan to the map. I heard that this is an amazing movie and maybe my expectations were a bit high cause I didn't enjoy it.It's about a boy who sees terrible visions and a child psychologist who is trying to help him. I didn't like the story. I know Shyamalan tends to have twists in his movies, but the twist in this one didn't impress me. Maybe I spoiled the viewing experience for myself since I knew to look for the twist. Maybe I should have seen this movie when it came out to enjoy it more. Much of this comes down to my personal preference. And to be honest I don't like Shyamalan's directional style. The long takes were not that good. I didn't like his framing either.The movie was okay on the acting front. I liked Haley Joel Osment's performance. Bruce Willis and the rest of the cast were okay. M. Night Shyamalan made a brief appearance, which didn't really make me hold my breath.The good thing about the movie is it's overall creepiness and sense of fear. There were couple of jump scares that made me cringe. Having too much jump scares isn't necessarily a good thing, but the movie doesn't rely on them. Sometimes this movie reminded me about Shining with the hallucinations and everything. And no surprise here: I thought Kubrick did it much better.Some things don't appeal to everyone and this movie is an example. I just couldn't make myself to like it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Sixth Sense - A Movie You Can't Forget,"I first watched this movie during my school days, and even today, I recommend it to everyone. ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of those films that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The twist at the end is absolutely mind-blowing. If no one has spoiled it for you, you're in for an unforgettable experience.Haley Joel Osment's acting is on another level, especially for someone so young. He's the heart of the movie, and honestly, he deserved some special award for his performance. Bruce Willis is brilliant too, and director M. Night Shyamalan really nailed it with his storytelling. The writing is so good that every time you watch it, you notice something new.It's crazy that this movie didn't win any Oscars, even though it was nominated in six categories. Sure, ""American Beauty"" won big that year, but in my opinion, ""The Sixth Sense"" was far better and way more memorable.If you haven't seen it yet, watch it.

The Sixth Sense An Effective Thriller With A Good Twist Ending,"The Sixth Sense is an effective thriller with a good twist ending from director M Night Shyamalan whose admirable in making this movie which was his first back in 1999. His other films that followed haven't even been on par with this one but thats okay. The cast are good in their roles including Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and especially Haley Joel Osment as the boy who can see dead people. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. Its best to see this without knowing too much about the film because that will ruin some of the surprises including a revelation about one of the main characters. This film does have a little suspense and creepy moments but there could have been more of them. This film felt a bit like a drama with thriller and supernatural elements which wasn't a bad thing. The music by James Newton Howard seems to sync very well with the tone of the film and what was happening on the screen. The creepy moments usually involving a dead person being seen are well executed and paced. This is a movie you'll want to see twice so you can pick up on things you didn't notice before the first time around. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Overall The Sixth Sense is a solid thriller with some suspense, creepy moments, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

great piece of work that sets a new standard for the genre,"Tense, creepy thriller about a renowned child psychologist (Willis) whose devotion to his work has overtaken his personal life and put him at odds with his neglected wife.

One of the most effective thrillers of its time: gripping, suspenseful, flawlessly performed, and extremely well-crafted, with sure-handed direction that allows for plenty of spooky, spine-chilling moments on its way to a startling and awe-inspiring finale.

Haley Joel Osment is marvelous!,"Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a successful child psychologist who's faced with the toughest challenge of his career when assigned to help a young boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment ) who is haunted by unknown demons. The director is the relatively unknown and young M. Night Shyamalan and despite his obvious talents the movie is a bit disappointing as a psychological thriller. The shocks are too far between and even too obvious and the plot, despite of a successful surprise-ending, does not hold up to minute scrutiny. But having said that it is important to emphasize that H. J. Osment is absolutely amazing as the haunted boy and stands out as one of the best child performances for a very long time. Bruce Willis is excellent as well, his performance is very quiet, almost  modest, and it suits him very well. But the outstanding performance of the film is without a doubt the breakthrough of the young Osment and personally I can't wait to see what the future brings for him. It's more than likely that ""The Sixth Sense"" will be remembered as the real beginning of an exceptional career.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
REDISCOVER AND ACCEPT YOURSELF.,"Re watching this film made me weep like a child. I don't know why. Maybe because of the nostalgic value and how my life used to be back then with my friends and brothers and now most of the them are dead and I don't even see them anymore.I guess I lost the ability to see dead people.It's more than that. The film is a masterpiece and it doesn't matter someone spoiled it for you or not. It still is a great psychological horror film. The diabolical conflict between the therapist and the child and path of accepting the truth of your reality and discovering yourself. It doesn't matter how far you go to help someone but sometimes helping someone can result into helping yourself. All you need is that one kind of validation from a person that you can be saved and an assurance from another that i believe in your secret.

A boy who sees the phantoms,"The boy Haley Joel Osment starred very well this thriller.

Being able to communicate with the spirits he knew what really happened in the past.

I see dead people....,"Here comes Bruce Willis again in the skin of a rescuer! But unlike ""the fifth element"" and ""armageddon"", he mustn't save the whole wide world. Neither, must he save a group of persons from a terrorist threat as it was the case with ""die hard. No, he simply must save a little boy called Cole, haunted by morbid visions and Willis, a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him... With ""fight club"" and ""the blair witch project"", ""the sixth sense"" ranks among the best movies made in 1999. It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it. If you're watching this movie for the first time, you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however, they are important for the development of the story. The same thing can also be said for a few scenes, especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him... Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay. Rarely, a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay. It's disconcerting, disturbing and however perfectly coherent. For a long part, the movie is a beautiful ""trompe l'oeil"". On another hand, it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man. In ""the sixth sense"", it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes to Haley Joel Osment. His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary. Besides, he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny, the little boy in Kubrick's ""shining"" because they've got a common point: an odd power supernatural and all in all, the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like: they're simply asking him for help...

A Milestone for Psychological Thrillers and a Masterpiece of Suspense and Drama ...,"The amazing climax of the 90's have enriched our cinematic knowledge with extraordinary movies, from the immersion into a parallel universe named ""The Matrix"" and the unforgettable heart-breaking ""Green Mile"", to the powerful social commentary of the pre-millennium consumerist society in ""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"", not to mention the resuscitation of the legendary ""Star Wars"" saga  and still, only one movie managed to get so rapidly and deeply rooted in Pop-Culture: M. Night Shamalayan's ""The Sixth Sense"", one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that ""The Sixth Sense"" didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed ""The Sixth Sense"" creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's ""Exorcist"" and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in ""The Sixth Sense"" : there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with ""The Exorcist"" is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking. The mother and son relationship is the heart of the film when the dorsal spine is Dr. Malcolm Crowe's back-story with Bruce Willis in one of his most underrated out-of-character performances as a mysterious doctor who tries to help and assist Cole in this painful experience, which seems to be a two-ways therapy inhabited by a profound will of redemption. Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography: the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock (""Psycho"" being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young débutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder ""The Sixth Sense"" made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films.""The Sixth Sense"" is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big ""Wow"" at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because ""The Sixth Sense"" still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Some Twists And Stuff,"""The Sixth Sense"" is the first horror film I know of that also works as a tear-jerker. A ""creepy weepy,"" you might even call it; the darnedest thing about that combination being how well it plays here.Child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to recover his professional equilibrium after one of his most traumatic cases came to a fatal end. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who struggles with his peers, is called a ""freak,"" and draws horrible images until he is called into a meeting about it. Now he just draws pictures of rainbows, not because his heart's in it, but because ""they don't have meetings about rainbows."" Underneath the surface, it's anything but rainbows for poor Cole.""The Sixth Sense"" has become a prisoner of its popularity the same way ""Titanic"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" have, marked for ridicule by those who think themselves better than the hoi polloi who made it such a hit. Even people who haven't seen ""Sixth Sense"" know its catchphrases and storyline, and with that familiarity comes contempt, especially as its director, M. Night Shyamalan, has struggled in recent years to repeat his success. In such an atmosphere, it's easy to overlook that the one thing that makes ""Sixth Sense"" so popular is that it's so incredibly good.The art of storytelling is at the heart of the film, the way it quietly unfolds at its own pace, pulling you in with eerie moments and occasional shocks to a place that gets deeper as you get closer. Cole explains at one point to Dr. Crowe that the trick to a good story is that it have ""some twists and stuff."" People who downgrade ""The Sixth Sense"" do so on the basis of the twists, which was what got the film so talked about in the first place. But it's the other ""stuff"" that makes ""Sixth Sense"" so lasting and compelling for its fans.Take it from me: I watched ""Sixth Sense"" for the first time just over a year ago. By then its much ballyhooed ""secret"" was out of the bag for me, just as it probably is for you even if you haven't yet seen this film. The film took me for a ride anyway, because of Shyamalan's soft-yet-penetrating eye; incredible acting led by Osment, Willis, and Toni Collette as Cole's mom; and its sentimental-yet-spooky atmosphere.Every scene is shot with a certain style that makes it compelling not just as horror but as a slice of life, and this constant balance makes the film such a marvel. Even as it slips out of everyday reality into the utterly fantastic, it does so in a way you never notice your feet leaving the ground. Moments of fright are alleviated with humor and warmth.Something else needs to be said of ""Sixth Sense,"" that despite its horror theme it's a positive, inspirational film, one that on its own terms gives ""Passion Of The Christ"" a run for its money in terms of connecting to the deepest feelings of many of its viewers.Yes, Shyamalan does gild the lily too much at times, tying up things that don't need tying up, and you can feel your heartstrings being tugged at a little too much at points. There may be a couple of minor plot holes visible on a second viewing. But still, at the very least the end result is one terrific piece of entertainment, and probably very much more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A good movie if a little over-hyped,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a good movie but perhaps a little overrated. I believe that those who don't like it are in minority. Part of this explains its success.The unfortunate reality is that this was the only Haley Joel Osment's successful movie. He made a reasonable number of very good movies and none of them was a success: ""Pay It Forward"", ""Edges of the Lord"" and ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"".Ironically at first nobody didn't expect that ""The Sixth Sense"" was going to have half of this success. This means that, if it wasn't a success, then Haley Joel Osment wouldn't have had a single successful movie.Now let's talk about the movie itself. Sometimes this is classified as a terror movie, but for me this isn't really a terror film. This is a combination of supernatural, drama, tension, suspense, thriller and instrumental (but suspenseful) music, without the use of special effects. Its simplicity works out well. This motion picture is also emotional, funny at parts and only in brief moments there is some terror.Haley Joel Osment plays a difficult role for a child, but with his incredible talent he steals the show. He was the first child actor ever nominated for Best Actor. Too bad he didn't win (not only for this, but also for his other movies I mentioned).Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in this. He is usually a very limited actor, but in this he's just as good as Haley. Plus, unlike his other films, Bruce plays a likable character here.Aside some absolutely unnecessary scenes, this movie is generally good. One of the best parts is when Cole (Haley Joel Osment) finally reveals his secret to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). That part is breathtaking, highly emotional and intense. Cole's facial expressions say all and some of the movie's best quotes can be heard in this sequence.The idea of this movie inspired the TV series ""Ghost Whisperer"" which stars Jennifer Love Hewitt.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

seriously and tiresomely dull - Overrated!,"Being involved in the industry and having read so much about this film for several months, I have to say that it is a great disappointment. Bruce Willis was badly miscast. With so many close-ups the part needed an actor with a greater range who can convey tension subtly and convincingly and not the one dimensional comic book action hero looks with the acting ability of a turnip. Bruce Willis trying ever so hard to be restrained is like torture to watch. Even the much-hyped ending is not so difficult to predict. Too many sub-plots with the dead people cropping up here and there with little point except to try and scare the audience - a hand shooting out from under a table - is all old hat.

WOW! Let me see that again!,"To me this film ranks right up there with The Innocents as one of the very best ghost stories ever made. The surprise ending really IS a surprise, and works even better on multiple viewings. I think that this film really is about the profound human need for communication, connection, and most of all for compassion. The Sixth Sense transcends its genre, as do most classics, and I do think that this one is going to a classic. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act, despite what his detractors would have us believe. Haley Joel Osment-- in one of the truly great child performances-- is wonderful. Bravo! This film should have won the Oscar instead of American Beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant All the way.,"One of the best movie I have watched in a long long time. Shyamalan is definitely an artist par excellence as shown by his control over the script and direction. By far 'the best' acting by a child actor in any movie that i have seen so far, simply brilliant. As for Mr. Bruce Willis, isn't he one among the very few actors who can act really well at the same time had a great stint as an action hero, kudos to you Mr. Versatile. I would rate the movie 9.5 on 10 [0.5 i have to take out because nothing is perfect in this world ;) ]A definite recommendation to every movie lover. For the sheer brilliance of the movie in its simplicity, nothing out of the world targeted or overt cheap scare tactics or stuffs like that. An extremely well controlled script with some superb acting by the two lead actors separated by huge age difference and experience but together bringing an absolute movie goers delight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"chilling, sad and uplifting all in one","The Sixth Sense was deservedly a surprising Hollywood sensation. It is of course remembered for its amazing and shocking ending. I can tell you though, there is much more to this film than just the ending.People who say The Sixth Sense is rubbish because the ending is obvious and they figured it out are just being stupid and they don't know what they are talking about. I have watched films before knowing the ending, and have still enjoyed them as much as anyone. The ending is there for you to see throughout the film, but it is still hard to figure out - a bit like the twist in Fight Club. Even without the great ending though, this film would still be excellent. Bruce Willis has proved once again that he has many more strings to his bow than just action hero John McClane that made him famous, as he puts in a wonderful performance as a doctor haunted by his past. The script and direction by M. Night Shyamalan is also very good. Despite these two great performances though, the stand out has to be Haley Joel Osment as the disturbed young boy. He is really freaky, and he really captures how scared his character would probably be in real life.The huge twist ending does divert attention from the rest of the film, but the rest of the film should not be forgotten. If you haven't watched this yet, you will not just be sat there waiting for the ending, the whole storyline is a compelling and disturbing drama. It is a film to watch more than once, as the ending does fit in perfectly with the storyline before it. The ending of Unbreakable is about as shocking, but I don't think Shyamalan will ever make another film as good as this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Puzzling, absorbing, good twist as the final touch...","To fully accept the premise of THE SIXTH SENSE, you first have to accept BRICE WILLIS as a prominent child psychologist after seeing him in all those DIE HARD films. He goes from an action star to an intense doctor absorbed with a child patient (HALEY JOEL OSMENT) who claims he can see the dead.Struggling professionally after a maniacal ex-patient has shot and wounded him in the heat of rage, the psychologist is determined to help Osment from going off the deep end the way his former patient did. That is the crux of the story.It involves flashbacks, flash forwards and all kinds of camera tricks to keep you guessing how it's all going to end, since the big hype about the film was that it had a twist ending. Well, it was a surprise to me--but now, years later, after seeing so many films of this ilk which are obviously copycat types that deal with ghosts or the supernatural--I'm not so sure I'd be fooled so easily again.However, a surprise it was for me and it's done so cleverly that you'll want to revisit the film to see just how the trickery was managed.BRUCE WILLIS cannot quite do away with the smirk he had as the anti-hero in many a film, so I have to reserve some criticism for his performance. But it doesn't matter since the film revolves around the dark secrets and behavior of HALEY JOEL OSMENT, very good child actor who manages to keep the plot believable and interesting.Absorbing thriller, even if it starts out a little slowly and doesn't really build up its suspense in a taut way.

I kept waiting for the plot to get interesting to justify all of the acclaim and it just never happened.Solid acting, average script and a surprising ending do not make a classic, this was definitely not one of the top 5 movies of '99 (how this was nominated and not Magnolia is beyond me) and certainly not in the top 20 of all time (as IMDB voting would suggest.)",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Haley Joel Osment sees Dead People for M. Night Shyamalan,"SPOILER: Child psychologist Bruce Willis (as Malcolm Crowe) reaches a career peak when he receives the Philadelphia ""Mayor's Citation"" for professional excellence. Celebrating with beautiful young wife Olivia Williams (as Anna Crowe), Mr. Willis gets drunk, and does ""Dr. Seuss"" impressions. The happy couple retire to their bedroom, where they prepare for sex. But, after Ms. Williams begins a playful strip, mysterious sounds are heard in the bathroom. It's Willis' former boy patient, Donnie Wahlberg (as Vincent Grey), all grown up and stripped to his underwear (briefs). Obviously quite deranged, Mr. Wahlberg sobs, ""You failed me!"" and shoots both Willis and himself.The next fall, Willis has apparently recovered from his gunshot wound - but, he feels guilty about failing to help Mr. Wahlberg overcome his childhood psychosis. Willis gets the chance to help another emotionally disturbed boy, unhappy Haley Joel Osment (as Cole Sear). Young Mr. Osment reminds Willis of the man who shot him. Osment is having trouble in school, startling teachers with bloody drawings and psychic abilities. Osment is bullied by his peers, who consider him a ""freak"". His mother, Toni Collette (as Lynn Sear), is struggling to make ends meet, after a messy divorce. After a few sessions, Osment reveals his anxiety producing secret, ""I see dead people.""M. Night Shyamalan, who also wrote, does an admirable job directing this unpredictable ghost story; he, with photographer Tak Fujimoto, works storytelling wonders with the camera; even before the revelatory last act, witness how effectively the camera sets each mood. And, the ""Best Director""-nominated Mr. Shyamalan elicits wonderful performances from his cast, especially from Osment; his is one of the era's all-time best kid characterizations.

"Never has the word ""speechless"" been so apt.","That ending... Never has the word ""speechless"" been so apt.'The Sixth Sense' is a very good movie from beginning to end, but it is during that conclusion that the film becomes truly remarkable. The only word that crossed my mind when the credits rolled was ""wow"". Such a fantastic way to wrap up events, the best twists are the ones that give you all the clues but without making it obvious what's occurred - and that's exactly the case here.Up until that moment, I was simply 'only' enjoying the flick. Like, it was really, really good but I was waiting for things to move up a gear. It is quite slowly paced for the majority, which actually helps in appreciating what eventually happens to be honest. The plot is supremely well executed when all is said and done.Haley Joel Osment puts in a top quality performance, such an impressive showing. Bruce Willis is excellent as well, kinda crazy that I had seen 26 features with him in and yet somehow missed this one. Toni Collette, a barely recognisable Toni Collette, is ace too, I love Lynn and Cole's mother/son dynamic; despite all the pressing issues.Logged, at last!

I See Dead People,"It isn't often a new director rises so quickly to the top of the ""A"" list with only a handful of films. But M. Night Shyamalan does exactly that with the surprise hit, The Sixth Sense. The tale is of a popular, but egotistic doctor (Bruce Willis) who sincerely believes in his award winning psychotherapeutic abilities and looks forward to a prosperous career with the mentally ill. But failing to secure a proper treatment for a suicidal patient, the doctor finds himself with yet another troubled, but far more mysterious boy (Halley Joel Osment) who possesses the power to communicate with the afterlife. Together they discover their own fears and a need for mutual understanding and trust. The film is a frightful combination of sights, sounds and illusionary symbols which creates terror and suspense with each new scene. The Director, like other famous movie artists, makes a cameo appearance and it up to the viewer to locate him during the unfolding drama. Fancible enough to be hauntingly interesting, the film is also a masterful canvas of photographic magic. Audiences everywhere will agree, this film will become a classic for the director and it's stars. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
See it at least twice to credit you've understood it!,"A film that I saw two years ago in the local cinema in Cutral Co, Argentina, just on my birthday  was this amazing film written and directed by M Night Shyalaman, starred by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osmeid and others. Since that moment I've turned into a fan of The Sixth Sense and why not of Shyalaman's scripts.The film takes you about two hours and a half to watch, but it will take you nearly a month to understand. The Sixth Sense, which is set in Philadelphia -land of the most popular boxer on the screen ""Rocky""- is a dramatic and suspense movie with a bit of horror.Bruce Willis as Malcom Crowe and Joel Osmeid who starred Cole Sear are the main characters. They stay together and need each other during the film. The Sixth Sense is the story of a boy who can see dead people that talk to him asking for help, but Cole Sear is scared and he won't control this gift unless he lets Malcom Crowe help him with this phenomenon.I was very surprised about the ending of the film (which I'm not going to reveal!!!), because Bruce Willis gives a dramatic, emotive and unexpected way to his character, as well as Osmeid, who despite being a young actor, seemed to be an expert one.I liked the acting, but without organisation and leading this would have been nothing, which means I liked the direction too. Make-up artists and dressers made a fantastic work, also costumes helped the photography director to highlight his job in the horror scenes.I think the sound technicians made a perfect work because the music was very good and the sound fused fantasy with horror.If you like films difficult to understand, and to see them again and again and again, this one is for you: you'll have to see it at least twice to credit that you've understood this exceptional film.Marcos Istueta, 15, Cutral Co, Argentina.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
He Can See Dead People,"Young writer/director M. Night Shyamalan created a total of five different drafts before he sent his finished script to Walt Disney's Buena Vista unit. There, production manager David Vogel was so impressed that he promptly offered Shyamalan $3 million for the story. The author accepted, of course ... on the condition that he himself got to direct the movie. ""The Sixth Sense"" was on its way.Unfortunately, other Disney executives weren't nearly as enthusiastic as David Vogel about Shyamalan's intended film. On the contrary. The top brass was so angry that Vogel had carried out the deal without asking for corporal approval that he was summarily dismissed. Then they sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment. Disney themselves would only retain 12.5% of the box office takings.In the film a famous child psychologist receives a new patient whose problems far exceed his usual area of expertise. The nine-year-old boy claims that he can see dead people. When the doctor examines the kid more closely, it has unforeseen consequences for both.""The Sixth Sense"" was the first of three pictures that Bruce Willis owed the Disney Studio. The reason was that the hot-headed superstar had caused another Disney production, ""The Broadway Brawler"", to shut down in the middle of filming. The deal also meant that the actor was forced to work for a salary well below his usual asking price.The movie finished its opening weekend at number one at the box office. A position it kept for the following three weeks. In fact, of all of Buena Vista's live-action releases, ""The Sixth Sense"" was second only to the phenomenal ""Mary Poppins"" in 1964. But unfortunately, the studio did not participate financially beyond its fixed distribution percentage. The men at the top had already sold away the rights to the company's biggest hit in many years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...It's hard to believe that ""The Sixth Sense"" celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. I remember thinking to myself when I first saw it 20 years ago that it was an instant classic. And now today, it still is. I don't know what else I could possibly say that hasn't already been said about his wonderful movie after all this time and after all the reviews. Since it is indeed a well known classic film, there aren't too many who still don't know what its twist, surprise ending is. However, being as such, I wouldn't want to ruin anything for that one person out there who hasn't seen it by giving it away in just a few paragraphs.What I will say is this. There are few films like it - and few that can or will shell shock you like ""The Sixth Sense"" does. Haley Joel Osment was a find and perfectly cast as the troubled little boy who ""can see dead people"". For this movie to work, his perfomance had to be convincing. Well, not only was it convincing, it became a landmark performance that people still talk about today. The only other child actor that wowed me as much as Osment did in this one, was Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview With The Vampire"". In my personal opinion, those two performances are the single best by child actors in the history of movie making.Bruce Willis also scores here. And, of course, it all came from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan - who forever made it on to the map of special directors with this movie. I have seen it numerous times - it is very re-watchable and just as enjoyable as the first viewing. Maybe the initial surprise and shock isn't there, but I love it all the same.I highly recommend this movie. It is perfectly made. One for the ages. If for some reason, you have not yet seen this movie, and you do not know the surprise waiting for you, do not read anything else about it. Put on the popcorn, turn the lights down low and curl up on your couch - and enjoy one of the best movies to ever be shown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A thriller for those who don't like gore,"I'd be the first to tell you that I avoid thriller or any movie that even smacks of suspense. I don't handle it well and I'm not particularly fond of blood and gore. (I almost passed out when the doctor needed a blood sample.) It's not that I don't appreciate a good suspenseful movie, but current movie tend to be more than I can handle. But The Sixth Sense is a movie that kept the suspense and didn't have the gore. I was riveted from the moment it started. Bruce Willis was great as the doctor and the rest of the cast was outstanding as well. However, what makes the movie great were the writing and the direction. The story keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. I don't believe in esp or ghosts, but the writing made the concepts seem realistic and believable. There are few red herrings and the surprise at the end of the movie really was a surprise. The direction of the movie probably was the strongest point. The movie is quiet with few loud, screeching moments  like many horror movies, such as Halloween or any of the many Friday the 13th flicks  which makes it even more suspenseful.

At once touching, suspenseful, joyous, sad, and shocking, The Sixth Sense is a movie everyone should see at least once.

"Powerful and Sweet, but a little Schmaltzy in places","This movie has been out for six years. Although this appears to be a story about the supernatural, it is really about our hopes that we never are completely separated from those who love, or loved us.After a traumatic evening with a man breaking into their house, our Hero's life goes into a tailspin. He cannot seem to connect with his new patient, a young boy with similar symptoms to one he could not treat. His wife is distant and uncommunicative. He often has difficulty keeping track of time. And on top of all this, the patient claims to be able to see dead people. Sure, here's an easy case to solve in a stress filled life.This often has parallels to our own lives, as those who love us come closer and farther in a gentle, undulating wave. But we are not prepared for the separation that no amount of work can undo. It is this poignancy that the movie captures so expertly. Granted, it is couched in supernatural terms, but the lessons for us mere mortals should be clear.The soundtrack is superb. James Newton Howard has made several mediocre movies quite bearable, and here he makes a good film into an excellent one. The track is truly one of the important characters in the film, and does its job by staying in the background without interference.There are some moments of startling horror.

﻿trying to redeem a past mistake,"﻿Malcolm Crowe is a child psychiatrist who, at the beginning of the film, has just been awarded a citation for professional excellence by the city of Philadelphia.  When a former patient, Vincent, breaks into the house, he learns that his excellent work has not done all the good that he'd hoped, in fact his promise to a young patient that everything would work out alright, has not come true, and results in the young man's suicide.  He tries to make sure this will never happen with another patient.Later that fall, he finds Cole, a boy who is suffering from the same symptoms as Vincent.  Cole spends his free time playing in a church, so the ghosts won't frighten him.  As Malcolm studies the case further, he finds connections between the two boys, and figures that by helping Cole deal with his problems, surely stemming from his father's abandonment, he can redeem himself from his failure with Vincent.Eventually he figures that Cole is telling the truth, that he can see beyond what is apparent in this world.  It is by allowing him to face his fears, and use the gift he's been given to help the departed rest in peace and comfort those still living, that he can himself live without fear.  He doesn't need to hide in either a church or a tent in his bedroom filled with religious statues.Malcolm didn't think that something glibly promised in a session with Vincent would come to such a drastic conclusion.  He didn't think that Cole could actually see dead people, and was suffering from severe pathology and school-age schizophrenia.  He didn't think there was any realm beyond the five senses.  He wasn't counting on a little boy, like a boy he had counseled years earlier, had a sixth sense that enabled a person to see beyond what is normally perceived, to the world of souls who had not realized that their bodies had died when they had work still to do.Likewise, I didn't think that the movie would have such a startling conclusion.  I hadn't seen it coming, and had trusted that what I'd seen naturally led to the conclusion of Malcolm's restored marriage, since he'd alienated his wife by being obsessed with Cole's case, and find faith in himself, that he was a good doctor who could heal children's troubled minds and really deserved an award for excellence.  Without that ending, it would've been a good movie.  With it, it was a great movie.  If the mind can be tricked in this way, within the span of two hours, it might also be tricked about preconceived ideas about what happens after death, to consider the existence of spirits lost on their way to the afterlife.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Despite all the talent involved, this is Osment's film.","Despite this still being the best film thus far from M. Night Shyamalan and perhaps Bruce Willis' best performance and one of the great child performances of all time from Haley Joel Osment, 25 years later this doesn't hold up as well as one would hope. It's still an entertaining film about a little boy who claims to see dead people and the doctor trying to help him with this psychosis, but there are so many scenes in the film that aren't terribly logical all due to the now famous twist ending. None of these illogical moments were terribly noticeable when seeing this initially as it is cleverly directed for a first time viewing. Toni Collette plays Osment's mother and she plays it well especially in a car scene near the end. And speaking of the end, the very final scene is ridiculously mushy. I don't know what I thought about it 25 years ago, but it's awful. This was a sensation in its day. It's still spooky and I still enjoyed it.

This seminal horror picture is one of the best in the last twenty years.,"When people talk about this seminal horror picture, they often tend to focus on and overstate the importance of the famous final plot twist which, while a fantastic reveal in its own right, isn't the only or even main reason why the feature has remained such a cultural touchstone and is often remembered as being one of the very best examples of the genre. Instead, the ominous sense of mystery created by the relatively slow and self-assured pacing; the mature and well-crafted scares stemming solely from our connection to the nuanced characters as opposed to obnoxiously loud musical cues; the layered and intelligent screenplay that dares to assume its audience is smart enough to understand what it is presenting; and the phenomenal performances that cement 'The Sixth Sense (1999)' as existing within a grounded reality - including what is arguably the best child performance ever put to film - are what make this emotional, gripping and complex drama stand out as one of the best horror films of the last twenty years. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

An epic start to M. Night Shyamalan's career in filmmaking!,"After I saw some of Shyamalan films except ""The Village"", ""The Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" three films in which I have yet to see even though they got mixed to negative reviews, I looked past at his very first film that started his film career known as ""The Sixth Sense"", a tale about a child psychologist who receives an award on the same night that he is visited by a very unhappy ex-patient. After this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with the same ills as the ex-patient. When it happened, the boy named Cole starts to see dead people and Crowe spends a lot of time with him while Cole's mother plans with his increasing problems and it's up to Crowe to cure him since he is his only hope.When I saw the entire thing, I was really creep-ed out by it and I realized that M. Night Shyamalan had created such a compelling film it became an epic start to his career in filmmaking history which is why I'm giving this an 100% rating. The story is well-written with a nice ending twist and has some brilliant atmospheric moments that would not only haunt you, but creep you out in the process. The music from James Newton Howard is great and fits really well for the emotional scenes in the film along with M. Night Shyamalan's solid directing which has a lot of focus with the tone of the movie. The pacing is brisk and it has some great character development especially the chemistry between Crowe and Cole. In fact, the acting is excellent. Bruce Willis did wonderful, Haley Jole Osment did such a compelling job as a frightened 10-year old, Toni Colette did fine as the boy's mother and Olivia Williams did great as Malcolm's wife.Overall, The Sixth Sense is a classic and it has been a long time since the quote ""I see dead people"" became so popular since the film's release at the late 90s. My advice to those who have not seen the movie: go watch it before Halloween starts. It is that good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Last masterpiece of the 20th century,"This movie really shows, that today's movies don't have to be mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted. Instead it shows, that good film-making also can be achieved by stuff, producers normally would go mad about - such a movie as ""The 6th Sense"". With no big publicity at all (at least here in Germany) this film started in December last year and went straight to #1, leaving ""block busters"" as Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"" etc. far, far behind. The story is awesome - M. Night Shyamalan did a great job and the way HOW he tells the story and brings it to the audience reminded me of the perfection of Alfred Hitchcock; even when Cole and Doctor Crowe stand in front of a door with a knob, you just see Cole being mirrored in the metallic surface, although Crowe stands right by his side. And when the plot reveals that Dr. Crowe actually died right at the beginning of the movie and you resume Cole's words of ""I see dead people..."" it makes you shivering although the movie ended - and the impact is even bigger while watching the movie a second time. Its ""silent"" horror combined with a tragic story of both Malcolm and Cole and Willis' and Osment's overwhelming acting makes this film a real masterpiece. Not honored by the Academy at all, it just shows that the movie is too good for the Oscars - it is just not mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted, and with all these points it's no real film for the Academy; normally I see Oscars in important categories as a warning that the film is bad, and once again I have been encouraged to keep this another year; last time it was this lame mainstreamer ""Titanic"" and this time we had ""American Beauty"". Poor Academy! Maybe next time. For me the winner of the Oscar for at least ""Best Film"" and ""Best Supporting Actor"" is ""The 6th Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"A very good, and well told story.","The most arresting aspect of this movie for me was the portrayal of the troubled little boy.  The methods he devised of dealing with his apparent ability to ""see dead people"" (i.e. the ""sixth sense"") and his heartwrenching difficulties with his mother, classmates, and the troubled spirits themselves are excellently portrayed and presented.  He is an unusually good actor, particularly for one so young.Bruce Willis is quite good in his role of the Child Psychologist attempting to help the ostensibly delusional and psychotic child.  The spooky effects are good, and not overdone with gore or crude bloodshed.  In fact, the movie really makes one think about the proximity of the ""spirit world""- especially on a dark night when alone.Many viewers who have offered comments here have seen the movie more than once.  I think I will too.  It is an entertaining, well thought out, well performed and expertly and effectively shot film.Rent it next Halloween!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Overall, it was great!","When I first learned what the film ""The Sixth Sense"" was about, I did not want to see it.  I thought it was a horror film, and horror is not my cup of tea.  However, when I began reading reviews about it, I began to reconsider and finally got the courage to see it.  It was a good thing I did, for ""The Sixth Sense"" is really a fine film.Since everyone by now knows about the film, I will not go into much detail about the plot.  Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who was a great success -- with all but one former patient who later accused him of having failed the patient.  The former patient then shoots Crowe and kills himself.  The sense of failure devastates Crowe and strains his marriage.  So, Crowe decides to help Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, a boy who reminds him of the former patient.  But Crowe gets more than he bargained for.  Abnormal sychology is little help in this matter, and eventually Crowe must abandon his preconceptions in order to help Cole -- and eventually himself.The film is great.  True, it may seem slow to some, but it's simply taking its time to create the proper atmosphere.The actors are what make the film great.  Olivia Williams, as Crowe's wife, does a fine job with what she has.  Toni Collette also does a fine job as Cole's mother, who truly loves her son but does not know what's wrong with him.  Her love is why Cole can't confide in her until the end.  Since I never saw the ""Die Hard"" films, I don't have any preconceptions of Willis as an actor, so I thought he was just fine as Crowe.  His performance was understated, and by the end of the film, you see why it was that way.  And it was a pleasant surprise to see Shakespearean actor Greg Wood as the father of the poisoned girl.  (I'm a Shakespeare nut.)But the best performance has to come from Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He was terrific!  That was probably the main reason why the movie was as unnerving and as great as it was.  He really made me feel Cole's terror whenever the ghosts appeared.  He stole the show, and indeed it was best he stole the show, as the movie would've suffered without his acting ability.  I hope he wins the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as I believe he truly deserves it.One final note:  the ending is really great!  It explains a lot that might have been confusing to some.So, I suggest you see ""The Sixth Sense"", even if you have to rent it on video or buy a DVD to do so.  It is really a great film, as its six Oscar nominations indicate.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Knowing there is a twist is knowing too much,"Okay, so you're in the reviews section of IMDb, so that means that you are a bit of a film buff, so by this time, even if you haven't seen the movie, you have already read somewhere that there is a huge twist at the end, so I'm not spoiling it to you by telling you ""there is a twist"", am I?Well, the trouble is, I am. European audiences have heard about the success of this movie in the States, and have heard about there being a twist, so most of us see it expecting it to come. And if you expect it, it is really quite obvious and easy to figure out long before it happens, there are many hints (put there so that everything makes sense at the end, of course). And it's not even such an original idea, we've seen similar things in other famous movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away too much). The whole movie relies very much on this final revelation, and until it comes, it just doesn't have anything consistent to say, there is never any real feeling of menace, which surely is the worst that can happen to a horror film(I do think, though, that the performances are quite decent, especially Osment's, given the difficulty of his role. But the pace could certainly be better). So if you see it without being surprised by the ending, the whole thing doesn't seem so impressive. A bit empty really. OK, but nothing extraordinary.

Perfectly benign fare to pass a dull afternoon, and I think devotees of Willis will get their fill. There's less plausibility in the other characters and the screenplay seems to reflect this in the way the pair seem estranged from the rest of the world somehow.

"I'd rather watch ""The Shining"" over...","A surprise hit of the year, and completely undeserving attention at that. The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional ""gloomy suspense"" music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called ""surprise ending"" which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

My First 'Discovered' Director,"Obviously, there is no way for me to be objective about a film that was a part of my awakening as a cinephile, but it wasn't just a subjective emotion that made this film attractive to a young audience member like myself.The acting in the film is top notch. Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette (Hereditary) both received best performance nominations at the Academy awards and both deserved them. Even Bruce Willis, in a very reserved role, pondering and silently observing, does a remarkably good job bringing a sense of the character's reality to the screen.Although the cast is small and upon re-watching, the film feels anemic at times, it is only when you know the story and are watching for it that you sense that we aren't seeing reality all of the time. I place the credit for that feat on the actors for creating expressions of these characters that would not allow you to think of them as anything except real people who were captivatingly interesting.The Storytelling is, of course, unique, or it was. Today, people may make jokes about the 'Shyamalan Twist' but at the time, it was a shock to end the film with a scene that made you rethink everything that had happened in the whole movie. To set everything into the story so carefully and precisely that people didn't see it coming was a feat, but to do it in such a way that you watch it a second time and think 'How did I not know?

Filmaking at it's finest...,"Movies this day and age are often hard pressed to be creative and original, seeing as (for the most part) everyone has dragged through the same stories and concepts before. Same plot. Different characters. Varied acting abilities. A new twist maybe, but essentially the same thing.That's why this delightful little thriller is so fantastic.Just when you thought classic movie-making was over, M. Night Shyamalan comes in and proves all of us wrong. Movies still *can* be original. Movies *can* draw a crowd without writers throwing in graphic sex scenes, pointless nudity, gut-wrenching gore and everything else that draws a crowd these days.Here we're given something far better: Feeling.Every emotion in you is squeezed out to the surface.

Iconic scary flick,"Is there anyone who hasn't seen M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece The Sixth Sense by now?

It's not the most upsetting movie I've seen, but it was at that point in my life.Young Haley Joel Osment, endearing himself into the hearts of every audience member around the world, is having a problem. He's struggling against the normal childhood bullies and getting along with his single mom, Toni Collette, but he also sees dead people. Sometimes they just scare the pants off him with their wounds, and sometimes they talk to him. Child psychologist Bruce Willis tries to help Haley through this difficult time, and the two bond. Since this movie is obviously a vehicle for Haley's incredible acting chops-although, you have to wonder why his parents let him act in such emotionally damaging roles-it's quite a feat that Bruce is able to shine as well. In the immortal scene when Haley tells him, ""I see dead people,"" both actors show off their chops. It's not just Haley's scene, because Bruce has to react to him with understanding, compassion, and trust.If you can handle it, this movie really is a classic that needs to be watched. I couldn't handle it, so I say to my fellow squeamish viewers, if you don't like the sight of blood, you're not going to like this movie.

Spine-Tingling,"""I see dead people""M. Night Shyamalan's first and most successful hour of his cinematic career was The Sixth Sense. A film that accomplishes, if nothing else, pure spookiness. Take any child, and give them supernatural abilities, and you've got a damn good recipe of freaking people out. Haley Joel Osment was an exceptionally great, mature actor for his age, which is what made this role even better. He compliments well with a quiet and calculative Bruce Willis. It's a fascinating story worthy of a Twilight Zone episode. But I don't believe that this is the best film of Shyamalan's catalogue. On more than one occasion during the span of the film, I noticed some of the dreaded trips of Shyamalan films that proved to be problematic later on in his career. I know, some of you out there love this movie, but go back and look closely. They are all still there. The ""twist"" of this film, suffice to say has been spoiled for me years ago.

One of the smartest horror/thriller films,"Sixth Sense gives that uncomfortable feeling that no one likes to get when watching horror flicks. You start sweating and and heart races kind of fast, and your head goes crazy and you don't know what to think. That's what I was going through when I first watched this. Well you might think my actions are a bit over dramatic, but I was only eight. The Sixth Sense is not a stupid horror film. It's smart, moves along well, and it's not going to disappoint. The acting is acceptable and the directing and the feel of the film just makes you feel like you're there with the boy, facing his fears, and feeling what's going through his innocent and limited mind. Bruce Willis is very good in it, and he's a great character, being a psychiatrist for kids. You'd never guess he was John McClane. This film is a revolution to horror scenarios. This horror film doesn't depend on images to scare you, like The Exorcist, and it doesn't fully work with you mentally like The Silence of the Lambs to scare you out, but rather it uses something different.

Definitely Watch This At Least Twice,"I find this a very difficult movie to review, because everything in it is so tied to the surprise ending that to say anything at all about the story is virtually to give everything away. Believe me, though, that you have to watch this twice to really appreciate it. The first time I watched it I found certain elements of the story to be so confusing that they were distracting. I also noticed a number of plot inconsistencies that bothered me. In the light of the movie's ending, most of it makes sense (although a few plot inconsistencies are actually created by the ending.) In any event, I found ""the Sixth Sense"" to be far more enjoyable the second time than the first. Without giving the whole thing away, what can I say about this?The performances are very strong. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist seeking to help young Cole Sear with his visions of dead people. Sear, of course, was played by Haley Joel Osment. Osment put on an astonishingly good performance, and was well deserving of the Oscar he won as Best Supporting Actor. Also offering a strong performance in a supporting role was Toni Collette, who played Cole's mother Lynn, struggling to make sense of Cole's behaviour.On the down side, I found much of the dialogue in the movie was offered in rather hushed tones which sometimes made it difficult to follow what was happening.

"Manipulation of Fears ""Par Excellence""","Little Cole Sear (Halley Joel Osment) is a child that seems apart from the current world, called ""a freak"" by his companions and always distracted and reluctant to connect to the others. Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) intends to help him in order to redeem himself from a bad past experience. But as Dr. Crowe deepens into the interior of Cole, he will uncover his most profound and frightening secret.At the moment it starts, Shyamalan jolts with an uncanny music, formed by the precise scratching of superb violins. All throughout the movie the music will be vibrating, exhilarating, electrifying and yet oddly repulsive and leaving a sense of dismay and creepiness. Counting on lofty performances, emotional and groundbreaking by Halley Joel Osment, Toni Collete and star Bruce Willis, Shyamalan will clear it's field to proceed with his cunning game of manipulating the fear of the viewer. He will show you simple things, he will input the terror on ordinary stuff and common and daily elements: he will terrorize you with the using of a tape- recorder to hear whispers, he will play smartly with the shadows, mirrors, claustrophobic spaces to gasp the audience, and the use of an eerie wind always blowing to give the sense of distance and cold. He will give you a little space to start, then the fear will start erupting inside your mind.The photography by Tak Fujimoto is intense and subtle, never approaching with direct focus but with transversal, lateral imposing lens and toying softly with the use of reflections, rolling cameras and visuals in odd places that give the film superb aesthetics. Overall, the technical aspects contribute on leaving on the viewer a feeling of dread and restlessness, awkwardness.Shyamalan is genius at creating this suspense, avoiding blood and imposing a sly fear. That is why he became so popular.He also delivers a lot of psychological substance, a lot of profound lines of thinking. Joel's Osment relationship with his father is portrayed with great touches, like the glasses with no crystals and the watch not working he received from him. The Indian Director also exposes his viewings on explaining a story within his sublime script. At one point Malcolm tries to tell Cole a story: -You never told a story before right? You have to add some twists and stuff.Well prepare, because it is highly auto-referential. The script also brings forth bewitching descriptions of fear ""like falling down inside but you are standing still"". And then prepare for the twist. It will shake you to the ground and burn all of your movie principles. It is the Twist, what made the movie genius and so iconic.""Sixth Sense"" is a cinematic bulwark, standing on an eternal and sublime direction. Its ending is emotional, and touching. This, in order to make contrast to the excellent creation of suspense and fear that bulges through the movie. Masterful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
M. Night Shyamalan at his Best,"This movie was incredible. The visual effects, ghostly images, and soundtrack were some of the best I've seen in a while.Bruce Willis is, well, Incredible.Most child actors are struggling to even comprehend the plot, let alone to put forth a believable performance. But the child actor in this film was incredibly mature and feasible. The writing for this movie is some of the best, and M. Night Shyamalan really showcased his storytelling abilities with this one. The twist comes out of nowhere and hits you like a train, but in a good way.This is the first movie in a long while that I wish I could unwatch for the express purpose of experiencing the magic again.Now if only M. Night could do another one of these turkeys instead of the Last Airbender.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Intriguing and original,"I am not the biggest fan of ""The Sixth Sense"" and don't believe it deserved quite as much word of mouth as it received, but I can't completely discredit the film.  It is well-done and quite intriguing.  I recently bought the DVD, since it was used and I purchased it for a cheap price.  Plus, I was curious about how it would feel watching it for a second time.  I watched it in theaters and thought it was pretty good, but like many others I wanted to see it again to try to uncover clues I didn't perceive the first time around and discover certain elements that I may have overlooked.  I still don't think it's a great movie, but it was interesting watching it and keeping in mind the big plot twist at the end.  As I watched it, the twist made a lot of sense and M. Night Shamalyan didn't just sneak it in for shock value.  He obviously put a lot of thought into both creating this big surprise and making it credible.  When I accessed the ""Rules and Clues"" feature on the DVD, that confirmed my theories and exposed a few details that I didn't even notice on the second viewing.The acting is good all-around.  Bruce Willis gives, probably, his most low-key performance up-to-date.  He is both compelling and convincing, not getting in the audience's face with a showy dramatic performance.  Haley Joel Osment was the perfect choice for Cole, and I don't think the phrase, ""I see dead people,"" would be the same coming out of any other child actor's mouth.  A good child actor is hard to find, and Haley Joel is one of the few who I can actually say measures up to a good deal of adult actors.  He's not ""good for a little kid""; he's just a good actor period.  His Oscar nomination was well-deserved.  His acting is very subtle, not broad in any way.  Toni Collette also deserved her Oscar nomination.  I don't live in Philadelphia, so I can't technically judge whether or not her accent was ""on target,"" but I know for sure that she pulled off a flawless American accent. And she went the extra mile by taking on a dialect.  Just like Osment, her acting is very subtle and you sense the pain and anguish she feels as a single mother of this estranged kid without her having to continuously sob and burst into tears.  Actors should know that you don't need to cry to express sadness.  9 times out of 10, people try their best to hold back the tears--at least when they're in public or in front of other people.  Donnie Wahlberg makes a short but memorable appearance as one of Willis's former patients, and actually plays an important role in the story as you will learn.What I didn't like about ""The Sixth Sense""?  Altogether, it's slow-moving and surely could've used some editing.  And some of the dialogue is corny and stilted.  I wouldn't classify this as a ""scary movie.""  Some have deemed this as one of the scariest movies of all time.  To that I say ""Hell no.""  I think of it more as a sci-fi/mystery.  It's not always entertaining, but it's intriguing and gives your brain a lot of work.If you decide to rent or purchase the DVD, another fun feature to check out is Shamalyan's (very very) first movie--as in he was 12 years old and shot it with his own video camera.  They only show a clip from the movie and, as he said, it's awful--but it's always fun to watch famous or up-and-coming directors' work back when they were starting amateurs.  Like he says, if you watch this crappy movie, you will understand why Shamalyan doesn't do special f/x.  I gotta admire the guy.  If I were releasing one of my films on DVD (in the far future) I wouldn't show my first movie--a crappy ""X Files"" film that I shot back in junior year of high school as a project for my TV Production class.  That really takes guts.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Perfection through gentle simplicity,"M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense had every hallmark of a modern classic when it rolled triumphantly over the world's cinema screens in 1999, and it still does today over twenty years later. The basis for the success is Shyamalan's hauntingly beautiful script, which not only belongs to an ancient ghost-story tradition, but is some sort of cinematic epitome of it. Stylistically, the film is quiet and understated. Shyamalan has so much confidence in his own and his actors' abilities that he never gets tempted into overdoing it. Instead, the film achieves perfection through gentle simplicity. Whenever there's an opportunity for emblematic genre-solutions, Shyamalan resists it and lets his subtle innuendos carry through. And whenever the film's drama and suspense rests on our affinity and empathy with main character Cole Sear, little Haley Joel Osment not only repays Shyamalan's faith in him; he imposes his talent and humanity upon us with such significance that it will probably never be eclipsed in a part like this. Osment even lifts Bruce Willis and Toni Collette to career-best performances. And as the young writer/director Shyamalan wrapped up his picture with a masterfully elegant ending, he must have known that he had just created something that would be comparable with Hitchcock's best works for decades if not centuries.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Ending ruined, therefore not much to enjoy","Since I just saw this movie but knew the outcome, it was probably not as much fun as the opening weekend audience experienced.  I am willing to admit that that might have taken away from the whole thing. But I still don't think its a very good movie.  The whole thing with the color red seems very cheap and obvious.The best scene was the 'communication' scene between Osment and Collette in the car.  I could have used that scene a lot earlier, though.   Both actors were very good and deserved their nominations, but I am not so sure about the other nominations.

The movie was broad casted on a television channel, and I started watching it with my family. It is really joyful experience when you watch a movie with your family, the shrieks, the laughs etc make you more involved. And that day while watching the movie my family was all silent, they were thinking inside, they were so involved that their eyes were not blinking but were filled with all sorts of emotions.

One of those movies you can never see the same way again,"The Sixth Sense is directed by M. Night Shayamalan and was released in one of the greatest years for movies ever, 1999. This movie took so many people by surprise, especially being the director's first film.I literally tried to find a flaw with the movie and I'm usually very picky with these things, but I just couldn't find anything wrong with the Sixth Sense. It's a beautifully shot, surprisingly expertly directed movie that is a blend of horror, mystery and suspense. I remember the first time I saw the Sixth Sense, I was terrified. I still find it very scary and even though I know exactly how everything is gonna play out, it's still very suspenseful. The acting is terrific by pretty much everyone, but I have to give a special mention to Harley Joel Osmont, giving what is probably the greatest performance ever by a child actor.Much like another one of my favorite movies that came out in 1999, Fight Club, the Sixth Sense is simply a movie you never see the same after the first viewing. Is this a positive? Absolutely. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies of all time.

I think the surprise ending hurts the overall greatness of the film,"I saw this film months ago when it first came out, and I never stopped thinking about it. It is the only film of this year that deserved to make a lot of money (The Matrix and The Phantom Menace disappointed me terribly). It is unlike the rest of the movies Hollywood throws out. Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star). I wouldn't even be offended if Willis got a nom, seeing that this is his best film besides maybe 12 Monkeys and Pulp Fiction.Now for the ending that I mentioned in my summary. Most people will know about it this late in the game, but I won't tell. I think it pulls attention away from the true greatness of the film, which is the characters. It is what we were talking about after we left the theater, and I'm disappointed at myself for doing so. Sure it was neat, but I have gone through it in my mind several times, finding flaws within the film. Surprise endings are almost always detractors. If you remember a film just because of its surprise ending, it is a worthless film, just like The Usual Suspects, a very bad film if anyone would actually think about something besides the ending.overall 8/10, being a 9 originally, but losing 1 point for its supposed hook.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best physiologically films to date,"Bruce Willis (Die Hard) stars as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man with a good working history, until one night an ex patient causes havoc, and Malcolm seeks to put his career and life back on track by helping a young boy come over his fear of seeing ghosts.Nominated for 6 Oscars including Best Picture, The Sixth Sense delivers a chilling and dramatic tale of life, going through the difficult and the joyous turns of life, which is justified through some strong performances, exquisite writing and stunning direction.Willis gives one of the strongest performances of his career as the psychologist, with exquisite quietness and humbleness to the character, which is only second to Haley Osment' s Oscar nominated role as Cole, one of the best young performances of all time.Osment delivers a chilling performance as the bullied boy who sees dead people, which has turned into a landmark in the horror genre. His likable character goes through typical stages of life, including self doubt, imagination and conflict, a true justification of the young mind, with an amazing shocking twist to match, in that he sees the dead, which provides twists and turns in a highly dramatic plot.The writing is exceptional, with the right amount of realism to reflect the drama of situations, and the use of seeing the dead goes a long way to build up to a stunning and gripping finale, one which will make you question the entire plot and watch it again straight away. The open ending leads to many questions and when watching it again, you may question certain aspects.The drama is pitched spectacularly well by the actors and deserves praise, particularly Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) and Osment.Having the use of real life scenarios including parent and child relationships juxtaposed with fantastic ideologies such as seeing ghosts creates a world of possibilities, and Collette and Osment have some great on screen moments together, perfect realism and perfect fantasy, and one scene will have you in tears.Shyamalan's Oscar nominated direction helps achieve the right mood, being chilling and yet realistic in its own context.Not particularly jump behind the sofa scary, more physiologically scary, and plays on your mind for a while after watching, which makes a true horror classic",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Malcom Crowe is a trained psychologist who deal with kids with psychological issues,"Sixth Sense Malcom Crowe is a trained psychologist who deal with kids with psychological issues. Malcom Crowe was awarded by the city for his enormous contribution in the lives of broken home kids with psychological problems. The same night Malcom received his award, an ex-patient Vincent who claimed that Malcom Crowe did not help him entered Malcom Crowe's home and then shot him. Because of this incident Malcom Crowe took it upon himself to help Cole Sear who happened to have similar problems as Vincent. Cole believed that Malcom was the only one who could help him.The theme of the film ""Sixth Sense"" is that people have the will to correct their mistakes even after their death. In the film, Malcom was shot dead by Vincent mainly because he could not help Vincent to solve his psychological problems and this made Malcom Crowe to make a committed decision to help Cole a nine year old boy whose psychological problem was increasing. Malcom felt like a second chance was given to him to finish his uncompleted work and so when he got that chance he stayed focused to help Cole Sears. As human beings we often do mistakes that contribute to our downfall but in our struggle we fight our way back to try to correct those mistakes. When people have the opportunity to correct mistakes, they do all what they can to make sure that they get it right. As it was demonstrated by Malcom Crowe, he was able to help Cole to come out of his psychological problem.The lighting in the film Sixth sense is mostly Low-Key lighting and somewhat dark. The lighting does not look bright and that indicates sadness or that something terrible is about to happen. Taking a close look at the opening scene, at the basement where Anna Crowe the wife of Malcom Crowe was picking up a wine from the shelf, it was dark and that presuppose that something terrible was about to happen. Lo and behold, Malcom Crowe was shot by Vincent shortly after they entered their bedroom.Sixth Sense film's camera movement was very extraordinary in the sense that shot were taking close to the characters. These shots illustrates the characters emotions. The shot taking at the scene where Cole Sears was talking to Malcom Crowe while he was in bed, shows that he was crying and timid and that is the best form of him expressing his emotions.Sixth Sense is an incredible film. It touches the bases of the effect of broken home, Doctors commitment to help kids with psychological problems and the treatment giving to kids with psychological problems at school. I think broken home parents should be committed to do their best to help kids with psychological problems and also schools should make sure that kids with psychological issues are protected by so doing past mistakes will be corrected.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Back-to-Basics Spook Film That Proves You CAN Scare Without Computers...,"THE SIXTH SENSE is a refreshing and absorbing ghost story that is much more than meets the eye.  It is great to see a major Hollywood release go back to old school fright methods.  Do not expect to see thrill-a-minute, falsely produced chills.  This is a truly original piece of atmospheric filmmaking that earns the viewer's responses, which include frequent oohs and aahs and an occasional scream.Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan, a Philly native, presents a plodding build-up to one of the best payoffs I have seen in a thriller in the past few years.  Seeing the film, I knew the young boy (played incredibly by Haley Joel Osment) has a ""gift"" and sees certain people walking around no one else can see.  Shyamalan seems to have taken a page out of Spielberg's JAWS, where the shark is never fully seen until crucial climactic scenes, and applied it to the boy's problem.  It is most definitely a problem if you are interacting with people who supposedly no longer walk the earth.  You may be unsure as to what he really is seeing until the great frights and charms of the picture hit you.  You know when Shyamalan means for us to get it and become involved.Bruce Willis is so reserved it is scary in itself and he plays off the boy very effectively.   SIXTH SENSE takes place on some other plane of existence it seems.   That is how I felt.  Sometimes you wonder whether people are seeing the main characters, who are all, in varying ways, mixed up in this whirlwind of terrifying sights and dimensions.  It is not manipulative and the scares do not need manufacturing.  We are led through them as a good script should put an audience through.Toni Collette has picked up a good South Philadelphia accent and is simply flabbergasted as to what the hell is going on with her seemingly gifted, yet sick, young son.  Osment as ""Cole"", the boy star of the film outshines even Willis and shows he is capable of playing a character deeper than Forrest Gump Jr. (yep, that's him).  There is a lot of religious reference to afterlife which is fitting and the so-called ""twist"" is indeed a twist to remember.All involved in this surprising production should be proud of the fact that you can still keep an audience in traction with moody story-telling and visuals and NO computer-generated effects.

""" I see a great movie""","I wasn't much keen on seeing this movie until one day it came on the television and I felt extremely delighted to have switched to that channel than watching the usual trash. THe thing that manly clicked about this movie was the smoothness at which the director/writer Mr. Shyamalan tells his story in just about 2 hours, which is well paced yet not too fast, unlike some movies that are very well made, but extended too much even after you feel that the story should have got over.I was utterly shocked during the end of this movie when I watched it the first time as I never thought of such a thing as most of the Bollywood movies are not thriller and very few of them have a mastermind of a writer like Shyamalan to have such a mind- boggling ending. That's probably one of the reason that he was presented the Padma Shree or Padma Bhushan award in India. I haven't seen his other films except for the Village which too was good but after this movie, I feel that he has rightfully been handed this award, unlike some people in India who expressed their displeasure when he was given this award. The reason why they felt it was unfair was because they had not seen this magnificent masterpiece.I was glad to know that it was a small budget film and did not contain exorbitant furniture or other accessories just to advertise the products or even a huge haunted mansion that would have made this a typical horror flick. This movie haunted me from within, than scaring me from outside or making me sick by showing people cutting other peoples' flesh etc. It was a wonderful psychological thriller with no fancy items to show how expensive the movie is.This movie had some of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history, like the sick girl's story and the iconic climax. It also had one of the best performances given by the actors. I would especially like to mention the little kid who acted so well that I was completely in amazement that he did this at the age of eleven. Bruce Willis too has done a commendable job and I thought that he would be worthy enough to get at least an Oscar nomination, which he didn't. The kid's mother too has done a very good job, especially in the emotional sequences but I felt that her make up was overdone and it made her look like an evil character.I think I'll sum it up by saying that this is one of the best thrillers I have watched.

"""I see dead people.""","When this movie came out, it garnered a huge amount of hype and acclaim, and I regarded this film as something of a masterpiece. It represented a type of quality filmmaking and storytelling that only men like Hitchcock seemed to master. It was one of the few films that initially established M. Night Shyamalan as a promising director of quality substance (a reputation that would only last for his next two films, Unbreakable and Signs; the rest of his work became arguably weaker and weaker, until reaching rock bottom with The Last Airbender).The story is pretty evenly-paced, but it is a slow-moving one. There's not a whole lot of conflict involved with this, but it's built pretty sturdily on the occasional paranormal fright scene and plenty of mystery.What really matters here is the story, and it is perfectly constructed. It's most famous for its twist ending, but it's not just an arbitrary narrative trick; in this case, the whole movie was built around that twist, so that it holds up on multiple viewings and gives new meaning every time. With quality characters that you can actually care for, and some strong themes concerning people and their gifts, the rest of the story stands strongly on its own and has plenty of insight.This film is immortalized with solid photography and editing. Acting is extremely delicate and subtle, with great nuanced performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. Writing shows some penchant for a little too much exposition (a standard complaint for most of Shyamalan's work, and it really only shows when compared to his later features), but is otherwise very good. This production doesn't have anything lavish, but it makes good use of its utilitarian sets, props, and costumes. Music is nice.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An inspiring thriller full of plot twists...brilliant.,"The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies. Everything about it was amazing-the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the effects. I have been writing many short ""horror stories"" for a long, long time. This movie inspired me to keep writing and to use its plot and characters as role models. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were astounding, believable, and as I said before, brilliant. Though it didn't have numerous action sequences, the plots many twists and occurrences were perfectly done (not dramatized and/or overly exaggerated.)The biggest twist in the plot (I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it) wasn't obvious at all, but supported by other details in the movie that led up to it. All in all, I loved this movie and could watch it over and over again without getting tired of it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
It's a good movie to start watching horror movies,"This movie was so good! I remember when I was 12 years old seeing this movie, i really joined it. It's a very good psychological horror movie that gives a very special story and a creepy atmosphere. I recommend it very much. It's one of the most best PG-13 horror movies that i have seen! But i think that some people may find it very but VERY scary or even traumatized some others people, so i think that this movie gives you a shocked feeling at the ending because you were not expecting that.

Ghostly deja vu,"I do agree this is a good film, with good acting, direction, photography and script.  However, anybody who's familiar with the 1962 cult film Carnival Of Souls will immediately pick up on what's going on with The Sixth Sense story.  I knew what was coming after the first half hour of the movie.  But nevertheless, I enjoyed the film because it manages to be intelligent and compassionate while at the same time giving us a few good scares, without recurring to cheap shocks.  I recommend it, and after you see it, check out Carnival Of Souls, and you'll be equally pleasantly surprised.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

FilmCreature Reviews 'The Sixth Sense',"M. Night Shymalan actually makes a good movie with this supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis as a child therapist assigned to a boy with an amazing gift. Haley Joel Osment is awesome as Cole Sear, the little boy who can see dead people.Cole's visions are disturbing, but the film is not scary or suspenseful. What gives it the edge and my thumbs up are the fantastic performances. Osment and Toni Collette are both Oscar material.

"A perfect, gentle ghost movie.","Like many suspense thrillers, but for reasons other than the usual, please try to see or hear as little about this movie as you can before seeing it. It's certainly not all surprises, it's much better than that, but why spoil those that are there?  This movie is so wonderfully restrained and subtle. Dialogue is unobvious and genuine.  The most interesting thing about this for me was that I left the film not thinking only ""What a great ghost story flick."", but also ""What a nice relationship movie!""  In fact that's what stayed with me, which is not what one usually expects from such a film. Early in the movie there appears trouble for the relationship between Bruce Willis's character and that of his wife, a thing which annoyed me, because as subplots, these things usually detract and end badly or through cliche. Not so here.  Everything works in this movie.  Everything.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Well, this has better acting, from the disturbed kid & even Bruce Willis, whose cockiness in past movies & his TV shows has annoyed me to no end.  Glad to see him restrained for the part.  But the ending will not be such a shocker - you do see it coming!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Sixth Sense was a great psychological thriller if you like seeing dead people!,"The sixth sense is about a single mother, Lynn Sear, played by Toni Collette and her son Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Lynn's son Cole sees dead people. The dead people scares Cole, so his mother Lynn takes him to see a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who is played by Bruce Willis. Cole, being scared to death, his mother, Lynn, felt helpless. Maybe Malcolm can help him get through the emotional trauma that seeing dead people are causing him.
There are a couple of themes in the movie, but the biggest one is facing your fears and, in a strong second, is mortality. Cole had to face his fears in the movie. Lynn, at all costs, is going to be there every step of the way. After the child psychologist got Cole to open up, Malcolm found that talking to Cole not only helped Cole, but it helped him. Cole had to face his fear to overcome it, and he was helping Malcolm to face his own mortality.
Cole suffered in silence about what he has seen, but he knew he had to face his own fears. A ghost named Kyra was showing up in Cole's room. She scared him because of how she looked, but this is his chance to face what he feared. It was not that bad. After all, she just needs help because she was scared and wanted to move on.
In this movie family, ties are strong because Cole is all Lynn had, and Cole is the support Malcolm needed. Cole learned to face his fears. Malcolm learned to face the fact he was dead. In the end, everyone faced their fears with a little help from each other. This movie has the same underlying theme as The Others mortality. Although The Others is considered a horror genre, it has some striking similarities as the Sixth Sence both visited by the dead.
No movie is scary or had so many visits by the dead without a little magic behind the scenes. The movie uses darkness, temperature, and even emotion to give the psychological response and the visuals. Cole uses the teary eyes to give emotional appeal while close up frames to get the attention of the living in and outside (us) the movie. The movie also used darker frames where very little light gets through again to play on the fear of the dead and emotional impact. Lighting was used in a number of ways of darkness, meaning death, and the frame brightens up when Cole or his mother were in the frame. The temperature was played with to give the ice-cold feeling of the dead. In a couple of scenes with Cole and a dead person, his breath gives the illusion of it being cold in the room.
This movie is a great movie to see good acting, and even the dead do a great job of being dead. It is a hit all the way around. You will receive the psychological thrill, but in the end, it is the chill you will feel. So if something goes bump in the night, do not turn on the light.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

How do you scare the crap out of people without using cheap shock gimmicks? See this movie and you'll find out. This was also done in the original movie The Haunting. If you've seen the new Haunting then you know the difference. This movie has the spirit of some of the best Twilight Zones and is also why after so many years that TV show is still a classic.

Ghost Humanity,"Initially, right now I'm really interested in humanity-subject. Not the kind of human race, but the human-feeling inside. I mean our conscience, or our human instinct. Yes, human as true human, not just a slave, weirdo, crazy-man, or etc. And The Sixth Sense (1999), just give another kind of human, a gifted boy as human. Yes, for such a talented boy, not everybody will accept him. The protagonist, Cole Sear, is just another ordinary child who also need to be loved, listened, and appreciated, in spite of his sixth sense. Before this, I just want to make a clear side about how I see the ghost itself. So, honestly I still believe in ghost, in other dimension of our world. The ""cinema reason"" is so that I can enjoy the horror-movie and movie like this. Yes, maybe just in the movie I believe in ghost. But, usually ghost-movie is identical with horror, and The Sixth Sense make the very opposite perspective. A ghost-cinema with humanity approach. There are two main idea of this review, humanity in people who sees ghost and in spirit itself.The basic idea is human knows to be human. So for this case, Cole really knows how other people really think of him. And how he should do to be normal-child. But, he just can't hold this ability. He sees dead-people everyday, he is afraid as a normal human. The problem is, nobody cares of him, what a pity. He just need someone who doesn't think he's nuts. Until he met a child psychologist, who on the first time doesn't believe in him. This is one of the essential human needs, the needs to be appreciated and accepted. Human can't live without this. And this movie delivers tiny message of it.The other humanity is in ghost itself. In movie, I believe in ghost like I said. So, from this movie, we learn that they are also need to be listened. However, not all people see them. And someone who can see them, such as Cole, afraid of their scary physical body. Let's say, if you look people with leprosy or other horrible disease, you will afraid of them, especially help them. This is what I get, everybody even ghost need to be listened. In real life, you can learn from people with acute health or physical problem. Of course, it takes time and great bunch of tolerance, but at the end we can see the joy of caring other people.From the core of movie, let's review the extrinsic part. So twisted and simple. The story is just nothing but superb. That's why I rated it 8 out of 10. Why not 9, because the cinematography is also simple, the setting is monotonous. But, what's good in movie, is just the original yet unique idea. This movie just make another breakthrough of how should we see ghost added by wonderful story and natural acting.

In my eyes, Haley leads the table of outstanding all-time performances by any young actor, followed scantly by Elijah Wood. This movie has suspense, it has frightening sequences, it has mystery and thrilling crime aspects, all of these superbly converging on Haley Joels' character. It is his very own personal ability to show emotional feelings and assign them on to the viewers that makes his performances so authentic and sensational.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Hugely Powerful, Mind-Boggling Thriller","For anyone who has no background knowledge at all surrounding this movie, it is hard to discuss The Sixth Sense without spoilers, but I'll try my best.This is by far one of my favorite films from the 1990's, if not one of my favorite films ever. Throughout the entire film, you get a very powerful feeling of suspense that simply leaves you craving for what's next. The Sixth Sense leaves you guessing one more thing after the next, and then completely turns your beliefs around and practically alters the movie's reality. It hooks you right from the start, with an opening scene that will leave you questioning what in the world just happened. But as the story unravels, things piece together and your jaw will drop multiple times.It is also difficult to talk about this film without at least mentioning the affect of its ending. The Sixth Sense has one of the most unexpected and powerful endings of any movie I've ever seen. When it pieces every detail together at its end, you may still be thinking about it 3 hours after watching it. It's movie making at its best.Before M. Night Shyamalan made crap like The Happening and The Last Airbender, he made some truly powerful films. The Sixth Sense is one of those films, and it is undoubtedly a movie experience you have to witness before you die.Rating: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A perfect suspense thriller and a force to be reckoned with...,"4/4 ESSENTIALIf you've talked with anyone who's anyone about The Sixth Sense, chances are you've heard ""I see dead people"". I encourage people who have not viewed he film to walk in to their first viewing as blind as possible, because the less you know the better. If you're farmiliar with M. Night Shyamalan's work, you'll know that he's famous for a twist at the end of his movies. This is not only Shyamalan's best twist, but one of my favorite thrillers, and a modern classic.The Sixth Sense is not a movie that is characterized by constant jump-scares and over-the-top violence, but instead it is a very smart, well preformed, and well directed movie. It slowly reveals new information over the course of the movie, and the suspense is waiting for the next answer. However, the two main characters (played by Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis) are always on the same phase of he journey as you are, providing a more genuine emotion to their preformances. It is a very well-constructed, well-orchestrated film and never gives way to it's own complex plot.As for the acting, Osment is able to play the very troubled kid, Cole, alive with raw fear. To capture such a mature preformance out of a child his age is truly incredible. Willis gives a very earnest preformance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe as well, and it'll be hard or forget as well... I was genuinely surprised at how convincing both the leads and the supporting cast was. It doesn't get more authentic than this.The instant success of this movie prompted Shyamalan to churn out more movies made in its image. Next was Unbreakable, a fantastic movie, and quite possibly an equal to The Sixth Sense. In 2002 came Signs, which was a great drama but little for suspense. In 2004, Shyamalan returned again with his signature ""plot twist"" with The Village, which fails to impress me. There is no doubt that Shyamalan hit hard with this movie, as he has been trying desperately to re-create the amazing experience found here. It just goes to show a formula is only good for so long, and he nails it in The Sixth Sense.M. Night Shyamalan has since been branded as a one-trick pony. While I disagree, I can understand those who think that. His films are similar... some are great, others aren't all that good. Even if it's true, The Sixth Sense is a pretty amazing trick and undoubtedly the movie that started it all for Shyamalan.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The premise is presented in a manner that is thoughtful and I guess credible enough for most people, and yet for some reason I seem unable to fully surrender my disbelief. Beyond that, or despite that, I did find The Sixth Sense mildly entertaining. Toni Collette gives a really solid performance, as does the rest of the cast, Bruce Willis included. The proceedings to me did seem a bit heavy handed at times and could have been handled with a slightly lighter touch.

In one scene the child comes through the front door just home from school. Yet, it is dark outside the front door. The child in the film has a 6th sense but totally fails to use it on Willis.

Night Shyamalan trait of surprise ending hits you flat in the face and you go ""OH! That's why""Sixth Sense is a movie that is so great but sadly it is not a movie for retakes, since the entire suspense is revealed in the end, the actors in the movie also performed well, especially Joel Osment and there is Bruce Willis, showing off his prowess as one of the great actors of our time. To me Sixth Sense is the best movie I have seen him in, although the Die Hard series are exceptional, this movie just stands out in your mind and heart.Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film about the perils of a young boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole lives an isolated life, finding it difficult to mix with others; he sometimes sustains injuries on his body, which he gets when attacked, by the people he sees and talks to, people whom others cannot see. Cole sees and talks to dead people.A child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with troubles of his own comes on board to try and help Cole deal with his problem, all to find revelations about his life that he was not expecting.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie script was first purchased by Disney before it was sold to Spyglass; Disney's president believed the movie was not going to be a hit. The movie production budget was 40 million and it was a financial success making over 600 million in the box office and the movie's tag line, ""I see dead people"" is a popular catchphrase, used by many other movies, TV and songs.Sadly though this classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but won none, this doesn't take anything from this movie as it remains a classic in every way.This movie is a masterpiece introducing Shyamalan for a great writer and director, this and Signs (2002) (with Mel Gibson) stand out as my favourite of his films.

Will Go Down In Cinema History As A Brilliant Hitchcockian Classic,"*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyThe Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first masterpiece. For the two people who have yet to see this film I will clue you in on what it is about. The Sixth Sense is a supernatural thriller about a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) who discovers that he made a mistake with a former patient named Vincent. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled young boy with remarkable similarities to Vincent. Malcome makes it a personal mission to help Cole so that he can feel better about his former patient. By the way, Cole's problem is that he can see dead people.There are very few ways that this film could have been better. However, one way to make it better has nothing to do with the film itself. If the promos for the film hadn't shown Haley Joel Osment saying the famous phrase, ""I see dead people"" over and over again than the film would have been much more surprising. Image the surprise in learning that the reason that Cole is so messed up is because he is haunted by ghosts. Not that it needed to be anymore surprising. The big twist at the end has been regarded as both brilliant and ridiculous for the past five years. I am one of the many who believe it to be brilliant. After seeing it for the first time you will be blown away. The ending is not the only reason to see the film.Bruce Willis strayed away from his traditional action hero roles when he starred in this film. It was all around a different character for him and he nailed it. Willis makes Malcome Crowe come alive and conveys his emotions easily in the film. Haley Joel Osment was great as Cole Sear. I am not quite sure if he was good enough to merit a nomination for best supporting actor though. His constant whispering got slightly annoying but was necessary considering the plot.M. Night Shyamalan's screenwriting and direction in The Sixth Sense is nothing short of incredible. The pacing was slow and it added to the tension Night so brilliantly created. A lot of people find Night's style boring and difficult to watch (especially in his later films). I love the slow development of the story and characters and increased ""creepiness."" James Newton Howard was the film's composer. His music fits the film perfectly and makes it even more suspenseful. M. Night Shyamalan gave himself a name with The Sixth Sense and raised the bar for all future supernatural thrillers. The Sixth Sense is a ***** film and, I say this a lot, but if I believed in organizing a list of my favorite films than needless to say this would be pretty high up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A rare 'twist' movie that holds up to repeated viewings,"Everyone knows that this movie has one of the best 'twist' endings in recent film history. Hopefully you haven't had it spoiled for you because seeing the movie for the first time wouldn't be the same if you knew the ending beforehand. That being said, if you're revisiting the movie then I think you'll find that it holds up surprisingly well, even though the element of surprise is gone.The main reason for this is that you can now appreciate how the film was constructed in a way that concealed the twist in plain view. There are various clues throughout which take on a second meaning on repeated viewings. In my opinion there are maybe a couple of questionably 'cheap' tricks but it does all fit within the logic the 'twist'.Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is the atmosphere. This is unquestionably Shyamalan's best directorial effort, effectively building a sense of mystery and dread, all without resorting to the over-the-top gore typical of horror films. James Newton Howard's eerie score is also an essential ingredient in building atmosphere.The acting is good all around but, for the most part, unexceptional. In my mind Toni Collette gave the best performance, one that was justly rewarded by an Oscar nomination. Haley Joel Osment also nabbed a nomination but I wasn't that impressed by his performance, though it was definitely above average for such a young actor.If you haven't seen this film already try to catch it before the 'twist' has been revealed to you either by someone else or by a cultural reference.

"Whatever You Do, Don't Blame It On The ""Night""...","So you wanna know who's responsible for the disgusting glut of weak-ass, PG-13-rated bundles of porcine fecal matter trying to pass themselves off as 'horror movies?' Well, folks, just blame M. Night Shyamalan.No, let me take that back...Let's not blame 'Night', but the sorry excuses for writers, producers and directors who called themselves attempting to surpass the brilliance of Shyamalan's best movie so far...THE SIXTH SENSE.With a smooth effortlessness that's just about as terrifying as the movie itself, Shyamalan brings us the damn-near perfect story of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis in a role that shattered everyone's prejudices about him as an actor), a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients (an almost unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg), who then commits suicide. Sometime after this ordeal, feeling that he failed his late charge, Malcolm attempts to find redemption by helping out a distressed young boy named Cole Sear, (Haley Joel Osment's career-making performance). who can ""see"" dead people and communicate with them.At no time are you ever unaware of how much you care for these characters, and how extreme the situation is for them, which makes the shocks and scares twice as intense as any you could ever find in a PG-13-rated flick before, (except maybe for POLTERGEIST.) Plus there are fantastic performances all the way round by Willis and Osment, backed up by great turns by Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Cole's tough- but-tender mom) and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's former fiancée.Even after multiple viewings, the storytelling skill that Shyamalan has is faultless, and still leaves you scratching your head as to how you could've missed the clues that lead to one of the most spellbinding, jaw-dropping endings to come along in many moons. Some people might figure it out in the first five minutes, but I will confess - Night so thoroughly pulled me into his world, that I wasn't one of them.SENSE was both a blessing and a curse to Shyamalan, since newly-won fans now expected ALL of his movies to have that tricky ""twist"" ending to stun and surprise them. Because of that, the quality of the movies that followed SENSE was inconsistent to say the least. People still debate about the merits of UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, or even if THE VILLAGE should've been made at all.Personally, I like everything he's done since, flaws and all. But as far as his career is concerned, THE SIXTH SENSE is like his ""CITIZEN KANE,"" and considering the genre, is every bit as monumentally good as Orson Welles' towering achievement.THE SIXTH SENSE is without a doubt a ""must-have"" for your DVD library.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"This Film Was a Game Changer, and It's Still Fantastic.","1999 was an interesting year with several films that would be highly influential still to this day, and this movie, along with ""The Blair Witch Project"" really redefined horror and thrillers and have since had so many imitators it is very easy to diminish just how good both of these films are, especially The Sixth Sense. The Sixth Sense established Shamalyan as a force to be reckoned with, and rightfully so. He has never quite lived up to the expectations with his film, and his trademark twists became so famous that people have called those who imploy similar twist Shamalyan twists.I watched this movie in the theatre with my mother in 1999, and you might think as a teenager I hadn't seen many movies, but not true, I watched a lot of movies, my parents even let me watch R films, with supervision, they even took me to see 8 Mile when it came out, and my mom took me to see ""The Cell"" and ""The Matrix""(My mom also took me to see ""Fire in the Sky"" in theatres, I was 8) . I was also obsessed with horror films as a teen, an obsession that I killed a while back, but I had seen enough films in many genres, particularly horror, supernatural, and thriller, to know this film was unique and special. When I watched The Sixth Sense, I was truly blown away, and I cannot begin to describe the many emotions I felt when the film was finished, it was a truly emotional journey more than anything. I have watched it at least 4 times since I originally watched it, and even though it doesn't pack the same emotional punch it does the first time, it reveals new things you may have missed the first time.What sets this apart from Shamalyan's other films is the ""twist"" is the movie, it is what the whole movie is about, it isn't even a twist so much, as a whole story that ties itself together in a satisfyingly bittersweet ending. ""Signs"" was still a good movie, so was ""Unbreakable"", and even ""The Visit"" is very well done, ""Split"" is probably his best recent film, and it rightfully put him back into mainstream consciousness, but none of his movies reach the greatness of The Sixth Sense because none of them have scripts that are good, characters as well-written and acted, or near flawless technical execution.It is easy to dismiss this film, but you would be remiss if you do so, it is worth revisiting if you didn't like it the first time. I can't imagine why you wouldn't like it, but some people are needlessly negative and jaded and won't be pleased, or simply dislike things because others like them.

A fine movie but no replay value,"The acting is quite good and I'm still sad the kid didn't become the youngest Oscar winner in history, he truly deserved it. A fine performance by Bruce Willis as always and the plot twist was completely unexpected, it was obvious from the beginning but we completely missed it.. Not a living soul saw it coming... But that's kind of the problem with this movie.. The twist is it's only selling point and it only works once. If you've seen it twice you've seen it.

M. Night Shyamalan's first movie is a brilliant psychological thriller with a fantastic twist.,"Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment Director M. Night Shyamalan pretty much came out of nowhere. We weren't expecting him or what he was going to bring to us, but then, he was there. And he left a huge impact on the film industry.His first film, The Sixth Sense, which he wrote and directed, and played a small role in, is an eerie psychological thriller. It's the horror movie that isn't a horror movie. It doesn't make you jump out of your seat and crap your pants, but it leaves you with this creepy, eerie feeling.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist. After winning an award for his work, he comes home one night to find that one of his old patients is waiting for him in his house. With a gun. The patient shoots Malcolm and then turns the gun on himself.Several years later Malcolm comes across an interesting case. Cole Sear (Osment) has a problem that he doesn't want to tell anybody about. Cole starts talking to Malcolm, and Malcolm slowly learns more about Cole. He discovers that he has cuts on his arms, that he kleptos from churches, that he speaks Latin. He wears his father's old glasses and watch. Malcolm decides very quickly that Cole is a very interesting, very bright, but very disturbed child.Eventually, after Cole feels that he can trust Malcolm, he tells Malcolm his secret. He sees dead people. People who walk among us, not even knowing that they are dead. Nobody else can see them, but he can.The movie has several very creepy moments when dead people with pieces of their head missing, or massive cuts, or vomiting, appear to Cole and try to talk to him. Cole cannot figure out why they come to him, and they scare him to death.Malcolm eventually helps Cole realize that he is the only that can help these people. Cole learns how to conquer his fear and talk to the dead people and to help them with their issues.Osment does a superb job of acting in this film, especially considering his age. Willis also does a fine job, but the spotlight is always on Haley.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Movie to Watch Once,"""The Sixth Sense"" is really a film to only be enjoyed once. It's an effective little ghost story with one of the most famous twist endings in history, but the film relies too much on that gimmick, and without it, it doesn't hold up all that well.The movie is a cut above others in its genre because it devotes a healthy amount of time to developing its characters, and Toni Collette, who plays the frazzled mother of a troubled little boy, invests the film with a tremendous amount of warmth and emotion it would otherwise lack.It's far and away M.

The only Shyamalan movie worth watching,"The only good movie M. Night Shyamalan has made to date.The flow and timing of this movie is fantastic, which makes it so good and easy to get into not to mention the punchline in the end. Bruce Willis fits the role well, and the little kid (Osment) is great. What should be notice even more is what an extraordinary job Toni Collette did in this movie. The scene where they (Osment and Collette) are in the car and he says to his ""mother"" that he is a freak, Collette's emotional reaction is so realistic. I have the greatest respect for her talent after that. I think she deserves greater roles.Shyamalan hasn't been able to make or write a single piece of good movie making ever since, which makes me suspect he had a lot of help on Sixth Sense. Someone with real talent and skill would not just sink from great to rock bottom. I almost want to attribute the Sixth Sense to someone else.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
M. Night Shyamalan on the Map,"The Sixth Sense did an excellent job of combining drama with suspense. The cinematography has slow pans and long shots which allow you to sit with each scene and take it all in. From the beginning M. Night Shymalan draws the viewer in with the stillness of the scenes, and immediately you are sucked into the world of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis).Dr. Malcolm is an award winning child psychologist; however, the story focuses on his feelings about his failure to one of his patients. He sees a second chance for himself in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), and is determined not to fail this time. Malcolm has self admittedly been detached from his home life and believes that he won't be back to normal until he helps Cole.Cole is a young boy who is the odd one out at school. He fears events that happen around him that no one else can see, and he is afraid to tell anyone his secret. Cole doesn't have any friends and his mother (Toni Collette) is not always able to see everything going on with him due to the responsibilities she takes on as a single mother.M. Night Shyamalan creates a wonderful film that follows the relationship between a troubled young boy and the doctor trying to help him. It begs the audience to suspend belief as you delve deeper into the story. Shyamalan has made a classic that you have to at least see once, but gets better with multiple viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Made me jump.,"If a movie professes to be scary, edge of your seat, frightening, etc; and it doesn't live up to that claim, I feel cheated.  The Sixth Sense lives up to its claim of being rather scary.  There are moments that will make you jump, and there are moments that will make your hair stand on end.  Bruce Willis is very good as the shrink who tries to help the young boy who sees dead people.  Hayley Joel Osmet is very good in his role.  There is a certain conviction to his voice and you can see it in his eyes, that he really believes he sees dead people.  The way he relates to Willis is refreshing in movies.  Most of the time, kids are either saying something smart or acting silly, not this kid.  He's tortured, and he's scared.  The film delivers the goods and even sneaks in a great twist.  Better bring someone along with you, you might need to grab hold of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

But THE SIXTH SENSE unmasks itself in an ending that is totally unexpected and shattering.The bad news, a glaring technical flaw about twenty minutes into the film (A boom microphone is CLEARLY visible in TWO shots) that drew a roar of heckles from the audience and came very close to wrecking the movie up to that point.Even with this flaw, the film was STILL able to deliver a knock out-have to see it again to get the full effect-experience.Makes me wonder...How could the film makers not SEE THAT MICROPHONE!It looked ready to pop Bruce Willis on the head! It's hanging close to dead center of the screen for what seems forever! One scene, Willis ACTUALLY SAYS ""I feel like I have something hanging over my mind"". Yea, the boom microphone!

Beyond the Veil,"The Sixth Sense is a film that continues to haunt and inspire me, lingering like a whispered secret long after the credits roll. From the first scene, I was enveloped in an atmosphere where silence spoke louder than words, and every shadow hinted at truths hidden just beneath the surface. Haley Joel Osment's portrayal of Cole Sear, a young boy burdened with the eerie ability to see what others cannot, struck a deeply personal chord, reminding me of the often-unspoken parts of ourselves that we carry in quiet solitude. Meanwhile, Bruce Willis's Malcolm Crowe embarks on a poignant quest for redemption and understanding-a journey that mirrors our own struggles to reconcile past regrets with hopes for a better future. Shyamalan's careful direction transforms what could have been a conventional supernatural thriller into a meditation on isolation, loss, and the courage it takes to confront our inner demons. Every carefully composed frame invited me to reflect on the unseen forces that shape our lives, urging me to listen closely to the silent stories that play out in our hearts. In its subtle blend of suspense and empathy, The Sixth Sense remains a timeless exploration of the delicate interplay between the visible and the unseen, leaving me with a lingering sense of wonder about the mysteries that lie just beyond our everyday perception.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The clever thing of the movie is that there are no inconcistencies on second glance,"""The sixth sense"" is a plot driven film. The ending comes really as a surprise. The surprise comes all of a sudden and you even think that the director must have committed some inconcistencies to keep you on the wrong track for so long. The clever thing of the movie is that there are no such inconcistencies on second glance.Plot driven movies are difficult to review, because you have to avoid spoilers at all costs. This review is therefore rather brief. Nonetheless I would like to call attention to the following aspects.Playing on the background of the story is the widespread belief that the soul of people who have passed away only can find peace if some unfinished business of their lives is taken care off.Towards the end of the movie there are (in quick succession) two scenes in which the lead characters of the movie (psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and yount patient Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment)) learn each other to communicate with their loved ones about their private difficulties. Cole learns Crowe to communicate with his wife and Crowe learns Cole to communicate to his mother.Although these scenes are overshadowed by the surprising end which follows not long after, they are so well played that in my opinion they are pivotal scenes of the film nevertheless.Before this film Haley Joel Osment (born 1988) had already played in ""Forrest Gump"" (1994, Robert Zemeckis). Two years after ""The sixth sense"" he would play in ""AI"" (2001, Steven Spielberg). After that his career faltered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Shyamalan delivers a story with some likable, well-drawn characters. There's some occasional good (and gruesome) shocks that keep the tension edgy and the plot builds to a startling twist ending. Shyamalan's direction is slick with lots of dark atmosphere and creepy imagery.The films stars are another strong feature.

An original new kind of horror movie.,"With the coming of ""The Sixth Sense"" M. Night Shyamalan (how to pronounce it, I have no idea!) introduced a new kind of horror. The kind of horror that is more psychological than it is scary, although ""The Sixth Sense"" still has some good scares! The movie inspired many other movies like for example ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman but also M. Night Shyamalan kept making movies in this new kind of horror style, movies like ""Signs"" and his most recent one ""The Village"".It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie such a masterpiece. It might be because of the superb mix of drama, thriller and horror elements. A thing why all these elements flow so well isn't only thanks to the directing but also due to the acting. Bruce Willis shows that he is a good actor and can also play a character without guns. Toni Collette is also good and warming as troubled mother but real discovery of the movie is of course Haley Joel Osment. He is more than just a child actor, he is a real actor! He really deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie and I wouldn't had mind him seeing winning it. Oh well, his hopefully his time will come, after all he is only just 16 now. The movie got nominated for 5 more Oscars including best picture and best director. The movie eventually went home empty handed, a shame because the movie deserved at least an Oscar nod.Already trademark M. Night Shyamalan element in a movie is the surprise ending. ""The Sixth Sense"" does have a good surprise ending, it's a kind of ending that makes you want to see the movie again after you finished watching it for the first time. Although not my favorite movie surprise ending of all time, it sure comes close to it!See this movie for the tension the drama and the surprise ending.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I still remember how I actually did gasp, and feel this jolt of shock go through me, when watching it at the cinema and realising the truth of the situation.

Still fresh after multiple viewings,"Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan might be a hit or miss with his recent films, but the title that made him a household name as a master-twister was his third film The Sixth Sense. It was so good at the time, that almost every film Shyamalan wrote and directed after this film was expected to have a twist ending by default. On its own, The Sixth Sense is a well-made supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis as a psychologist and child actor Haley Joel Osment (whose breakout role was Forrest Gump Jr) in his care. Their investigation into a series of paranormal incidents leads to a terrific revelation that no one saw coming at the time. While the scary bits may feel mediocre, the twist ending is still fresh for a film that is over two decades old.

Ghost Story,"M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of his two best movies. The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark. Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor. To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children. Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences. For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority. The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past. The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating. The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling. The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever. Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film. The supporting cast is remarkable as well. Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way. (Psychology is rendered at least overrated.) Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly.

I Just Have a Feeling About Films Like This.,"""The Sixth Sense"" is one of those rare films that really gets under your skin and stays there. Young Haley Joel Osment (in an Oscar-nominated role) is slowly going crazy due to the fact that he is seeing dead people who literally walk around as ghostly spirits. Enter child psychiatrist Bruce Willis who is having marital problems and blames himself for the demise of one of his former patients. Together they go on a harrowing journey of unexplainable phenomena which culminates in one of the greatest surprise endings in the history of the cinema. Indian director M. Night Shyamalan (Oscar-nominated in writing and directing) shows Spielberg-like potential with only his third production. Toni Collete (also Oscar-nominated) is adequate as Osment's answer-seeking mother. However, it is Osment who keeps the audience on its toes and Willis' equally riveting turn that are at the heart of ""The Sixth Sense"". 1999 was a year of disappointments in the movie world, but this picture was one of the few that really delivered on its pre-release hype. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

But what really sticks this film out (besides it's over 200 million gross and six academy award nominations) is the acting.  Bruce Willis fits in well as a troubled psychiatrist trying to help out an even more troubled boy (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) who has a gift in which he sees dead people.

a modern psychological suspense masterpiece,"i'm not going to give much of the plot of this one away,just in case you're one of the three people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie.suffice to say that it is one of the greatest psychological suspense thrillers in modern time.this is one eerie movie,strongly anchored by the performance of Haley Joel Osment.,who plays the character to which the title refers.Bruce Willis and Toni Collette also put in strong performances.and watch for a brilliant performance from an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg(yes that Donnie Wahlberg from ""New Kids on the Block"" fame).who knew he could act?you will almost certainly have to watch this movie more than once,and you will discover something new each time.if you have'nt seen it,and somehow have managed to avoid knowing anything about it,i highly recommend it.to end,i will just say that this movie is a modern Masterpiece.10+++/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Possibly 1 of the last great original films :(,"I am writing this review long long after this movie had been released so I will try to stick to my feelings at the time I watched it.
It definitely started a new & exciting trend in movies but it also made it more difficult for future movies to surprise(?) us as successfully.
However I really didn't enjoy this movie the first time I watched it and even watched it again to look for certain things that I may have missed. This is something I rarely do (re-watch).
It was a very good classic horror story that kept me entertained and I enjoyed watching till the end.
Almost all horror...etc.. movies nowadays have very disappointing endings,( and I use the term ""ending"" very very loosely)..
it's like they just decide to stop filming after realizing they didn't know how to conclude anything & basically wasted our time watching a story that went nowhere while spitting out the usual BS excuse "" we wanted to leave it up to you the user to decide what happens"" , which basically explains nothing.I felt like the sixth sense left me with an extremely satisfying conclusions and The overwhelming excitement to discuss it with others. If you are one of the very, very few people who has not watched or heard of this movie, then first of all ...""WoW!!!"" You're lucky if you getting to watch it for the first time without any info about it & second, if you are planning to watch this soon, I suggest you do so without really reading too much about it or letting others who've already seen it, tell you much about it.As for the film itself, I really enjoyed the story, the entire unfolding, the acting and basically everything else. It did a great job of keeping me engaged and pretty much stuck to the story without adding unnecessary scenes for nothing more then shock value or filler.
It's definitely become a cult classic and my only regret is not being able to see it for the first time again....
I feel as though this was sadly one of the last decent movies in at least the last decade or so.
it's so obviously only about money now... instead of quality storytelling.
There are many extremely talented people out there who are MORE than capeable of creating amazing films, but most likely they'll never be given the chance to express their work Because Hollywood is too crowded for ""unknown"" & unproven talent..So until them we will keep getting these generic scripts or consistent rewrites from the people with the ""big names"" that make money.

"Scary, very scary","This is one movie everyone should watch over and over. ""The Sixth Sense"" had everything from a plot to a great cast and awesome performances.

I have since seen several times and it keeps getting better each time I have seen it.The plot is laced with twists and turns that will keep the mind working well after it is over.

Bruce Willis has finally found has made the best decision of his career by selecting the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Bruce Willis makes me glad I watch movies because he is just so good.I was surprised to see how good Olivia Williams was in this film. I saw her in ""The Postman"" and she was not quite used to her full potential. I'm glad that this role allowed her to flourish as an actress.

One of the most Overrated Films of All Time,"Unlike some people I will admit to the fact that I was totally surprised by the ending, but in my book the ending does not make the movie. Even still the twist at the end, did not live up to it's hype and was not as good as movies like ""The Usual Suspects"". I am a fan of Bruce Willis and he has his moments in this one, but I for one cannot stand Haley Joel. I believe his best movie was Forrest Gump and thats because he had few lines and was in 5% of the movie. I am not saying that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a terrible movie, but it does not live up to it's hype and certainly not to the IMDb top 100 rating. It was a very uneventful flick with boring dialogue and a very dry plot. To put it bluntly it bored me to tears. After weeks of hearing praise and worship after the viewing I was severely disappointed. The ending was good, but the rest of the movie was just average. If you want to see a good M. Night movie, watch ""Unbreakable"", I think ""Signs"" was just as overrated. All in all I gave this movie a 6/10 or maybe a B-. Like I said before, it's not a bad movie, it just didn't live up to the hype, and was not worth paying to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Boring with a predictable ending.  That's right, predictable!","Before seeing this movie, I had heard there was a surprise ending.  I knew no more than that and was able to come up with a nice twist ending before seeing the movie.  True to my instincts, this movie ended exactly as I predicted.  Because I had already figured out the ending, the clues in the movie seemed so obvious to me, I wondered why people were not figuring it all out.  But people are surprised are by the ending, and I can't understand why.  This movie might be worthwhile if you can't pick up on clues.  But I could not enjoy it.  Some reviewers say once you see it once, you have to review the movie to understand everything.  Well because I had already guessed the ending, I felt like I had already seen this movie and every scene just led up to an already known end.  I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed.  Proud as in I guessed the ending before seeing the movie or disappointed as in the writers couldn't come up with anything better. I was left with a ""that's it?"" feeling.  So if you already have an idea as to what the ""surprise"" ending is, then do not go see this movie, you're probably right.

Shyamalan's Masterpiece?,"While M. Night Shyamalan does an excellent job toying with our imagination in 'The Sixth Sense' it is not overly thought provoking or complicated in any sense.

A classic suspense thriller that has stood the test of time,"After 20+ years, M. Night Shyamalan's suspense thriller and ghostly drama still stands the test of time.The creepy duo of Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment is what makes 'Sense' work, alongside some innovative (at the time) cinematography and the easter eggs that Shyamalan has become known for (e.g., the ""red thread"" that is symbolism throughout the film). The six Oscar nominations that 'Sense' was able to earn speak volumes about how the film was received when it was released, including the best supporting actress nom that Toni Collette received, Philly accent notwithstanding.While there are only a few scenes that hold up as being frightening, it's not a strike against 'Sense,' as that's not the objective of the story. Instead, the film focuses on themes like letting go and forgiveness. Even though the infamous twist that's reveleared at the end is no longer shocking given how it's been immortalized in pop culture over the past two decades, it's still an important moment in cinematic history.Maybe Shyamalan peaked early in his career with 'The Sixth Sense,' but that doesn't take anything away from the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A well-crafted suspense movie that makes you think about your own 'hereafter'.,"I was able to watch the Sixth Sense on DVD on its first release today. As enjoyable as this movie is, the 'extras' on the DVD make it twice as enjoyable. Included is a fine interview with the writer/director that helps put the whole story in perspective, which includes his personal and family influences.The votes currently place this movie at about #23 on the top 250 movies of all time. That's probably a bit of an overrating, considering all the other fine movies in the list. However, for any person who sees it and loves it can also make a legitimate case that it is their favorite of all time.My ""review"" doesn't really say anything about the story itself. That is because it is best viewed if you know nothing about it first. Except to say that it is one of the very few movies that gets high ratings from viewers of all ages, and genders!

Don't let a disappointing initial viewing turn you off...,"Some movies manage to scare us, and some movies manage to move us, and ""The Sixth Sense"" is a film that successfully does both. It took me three separate viewings to finally realize the genius of it all. I was not exactly impressed after seeing it for the first time on network television, after hearing so many good things about it. Then I stumbled into a theater playing ""Signs,"" and I was blown away by M. Night Shyamalan's directing style, and I decided to revisit ""The Sixth Sense"" again and again--and finally, all in one viewing, everything struck me as a wonderful, perfect whole.The film begins ominously in the cellar of a dark house. We see Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) wander into the basement and grab a bottle of wine. We follow her upstairs where she finds her husband, Malcolm (Bruce Willis), drunk on rich wine and admiring his newly-acquired plaque, given to him by the city of Philadelphia in honor of his work in the field of child psychology. He thinks it would look good on the bathroom wall.Then everything falls apart. Malcolm is shot by an old kid whom he failed to help. Some number of months goes by before we meet up with Malcolm again, as he walks down a street in Philly, watching Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having trouble at school. He seems to be haunted by something, but Malcolm is unable to place a finger on what's wrong.Then Cole tells him. He sees dead people. (""They walk around like they don't even know they're dead."") Considering Cole a sort of ""do-over"" for that kid he failed to help so many years ago, Malcolm makes it his personal vendetta to get to the bottom of Cole's troubles, and perhaps even face the most terrifying of all realities: the kid is telling the truth.John Travolta had ""Pulp Fiction"" and Willis had ""The Sixth Sense."" This film reanimated Willis' somewhat faltering career, and for good reason: it's one of his best performances. Sure, the fake wig gets a little tiring, but the mystery surrounding Malcolm and his interest in a patient will connect with most viewers. We're a lot like Malcolm, at first, trying to figure out what's wrong with the boy. Then, later on, we find out that we were really viewing everything through Cole's eyes.A major problem with movies about kids is that kids often can't act very well and rely on their cute, forced one-liners for audience approval. Not Haley Joel Osment (who was nominated for an Oscar due to this film). He actually acts, unlike most kids his age, which is refreshingly satisfying. He's no Macaulay Culkin--and I mean that in a good way.You may not be as scared by ""The Sixth Sense"" as you will be haunted. The movie connects with a primary fear of our inner psyches that we all experience starting as early as childhood: the supernatural. A realm where rules of the mortals do not apply. There's a sort of satisfaction in knowing that only so many things can happen in this world that we live in. We know there's a limit as to what can appear before us, or what restrictions apply. But anything could be possible in a separate realm, and that is what most supernatural horrors miss. They mistake true nail-biting fear for creepy images of ghosts. M. Night Shyamalan doesn't. He strikes a chord with the audience by respecting them more than that.Shyamalan is a self-confessed Steven Spielberg fan, and also admitted that Spielberg was a huge influence on all his films. I'm not too terribly surprised. Indeed, ""The Sixth Sense"" carries a sort of elegant structure that some of Spielberg's early features such as ""Duel"" and ""JAWS"" contained--some sort of majesty about the curiosity of it all. We never saw the truck driver; we rarely saw the shark (and when we finally did it was truly startling); and here the supernatural overtones of the movie carry a sort of otherworldly mystery that this genre often lacks. I can see how ""The Sixth Sense"" may have been ample straight-to-video effort. A kid who sees ghosts. It's not exactly brilliantly conceived.But its execution and surprise ending (that almost everyone knows about by now and few actually guessed ahead of time) are what make ""The Sixth Sense"" something more than just another supernatural thriller. It's more of a tender, subtle character piece with spiritual overtones. Shyamalan has created an eerie second presence in the movie that is a lot scarier than showing ghosts parade about. ""Signs"" wasn't about aliens. ""The Sixth Sense,"" despite what people tell you, is not *really* about ghosts. I think that's part of what makes it engage the viewer, and seem so very intriguing, even to this day. After setting a groove for films of the genre to later follow (and knock-off), ""The Sixth Sense"" stands strong and proud and strikingly different. You have to admire both its ambition and respect for the audience, two fundamental elements of which are often lacking in many of today's motion pictures.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Much more than its twist,"I have a thing against twists for the sake of twists. There's a certain desire in creatives to surprise their audiences, to give them the unexpected, and the plot twist is an easy tool to use in such circumstances. The key to a good twist is that it needs to not only recast the movie that came before it so that the audience has to re-evaluate what they've just seen, but it also needs to be naturally built into the story itself. That leads to a compulsion to hide clues that otherwise shouldn't be hidden, or to even outright lie (like in High Tension). The Sixth Sense is a film with a twist that very easily meets the parameters of a good twist because of a couple of major reasons.So, Dr. Malcolm Crowe is celebrating with his wife after having won an award for his tireless work in child psychology that, according to him, he achieved after having sacrificed time in his marriage. The evening is interrupted when a nearly forgotten patient shows up as an adult and shoots Malcolm before blowing his own brains out. Skipping ahead a year and Malcolm watches a new patient, Cole Sear, cautiously approaching him and getting to know him and gaining the boy's trust.The first half or so of the film is told almost exclusively from Malcolm's point of view. He observes Cole and tries to understand the child's emotional issues through his psychological lens, and that's how we see it as the audience. He's a weird, introverted kid with odd little behaviors like talking to toy soldiers in Latin in a church. He has scratches on his arm. He can't interact with other kids. It seems like an early version of schizophrenia.And then the movie gives its first twist (which was never really a twist for the audience since the reveal was in every bit of marketing) that Cole can see dead people. They're everywhere, all the time, and they plague his daily life. It's here that the movie really moves into Cole's perspective, splitting the rest of the run time between the two main characters, and we finally see what Cole sees. Horrific sights that won't leave him alone. He has no safe places except the church and a little shrine under red blankets in his room populated with stolen statues of saints.The first half of the film is a build up of character, showing us both Cole and Malcolm in great detail. The second half uses that solid base and throws the film fully into supernatural thriller territory as we get deeper into the mind of Cole as we watch him deal with the dead that surround him, but we also see Malcolm working towards his own healing, making up for his failing with the patient from the beginning of the film by helping Cole find his own ability to work with his curse.That very strong base in character is what makes the final twist work even after multiple viewings. Perhaps some of the tricks used by the film to imply a certain reality that is not true become a bit more obvious for the viewer, who's supposed to be tricked in those moments. However they still work for the characters themselves. The movie intelligently uses the tools of cinema to place characters in situations without any real explanation, implying interactions that never actually happen, and act like it's cutting out the beginnings of scenes, a common modern cinematic practice.Can you remember when Bruce Willis gave meaningful performances? It's been about twenty years, but it did happen, and his performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe shows that the man really did have acting talent at one time. Haley Joel Osment got all of the acting attention at the time, even getting nominated for an Oscar with this performance, and he is really remarkable. The quivers of his lips as he tries to explain things sells a character in abject fear of what he's saying. I think, however, the real unsung hero of The Sixth Sense is Toni Collette as Cole's mother, Lynn. She's a working mother with questionable tastes in fashion, and she's near the end of her rope. Her husband left her, her son seems crazy, and she's barely surviving financially. When Cole finally reveals his secret to her with details he received from Lynn's deceased mother, her breakdown is restrained and affecting all at once.M. Night Shyamalan had made two films before this, his breakout, and just about no one has seen either. His first two don't reflect the later obsessions, as far as I know (I'll watch them eventually), but The Sixth Sense shows all of his strengths and even some of his weaknesses, though they don't feel like weaknesses without the context of his later films. The twists are well built and feel like intelligent approaches to characters. The characters have very definitive quirks. The quiet of the first half is done to help focus the audience and build a sense of unease. The scares of the second half are really reliant on atmosphere because outside of that the sights aren't actually that scary, but in context they are quite effective. With some of Shyamalan's later issues, it's amazing to see how thin of an edge's knife The Sixth Sense dances on. One step too far in several different areas, and the whole exercise could have come crashing down.As it stands, though, The Sixth Sense is in almost perfect balance. A psychological and supernatural thriller with strong character work, intelligent cinematic touches, and wonderful performances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Slow film - good acting,"Slow film - good acting. There is no ghosts. Scripture says we are to die and face judgment. That aside, this is an extremely slow-moving film with no action in it whatsoever, no screaming girls being chased by maniacs, just important dialogue and realistic people in real situations. There are plenty of reasons to watch the film for. When we eventually start seeing the 'ghosts' that Cole himself sees, there is ample opportunity for some chills, and the ghosts themselves are really quite frightening - both in their behaviour, and of course their gory looks. These spooks are of the kind THE HAUNTING remake could have done with.The acting is of the highest calibre, with a relatively unknown cast headed by that great action star, Bruce Willis. Willis turns in his most sombre, thoughtful performance ever, and surprised many people who didn't realise he could actually act. In fact I would say that this the best I've ever seen him - his character is sympathetic, and Willis really does excel himself in portraying a believable, faded and disheartened man. Toni Collette also puts in a good role as the frustrated mother of Cole, and even though she doesn't play a likable character and has a relatively supporting role in the proceedings, she remains a totally believable and understandable character, and the same can be said of Olivia Williams. However, it's Haley Joel Osment who really shines as the star of the piece, and his acting is spot on, conveying a boy totally in fear of his own unnatural abilities, and who labels himself a 'freak'. Thankfully, Osment doesn't get too many opportunities to do 'cute' scenes, which I was grateful for. Aside from the many genuine chills at Cole's revelations that he can see dead people, there are a few too many 'jump' scenes for my liking, where somebody brushes past the camera and somebody screams. A variation on the cat in the cupboard, really. However what seems to be initially an average film is suddenly boosted by the now famous twist in the tale, which really changes your entire perception of the film and makes you think about how clever it was long after the images have faded from the screen. This ending was brilliant, one of the best I've seen, and I should probably watch the film again now that I know the outcome, in order to spot all the clues, as it were.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Perfect movie,"Bruce Willis interprets the lead, uncharacteristic of him as playing a child psychiatrist and I think he did a great job, ie I believed he was a psychiatrist, not a sweaty bloody character who would just break the drug chain after numerous explosions and loud shootings, hence the role he specializes. He wants to help the boy Cole, who has his secrets and inner demons, as he reminds him of one past patient he failed to help.
If Willis did a great job, what about young Haley Joel Osment? Little was devastated in his role, which even earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. To this day, this role remains one of the best, if not the best, children's role on the big screen. Osment already auditioned for the role because he was wearing a tie and when the director asked him if he had read his role, he said that he had read it three times and that was the whole scenario. He was so ready. We can clearly see the seriousness of his character through dialogues with Willis, but also with his mother, played (supremely) by Tony Collette. Such mature acting is not easy to find with many older actors, let alone with (then) nine-year-old Osment.I was impressed by the way this movie was directed, every detail is important, there is no long or unnecessary scene because everything has its meaning. If there was a question or confusion, in the end everything was explained, everything is connected. I also see the quality in that when we first watch it, we have it and when we watch it again, we get a different perspective because the movie contains one of the biggest and most unpredictable twists, and yet that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie again. What is even more impressive is that the film continually casts clues as to what it really is, but your eyes and brain do not allow you to see or understand it. And when that moment comes when the light comes on in your head, you'll be surprised you couldn't see something that was constantly on your eyes.
The use of colors was not in vain, especially the red that appears in prominent and important scenes, but I couldn't see it at first glance.
I don't want to give out anything about the store, even though I know the vast majority of people have watched this movie, but I still don't want to ruin anyone's first impression of such a great movie.
We can only watch movies for the first time once.

What's the hype?,"This is a reasonably well written, well shoot and constructed film with no substance to mention, playing it safe and not daring to transgress the conventional Hollywood frames. Young Haley Joel Osman is the carrying force of this film and succeeds  in receiving lots of empathy for his unhappy, fearful condition. Many scenes of this film are touching, and some scenes startling and slightly disturbing, but for the most part this film has been dumbed down to achieve maximum audience and profit. The good craftmanship of the film makers is being wasted in the director's lack of strength in his vision and edge. This is such a neat package of ""horror"" for cinematically uneducated and undemanding from a nice, compromising Spielberg school of directing.Bruce Willis is not playing a moronic action-hero, but an introverted academic in his typical boring way. Comparing this film to ""Exorcist"", ""Shining"" or ""Silence Of The Lambs"" would constitute a blasphemy towards great masters of film making like William Friedkin, Stanley Kubrick and Jonathan Demme.This film is more of the calibre of ""Flatliners"" than aforementioned achievements. Sixth sense is a relatively insignificant,  unchallenging mainstream film with really, nothing you haven't seen dozens of times before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

average,"'The Sixth Sense' is a horror film about a young boy who has the power to see the ghosts of people who have passed away. The boy gets help from a psychologist and tries to learn how to fit in and know a normal life. The film succeeds in playing the horror as well as cinematography and a plot that makes the audience think. Most of the horror in the film is portrayed in a way that gets the imagination to work and plays on suspense. The plot is engaging and it also makes the audience think. However, I thought that it was predictable and knew what was happening before the end of the film. The performances are done well, and this film does have several strong points, but as a film overall, I think that it was average.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The Sixth Sense is a sensory trap, a film that traps the viewer from beginning to end, offering a multitude of visual experiences that are perfectly constructed","At the end of the second half of 1999, the movie world was awestruck by a phenomenon at the box office. Blair's Witch (1999) debuted in theaters around the world, breaking records and showing the public that there was a new way to fix people in their seats, fearing the protagonists' next step. Less than a month later, still not remade from the witch's fright, behold, the film by a hitherto unknown director hits theaters, surprising with its atmosphere of wonder. This director is M. Night Shyamalan and his work: The Sixth Sense.It is precisely the focus given to these four characters (Malcolm, Anna, Cole and their mother) that makes The Sixth Sense so terrifying: by making the viewer 'intimate' with its protagonists, Shyamalan makes us really care - and fear - for they. But that's not all: the camera work of this young director is also extremely skillful, especially in the sequences that take place inside the apartment in which the boy lives: slight oscillations in the frames give us the impression that that little family is constantly being observed. By the spirits that trouble Cole. Furthermore, the tone of the narrative becomes even more frightening thanks to the clever photography of Tak Fujimoto, who deftly explores the Gothic style of some points of the architecture of Philadelphia, where the story takes place.The secret brought by young Cole is revealed only in the second act, until then, there are no frightening sights or hauntings. The spectator follows the facts in the physician's perception, anticipating this revelation, in a slow and cadenced narrative, when the boy's discomfort becomes evident and is transmitted to the public, without sparing them the shivers. From then on, the until then psychological drama is enveloped by supernatural elements with the presence of disturbed ghosts in search of help. There are the school hangmen, the one who knows where the gun is hidden and the girl who drools - always scary displays, accompanied by the right soundtrack and smart, well-chosen camera placements.It becomes impossible not to get caught up in the drama of little Cole. Now, who would have the courage to approach these entities in a state of absolute suffering to try to listen to them and make them understand their new condition? Among the rules observed by the boy, two are fundamental, but which make it easier for the public to foresee the final surprise: 1) one ghost does not see the other; 2) many do not know they are dead. Even with this anticipation of this surprise, Shyamalan acts consciously in the presentation of the pieces that will lead to the climax as the red color shown only at the right moments, leaving the final revelation just like the icing on a cake enjoyed and enjoyed slowly.It's wrong to think of it as just a ghost film, which is a shallow vision of a well-formed work about the end of a relationship, the difficult acceptance of a separation, when each axis avoids seeing the other. In fact, all of the director's work allows for a deep analysis of life stages hidden in supernatural metaphors. Just as an example, Body Closed can be seen only as the emergence of a hero and, consequently, a villain, but it also brings a reading of divorce through opposites; Signs is a film about alien invasion making up for the loss of faith in the face of the death of a loved one; and even the criticized End of Times brings a cataclysm and a pre-apocalypse to show that Men, by destroying Nature, walk backwards in evolution, slowly committing suicide...The film is a beautiful spider's web, set up to catch the viewer and make us intrigued and curious about the unfolding of the story. Everything in the film reminds us of other facts that, later, make us understand and connect the dots of this great web that Mr. M. Night Shyamalan involves us. The script sculpted (yes, the term is 'sculpted') by the director is not only clever, but also full of such subtle details that after the film is over, I want to watch it again in order to try to understand. It in all its magnitude. No information is free and - detail - many of them go unnoticed until, suddenly, we realize that something relevant had been said a long time ago, leading us to recapitulate everything that happened so far, in a delicious attempt to reassemble the intriguing break -heads proposed by the plot.In fact, it all lies between the lines - if only we could take a closer look. Yes, Dr. Crowe is dead and I believe it was the biggest plot twist of my time, but if we notice, whenever someone goes to talk to Cole and that person is alive, there are never any outlying colors in the scene. The film's photography is morbid and cold, giving a feeling of strangeness and unease, as if something is always going to appear behind the door or when the camera changes direction, however, when we notice that he was confronted by a spirit, always there is something in red on the scene, always! We can also notice that whenever they are talking together, there is never anyone around, or, if there is, they do not pay attention to the adult, only to the child, another sign that he was not really there.Even when Malcolm is sitting across from Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette), at no time does she look away or talk to him, only to her son. When Crowe goes to his house and tries to work on the case, there is always a distance with his wife, and if we look deeper, she is always alone at the dinner table at the restaurant, at her house and at the service, she never mentions her husband and live watching the wedding footage, which is unusual for someone who loves her husband as presented at the beginning of the film; even after the attack, she would never let go.Cole's conversation with Crowe at the hospital was the final card to fall apart. After all, he told everything that Crowe was and couldn't see, just like us. We are not talking about a horror movie, we are working on a very well-produced suspense, where we are immersed in the depth of the characters' relationships, the fears that move us and how we are able to deal with the ending, if it really exists. The soundtrack is very well thought out in order to make us feel what the characters are thinking at the moment, be it fear, uncertainty or relief.With all the great acting in the plot, and the incredible way M. Night Shyamalan directs the film, we audiences don't see all the signs of this incredible plot twist. But once we understand everything, The Sixth Sense starts to have a completely different story from what we believed it to be from the beginning. And that's precisely why this film brought all the fame of M. Night Shyamalan, and a completely deserved recognition. In addition, he took the opportunity to use color theory in his production. Everything that is red in the scenes is related to the death of the ghost that Cole sees, be it personal objects, clothes or even environments.However, even this brilliant script could have been damaged if the protagonists' performances weren't convincing - and they are simply brilliant, highlighting the superb work performed by little boy Haley Joel Osment, possessed of enormous talent. His character composition reveals not only an impressive precocity, but also a profound professional responsibility - it is evident that he immersed himself unreservedly in the creation of the troubled Cole. His pauses, looks and inflections are always effective in every scene, helping to make his implausible character completely believable to the viewer.But much of the credit is also due to Bruce Willis, as his perfect chemistry with Osment is vital to the audience's ultimate involvement. But that's not all: his frustration at the breakdown of his marriage is conveyed with great sensitivity, especially as he talks about it to Cole in what is one of the most emotional scenes in The Sixth Sense. Meanwhile, Toni Collette is also moving as she portrays the frightened Lynn, Cole's mother. Her despair at not understanding what is affecting the boy is only matched by her frequent attempts to get him to 'relax', as when pushing him in the shopping cart. (It will be a great injustice if the Academy does not grant nominations to all three). Also noteworthy are the strong presences of Olivia Williams, as Malcolm's wife (although her participation is small, which is one of the few flaws in the film), and Donnie Wahlberg, as the distraught Vincent.The Sixth Sense is a sensory trap, a film that traps the viewer from beginning to end, offering a multitude of visual experiences that are perfectly constructed by its director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan in his first film of relevance, and also what it would mark his career forever. Blending features from different genres, The Sixth Sense cannot be described merely as a 'suspense', as it is not only capable of scaring us: tears and laughter (these more sporadic and with a nervous background) are also present throughout the projection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A weak foundation.,"The sixth sense wasn't really a bad movie, per se, but the problem with it lies in the fact that any entertainment value it may hold is in one aspect of it which you find out when watching the film for the first time - if it hasn't been spoiled for you.

A Masterpiece from Start to Finish,"This movie should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but instead, the honor went to the cringingly pretentious and uninspired ""American Beauty""-a film that tries so hard to be poetic about mundane nonsense that it makes me feel sick just thinking about its disingenuous, failed attempt at cinema. ""The Sixth Sense"" is what cinema is truly about. Every frame exudes greatness; there isn't a single shot that doesn't tell a whole story. It's one of the rare films where the camera acts as a silent narrator, with composition and movement constantly adding insight into every scene. It's a masterclass in visual storytelling, where invisible hints are everywhere. The performances are flawless, culminating in one of the greatest plot twists in storytelling, regardless of the medium. This is what poetic should be-never forced, never pushing absurd metaphors, like trying to find beauty in a plastic bag being tossed around by the wind. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a metaphor for life, death, and the unresolved matters we cling to that continue to haunt us. A must-watch for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

And all nine lives...Willis delivers again,"By far this is my favorite Haley Joel Osment role that I have seen him play. M.Night is sensational directing this onion-skin of a thriller story, but who doesn't realize that? The bedroom scene with the doctor and his wife was what a shocking good thriller is made of. Donny Wahlberg is a terrifying short detour in this right-made enthraller that packs a whopping cast that has authentic developed personalities with an eerie undertone. Bruce again shows that he is the right choice for a major story that captivates from the start to the end. You feel for Malcom Crow, as he seems to be searching for truth and help for this young boy. The mother has a real appeal in that (Toni Colette is superb)the actress is a well crossed role player that seems like there is just no-acting there. She is on it. All the while, there are scenes that are not 'shot' impatiently. I think that so much of Hollywood is cutting, cutting, cutting to make the scheduled time box that the formula fits into. The visual chemistry woven is done almost with a cinematic respect for the classic film noir, they are held in the length that makes them perfect grippers, you see what's happening and it gives enough 'pause' then makes you feel the chill across the back of your neck. When the story captives and the performances are cut to fit as right as this is, you know that not all movies are even. Not by a long shot. Bruce Willis has a definite old world quality of acting, in a new world format. This movie unfolds with precision in story telling and character development with the good Doctor and the boy and then when it goes to the end, it twists and you are left feeling that cold chill once again. I only had one question that I would like to ask 'M' about the plot. Other than this, I am well pleased with ""The Sixth Sense"".For what a superb thriller should be, this one is a top pick. It's 'incredible' the success that The Sixth Sense has had, it is no wonder to me and millions of fans, and in that, Willis with his contract and profit agreement took away with him One Hundred Million Dollars. Some might say that he isn't one hundred million good. Some might say, the Razzies gave him three awards for worst actor just the year before, I say, none of that 'banter' will change a wit about Bruce in this film.Recommended for M.Night Shyamalan and Willis fans, even if you aren't it really makes no difference in the end you will know why.

"The ""Plot Twist"" at the Turn of the Century","""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) marked the end of the 90s by presenting a captivating plot, with a surprising twist in its outcome, solidifying M.

The iconic plot twist has become one of the most mentioned and discussed aspects, appearing on lists of great movie twists. In addition to suspense, the film explores deep emotional themes, such as guilt, redemption and acceptance of death, which elevates it beyond typical thrillers of the time, in addition to notable symbolism and visual details, such as the presence of certain symbols, such as the use of the color red, adds layers of interpretation to the film, enriching the experience for attentive viewers.Remarkable and influential, ""The Sixth Sense"" became a landmark in the thriller genre, delivering one of the most impactful endings in cinema history and influencing several subsequent productions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Three Eyes Wide Open...,"THE SIXTH SENSE is Director M. Night Shyamalan's darkly mysterious masterpiece. The basic plot is straightforward enough, with Bruce Willis playing a psychologist named Malcolm Crowe, who attempts to help a young boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment) with his issues. Having just lost a client, Malcolm is initially reluctant, but forms a deep bond with Cole as the story progresses.Along the way, Cole exhibits behaviors and holds beliefs that could mean that he's harboring severe psychological problems. That, or he witnesses paranormal occurrences that no one else can see. The further Malcolm goes along with Cole, the more convinced he becomes that the boy actually has some sort of psychic ability.Saying anything more detailed would ruin everything! Shyamalan has included two revelations in his film, one minor (involving the death of a young girl) and one major (the finale). The Director certainly captured supernatural lightning in a bottle here!

Very Good Thriller,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.The Sixth Sense was undeniably one of the best films of 1999. Director-Writer M. Night Shyamalan claims he is a fan of Hitchcock and it definitely shows. I am not saying The Sixth Sense is a rip off of a Hitchcock film but its definitely Hitchcock-like. If Hitchcock saw this movie I am sure he would be very impressed.The genius of The Sixth Sense is definitely in its script. The dialogue is well-written, but most importantly its very well structured. The Structure is relatively simple but it hides the twist at the end while revealing some clues along the way. None of the clues gave away the ending for me. The twist is simple yet very effective. I was blown away at the end of the film. Shyamalan has written a very, very good screenplay.The Script is probably the main strength of the film, but the acting is also quite good. Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in a restrained performance as a psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as the disturbed boy, Cole. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mother. Shyamalan is fine in a small cameo.The movie is also atmospheric and chilling. So many memorable scenes, but one scene looked very awkward to me. Its a scene between Bruce Willis Character (Malcolm Crowe) and Cole that seemed a bit too sentimental to me. Other than that, Sixth Sense is a very good thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Sixth Sense (1999),A creepy little spook movie to watch on a Saturday night. The Sixth Sense will remain a classic for a very long time if not forever. 10 star performances and a little twist at the end makes a good movie.I don't like movies that keep me up at night. This didn't but it had me turning around a lot hoping for a spirit not to be standing behind me. This is one of those movies that will scare the hell out of some and will not even make some jump. It depends on what sort of person you are. If pale ghosts with slit wrists walking past doors scare you then you may not want to see this movie.The twist was good. I didn't see that coming. But some will see it coming a mile away. It was ruined for some by 50 first dates.WARNING: DO NOT WATCH 50 FIRST DATES BEFORE WATCHING THIS. IT GIVES THE ENDING AWAY.Check out my 50 First Dates comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/usercomments-enterLuckily i had seen The Sixth Sense before i saw 50 first dates.Now the acting. It is extremely rare to find a great performance from a kid. But Haley Joel Osment gave me the greatest performance i have ever seen from a child. He is disturbing and a cursed kid. Bruce Willis plays a very different role then the hero John McClane. But he was still good. But the one who stole the show was Toni Collette. She was just so natural and great. She played Haley Joel's mum. She was just excellent.You might be thinking why has she said it is so good and then gave it an 8/10. Well i am not a fan of this movies at all.

"The best ""thinking"" movie all time.","I will not be reviewing The Sixth Sense. I will be reviewing M. Night Shyamalan's flawless masterpiece.First off, the acting in this movie is beyond excellent. Haley Joel Osment delivers a great performance as the character Cole, and Bruce Willis as Dr. Crowe delivers an equally good role, if not a better one. But who plays the better role is out of the question when you are talking about a movie of such quality as this. Shyamalan did such a great job with the writing of this movie and like my summary suggests, this movie really makes you think. And by the end, all of the loose ends or missing puzzle pieces come together and everything makes sense. You can watch this movie several times over and you will always pick up something you missed the last time. I have seen a few movies that had a big twist ending, and this has gotta be the 2nd best twist ending of all time- Only behind Stephen King's ""The Mist."" But when you look at the entire picture, Sixth Sense is the superior film, The Mist only had the superior ending.I suggest you drink some caffeine before watching this, because you need to watch it at night with the lights out, but you can't be sleepy, because you're going to need your thinking cap for this. But as long as you give it your attention (while still having a good time watching) you will thoroughly enjoy this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I like that - but ...,"It is very difficult to write a good review about ""The Sixth Sense"" without letting out the ending. To those who haven't seen the film yet: The whole film would be meaningless with any other ending. It was made only because of the ending. Every single scene, every shot exists for no other reason than to give a hint or to prepare the very last scene. The consequence of this is that the film seems very artificial to me; it couldn't be more constructed. Shyamalan shows us exactly as many scenes as possible. Other scenes we expect we do not see because they would tell us too much about the solution.I admit I'm fond of these stories where at the end you sit there with an open mouth, speechless and then you think about the film again and again and you find answers to thousands of questions you didn't ask. My favourite film is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it has the most brilliant point since ""The Planet of the Apes"". But there they didn't need any talking dead people to tell a gripping story.I mean, this was a nice little movie with an interesting atmosphere, some exceptional actors (I don't mean Willis, I mean Osment and Collette) and a little bit of black humour.

When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick. I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience. I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love. The end was so surprising, I had to see it again. The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story. I couldn't find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.I believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently. The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me. This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions. Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.

It is a film that simultaneously transcends and succumbs to the limitations of its genre, a work of art that, despite its eventual narrative predictability, manages to enshrine itself in the annals of modern horror. While the modern astute viewer may readily discern the central ""reveal"" before the climactic moment, the true genius of the picture resides not in its narrative sleight-of-hand, but rather in the meticulous architectonics of its suspense, the resonant performances, and the hauntingly elegiac exploration of grief, guilt, and the ethereal boundaries of human perception.To dismiss ""The Sixth Sense"" as merely a well-executed genre piece would be a profound disservice. It is, in its essence, a meditation on the psychological ramifications of trauma and the desperate human need for connection, even with the intangible. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, expertly portrayed by Bruce Willis with a restrained gravitas that belies the character's internal turmoil, is a man adrift in a sea of unresolved emotional baggage. His professional success - a testament to his empathetic understanding of the human psyche - is tragically juxtaposed against his personal isolation. The narrative expertly establishes Crowe's vulnerability from the outset, highlighting his inability to fully grasp the insidious nature of his own fractured reality. This vulnerability allows the audience to become complicit in the film's gradual unveiling of truth, mirroring the character's own harrowing journey.The film's visual language, masterfully orchestrated by Shyamalan, is crucial to its success. The dark color palette, the deliberate use of shadows, and the unsettling stillness of the mise-en-scène create an atmosphere of palpable unease. The camera, often employing low-angle shots and lingering close-ups, subtly reinforces the sense of claustrophobia and isolation that pervades both the physical and emotional landscapes of the characters. These visual cues, combined with James Newton Howard's haunting score, function as a subliminal symphony of dread, gradually escalating the tension with each passing scene. This deliberate construction of atmosphere, characteristic of classic psychological thrillers, is a masterclass in cinematic tension-building, a testament to Shyamalan's profound understanding of the power of suggestion.The character of Cole Sear, the young boy burdened with the ability to ""see dead people,"" played with astonishing maturity by Haley Joel Osment, serves as the emotional fulcrum of the narrative. Osment's performance is nothing short of revelatory; his portrayal of Cole is a nuanced blend of fear, resilience, and profound loneliness. He embodies the burden of his spectral communion, conveying a sense of tragic isolation that resonates even after the credits have roled. Cole is not merely a vessel for supernatural phenomena; he is a representation of the unspoken traumas that haunt the living, a conduit through which the film explores the complexities of grief and the desperate need for closure. His scenes with the revered Toni Collette are particularly compelling, demonstrating a deep understanding of the actor-director symbiosis.The film's employment of traditional psychological thriller tropes is not merely derivative; rather, it represents a skillful reappropriation of established conventions. Shyamalan understands that familiarity breeds anticipation, and he deftly manipulates the audience's expectations, using the familiar elements of the genre - the jump scares, the unsettling sound design, the ambiguous character motivations - to heighten the sense of unease and anticipation. The iconic imagery, like the ghostly apparitions and the chilling pronouncements of the dead, transcends the realm of simple shock value, contributing to the film's overarching exploration of fear, vulnerability, and the fragility of the human mind.Furthermore, the film's narrative structure, employing the red herring with expert precision, deliberately misdirects the viewer, allowing the core premise to be disguised as it unfolds. While the observant viewer might anticipate the resolution before the final act, the journey itself, not the destination, is where the film truly triumphs. The gradual accretion of evidence, the subtle clues embedded within the lack of dialogue and visual cues, compels the audience to participate actively in the unravelling of the mystery. This active engagement enhances the film's impact, allowing viewers to become more emotionally invested in the characters and the narrative arc.In conclusion, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a triumph of cinematic storytelling, a skillfully crafted exploration of the human life, and the lingering echoes of the unseen. While its pivotal plot twist may be somewhat predictable, its artistic achievements lie in its masterful suspense, its compelling performances, and its profound thematic resonance. It is a film that lingers in the memory, not just for its scares, but for its hauntingly beautiful portrayal of human vulnerability, and its exploration of the enduring, yet ultimately comforting, power of connection. It is, for all its spectral inhabitants, a deeply human story, which warrants, in my considered opinion, the score I have assigned: 91%. A near flawless masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Simply wonderful !,Sixth sense is a master piece in itself one of the finest movie in 90s era basically this movie has been keep in horror category but it's a horror psychological thriller amazing performance by plot including Bruce Willis (Dr. Malcolm) played his role very well specially that child Haley Joel osment (Cole) was exceptionally well in his acting throughout the movieSixth sense is simply amazing that atmosphere in the movie is something which makes scare you instead of jump scares both characters help each other and ending makes the movie perfect n amazingWell directed by M. night shyamalanDefinitely must watch.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
M. Night Shyamalan has done it again,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" is a very haunting tale about a boy who can see and talk to people that don't know they're dead. Some scenes in this movie are disturbing, and some are upsetting. But if you listen closely to everything the actors say, even if it's hard to hear and hard to remember, it all makes sense in the end. Much like ""Holes"" and ""Signs"", another fantastic movie directed by Shyamalan. The ending of this movie is a humongous surprise, which makes you feel different about the whole movie.

My comments are on the acting and the movie itself,"The Sixth Sense is a movie about a young child who can see the dead.  This movie is highly overacted, and mostly unbelievable.  The sixth sense is more ridiculous than scary.  But Bruce Willis gave a great performance in this movie.  I gave the movie a 7/10.  Overall review, the Sixth Sense was good.

Tremendous thriller and paranormal drama,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a paranormal drama and thriller that packs edge-of-seat mystery into a film of less than two hours. Although it didn't win any of the major film awards for 1999, it was worthy of the numerous nominations it received - six for Academy Awards, two for Golden Globes and three for BAFTAs.Haley Joel Osment was deserving of his nominations as best actor in his role as the young boy, Cole Sear, who had a sixth sense in which he could see spirits of people in situations before they happen in the future. Bruce Willis also gives a tremendous performance in a role cast out of his usual type. He plays child psychologist Malcolm Crowe. All of the rest of the cast give superb performances in this thriller that has a surprise ending.This is a very good film - one of the best dramas of the late 20th century that should still please audiences well into the future.

I See Dead People,"If you are a thriller lover and haven't watched this movie yet then I believe you should. The story built-up is what matters in a successful thriller and this is what has been done with class by M. Night Shyamalan supported well by its crisp editing. Despite Bruce Wills is the main lead but film goes to the Haley Joel Osment a young boy that time who played his role with so much of a conviction that you from the beginning start sympathizing with the his character and the entire film is then leaded by this small boy and he convince the audience to watch this movie by his perspective with an Iconic Dialogue ' I See Dead People' .
The plot twist is one of the biggest USP of this movie and if you are watching this movie in 2020 and didn't get the plot twist till end then it will definitely blow your mind however if you anticipate it already during the movie then you should praise that how well it is crafted and how it would've blow'ed the audience mind in 1999.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

creepy but has plot holes.,"I admit that this movie is very dark and creepy, the emotional elements are good and the actors are good, especially the child actor Haley Joey Osment.

However, there are too many plot holes. I just don't understand why some ghosts can move things and some can't, why some ghosts can't see/realize their own wounds... The atmosphere is great though. Also, ghosts that walk pass like normal are much horrible than ghosts which just look scary & dangerous. The story makes me feel depressed too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Vomiting? Reckless Gunplay? Anything but this film mess...,"A hundred megabucks to Mr. Willis for this ponderous pile of celluloid psychic - psychotic? - parrot droppings? Wildly popular? Doesn't that explain why we're now richly paying for the brain-dead 1990's? Sixth Sense in one sense is prophetic. It prefigured breathtakingly dull snore-gasbord of pretentious films and TV shows in which actors make it so small they become gassily hissing statues. Whisper, whisper, whisper. Reductio ad absurdium of 'make it small' 90's method. Subtlety run to ground. Mark of manipulative hackwriters who've nothing to say. This moribund arthritic film strains constipatedly along at glacial speed like a tortoise with lumbego. Actors whisper softly, their words lost in a maelstrom of soporific hissing. No matter. They're saying nothing. Sixth Sense is cheezy manipulation exemplified. Making it small lets viewers project themselves into the action. Well and good. Make it too small, whisper interminably and what? We're privy to sacred yet uninteresting secrets of the ancients? Hidden albeit inane wisdom of the condemned?Viewing Sixth while typing. Scary? You bet. Film so boring, ready to hit Circle-K, load up on Jen & Berry's High-Viscosity Frozen Cow Secretions and wash them down with bushels of Choco-Chip Suet Snaps. Goal? Induce insulin shock to forget I squandered an elegant tropical Saturday night on this beautifully photographed snore.Bituminous scenes of Willis meandering thru gutted garages are marginally interesting. Yet not even that and a compelling soundtrack can save this dreadful 90's polemic-lite. More economical and less fattening: turn in early, enjoy good night's sleep.A few minutes of this New Age Chapter 11 filing does the trick faster than flocks of sheep bearing jeroboams of ether.Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasota Key, Florida16 July, 2006""Truth leads a wretched life - and always survives the lie.""Cathy O'Brien",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Shayamalan's one masterpiece that still resonates,"Nearly two and a half decades have passed since this amazing masterpiece blew up the big screen. Most have forgotten (or those who didn't have a chance to see) the original cut of the film in the cinema. After it's massive success in the box office, we got a edited more dumbed down version... still mostly the same.The film's story was original, beautifully acted, written, directed, scored, edited etc... so why are the rest of M. Night Shyamalan's films nowhere near as good? Answer: This film was a GROUP contribution! All the little secrets throughout the film were ideas mostly given my the big producers (Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall) and some of the stars like even Bruce Willis.To get back to the film, if you haven't seen it by now... you're an idiot. Sorry to sound so harsh but people consistently mock what is one of the biggest plot twists EVER just when they hear the movie. Most likely it's been spoiled for you... don't let that stop you from watching it.Like other great films, this one remains in the top #100 where it's earned it's rightful place. It has horror, drama, mystery, thrills... and gonna be more specific. You can watch it and cry. You can watch it and be spooked all night. You can watch it repeatedly...

The film is greater than its climax.,"The Sixth Sense is one of the celebrated movies of all time more because of its mind-blowing climax. To me however, the movie stands for much more than just its ending. In particular, the two relationships in the movie, that between Cole and his mother, Lynn, and between Malcolm and Anna were handled with great delicacy.Toni Collette has delivered a flawless performance as Cole's exasperated mom who tries in vain to understand her son's psychological nightmares. The scenes between mother and son are few in number but have been constructed with great care and meticulousness and go a long way in describing their relationship.In the case of Malcolm and Anna, the former's confessions to Cole about his marital problems and Anna's vacant stares into space also describe their strained marriage effectively.The scenes where Cole confesses his biggest secret to his mother and Malcolm talks to Anna in her sleep are, in my opinion, Shyamalan at his very best. With minimal but very effective dialogues, he shows why he is the master of underplay and subtlety.The Sixth Sense truly is M. Shyamalan Night's masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"A captivating, bone chilling Movie","Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, The Sixth Sense. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired August 2. 1999. It has a runtime of 1h 47 minutes, The Sixth Sense was rated 16+. The Movie was directed and created by M. Night Shyamalan.Summary: Malcolm Crowe, a dedicated child psychologist, is honoured with an award on a night that takes an unexpected turn when he is confronted by a distressed former patient. This encounter compels him to take on the challenging case of a young boy who shares similar struggles, claiming he can ""see dead people."" As he immerses himself in helping the boy, his wife grows increasingly concerned about the time and energy he devotes to this troubled child. Meanwhile, Cole's mother finds herself at her wit's end, desperate for solutions to her son's escalating issues. For Cole, Malcolm Crowe may be his last chance at finding peace.Review: -This film captivated me from start to finish. Certain scenes sent chills down my spine, enhancing the overall experience. The cinematography was impressive, featuring creative shots that captured character reactions through reflections, bird's-eye views, time-lapses, and close-ups. I particularly appreciated the innovative use of a camera positioned inside a glass box, allowing us to see the actors behind the glass. The dim lighting added an atmospheric quality, ensuring that everything essential was visible within the frame. Additionally, both the set design and costumes were well-executed. The gore effects appeared remarkably realistic, surpassing those in many other films I've seen.I appreciated the casting and performances, as they generally felt authentic. The actor portraying Cole effectively conveyed his character's emotions through facial expressions and body language. I also liked that the film included subtitles, which allowed me to quickly grasp the dialogue when necessary. However, there were a few scenes featuring dialogue in Latin and Spanish that only indicated the language being spoken without providing translations, which was somewhat limiting. It was intriguing to see some of the undead that Cole could perceive; however, I had anticipated witnessing many more than what was actually shown in the film.I felt that some of the dialogue in the movie script was somewhat misplaced, as certain lines seemed overly mature for a character interacting with peers of the same age. This created an odd viewing experience at times. Personally, I believe the story would have been more engaging if the undead characters had amnesia, allowing Cole to discover their pasts and collaborate with them to uncover what truly happened, rather than having them fully aware of their histories from the outset. I would also have enjoyed seeing Cole meet and connect with others like him, which could help us understand why he possesses this unique ability to see what he does and what sets him apart from others. I think that by introducing a clear antagonist who actively opposes characters goals could have added an exciting twist to the story.-I really enjoyed the scene between Cole and his mother, Lynn, towards the end of the film; it was exactly the kind of conclusion I had hoped for. The ending surprised me with its twist, leaving me genuinely shocked and speechless. It also felt satisfying and complete. While I believe that many viewers might have predicted certain elements when the movie first premiered, my experience this year made me realize how possible advancements in medical science could influence perceptions of the story, which contributed to my surprise. Personally, I would love to see a remake of this film with an updated script to enhance certain aspects. I'm curious to see how a new version would turn out.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 8.5 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One Of My All Time Favorite Movies,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) was one of those movies i couldn't get enough during upon its release almost 17 years ago. The mystery, performances, script, directing, horror and THAT unforgettable and once in a lifetime twist at the end that left me speechless - this is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is still the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever created, and seeing his movies now, he will probably unfortunately won't top this one. That said, i liked many his movies post ""The Sixth Sense"", but nothing came closed in comparison to this masterpiece.Overall, as you have probably seen this movie more then once, there isn't anything new that can be said about it. It's definitely one the best movies of all time i think, that works equally good as a mystery, horror, drama and character study. One of the kind movie experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Movie of the week?,I like Bruce Willis movies just as much as the next guy...but I saw this movie at a special screening and I have to say that I was disappointed.  The concept itself of a young boy cursed with the ability to see the dead in a heightened sense is very cool...but...the movie itself is dragged out and long...it's as if they had a 30+ page script and tried to stretch it into a lengthy 2 hours...I'd recommend it for a decent rental only.

"Doesn't feel like the genre its in, yet works either way,...mostly","After Die Hard (1988) had permanently made actor Bruce Willis a go to action star, he could couldn't get himself out of it. He did manage to snag a few roles that were out of the action genre but none of them really stuck. At least, not until he decided to take part in this little project. There's also something to say about this films director, M. Night Shyamalan. It may not be his first directorial or writing job, but he certainly shows the kind of potential he had from the beginning. Of course, for many viewers now a days he's missing his mark to the point of no return. However, that is a discussion for another time. Ghost stories are not a new thing; they've been told several different ways. However, something about this particular story does make it quite different from the rest.Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), is given a case where a child, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is considered an outcast among his single mother and classmates for being strange for his own reasons. Along with this is Crowe's own subplot dealing with him trying to reconnect with his distant wife. Among the rest of the cast are other good actors which all pitch solid performances. Not one actor here gives a performance that isn't believable. In fact, for a horror film, it had several significant emotional moments along the way that helped define the its characters and gave them depth. Of these actors, Bruce Willis gave his most realistic showing that is not seen all too often. Frequently, Willis is playing sharp, hot-headed, wise-cracking characters. Here, he's the exact opposite - cautious, soft spoken and well-mannered. It's a nice change in character.And of course with this inventive writing comes the respective errors. One big error is the continuity. The laws of how ghosts work are not kept clear to what their limitations are. An example of this would be how ghosts can touch certain physical objects and not others. Certain rules like these are difficult to follow, especially when it comes to certain plot points. When it came to the horror elements of this movie, it was effective in some areas, while others not so much. What did look well done were the practical effects. This helped create some disturbing images. Unfortunately, what didn't assist in making these images even creepier was the lighting and camera work. Tak Fujimoto, the cinematographer for Silence of the Lambs (1991) also worked for this project and his selection of lighting doesn't assist any of the jump scare moments in any fashion. If the whole scare shot is in total bright light from beginning to end, how is that going to be scary?Musically related, James Newton Howard's score did its job accordingly. For the horror elements there were screeching strings and sudden percussion for the scares. This is typical but also doable. For the scenes with the more creep out factor, Howard used piano frequently that only relied on a number of keys to give that uneasy tone. Piano was also used for the more emotional scenes and they were probably the most effective due to the execution and writing behind the composition. It certainly did not have a memorable theme but its overall listening experience can be done solo without watching the movie. It is a decent movie with some apparent problems, but it still entertains.Continuity flaws and authentic scares are not its strong points, but its creepy imagery, music and realistic practical effects help recover that loss. Along with that is Bruce Willis' most likable human performance to date with an interesting story and other believable showings from other actors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I see dead people,"One of the most frightening scenes in this film which people rarely seem to mention is at the beginning when that guy with no clothes on jumps into the house of our child psychologist, the speech he makes before he hits the trigger sent a shiver up my spine immediately.

Our child Psychologist becomes obsessed with helping one of his patients, a terrified young boy who sees dead people, the two leads are magnificent, a good script even if you guess the downbeat ending, at the time I did not because these kind of twists were still just about becoming in vogue.

Powerful Cultural Phenomenon,"'The Sixth Sense' is a captivating, chilling, and suspenseful supernatural horror film that became an instant pop culture phenomenon thanks to its engaging premise, effective storytelling, haunting atmosphere and of course that ultimate shocker of a twist ending that's still talked about even to this day. This is simply one of those rare movies that you could not miss as it was everywhere at the time and even still to this day it still holds up well and packs an emotional punch.The Plot = Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) a child psychologist, starts treating a young boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment) who encounters dead people and convinces him to help them.The movie is a grounded and sensitive drama about the afterlife that combines vivid scenes of suspense with real emotional drama and thanks to its slow yet thoughtful pacing everything comes together beautifully thanks to the intelligent screenplay and the stylish direction by M. Night Shyamalan who handles the production with immense conviction and a great deal of tension and mounting sense of dread throughout. The movie is one of those powerful movie going experiences that will forever resonate with you long after viewing and that's the testament to the film's overall quality.The acting performances in this flick are simply outstanding and is the main reason why this classic horror thriller works as well as it does. Bruce Willis gives perhaps his finest performance of his career with his compelling and well-rounded role. Haley Joel Osment gives a natural and impressive screen presence in his iconic role and really draws you in with his emotional performance. Toni Collette is fantastic as always as she creates a character of quiet desperation and compassion. Donnie Wahlberg gives a fantastic and complex performance in his limited screen in which he makes the most out of.Overall 'The Sixth Sense' is something that will be an imprint on supernatural horror sub-genre for all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A clever, gore-free horror thriller","Though many believe it to be true, The Sixth Sense is not M. Night Shyamalan's directorial debut (in fact, it's his third movie), but that myth holds up well because no one knew about him before this film. Not his proper first, then, but the first significant one, and deservedly so.Influenced by TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone, Shyamalan crafts a slow-burning, low-key thriller that grabs the viewer right from the beginning: psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is enjoying an evening at home with his wife when he's suddenly attacked by a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg). Months after this shocking prologue, Malcolm's marriage is in jeopardy and he needs some kind of redemption for what he believes to be a professional failure. He finds that redemption in the shape of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a terrifying psychic gift, best described by the kid himself: ""I see dead people!"".That line has been aped countless times since the movie's release, as has the now legendary twist ending, which has become a Shyamalan trademark. But knowing about the twist, or guessing what it is at an early stage of the viewing, is beside the point: it isn't the ending itself that matters, but the build-up. Consider other famous ""twist"" movies, like The Crying Game, Psycho, The Usual Suspects or Fight Club: the revelations at the end or halfway through those features are brilliant, no doubt, but if the overall film is bad it will diminish the epilogue's impact, no matter how smart the latter is.As such, when watching The Sixth Sense, the attention shouldn't go to the climax, but to everything that precedes it: how Shyamalan creates tension with very few camera movements, most of the creeps coming from James Newton Howard's score; how the story evolves slowly and naturally, enabling us to care for the characters and their inner struggles; how the subdued Willis and the creepy Osment constitute one of cinema's best on-screen duos, with able support from Wahlberg, Toni Collette and others (Mischa Barton's cameo is one of the scariest things of the '90s).The trick is in the smaller details, and that's what makes The Sixth Sense an immensely satisfying experience. Instead of gore and monsters, Shyamalan uses psychology and subtle chills to construct a memorably unsettling atmosphere, adding emotion on top. And, of course, the unsurpassed ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A very average ghost movie.,"This was a very average ghost movie about young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmont), who sees spirits of the deceased who do not know they're dead, and seeks the help of a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) to deal with his problems.There are some scary moments in this movie including the appearances of the wandering and pale-looking ghosts, and the part where Cole utters the classic line ""I see dead people"" while cold breath is coming out of his mouth.However, I think the lack of emotion in the film overshadows the horror elements, making this a pretty dreary movie at times. Most of the characters lack emotion passion and appear very wooden, except for Osmont's character. And, the plot was slow-paced and the cinematography was dull. I guess this is director M. Night Shyamalan's style, as other movies I've seen of his use the same elements. But, this style isn't really appealing.Again, overall, this is a very average movie.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

M. Night Shyamalan at his very best,"First off this movie has Bruce Willis and Toni Collette in it. That would make me want to watch it alone.

He starts to see a Child Psychologist to help work through is abandonment issues and learn how to communicate with his mother. During the course of their sessions, Cole confides in his Willis (Malcom) that he sees Dead people who want him to do things for him. While on the surface, this kind of looks like a ghost story where a medium speaks to ghosts, but this has a very interesting twist to it. Shyamalan can sometimes miss the mark with his twists, but he really got it right in this one.Its' well written, well played, well directed as that Shyamalan is completely in his element of mystery/suspense/plot twists/horror light. It's a movie that can be scary and spooky while at the same time developing characters to such a degree that you feel kind of like you're also watching a drama unfold between mother, son and therapist.I'm rating this movie high as that it's entertaining, suspenseful, and resolves itself nicely.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The twist at the end is nothing more than a cheap gimmick, it doesn't take much to throw that in the script, whether you saw it coming or not. The acting is ok, but at the end of the day there's not much depth or substance to this.

a truly amazing film,"The Sixth Sense is an absolute gem, it is one of those challenging films that will stick in your mind and have you thinking about it for weeks after watching it. The plot is downright genius, it's so cleverly and precisely orchestrated that the resulting twist will just leave your jaw rightfully on the floor! The twist is so shocking, I will avoid the overwhelming temptation to give it away, watching it in ignorance will ultimately have the best effect.The cast is superb, Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis gives a refreshing change of pace performance as award winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Joining him is the critically acclaimed child actor Haley Joel Osment, last seen in Artificial Intelligence. The acting talents of this young boy are phenomenal, I have never seen such powerful presence, he is mature beyond his years.Haley thoroughly deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination for his role as 'Cole'; a gifted young boy with the exceptional ability of having the sixth sense. Possessing this gift however only serves to create fear in the mind of a nine year old, and scepticism in everyone around him. Cole experiences terrifying, unwanted visits from the spiritual world, which inevitably leads to his social isolation. Dr. Crowe recognises Coles behaviour, and remembers many years back when he had a patient with the same symptoms. This patient however left a painful impact on his conscience, as he was unable to help. Dr. Crowe then seeks to redeem himself by doing everything in his power to help troubled Cole.As Cole is alone in seeing and hearing these suffering spirits, it is also he who must help them rest. To do this Cole must confront his nightmare. It is only with Dr. Crowe's suggestion to listen to them, he makes the discovery that they are not there to haunt him, but instead only want his assistance in their unfinished business.With the riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling and utterly forgettable, The Sixth Sense is a must see movie.The 2 disc collectors edition has wonderful special features, including exclusive interviews with the cast and writer/director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

However, Cole has certain special, supernatural abilities...Great movie with a brilliant twist at the end. For the most part it feels like a slow-burning horror movie. Writer-director M Night Shyamalan, directing his third movie (though the first two were very low-key), expertly builds the tension and intrigue.The twist, when it comes, is so unexpected, but works so well and fits so perfectly with the plot. Even watching the movie a second time you are hard-pressed to fault how the twist fits in with the plot.Some great drama too, and quite emotional at times, especially towards the end.Solid performance by Bruce Willis in the lead role. Good work from Haley Joel Osment as the boy. Good support from Toni Collette and Olivia Williams. Osment and Collette got Supporting Actor/Actress Oscar nominations for their performances.Just a pity Shyamalan couldn't reproduce this form in any of his subsequent movies. His next movie, ""Unbreakable"", was good, but not brilliant. ""Signs"" was mediocre and ""The Village"" was okay, but not great. After that his movies were very bad - ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender"" were very silly and pointless.

I see dead people!

Anyway the story takes place in the city of Philadelphia with Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe an award winning and well thought of psychologist who's assigned to a young man by the name of Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment)who's a timid and confused eight year old boy who's clearly different as he can see things before they happen even seeing dead people. And Cole has a loving and tough single mom(played by Toni Collette)and thru it all this is a journey to learn what haunts the young boy and his life.

Unbreakable was a decent movie, so was Signs and The Village but they're not even close to The Sixth Sense.

One of the years best films--with a jaw dropping final twist. ***1/2,"THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) ***1/2Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, Toni Collette and Glenn Fitzgerald Written and directed by: M. Night Shyamalan   106 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)By Blake French:""The Sixth Sense"" is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but ""The Sixth Sense"" does it so perfectly and convincingly  that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not.""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like ""You lied,"" ""You did not help me"" and especially mysteriously ""Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do."" He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.The film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient.After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, ""I see dead people,"" the young boy whispers, ""they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead,"" he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.The story setup to ""The Sixth Sense"" is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle.The film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the ""sixth sense"" seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like  ""come on, get to the point.""For the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than ""Entrapment."" More jaw-dropping than ""Wild Things."" More compelling than ""Goodbye Lover."" And  more awe inspiring than ""Arlington Road."" It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted  to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material. This is a very tricky ending to succeed with, but ""The Sixth Sense"" does it wonderfully.Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I jumped out of the seat!!!,"In this film that made M. Night Shyamalan's debut to the mainstream public for the first time, we can see his skills, imagination, and creativity in writing and screenplay at their best.This film takes you inside an immersive and suspenseful story, where doctor and child psychologist Malcolm follows the case of nine-year-old Cole.The plot is fairly straightforward, taking you from the beginning of the film into a story that grips you inside, makes you think, surprises you, scares you, makes you reconsider the idea you had and offers not a few twists and turns.The suspense grows more and more, moment by moment, scene by scene; anxiety, fear, curiosity, and interest blend into an excitement that stayed with me from the middle of the film until its end. I do not want to give spoilers, so I will stop here regarding the plot and its narration. The dialogues and characters are well written, they are original and keep your attention and are able to give a good rhythm to the film. You get attached to them and want them to get what they want in some way.I am unimpressed with the photography and set design, finding them quite flat, although there are some scenes that have become iconic for their beauty.The music, on the other hand, is something memorable, literally creating creepiness and tension. The final message of the film is deeper than it seems at first impact, with the ending the director gently takes you by the hand and then throws you down violently; very deep and inner themes are touched upon; I am not shy to say that I held back tears at the end of the film because of the intense emotion that came over me.I fully understand that it is a dated film and it is almost impossible to see the film for the first time without spoilers, but I particularly wanted to give my opinion without spoiling anything.This movie entertained me, scared, excited, and most importantly left me with a final ""message"" (at least that's what it got to me personally), making me think about some topics that are not at all obvious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I see dead people,"What happened to M. Night Shyamalan? It's astonishing to think of how far he's fallen when, looking back at his first big hit, The Sixth Sense, we can see just how talented a director and storyteller he can be. The film starts out simple enough: Bruce Willis is a child psychologist who failed a patient and meets a kid with similar issues he wants to help as a sort of redemption. Then, halfway through, it does a complete swerve and turns into a ghost story. This could feel like a bizarre tonal shift resulting in a film that feels like two separate ones. However, the script, pacing, and direction do a perfect job of making these two seemingly disconnected elements flow well into each other and compliment each other. Then, there's the twist ending, one of the greatest in film history. Unlike some of Shyamalan's later films, the twist in this film really makes you look at the events of the rest of the film differently, and it adds to the rewatchability, as you find yourself looking for clues to the twist in subsequent viewings.Willis should have been nominated for an Oscar for this, plain and simple. Don't get me wrong: Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette both earned their nominations and I commend the Academy for nominating a kid. However, Willis should have been nominated too. All three give spectacular, career best performances, and Osment's chemistry with both Willis and Collette easily carries the movie. The rest of the cast is great too.This was back when Shyamalan wasn't full of himself as a director, since he wasn't famous yet. As such, he's much more subdued and subtle with his filmmaking. There are a decent amount of one of his signature techniques, the long tracking shot. But they're used for a purpose other than just to be artsy, often to get across a bunch of info, like in the funeral scene. One thing I give credit for is the simple ways the ghosts' presence is established throughout, like it suddenly being cold, or cabinets that were closed when Collette leaves the kitchen being open when she returns. And when we do see the ghosts, they're effectively creepy and intense, with some surprisingly gruesome imagery to boot, but still sympathetic.Overall, The Sixth Sense is a truly excellent movie. It's scary, shocking, touching, and tear jerking all at the same time. Not to further harp on the Academy, but it should have won Best Picture that year. And the fact that I'm saying this about an M. Night Shyamalan film should tell you a lot. Here's hoping he starts making films of this quality again soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Good film -- nothing more,"I really wanted to love this film, I have waited for it to open in Sweden for so long. Unfortunately, I did not love it. I came pretty close to not even liking it, but well, in the end I did like it. Last night I saw ""Fight Club"" at the cinema, I hadn't expected very much, but I walked out of the cinema thrilled and enthusiastic and ""wowed"". I walked out, after having seen ""The Sixth Sense"", thinking about all the plot inconsistencies. I tried to overlook them and say: ""Look Anna, you're too stupid to realise that those ten or fifteen plot inconsistencies do not exist. Surely, there are a ""logic"" explanation for everything."" I failed. But as I said, I *did* like it and I was quite spooked at times, but after having seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and David Fincher (well, I didn't actually see *him*) in action the night before I just don't think I was ready to accept ""The Sixth Sense"" as a great movie experience. I *should* love this film, and I know that I probably would have if it wasn't for a) the boring first 45 minutes and b) the fact that I knew there was a twist. I think that if the ending had come as a *real* surprise, like ""oh-my-god-is-there-a-twist-in-this-film?!"" I would have appreciated it much more. Now I spent half of the movie looking for clues to the twist (I didn't know *what* the twist was, though).Well, the film is good and Haley Joel Osment is fantastic -- a child actor that would actually deserve a Golden Globe or an Oscar (unlike Anna Paquin). And Bruce Willis was good as well! Okay, he's not Kevin Spacey or Edward Norton, and he never will be, but he actually did a great job in this film. I'm surprised. Well, I give this film a 6 out of 10, although I thought a lot about giving it a 5. A huge disappointment -- but still a good film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
brilliant drama-mystery hybrid with a legendary ending and superb acting,"I've seen this be called a thriller and can't quite agree, nor would I consider it a horror. The scares are solely reliant on cliche music and blood, but for me it was just adding tension, which I'd say it did effectively. The writing is practically airtight, making rewatches even more enjoyable as you witness lol the clues regarding the ending. Cinematography isn't always straightforward and there are some creative approaches to certain scenes that I can really appreciate. As great as Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment were, for me Toni Collette was absolutely amazing. Throughout the movie, thanks almost solely to the script and delivery of lines, I'd feel chills and often the tickle of potential tears. At just over an hour and a half, pacing is solid as it is a drama, and although the whole ""I see dead people"" line doesn't even drop until 45min, everything leading up to that moment was effective.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
M. Night's masterpiece.,"Watching The Sixth Sense for the first time is a seriously creepy experience topped off with one hell of a clever twist. Subsequent viewings might lack the same level of spookiness, and prior knowledge of the ending robs the film of its novelty factor, but hindsight still makes for a very interesting watch: knowing the twist means that the viewer sees the film from a different viewpoint, paying particular attention to the details, thereby driving home what a superb film this is, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan clearly having gone to great pains to ensure that all possible plot-holes can be satisfactorily explained.Bruce Willis, taking a break from his usual tough-guy action roles, is excellent as child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, but the star's thunder is stolen by 11-year old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the child who can see dead people, who puts in an amazingly assured and thoroughly believable performance for one so young. Also making an impression are Toni Collette as Cole's concerned mother Lynn and Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe, Malcolm's wife.Sadly, M. Night Shyamalan has earnt himself a pretty rotten reputation as a film-maker in recent years thanks to succession of box-office flops, but don't let that put you off checking out this wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A mini-masterpiece that delivers shocks, surprises and thrills.","A child physiologist (Bruce Willis) with a rocky marriage comes to visit a troubled boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to be seeing the dead.The problem with movies is that someone has always been there first. I was lucky with Psycho in that I didn't know anything about the film before I saw it - although I would have dearly loved to see it on a cinema screen. Here I was told there was a ""twist"" and having been warned I looked out for the clues and got them.(Not so sure I would have done if I had come in stone cold and just let it wash over me, though!)Osment - as the little eight year old boy - is a revelation. He acts like he is thirty year old dwarf rather than a child. How does he do it? When I was that age I could barely prepare a piece of toast, Osment has to carry a major motion picture by his emotions alone. Truly as good a piece of acting as I have ever seen from a pre-teen.Willis lowers his voice and tries to compete - but he is being outclassed and he knows it too!This is a throwback picture in that the threat is outside and little glimpsed. It has the best of Hitchcock and a million B's to steal from; and this includes the reverse-of-norm wide shot - rather than close in on tragedy the camera pulls back as if not to intrude. There is a car accident scene where a medium-expanding-to-long shot is used in a masterful way.There isn't a lot to write about this film beyond general platitudes about performance and moody setting. This is clever in that it never gives you too much to hang on to - no barrel chested hero about to come charging to the rescue. It wants to throw you off balance, keep you off balance, lead you to believe that it is going one way and then shots off in another.True, there is nothing really essential about this film. Nothing that is going to change your opinion on anything - not even whether there really are ghosts and people that can communicate with them.Manoj Night Shyamalam might not be Hitchcock quite yet, but at least he has learnt a few of his better tricks and has even added a few of his own.Just because it is only escapist entertainment doesn't mean that it isn't also very good. It is actually very, very good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Thriller with a Twist,"My now-husband and I saw this in the theater together when we were first dating. Actually, I had gone to see it before that with friends, and loved it so much that I went to see it with him.If you've seen the movie, you know that the revelation at the end is a total shocker. I remember the people sitting behind us, who had also already seen it, talking about what was going to happen next, and nearly spoiling it for my husband (I kindly asked them not to say more). My husband is almost never surprised by a movie, but this one got him good.This story is so well-written and truly leaves you on the edge of your seat. I remember the the creator of it saying that he was worried that there were too many spoilers along the way and people would have figured it out before the ending - but I've never met anyone who said that. Going back and watching it again, you can see some clues, but the first time you see it, your mind is blown!

If the first time doesn't go well try it again.,"I know this is a modern classic, but it is not my favorite M. Night movie. In fact, I wasn't crazy about the Sixth Sense the first time I saw it and this second time; at least, I could pay attention to other details. It contains all the M. Night staples. Nice pull-backs on the camera during the ""One Step Questions"" scene between Willis and Osment. It takes place in 1999, but has a cool gothic late 70s/early 80s feel to it. The acting of Osment is freaky and helps to enhance the suspense and freakiness felt throughout the film.A test of a good movie such as this, in which the pay-off comes when you see it the first time, is watching it the second time to see how you were deceived the first time. The film has a way to accomplish its goals even after the first viewing. That's what makes it worthy of at least a B. I say that, because, unfortunately, the movie has a really gnawing, slow boil. It's such a slow pace that it is tough to sit still during the film. While I am saying to myself, ""Oh, that's how that works"" and ""I missed that the first time"", I have to struggle to stay awake. The film's slow pace can be draining so much that I forgot the whole film took place in Philadelphia. M.Night at least kept me at a B.8.2 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Far more than a horror film,"There are two kinds of great genre film. The first is the sort that exemplifies the conventions of the genre, while respecting the genre's limits. The second kind of genre film uses the rhetoric and archetypes of the genre to film to point beyond the limits of genre, to attain the level of the symbolic, the ethical and the spiritual.Thus , in the film Noir genre,Kiss Me Deadly is a brilliant example of the first kind of good genre film, while Touch of Evil is a brilliant example of the second. The greatness of The Sixth Sense-and I firmly believe that it is one of the handful of films from last year that can be classified as truly great-lies precisely in how it transcends its genre.The Sixth Sense resonates with Hawthornesque tonalities. It echoes Melville, Poe and Henry James ( I refer to James' great ghost stories, not his often tedious ""novels of manners"").The critics who saw only only a creepy, dull story with a twist at the end missed entirely the films extraordinary religious symbolism. The Bruce Willis Character is a soul in limbo, waiting to be saved. The instrument of salvation? A frightened, yet preternaturally gifted, child.Not a single performance in the film hit a false note..this is an extraordinary film about parents and children, about husbands and wives, and about life and death. The score, the cinematography, and the script were uniformly excellent. I i especially liked the filmmakers' brilliant use of the Philadelphia locale, and the way in which the cities dark history was alluded to. In short, a wonderful film and an exhilarating religious experience-SUPERB",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Does that sound odd?  Oh well.The focus of the movie seemed to be more the Bruce Willis character than the boy, but they both helped each other out.  So it was cool.  In a way, even though Bruce (first name basis) was the focus, the boy had the most important part.

A Twist of Fate,"M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a masterful fusion of psychological drama and supernatural thriller that redefined the genre upon its release. With its subtle storytelling, haunting atmosphere, and unforgettable twist ending, the film captivates audiences and remains one of the most iconic cinematic experiences of its time.Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist determined to help a young boy with a chilling secret. His restrained and introspective portrayal anchors the film, allowing the story's emotional depth to shine. Haley Joel Osment is extraordinary as Cole Sear, delivering a performance far beyond his years. His ability to convey raw vulnerability and fear makes every scene with him deeply compelling, earning him a place among the most memorable child actors in cinematic history.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing for rich character exploration and a gradual build-up of tension. Shyamalan's direction is impeccable, weaving foreshadowing and subtle clues throughout the narrative, which only become apparent upon the film's iconic twist ending. The cinematography enhances the eerie tone, with a muted colour palette and clever use of shadows and framing that heighten the sense of unease.The twist ending is, of course, the film's crowning achievement. Without spoiling it, the revelation redefines the entire story, prompting viewers to revisit the film with a new perspective. This narrative masterstroke solidifies The Sixth Sense as a standout in Shyamalan's career and a benchmark for twist-driven storytelling.While the film is nearly flawless, its pacing may feel slow to those accustomed to more fast-paced thrillers. However, this measured approach is what gives the story its emotional weight and allows for its powerful climax. The deliberate build-up ensures that every moment feels earned, making the eventual payoff all the more impactful.In conclusion, The Sixth Sense is a cinematic triumph that blends suspense, emotion, and masterful storytelling into an unforgettable experience. Its profound exploration of fear, connection, and redemption, coupled with its groundbreaking twist, ensures its legacy as a modern classic. Haunting and thought-provoking, the film lingers long after the credits roll, showcasing Shyamalan's storytelling prowess at its finest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
That twist caught me off guard!,"""Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone? I do. I do.""Shyamalan & his mind-numbing twists.

I have encountered countless curveballs before, but this is probably one of the trickiest ones of the bunch that I have come face to face with! And there is no shame in admitting the fact that I did not see it coming.On the whole, it's an efficient Horror-Drama; yes, I did call it a drama because Shyamalan tends to incorporate dramatic characteristics in his writing, irrespective of what genre his work may fall under. Whether it be a thriller, mystery, or horror; he likes to carefully craft his characters from scratch, give them distinctive personalities, and give them purpose, so that we as spectators would not perceive them as any notional creations but as ordinary human beings, who have flaws, who aren't perfect, to whom we all can associate with. And I think that's one of his distinguished qualities as a director.I have recently been on an M.

Stately thriller will divide audiences,"THE SIXTH SENSEAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhilst recovering from a recent trauma, a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) helps a little boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts.Released the same year as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999), another 'spook' movie which divided audiences and reaped dividends at the international box-office, M. Night Shyamalan's breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE plays much better on TV than it ever did in theaters. With its slow tempo and stately visuals, the movie takes a mature approach to its supernatural subject matter, revealing Osment's ultra-creepy 'secret' in piecemeal fashion, one scare at a time. Former tough guy Willis plays a vulnerable figure whose bond with Osment provides a level of stability absent from his personal life - devastated by an incident in the film's opening sequence, Willis' wife (Olivia Williams) seems to be drifting into a relationship with a young family friend (Glenn Fitzgerald) - and while Osment is the primary focus of Shyamalan's screenplay, it's Willis who holds the material together. Some viewers may be distracted by the film's deliberate pacing, while others will be affected by the gradual accumulation of creepy details, spiked by a couple of really good jolts. The much-lauded twist ending might have been more effective had it not been mentioned in EVERY SINGLE REVIEW (including this one!), making it possible for many people to guess the 'surprise' long before Shyamalan reveals his hand. Australian actress Toni Collette is superb as Osment's harried - but deeply loving - mom, and there are cameo appearances by Shyamalan himself and an unrecognisable Donnie Wahlberg (BAND OF BROTHERS).",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I came up with the final twist but rejected it a couple of times.  It is just too incredible.

I have a secret: I see the dead...,"I remember the movie ""The Sixth Sense"" very well. He stands on a par with those that have an unexpected ending, as you can now say ""twist"". And this finale really makes the whole story interesting, unusual and gives you goosebumps when in the final credits you sit with your mouth open and can't believe what happened.The author of the project was a master of his craft Indian M. Night Shyamalan. His creativity is guessed here. The atmosphere of the film, dialogues, unhurried narration, unexpected denouement - these are the hallmarks of the master. Shyamalan gives the audience a great thriller, which is built in such a way that every frame keeps in suspense. And even if there are no monsters in the plot, watching the movie for the first time in the evening in a dark room, I involuntarily pressed myself into an easy chair, as if looking for protection in it. Is it not the skill of the director and a perfectly presented story?The painting is stingy with bright colors. On the contrary, the film takes its gray muted tones, perfectly conveying through camerawork and high-quality music a certain surrealism of what is happening on the screen.There are excellent actors in the frame. Despite the big name of Bruce Willis, I think that the real decoration of this masterpiece was the young actor Haley Joel Osment, who perfectly played a boy named Cole, who actually could see dead people and tried to share this with Malcolm, who was embodied on the screen by ""Die Hard"" Willis. The rest of the actors are good, but the duet of Willis and Osment became memorable.I liked how the parallel storyline is served in the film. This is the relationship between the characters of Willis and Williams, who played the spouses. Each appearance of Anna Crowe, Malcolm's wife, is a kind of confrontation between the characters, who, as it seems to the viewer, have lost love and mutual understanding, distanced themselves from each other, and the wife does not listen to her husband at all. But the finale necessarily puts all the dots, allowing the viewer to finally understand the true reason for these complex relationships.""The Sixth Sense"" is an excellent original work that allows you to enjoy an unusual story. This is one of the best films of the director, who then gave us many more interesting pictures. My acquaintance with the author began with this painting in my childhood. Perhaps for this reason, I remember the film so much for its ambiguity and at the same time a gorgeous ending that it stuck somewhere deep in my soul and even decades later arrives somewhere there.The film is definitely worth watching. This will allow you to enjoy the high-quality atmosphere of the action, to see the world through the eyes of someone who is different from us, a boy who can communicate with the dead. Assuming for a moment that this is generally possible, you suddenly realize how hard and lonely this young boy is, whom his own mother does not believe, and others consider crazy. And only the hero of Willis, it seems, eventually begins to believe him. And in the end, he is completely convinced of the rightness of the child.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

We see dead people... ALL the time,"With social media explosion, just about every movie with a twist gets exposed long before it reaches audience. It's too bad. The Sixth Sense was Shyamalan's one hit wonder (although I actually like Devil). It's enormous success made him do a handfull of twisty movies which were, IMO, extremely mediocre and boring. But with this, he hit gold. It's one of those movies that changes everything on repetitive viewings. And it finally established that Bruce Willis CAN act. If I remember correct, young Haley Joel Osmont made history, being the youngest nominee for an Oscar. It's NOT a horror or a thriller, it's a mystery, much like another great movie, The Others, which shares some DNA. It's a threesome masterpiece, with troubled Crowe (Willis), in a piss poor marriage (we think... ), young Cole (Osmont), seeing dead people and traumathised, and his mom, wonderfully played by then pretty unknown Toni Collette. The way Shyamalan slowly wrapes open the story is pure, Hitchcockian mastery. We actually SEE everything, but Mr. M. Night knows he holds the cards. I actually remember at the cinema, you could almost feel your hair raising when we see Cole all alone having an encounter with a ghost. I would have given it 10/10 some years ago. But unfortunately, social media again has destroyed some of it's stature with memes, gifs and parodies. I guess it comes with the turf, being a modern classic, highly influental.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Amazing!,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. In the mid parts of the movie it kind of made me question on where the movie is really going and how this will ever tied up into an ending but oh my..

"Not recommended after Kilbourn and before ""Tricks and Clues""","The Sixth Sense ends with a twist that must have been thrilling to see for those who saw it unprepared, but that pleasure was denied me several months ago by TV's Craig Kilbourn, who purposefully gave it away for a laugh (I will not do that here).  Beyond that, the director makes some interesting efforts at being stylish, but this too was partly ruined for me by his own somewhat pretentious `Tricks and Clues' commentary at the end of the video. As for the acting, Bruce was good but much more interesting in Twelve Monkeys and Haley has been overhyped if not overrated.   And the overall story, especially the transitional section which precedes the twist, is weak and the pace is slow.  Meanwhile, oddly enough, I still laugh at Craig Kilbourn.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best films of 1999!,"The acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I've ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Masterful Blend of Suspense and Emotion,"This film is a haunting and thought-provoking thriller that expertly weaves together suspense and emotional depth. Bruce Willis delivers a strong performance as a child psychologist who helps a young boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, who claims to see dead people. The chemistry between the two characters is touching and adds a lot of heart to the story.The atmosphere is incredibly eerie, and M. Night Shyamalan's direction creates a sense of unease throughout. The plot is cleverly constructed, keeping you guessing until the very end. The twist is one of the most famous in film history, and it definitely lives up to the hype.While the pacing can feel slow in some parts, it builds tension beautifully and allows for character development. The themes of grief, loss, and understanding resonate deeply, making the film more than just a typical horror flick.

The Sixth Sense phenomenon.,"Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe takes on the case of a deeply troubled boy named Cole Sear. At first Cole is reluctant to be helped, but as Malcolm gets closer to the boy, Malcolm learns the root of Cole's fears, he claims he sees ghosts.The Sixth Sense was a monster hit back in 1999, a deftly crafted ghost story with a kicker that was talked about by all and sundry, the box office bulged and the critics did rave. Nowadays you will find hundreds of people proclaiming that the film is boringly formulaic, that they worked out the film's premise easily in the first quarter of the film, or that the film is a mere cliché, funny how I don't remember it like that back in 1999! The box office bulged because many went to see the film more than once, they went (myself included) back to see just how director M. Night Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Director) managed to bluff us and pull the rug from under our feet. I remember vividly both times I saw it in the cinema, the crucial turning point of the piece bringing a collective audible gasp from the viewers sunken in their respective seats, that's the sort of impact that carries a film's reputation far and wide, and that's the reason why I will never rate the film lower than 10/10.Repeat viewings of The Sixth Sense obviously dim its star appeal because we know the tricks of the directors trade, but the film still ranks to me as one of the best of its type for so many other reasons rarely mentioned. The writing from Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Screenplay) is surprisingly complex, the piece masquerading as a horror picture is emotionally charged, linking children with the paranormal through loss and a need for understanding, the need for closure of unresolved differences, but chiefly and crucial to the film's heart is the message of connection before it's too late.The performances are incredible, Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is perfectly understated, all the pointers for the denouement are there for us to see, but such is the actors performance, and we now know he is cutely having to play his cards close to his chest, are hidden from us until the revisit of the picture reveals it all. Hayley Joel Osment (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful, for a child performance in a film of this type to not be over sentimental, is quite an achievement. Sympathetic Cole may be, but Osment never lets it become less than the accepted level of child vulnerability. Rounding out the great trio of leads is Toni Collette (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actress) as Cole's mother, Lynn, fabulous in portraying the love and confusion in Cole's troubled world, this story arc between the two is expertly realised. The direction from Shyamalan is very restrained, forgoing out and out shock value for periods of disquiet, he uses sounds to make the audience sense the unease unfolding in this creepy tale, while his camera work, full of draw ins and pull outs-and subtle side shifts, is adroitly in tone with the narrative. The score from James Newton Howard flits beautifully between the uneasy periods and the sustained moments of query, while Tak Fujimoto's cinematography puts a gorgeous funereal texture over this part of Philadelphia.If you haven't seen it then don't believe the naysayers, because The Sixth Sense deserved every penny/cent it made, its a wonderful, creepy, and yes, at times, a beautiful picture. A film that still ranks as one of the best ghost stories ever crafted. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A very interesting twist at the end which I will not spoil and I did not see coming!,"Very cute kid with good child-acting talent!

If it wasn't for the plot twist..,"If it wasn't for the 'shocking' twist at the very end of the movie, I believe this film would not be considered a ""masterpiece"" or whatever else many considers it.

Apart from that, you have to acknowledge Bruce Willis and and Haley's terrific performance.There are many subtle and obscure hints that, if attentive enough, one could deduce or eventually guess what is bound to happen. But, whether one could have figure it out early in the movie or at the end, you cannot shove aside Shymalan's thought-provoking ending.Once again, if it wasn't for the plot twist, this movie's is but a mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Only Okay,"I liked the movie that first time that i saw it, but for me a really good movie has to be one that can be watched over and over and still really liked.  This was one that just cant be watched over and over again like say Army of Darkness (lol).If you evaluate the movie on the whole then it is good but take away the last 5 minutes and you have a so-so film. I understand the whole lets put a ""wierd twist on the end"" thing and im not gonna sit here and say that i had it figured out when i watched it the first time because i didnt.  In fact that is the best part about it.  No one knew what was going on  until the very end and it was done very well.  All i am saying is take away the end and it is a dull movie.

"""I ain't 'fraid of no ghosts!""  Until I saw the Sixth Sense.","I believe the Sixth Sense was researched thoroughly as I have heard demonologists speak on the subject of the paranormal: and much of what these clairvoyants had to say was incorporated into the movie.  It was very unsettling indeed.The acting job by Bruce Willis was probably the best of his career. He is so believable and he's not even hanging from an elevator shaft or racing in a cab through Central Park.  He's just acting, and he's great in this film. As for Osment, well he deserves the Oscar.  If he doesn't get it, then the academy is even more blind than I thought.  (I.E. Shakespeare in Love beating Private Ryan-get bent!)  Quite simply these actors make the characters frighteningly believable.And that's just for starters.  For the first time in years this was a movie with an actual story.  I know, unreal idea in today's big Hollywood, with their awful big money concepts.  It just proves, give the public a story rather than Godzilla, and they'll go see it.  There's no reliance on special effects made on some turbo-geek's CGI machine to drive the film. Shyamalan has written an amazing script with twists and turns that will leave you with goosebumps for the full two hours.  He also did an incredible job directing the film, with filters, and angles that will make you quite nervous, as if you're with the boy and Willis throughout the terrifying twists.As for the ending, go see the movie and you will be blown away. It's right up there with The Usual Suspects as far as surprises go.  And bring a warm jacket to the theater because you will have the chills as each plot twist hits you.Simply put this is by far the best movie I've seen all year.

This film goes down as one of my favourite thrillers of all time due to a fantastic plot and a fantastic cast. It is a very moving film that reduced me to tears at the end.

Enjoyable but far from brilliant,"I liked this movie because it is good entertainment. Its ideas of ghosts and spirits, of powers that heal are nice. And no one can possibly have forseen the unforgettable endingHowever, the movie is a far cry from ""Brilliant!"" or ""Masterpiece!"" status. At times very slow-moving, it centers too much on the little boy's supernatural encounters, incidents and not nearly enough on the effect it has on the people around him. The plot is not well-developed enough. It seems that Bruce Willis' character decides ""ooooh if you help them, they will go away."" He does, and they go away. Very sappy and forgettable.Haley Joel does give a good performance for someone of his age, and Willis is crucial in his supporting role. The conversation with his mother in the car was touching, but moments of real emotional epiphanies are few in this movie.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

This film is clever in more ways than one,"The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that each time you watch it, you can pick up something new. M. Night Shyamalan and his crew created a world and characters that were easy to believe in as well as engage in. There may have been one or two scenes that were necessary, but the movie never felt like it was dragging on. It also doesn't rely on just scaring the viewer, but draws out all sorts of emotions.The biggest thing about this film is its cleverness. Everyone mentions the twist at the end, but I argue that this film was good without it. The film is complex enough to keep interest. Yes, the twist is what this movie if really known for, but I think that it sometimes over-shadows the story of a young boy who sees dead people. All of the parts of the film work really well together and I never felt there was something that was out of place.The cinematography is not ground breaking, but it creates lots of contrast that definitely adds to the story. I thought the music was a great fit as it was not too overpowering at emotional moments, but was able to create suspense when needed. Haley Joel Osment's acting is fantastic. He looked as professional as the great adult actors. Although Bruce Willis acts this part very well, I may have gone with a different actor because of his reputation as hard edged characters.As I said before, it is as rewarding if not more rewarding to watch it more than once. It has many little ins and outs that make this film more complex than most. Overall, this film is very entertaining to watch and I think has more to say than what is on the surface.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Stood the test of time,"The sixth sense even in 2019 proves to be an absolute treat. The movie at its heart is a film that seeks to explore death and how that death affects those around us through the use of Cole. And while I was sceptical as child actors can vary substantially, I am happy to report the actor does a excellent job. In fact every one of the actors does a good job at portraying their characters. The story itself is quite good and the main twist is a welcomed surprise although a bit easy to guess once you're about 60% through the film. The only main problem is its opening which is quite slow and a bit hard to sit through. However other than that, this movie is something every film goer should watch, it has after all in my eyes stood the test of time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Frightening, intelligent and sensitive","Three were the numbers of times I watched this movie till I get the conclusion that... it's perfect. Before I watched it for the first time, I already had great expectations, what is not good, the chances you have to be disappointed is much bigger then. But the opposite happened: I left the cinema wondering how M. Night Shyamalan could do something so perfectly arranged and also coherent. And I am not just talking about the plot, the soundtrack, the camera movements, everything seems to be in the right place.Cole is a twelve-year-old boy who would be like every children in his age if there weren't this simple fact: he can see dead people! The story is focus on Cole's little issue and how Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) will find a way to help him. The movie also has beautiful background themes like: love, losing a close person, familiar relationships, human cruelty, friendship, human rational beliefs and how people always try to find reasonable explanation for everything, beyond of course the relationship between doctor and patient, how they have to be confident with each other to find out the answers.It's not a movie to make people scared like horror films, but it has the elements that can make you jump out of the chair and fell chills in your neck whiling watching it. The bad news is after this movie you might have another opinion about chills ... The same thing will happen about things we can't find anywhere... Never mind, when you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about.The three things I admire the most about this movie, one for each time I saw it, are: the Haley Joel Osment performance  an Oscar deserved one, the techniques  how it really keeps the watchers attention, and how everything directs to the amazing surprise at the end.

"Sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and see dead people","Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AAThe Sixth Sense is about Malcolm (played by Bruce Willis) who is a child psychologist. He is assigned to help Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a child who can ""see dead people."" The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has got a lot of attention and it has overshadowed the rest of the film. I'll talk about the twist, but it is only a part of what makes up the film. The twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever, it's not fun if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist makes sense. And surprising. I've seen a few movie twists and some are surprising, but don't make any sense, because the director didn't provide enough hints. It is incredible that these scenes can be seen in many different ways after the twist is revealed. The movie is effective because it works on this basic level. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" moving is that it never cheats. Everything we see is real, and feels real, real meetings, conversations, and its our assumptions that fool us. Illusions are scattered throughout the film and that is what Shyamalan is when he directed this movie, an illusionist.Real horror is The Sixth Sense, events that could happen. Instead of excessive violence, nudity, lazy jump scares, boo, ah. The Sixth Sense looks at, separation, depression, bullying. Sad things, scary things to happen to you in real life. A scene when they attend a funeral with a disturbing video tape was frightening. Now when you hear that, you may think, some gory old woman will give us a fake jumpscare, no. No gore, no jumpscares. Movies are missing out on this in recent years, yes the jumpscare will startle you because its unexpected, but it's a scary face and / or a loud noise. This is a touching moment when a father realises a terrifying secret of why his daughter died. Because this is a non spoiler review I will just say that it is brilliantly directed and pure terrifying.You could just watch this movie if you love the craft of acting because Osment puts on one of the greatest acting performances by a child that cinema has ever seen. Malcolm, his wife and Cole's mother are all brilliant in this and believable. A scene near the end of the movie, between mother and son, finally understanding each other, it was so beautiful.Now when I think of a horror film, I think of R rating movies, jumpscares, monsters and gore. I was really surprised that a movie as upsetting as ""The Sixth Sense"" wasn't given a restricted rating.It was great watching this movie when I did, I just watched The Visit, another film of Shyamalan.I have never seen a moving picture that has had this much attention to detail. The director removed certain colours from scenes to create different effects so it made sense in the long term. This movie shows that when you make a great horror movie you will be rewarded with the money you so desperately want. It is great to see people come together and create something incredible and do their job.The ending adds more interest after the movie concluded, and I was searching up all the easter eggs straight after. But that isn't the only way you can enjoy this film. This is one of my favourite horror films. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" lets suspense build. I said it before and I'll say it again. It doesn't rely on excessive violence, blood and gore, or cheap jump scares. It has terrific acting, story, pace, messages, hidden messages! This is a movie that will not be taken from its rightful place as the best horror film of all time and if you were like me and pondering on the idea of see it. Go see it, anyway you can, it's a movie you need to see before you die, and before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!A+Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It is certainly good; it's just a shame it was spoiled for me,"THE SIXTH SENSE - 1999Directed by M Night ShyamalanStarring Bruce Willis & Haley Joel OsmentPlot Overview: Young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is haunted by a dark secret: he is visited by ghosts. Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unfathomable.Let me start of with saying this is definitely a 'good' movie. I imagine it'd be great if only it was not spoiled for me before watching. That is not the film's fault so I can't exactly criticise it for that but I can't rate it higher than my initial reaction to the final product. I am sure I'd like the movie more without the spoiler but, as it stands, it was spoiled for me and I can't give it a 8, 9 or 10 based on a hunch on what my reaction would have been.Due to that, I will provide critique on other aspects about the film. The story for example. The actual story for the movie is pretty weak, in my opinion. Obviously, it builds to the end and I will say I love the idea of the ending. It all builds to a conclusion and I admire that. I love the hints throughout but I just can't say I was impressed by the STORY whilst knowing the end. Again, not the film's fault but I can't rate it higher based on what I think I would have thought under different circumstances.Now for things that I actually like about the film. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr Malcolm Crowe and I love the way his character adapts over the course of the movie. Haley Joel Osment gives the most creepy, odd, perfect performance in this film. He was truly exceptional in this role and stole the show for me. Without speaking for extended periods of time, he conveys so much fear, and anxiety, and worry, and sadness with just his face, and that is impressive for an ACTOR to do, never mind just a child. Toni Collete was pretty convincing as Cole's mum.Both the cinematography and editing were really really good in this movie. Shyamalan relies on building atmosphere and anxiety instead of blatantly using jump scares to incite fear in to the viewer. Why didn't this style of horror carry over from 1999 instead of the style of 'The Blair Witch Project'? This style was so much better and relied on actual SKILLFUL FILM MAKING, not cheap scares and horrific camera work.As a whole, The Sixth Sense is a very enjoyable movie and I will probably purchase it on Blu Ray. I am confident that if I did not have the film spoiled, I would have liked it so much more than I did. It is for that reason that I can't rate this film any higher and why I will rate this film 7 'DEAD PEOPLE' out of 10. I recommend you see this film regardless if it has been spoiled or not. I imagine you'll at least enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Twist threw us off twenty years ago...,"Today? Half of the audience will guess it, thanks to all new movies using the same kinds of twist endings. I wasn't impressed by it back in 1999, and I got bored rewatching it recently. No amount of good acting can make up for how slow, and stretched out this movie can be. And this only comforted myself, in the idea that M. Night Shyamalan is an overrated director.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
They should've let Blair Witch die down first,"First: WHY DIDN'T THIS KID AUDITION FOR ANAKIN?!Outstanding movie on all fronts.

Riveting from beginning till end!!!,The Sixth sense is my most favourite film.  The directing and writing are amazing.  The score and cinematography are 100% perfect.  And the acting is fantastic.

Unbelievable,This movie was a refreshing breeze in the midst of the summer horror rage.

worst film of the year,"Here's a homework assignment for everyone who has hyperventilated with hyperbole over this film and praised its ending. Go read Ambrose Bierce's short story, OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE, and then rent Adrian Lyne's JACOB'S LADDER. And if neither of them surprised or shocked you, then you will know how I felt after watching this trash. There is nothing scary, enlightening or moving about this film. It's a sugar-coated, sappy film with no edge at all, and strictly for fans of GHOST. The so-called twist does not redeem it at all and there is just nothing good I can say about SIXTH SENSE.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Well-crafted story with a superb twist!,"This film thoroughly surprised me. Great acting, excellent characters (well-defined and intriguing), a hypnotic storyline, and lots of chills. I'm used to predicting endings even when they are a bit of a twist, but this one came from left field for me. I measure the success of a movie not just by the actual in-theater experience, but also about how much the film stays in my mind and keeps me talking about it after I've left the theater. The Sixth Sense had audience members immediately turn to their companions (as soon as the credits rolled) to discuss their interpretation, and I know I thought about it days later.Bruce Willis is fantastic in the role of the child psychologist, but Haley Joel Osment is the one who most surprised me. This boy has a great career ahead of him. His emotional range and sincerity is impressive, *especially* considering his youth. You go, Haley!I look forward to watching this moving again to see what I missed the first time around. Bravo to M. Night Shyamalan for a brilliant screenplay and tight, skillful directing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Decent movie.,"This movie was not the best, but don't get me wrong it was very good for you first timers.  I agree with the Academy that this movie should not be best movie of the year, solely based upon the fact that it is a movie you only want to watch twice, but you want to watch it and fast forward pass the boring parts.  Believe me, there are boring parts, and that is why I gave this movie a low vote.  And also, because it took away the notification from Stir of Echoes, a great scary movie with Kevin Bacon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I feel like a dead person,"I wanna start by saying what the heck was the Academy thinking nominating that kid for an award? Poor Michael Caine just got slapped in the face by being put up against that kid. All the kid did was sit in a corner, cry and say 'I see Dead People' and cry some more. And not to mention 'Long Unnecessary Pauses' makes another appearance here. (See Traffic review). And COME ON! The egomaniac director just HAD to make a cameo as a doctor.. for what? NO PLOT addition at all! He just HAD to stick his face in the film. He asks the mother if she beat the kid, when we all KNOW she didn't.. did he think that was a unique plot twist? Ye gods! Ok I will admit the final twist did get me. But really folks.. it's a creampuff of a twist when compared to the Usual Suspects or the japanese film, Audition (1999). I just think the general public is easily amused and everything is more intelligent than them, so they easily say ""wow that was so innovative!""Watch more movies people!

One of the better thrillers in quite a while.,"I've seen the Haunting, Blair Witch, and Sixth Sense.  Sixth Sense and Blair Witch were equally 'good', although very different movies (Haunting doesn't even rate, in my book).  I'd give the edge to Sixth Sense.  When the final twist occurs, it's a real eye-opener, because the story has carried you along so well.  I wouldn't really call Sixth Sense a horror movie, although it does have some good scares, but it's a lot more subtle.  The acting by all the characters is great.  Yeah, you can find some plot holes, but if you do that during the movie, you're wasting your time.  Enjoy the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Best Horror movie,"Most horror movies try to scare you with heads and hands being chopped off, after that has been done 60 or 70 times it becomes stale and boring, the Sixth Sense brings a new and fresh twist, this is by far one of the two or three scariest movies ever made. As a person who has had dreams about death that came true and has had my grandmother come and visit me after her death I related to this movie 100%. The Sixth Sense gives you clues about Bruce Willis during the movie but you are to busy centering on the boy to pay attention.

So many movies feature so much tedious, unreal dialogue--assuming they feature a plot at all--that it struck me as a real revelation that M. Night Shyamalan's script could ring so true and sound so human. I think I am going to savor a number of scenes for as long as memory lasts, some scenes were gripping, involving and satisfying; credit should go to the actors surely, but surely to the screenplay, as well.I hope Haley Osment receives at least an Oscar nomination.

Thrilling and mysterious,"Well, all I know before watching this movie is that it has a big twist at the end, and that it was a game changer. therefore, I watched the movie expecting some mind-boggling twist but it turned out it was what I was suspecting from the very beginning. Really, it wasn't that hard to figure if you pay attention, He never talked to anyone except Cole and he was acting all dodgy. But it was really a good twist and I'd be lying if I say I wasn't surprised.The atmosphere of the movie was eerie and creepy and so was the score.

Watchin it now for the millionth time.,"If I hear one more comment about how 'This movie wouldn't have been the same without the ending' or 'It's a movie reliant on the plot twist' I fear my head may well explode and I'll be another of the young Cole Sear's visitors.Where to begin. This movie is more than a twist ending. It's how movies should be made. From the beautifully haunting score by James Newton Howard, the unbelievably sophisticated performance by Osment (I hate pretentious child actors doing scary, ie 'The Ring', but this kid is special), the dark,moody directing of Shyamlan, Bruce Willis's excellent tortured performance (fast believing he's the best at tortured expressions in the business. See Twelve Monkeys & Unbreakable) and the unsung hero or heroine in the form of Toni Collette (easily the pick of the performances. Haven't seen her mentioned much. Watch the movie again and just focus on her).So what's bad about this movie....ummmmm. Give me a minute or two. Nothing. Not a thing. Its a masterpiece. Need more evidence?Focus on the little subtleties in the movie. I'm not talking the 'Rules and Clues'. I'm talking human eccentricities. Those things that breathe life into a character. I don't care about the horror. My favourite bits:The 'step backwards' scene. The camera from Cole's POV zooming out. The fact Cole wears his father's glasses with the lenses taken out. His father's watch he found in the drawer. The fact he pays the kid to pretend to be his friend for his mothers benefit. The line 'They don't have meetings about rainbows.' The 'shopping trolley fun ' scene.Obviously I still like the obvious scenes (the twist revelation, the 'revealing to his mother the truth, Watching it again and missing the clues) buts it's the human characteristics I like.There's so much more than just a twist movie here and it pains me to think that people that think otherwise should have a voice on here. Then again everyones entitled to there opinion. Even if it's the wrong one...which I guess is subjective anyway.Anyway, I'm rambling. Go watch it now...I don't care if you've seen it. Watch it again....and again...and again.This is how to make movies.Welcome any feedback/criticism. The e-mails there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Worth Watching a Second Time,"It just played on ABC, (I managed to stay awake through 73 minutes of ads!), and was surprised that there are some parts of the dialog throughout the movie that are worth hearing a second time around because they make more sense. I also heard stuff I must not have paid enough attention to the first time maybe because I didn't have to try to analyze anything.For example, the first time I watched it, I didn't really connect the two 'halves' of a 'particular' exchange between Malcom and his mother at the end and found out in the second viewing that they go together like book ends. The first time I may have been scrambling to recall what else I already knew from earlier in the movie about the 'subject' of the first part of their conversation and missed that the basis of second part is a direct result of the first part not an added amplification of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"AH, It all makes ""sense"" to me now!","Unlike most movies, the SIXTH SENSE will leave you talking about it for an hour after you see it!

We were so impressed with the way everything that happened throughout all made sense by the end, and that all the little bits (the ""clues"") throughout hung together to support the ending, unlike the ""flaws"" in the plots of most so-called ""intelligent"" movies these days.

Horror at it's finest,"I don't usually like horror movies, for most of them (at least the newest ones) are more sick and disgusting than scary and intriguing. I was, therefore, a bit skeptical about The Sixth Sense... but the movie paid off. Very few horror films have made me feel like this one... and even fewer ever made me think like this one. That feeling when you watch a movie, and with every scene you become more eager to know what will come next is priceless, and you experience it on this film constantly. If there is anything at all bad to say about M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, it's that he only made one movie on this level. All of his other works are much inferior, but ""The Sixth Sense"" belongs on the top of horror film ranks, among Kubrick's ""The Shining"", ""Hitchcock's Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
best film this year so far,"Everything Blair Watch was not but wanted to be- well written, scary, incredible acting across the board (and I concur with the general concensus, Haley Joel Osment deserve *at least* an Oscar nomination - and not as a token supporting actor, but as a lead.  He carries the film), brilliant direction, and most of all, a plot!  And what a plot it is.  I was totally engrossed in the trauma that this young boy was going through.  I had no idea about the twists the film would take and if you read these critiques it's unfortunate that the fact that there is a twist ending is revealed. You're better off not trying to figure it out, but instead allow yourself to be transported into young Cole's world.  Lighting and color are used wonderfully to set the mood, often changing within a scene.  The music, which can so often ruin a good shock by being more powerful then what's on the screen instead hightened each moment perfectly.There are some truly scary moments but this is not a horror film.  It's drama with some supernatural elements, so don't be put off by a poor marketing campaign.  As with most twist endings meant to spin everything you've just seen 180 degrees, this one leaves many questions unanswered but if you believe in the world the movie draws you into, these are easily overlooked.  I was unfamiliar with M.

A Real Bad Letdown,"I found this Bruce Willis suspense quite a letdown as it offers no action and is host to a diabolical music score. Of course, you will say that it is not an action movie  even so, there are no memorable scenes even in the suspense category and the movies dark and moody atmosphere gave me a very negative feeling. All feedback I have heard for this film is Wow, fantastic' but it has yet to make the tiniest impact on myself, be it on the big or small screen.

Bruce Willis once and for all shows that he can act without the use of a gun and a few explosions, he impressed me with his emotional side and pulled off a very believable part.  As for Haley Joel Osment it is a pleasure to see a young actor rely on emotion and acting ability instead of ""cuteness.""

The two form a trusting relationship and gradually, Cole's horrifying secret/problem is revealed... both orally and visually.Excellent performances, storyline, direction and a hauntingly splendid score make M.

With great acting, directing, and writing, this movie became a classic.  It was creepy, not scary, and had such a great story that touched you in the heart.  Now tell me a horror movie thats done that to anybody.  Bruce Willis, an underrated actor in my opinion, did a hell of a job playing the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe who helps a boy, played also greatly by Haley Joel Osment, who sees dead people. Also great writing and directing by M. Night Shayamalan,  who is right now in the most famous director list right now.  He probably created the most shocking ending of all time in any movie.  Pretty much like Hitchcock.  Great film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Overrated and not too entertaining.,"I so far dislike M. Night Shyamalan's works after seeing ""Signs"" and ""Village"".I finally saw more of Sixth Sense, more like Six Cents in someone's pocket.About Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child physiologist portrayed by Bruce Willis who meets with Cole Sear, a kid in Philladelpha who is mentally challenged, and living with a single mother.Cole can also see the dead, in other words he can see ghosts walk around like regular people. And the dead sometimes don't know they're dead at all. This frightens him a lot, and makes his mother worry. And thinks he need serious help. While Dr. Crowe does all he can to help Cole out with his unexplainable power.I can't say I enjoyed it at all, I didn't expected it to be great or anything, since I hated the way Signs and Village were. I'm just saying that Sixth Sense is a movie that doesn't seem well done. it needed some more plot wholes to explain the stuff they didn't even bother to explain. Least it wasn't as confusing as that ""Village"" movie which had so many flaws in it.Bruce Willis was the only actor I know in the entire movie, he was alright in this one, but he's done way better roles in other better films than this one.That and Cole is nothing compared to Danny from ""Shining"" or the ""Omen"" kid.

Finally a movie with a brain!,"Whatever your view is on The Sixth Sense you have to admit that it has got people talking! How long has it been since you've felt compelled to sit down and just *talk* about a movie? For me, it had been quite a while and then I went and saw The Sixth Sense. And I left the cinema having been both scared and moved. I'd had goosebumps, a big smile on my face, and tears in my eyes just over one movie.The acting is seamless - Oscar nominations for the three leads, please! - the cinematography is so moody, as is the music, and the script is SO different from anything you're likely to come across in a long time.Yes, the movie has a twist, and, yes, the movie would have been great even without the twist. BUT what is important to me, personally, is not the nature of the twist. It's the fact that here is a movie with a BRAIN. Unlike the ending of The Usual Suspects which was great but in the end just made me feel manipulated and cheated, when The Sixth Sense twist happens you will inevitably go ""Oh THAT'S why..."" and you will want to see the movie again because you know that it'll be a totally different movie the next time you watch it. The whole premise has changed. In fact, this is two movies in one! A scary story about a boy seeing ghosts and a touching story about... :) See for yourself!!!I cannot recommend this movie enough. Unless you are very cold-hearted or have a short attention span (Yes, unlike so many modern-day movies, this one actually requires that you feel and think as well as concentrate on what's going on), you will love it and you will want to go back to it again, because although close scrutiny will reveal holes in the plot, it's a cracking good story that leaves you *thinking*.

"""I see dead people, and some of them don't know they're dead!""","""The Sixth Sense"", released in 1999, and starring Bruce Willis, gives a new version of the age old mystery regarding life after death.  Does the dead person immediately leave this world, or is there a time when the spirit has a chance to stay around awhile?  This film will cause the viewer to ponder that mystery while watching the cast wrestle with that concern, and watching dead people appear, then leave the screen.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist that takes on a case that involves a child, Haley Joel Osmond, who has a problem relating to peers and his single parent.  Willis has recently been involved in a situation that left him wounded, and this is one of his first cases since a shooting that occurred at his home.  Willis is able to establish a working child-doctor relationship with Cole, the Osmond character, but at the same time finds his own relationship with his wife chilling, even to the point of not existing. During the film, there are several scenes that involve Dr. Crowe, (Willis) with his wife, and she totally ignores him, as if he weren't even there.The film does hold the viewing public in a suspense-filled grip, with the ending being somewhat expected, but nevertheless, causing the watcher to want to see the film again to see what they missed.  A good film to have on VHS or DVD, as there are some excellent commentaries on both formats in regards to the clues that were given during the film.

"Brilliant, because is believable","This movie is a must. Not only cause the performances are excellent, not only cause the script and direction are great but also because it makes you believe in Ghosts. The plot takes you to the patient doctor relation between: Bruce Willis (Dr. Malcolm Crowe) & Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear), which is beautifully done. But nothing is what is seems. Cole is not just a crazy child, with a tuft family past: he sees ghosts; and nor his mother neither his doctor can't believe him. The process that takes place till Dr. Crowe realizes that the Kid is not telling lies is masterly developed: thrill, drama and the boy's explanation of the supernatural submerge the spectator into the history forcing the catharsis. The experienced viewer can resolve the ending before it happens, only if he is analyzing instead of enjoying and even though it thrills you. The movie's success relies on a seriously developed plot that considers actual life experience and its relation with the supernatural (understand as common things that can happen to anyone). This key factor is the reason why scary movies are great or just ridiculous entertainment, is what separates The Sixth Sense & The exorcist from Freddy and Jason for example.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

There is nothing there to really set this film apart, and that little spark that makes you think ""WOW!"" when you watch something mindblowing is quite clearly missing, despite what seem like considerable efforts to put it there.

Excellent Overall,"One of the most enjoyable movies this year, with a most excellent ending. This is a movie best seen without reading any reviews, including this one. So don't read further if you haven't seen it.I found the pacing to be a bit slow in the first 45 minutes, but the wait is well worth it.  Excellent performances by all, with Willis surprisingly effective and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment)'s  being Oscar-caliber.  A thought provoking movie with a number of good scares.  While highly recommended, the movie does contain some (very few) false cheap scenes, including an early one involving a picture frame and a later one involving a videotape.For an opposite review, I would recommend the brutal (and pretty funny) review in the New York Times by Steven Holden, where he gives the movie the ""Touched by an Angel"" award for ""gaggingly mawkish supernatural kitsch"" and where he gives Willis the ""Robin Williams Award"" for ""ineffable, twinkling, half-smiling misty-eyed empathy with adorable tots.""Interesting factoid:  Toni Collette, who gives a great performance playing the young boy's mother in this film, was the overweight distraught Muriel in ""Muriel's Wedding.""  Quite an actress!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I know Bruce Willis is in it but it's a good movie.,"Best story I've seen Bruce Willis in, minus Die Hard.  Yeah, take away Die Hard and you're not saying much but this really is good.

Pretty lame,"It's one of those movies in which several key characters would have to be stupid, or laughably inattentive, to behave the way they do, and in which the director repeatedly has to cut away from certain scenes and move hastily on, in the hope that we won't notice.  Cheap trick.  There were a couple of well-executed startles, which are always fun, and the drizzly autumnal atmosphere was just right.  Bruce Willis is his usual smirky self.  The little boy is very good.  The ""surprise"" was figured out in the following order, according to the people involved: my 15-year-old-son (the movie maven in the family), right after the opening sequence; myself, about 15 minutes in; my wife, a couple of scenes before the truth comes out at the end; my 13-year-old daughter, when we explained it to her on the way out to the car.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This film will keep you awake at night...,"Remember when you were little and had to run up the basement stairs really fast for fear of being grabbed by...something?

If you love scary movies, keep you eyes wide open and relish in the thought of what the little boy has to go through.Is the acting good?

One for the collection,"You know, there is no way I would have imagined Bruce Willis could pull this kind of movie off. He's completely the wrong person for it when you think about it.

The Sixth Sense,"There are three really potent performances in this mystery and none better than a super debut from eleven year old Haley Joel Osment who is the troubled young ""Cole"". He can see dead people, he can talk to dead people, he can learn from dead people. His problem is, not unreasonably, that nobody believes him - and his mother ""Lynn"" (Toni Collette) is at her wit's end. Enter onto the scene child psychologist ""Crowe"" (Bruce Willis) who has some experience in this field as one of his other patients ""Vincent"" (Donnie Wahlberg) suffered with the same problem - only with tragic consequences. Of course the scepticism abounds, but as the plot develops we all begin to wonder just what is a figment of the youngster's imagination and what is actual fact. M. Night Shyamalan lets the actors do the heavy lifting here, accompanied well by some intimate photography and an effective score from James Newton Howard. Collette is really convincing as the distraught mother and Osment just oozes a confidence well beyond his years as his character comes to terms with a trauma that would test the most robust of temperaments. Finally, Willis reminds us just why he was ever a star in the first place - his performance is delicate and assured. The dialogue is well constructed with little extraneous verbiage to clutter up what is a really compelling foray into a scary yet enthralling dimension that I really enjoyed watching. It is better still on a big screen, if you can.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Fairly intense, excellent idea","I had waited a while to see this film, I had heard heaps about it - mostly that there was a real twist at the end.  So when I watched it a few days ago, I looked for the twist from the start.  Lets just say that if you are looking for it- its fairly easy to find- there are clues everywhere!  This took a way the shock value that other viewers may have had when the surprise ending came about.  The twist is good, and if I had not been looking for it- I probably would not have found it, or picked up on the clues.  I didn't think it was as scary as what people said.  In fact I thought as it more as a psychological drama.  Bruce Willis was particularly good in his role, and I feel it is a shame that he was overlooked in the best actor category for the various film awards.  This is a very good film, it is well written, directed acted, although not scary as such it does give you the chills in a couple of places.

Public revealing of the ending would be worse than genocide, in my opinion. The movie is great the second time around, especially when you're with newcomers, because it's SO obvious to you and you can't believe they don't get it.

Double wow,"Who knew Bruce Willis could act?  I had 0 interest in seeing this film, and it is now right up there with Contact as one of my all-time favorites.  I can't understand why this movie gets compared with Blair Witch all the time. For one, I wouldn't classify it as horror.  What it really is is a supernatural thriller that touches upon drama and endearing comic moments, all-the-while employing all that is wonderful and good about film making to create a touching and memorable movie, whereas Blair Witch is nothing than an over-rated novelty.The filming, the acting, the script - everything is virtually flawless here. While it does have a startling plot twist, the strong story and well-developed characters prevent this from becoming just another gimmick-flick.  And Haley isn't just good for a little boy - he's just plain GOOD.  You don't often find that much charisma in someone so young.  To me, this movie is the perfect blend of art an entertainment.

The Beginning of the End (of good horror films),"Thank you, M. Night, for beginning the trend of PG-13 horror flicks. You know what I mean, the movies that come out every quarter and are gonna be the ""hottest scare fest"" of the season. Of course, It'd be great if we could just leave out the part about this film and it's predecessors choosing to appeal to jumpy amphetamine-laced 13 year old girls that shriek hysterically whenever a loud noise plays on screen. It would be just peachy if the fact that ever since this film, the scare factor of most modern horror films makes Goosebumps look positively horrifying, could be ignored. Unfortunately, it can't. What we have here is a ""modern-horror classic"", and indeed, it has all the makings of one. It brought horror filmaking to a new level, the ""I wonder how many sixth graders will jump when we play that jump sound and something pops up on screen"". It brought the career of rising star ""I see dead people"" to astonishing heights (shudders). It also got studio executive interested in the horror genre again. Too bad the genre become so badly butchered that it's practically unrecognizable.So, on to the film. The story is about a young boy who can see dead people. It's also about his shrink, who is trying to help the boy get through his ""dillusions"". Of course, as we see right away, the kid really does see dead people, and what follows is the kid wandering around seeing dead people, and the shrink wondering why, until the ""unpredictably and surprising"" twist ending. Ah the twist ending, yet another technique in film that the Sixth Sense transformed from original to cliché. The pacing of the film is repetitive and dull, and the directors laziness when bringing ""scares"" to the screen is appalling.My score for this film, while abysmal, does not reflect it's production values. The acting, cinematography, and special effects are all top notch. So why such a low score? Well, put simply, this film was responsible for a crumbling away at a fantastic genre; a genre that was called ""horror"" for a reason: it's supposed to be scary.Enter my feelings on the entire ""PG-13"" genre of horror flicks. The rating limits the possibilities of the filmmaker so much, that fear can never incubate within the viewers mind. It takes disturbing images, characters, mood, and shock, to truly scare most viewers. Simply isolating the ""shock part"", and cutting out the rest may sell a lot of tickets to 13 year olds, but that doesn't convince me that these films are any good.I understand that, as a filmmaker and fan of the genre itself, I can be a little jaded when it comes to horror. Maybe the reason I thought ""Boogeyman"" sucked was because I'm immune to terror, and that movie really was scary. But for some reason, I doubt that. Good cinema, for me, is about pushing the envelope of human emotion. If it's a romantic comedy, and it's not funny or romantic, it's not a good romantic comedy. And if a horror film is not scary, it defies what the genre is supposed to be. Therefore, as a fan of horror, I am disappointed with this film and the trend of films it started.In one final note, I would just like to thank Asian cinema for not backing down. Films like Audition and Ju-On continue to push the envelope and create truly terrifying worlds for the viewer. And this is a warning to Sam Raimi. I loved the Evil Dead movies, but if you try to ruin another great Asian film by having it remade, you'll be hearing from me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

One of my all time favorite films,"""I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.""When asked what my favorite films are, M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller The Sixth Sense tops the list for me every time. I know he hasn't been on a role lately, but that doesn't stop me from having high expectations for any of his upcoming projects because I was deeply influenced by this film. Even his following movies, Unbreakable and Signs, rank among my favorites, and I went as far as defending his work in The Happening (which is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest films have disappointed me, but I still admire his storytelling and the way he builds suspense in his films (he's heavily influenced by another favorite director of mine: Alfred Hitchcock). I'm looking forward to the release of his new TV series, Wayward Pines, which seems like a return to form for this talented director. But I'm even more excited about his upcoming film, The Visit, which will be released in September.I was 18 when this film came out and I had just passed my final High School exam so I decided to treat myself to the movies that night to celebrate. Up to this point I was simply a casual viewer of movies and enjoyed pretty much everything I saw. I had no idea about film criticism, and when I got to the theater I decided on The Sixth Sense simply because it starred Bruce Willis. I didn't know anything else about the film and was surprised it wasn't another action vehicle from Willis. The film had a very slow and creepy opening, but I was sucked in by the story and the building atmosphere. I was enjoying the strong chemistry between Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the pair were trying to figure out what was causing these freaky visions. There were several surprisingly scary scenes that made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The score was deeply effective as well. I was hooked from the very opening scene, but I was not at all prepared for the surprising and revealing twist at the end that left me completely blown away and speechless in the theater as the credits began rolling. I was in love with The Sixth Sense and from that moment on I have not stopped praising it.I can't believe all the signs that Shyamalan leaves behind for the audience while he is telling the story, and we still couldn't see the twist coming. He practically has Osment spell it out in his famous scene with Willis. It was a movie I had to rewatch simply because of that twist, and the second viewing allowed me to appreciate the film even more by catching up on all the symbolisms and clues that the director left behind. In my opinion it is the best twist ever because you never feel cheated by it. I credit this movie for getting me interested in film as an art form, although the transition didn't happen from one moment to the next. The performances from Willis, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette are all great, but Osment stood out, and it remains one of the best child performances I've seen from a Hollywood film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Solid plot with great ending, but...","This film contains a great combination of horror, mystery, drama, and sci-fi all conglomerated into the same film.  The premise of the story is that a young child played by Osment is able to see dead people as easy as you or I can see the living.  What do these ""dead people"" want of him??  Dr Malcolm Crowe ( played by willis) offers his help to unlock the mystery.**** Do not read this next paragraph if you don't want to learn of the ending**** Ok, this is a great film, no doubt about that.  The ending is one of the best as well.. But I bring attention to the fact that if Crowe is suppose to be dead all along yet HE DOESN'T KNOW HE IS DEAD, why don't we see crowe trying to interact with the living?????? He is suppose to be ""alive"" yet wouldn't it seem a bit out of the ordinary if your wife never talks to you?? OR in the case of when he went to see Cole at his house, he is sitting with cole's mom--- wouldn't it seem feasible to want to strike up a discussing with the mother of a boy whom you are trying to solve his ""mental problems""???I just find it hard to believe that a man would not try to communicate with anyone throughout the duration of the time he is examining Cole, beacause he is DEAD so therefore if he did, he would surely realize something is wrong, why would everyone ignore him? hmmThis is about the only point of the movie that keeps it from a 10 for me.  The plot is well-developed, and Willis does a good job portraying Crowe.   Osment is the real star of this movie though.  The kid puts on one heck of a performance!  You believe his pain, his fear, and want to see his problems resolved.   Also, I would have liked to see Cole help the ghosts in his house ( the wife and the kid with the bullet wound) and maybe tell the audience a little more about the backgrounds of the ghosts to add more of an eerie twist.

very disappointing,"I already saw this movie a couple of months ago, but decided to send in a review after all because it just got way too many credits. I was horribly disappointed.

It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't do much to me, there's no thrills, no false scares, the few ghosts are all very tame and in my opinion the little kid was pretty annoying. The movie goes on and on in the same pace, doesn't have any real highlights, no memorable moments, and the end (though it was kinda interesting) wasn't the roaring climax i was secretly hoping for. But still worth a look. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An emotional and physically tearing film.,"The Sixth Sense, has quite the potential to be nominated for Best Picture come oscar night. You're probably asking why. Well, it's better than your standing Bruce Willis-Helps-A-Kid movie, because well it's not like that type of movie. ""The Sixth Sense"" is not at all similar to ""Mercury Rising"", which some people were saying before the film came out. Bruce Willis is probably in his best film role in years as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the psychologist who's patient Cole Sears (Haley Jole Osment is wonderful as the young child, should get some oscar potential as well) has the ability, to, well, you know. Toni Collete is good as Cole's mother who wants to know what's wrong with him. Olvia Williams is also quite good as Malcolm's wife. The director and writer of the film, M. Night Shyamalan's script WORKS because of Cole's terrified vision. Cole enters another world with us, and we explore that world. Have I said enough? Probably so. But if this movie is nominated for awards at the forthcoming Academy Awards, I wouldn't be so surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
decent...,"I enjoyed the Sixth Sense, but I saw the ""surprise ending"" a mile away. When I first saw the trailer I thought, ""I bet..."" and I was dead on, without hearing anything about the film.

Sick Non-sense.,"Even though this movie had plenty of expensive glitter, an excess of on-screen whispering, coupled with an excess of flashbacks, rendered the plot next to impossible to figure out.

A cinematic triumph.,A movie made with immaculate perfection. Rarely you get to see cinema which leaves you with  awe and would want you to go  back and see it all over again as soon as possible. Director Shyamalan has made this movie with perfection to the core. Its a touching tale of a child who sees ghosts and his relationship with his psychiatrist ....his mother...and himself. Its about his discovery of his own personal powers. It is also a tale of a man(Willis) whose life has a lot of loose ends to meet. These intertwined...it makes it a mesmerising cinematic event. Beautifully crafted scenes which are edited with perfection.touching performances....especially a oscar worthy potrayal of Cole by the young Osment.

Brilliant making,"Psychological horror flicks comes with exiting, thrilling plots with unexpected twists and surprises, the best part of these genre is that it never make its viewers to get diverted from the screen until credits flows on at last, the movie that seems to be running very normally with a linear presentation where viewers move with the plot being clueless about what happens next and all of a sudden the entire plot and shades turn off and gives you the surprising twist, leaving you astonished.1999 Thriller ''The Sixth Sense'' is one such brilliant work on supernatural theme with wonderful twist is a worth watch for all those thriller and horror movie lovers, M Night Shyamalan showcased his ingenious film making talent with beautiful script that moves on in very simple and silent flow and he sets the mark of his unique movie presentation, Haley Joel Osment has done a tremendous job playing Cole a boy who is able to look at the dead people and believes that they want to accomplish their unfinished task through him, his naturalistic and full fledged performance depicts his acting brilliance, Bruce Wills well known for his action shades in most of the movies is also well presented himself as sympathetic psychologist and loving husband, this image makeover helped Wills to show his hidden acting potentiality.''The Sixth Sense'' is one best script ever written and proves to be the standard Supernatural thrillers of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Fantastic ghost story,"This movie is excellent.  It doesn't need to use excessive blood and gore to get its point across.  It is tense, scary, well-acted, and cinematically beautiful.  The use of the color red by the cinematographer is fantastic, and the cryptic camera shots of Bruce Willis are fantastic.  The ending of the movie at first doesn't seem to make sense, but then when you look back at the entire film, it makes sense all along.  Haley Joel Osment is spectacular as Cole.  His was one of the best child performances I've ever seen, rival to Henry Thomas in ""E.T."" and Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"".  It was truly a chilling tale of the supernatural and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I see dead people....,"The Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first directorial debut to the wide open of his career to an extension which has now become shameless regarding the outcome of the films that are usually involved in the genre of action and heavy blockbuster which clearly isn't the precise type of films to write and direct. Nowadays, M. Night Shyamalan's name has become a joke by ruining a famous cartoon Avatar or The Last Airbender in an attempt in making a live action which was a major failure. Addition, after 3 years he has both written and directed a film called After Earth which was a very mediocre-ish bland, dull, and especially a pointlessly boring action flick. However, retracing the films of M. Night's early years of his career it seems in a way that is completely in the opposite of the position that is held by him these days.The Sixth Sense follows a tale of a very young 9-year-old child who is extraordinarily different compared to the fellow kids around his age. When adults think of 9-year-old kids, they are exceedingly cute, and just wanna squeeze their cheeks. However, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) in this film the main protagonist is explicitly the opposite. He is unusually well educated according to the fact that he has no father at home and him only family member he has obtained is his mother named Lynn Sear (Toni Collette). Cole has an extraordinary talent in which he can communicate with ghosts, dead people and he is continually threatened by the unheated beings who he considers wants to drag him to the dread tension and harsh conditions of his life. While he may not be solely correct. In fact, he says ""I see dead people, they want me to do things for them"" which may lead to a supportive help to a young girl who has passed out from the outcome from his mother as she poisoned her all the way and this shocking event has been leaked to the father of the dead girl.Aside from the interesting and original plot, the performances are peril excellent. Especially, Cole played by Haley Joel Osment gives one of the best young child performances in cinema history. The role in this film is deeply different regarding other child roles, which requires a subtle, thoughtful, and an immense dramatical act. Haley Joel Osment is fully engaged within the character as he is phenomenal and proves himself to be the most talented child actor from his age group. He has been nominated for an Oscar which is fabulously arduous for most actors and especially the ones from his young age. He is by far the most considerable best aspect of this film that elevates it's heightened of the creation more further. Toni Collette is very realistic and relinquishes a very convincing act of the mother of the threatened son Cole.The story continues as Cole gets/seeks help from a disheartened child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a sad character who is disheartened by the loss of his wife's caring and love from an incident that happened a few months in which a patient of his previous years visits his estate, and shoots Malcolm a serious one shot through his body which still remains the separation of himself and his wife. It remains a big wound striking his heart and emotions. As he takes on an assignment to help this young child, he assumes the relationship with his wife will improve. Before Bruce Willis's attempt on fetching this role, he was regarded as an action star. People in 1999 though this type of subtle, quiet and passionate role would not fit his vital character. As a result, this stereotype was broken as he committed fully to this quiet, caring, loving role as a child psychiatrist. He is marvelous and astonishingly well acted in terms of this type of role as he was famous for absurd, loud cursing characters. As a fact, he has been supportive to Shyamalan in taking this role seriously as it makes the finest performance within Bruce Willis's career of acting.The Sixth Sense is utterly and terrific in the cause of the shocking ending twist added into the film. This film is also well known and praised in terms of the extra addition of the fabulous unpredictable twist that reshapes the understanding of the film as it recalls for repetitive viewings. Personally, I definitely agree as a fact it does not exceedingly cheat its own rules that were set up, and immensely reveals it sudden and quiet making it inspirational and well thought- out. Originally, the screenplay of The Sixth Sense was sold for $ 100 million around Hollywood. Unlike other Shyamalan films, this film is doubtlessly his best work throughout his whole career and a very clever and unquestionably genius filmmaking. The Sixth Sense is one of the most inspirational and a masterpiece of our decade that is precisely original and creates subtle, shocking and peril tension that makes the audiences grip to sweat and tears. This film does have the horror elements but it is more of a light-hearted, quiet drama surrounding the two main protagonists Cole and Malcolm. Lots of meanings expressed by colors and lots of themes to discover and to be analyzed. This is an undoubtedly pure genius filmmaking and the finest work of Shyamalan.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The best movie he's come up with.,"The Sixth Sense came out of nowhere and stunned audiences worldwide. It was daring, inventive and had a twist at the end that cemented M Night Shyamalan as a true auteur. He was heralded as being the next Stephen Spielberg but it seems all this went to his head and he peaked too soon because while his next movie was well received it started a long line of increasingly bad movies. But let's only talk of this one.The movie starts with a young boy who is having trouble in his life because he can, as the movie states, ""see dead people"". Essentially he sees the ghosts of people that have passed on and they still require some kind of action to take place before they're able to leave this world. Enter Bruce Willis playing a psychiatrist who helps the boy come to terms with this ability of his and how to maybe help those that are trapped in this world.The movie is inventive. It's well done. It's shot nicely and the actors are giving their all. It's truly a great movie that surprised a lot of people when it came out. Not only due to the story but the twist at the end which a lot of people were genuinely surprised at.However, his follow up to this, ""Unbreakable"", while a decent movie in and of itself is not as good and each movie afterwards got steadily worse. Showing that maybe M Night Shyamalan's work needed some work.But this one is genuinely good. You should check it out if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

That's it?,"The Sixth Sense is considered one of the greatest horror films ever, and quite honestly it doesn't stand the test of time. It was one of my first horror movies, so it should've had more of an impact than it did. I'm not going to pull out the ""I guessed the twist in the first five minutes"", even though I did and was quite underwhelmed by the ending. However, I came in knowing that there was some big twist at the end, so I'm not sure if I would've guessed it so quickly if I didn't. And besides, basically everyone else who doesn't care for this movie has already said that. My main problem with this film is that it is not scary... like at all. As someone who has seen real horror on their television screen (The Blair Witch Project, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, both Suspirias), I am thoroughly disappointed when a movie confuses ""scary"" with ""constant jumpscares"". Sorry Sixth Sense, but you can't try to frighten me with loud noises and sudden visuals and expect me to call you good. However, I do think that the acting and plot itself until the ending were very good, interesting, and engaging. It's definitely not a bad film, just a very overrated one in my personal opinion. If you're looking for a compelling supernatural drama, I would go for this. But if you want an actually scary movie, please look elsewhere.Final Score: 60/100.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I'll never understand it.....,"I am not surprised the mass market likes this very mediocre movie, but I can't understand the near universal critical acclaim a movie like this can get. I admit my own bias - I hate movies about smary kids to begin with, nor do I care for obvious sentimentality,  but trying to be objective, the problem, as usual  is the script. It simply is average--the pacing is awkward and plodding; there is a serious lack of tension and momentum. I do not consider myself to be a literary genius, but have all the critics of today never seen a movie with good writing? (Mostly pre 1990). Are we really left with movies that go ""Boo."", (accompanied by the generic rumbling sound effect). Or are they only comparing movies to the other dismal offerings we get today (well,fair enough, perhaps).

The creepiest film in many years.,"Wow! What an ending. I don't think I've been this moved by a film's conclusion since the frighteningly shocking end of David Fincher's ""Seven."" Don't worry because I will obviously not ruin this film for anyone, but suffice it to say that the end of this film allows you to see the entire picture from an entirely different point of view the second time around, and that is simply a unique achievement. In fact, I was more than willing to see this film many more times, just so that I could see it unravel within that other realm. Another thing that stood out for me with this picture was the fact that unlike its trailer, which sells this film as a chilling thriller, this movie is actually more of a supernatural drama with plenty of tear-jerking scenes to boot. And yes, I crumbled under the emotional drainage of the film's players, especially with Toni Collette in a few choice scenes. I would rather compare it to elements of ""The Omen"" and ""Ghost,"" rather than any thrill-seekers ride, though it has it's share of creepy, terrifying moments.In fact, the film is deliberately paced very slowly, with plenty of time given to the performers to grapple with the powerful material at hand. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job as the confused young child who is going through things that no child should ever go through, and even Bruce Willis pulls off an impressive steady performance, without a single ""yipee-kaya"" in the whole script. But once again, allow me reiterate how much the twist ending of this film allowed it to catapult onto another level. Even after the film's credits had long been done rolling, I could not help but discuss the many different parts of the plot that were altered through this amazing ending, and could not help but further my appreciation for this film. Great acting, great style, great score, an instant classic ending, and certainly worthy of being called one of my favorite films. And despite it not being an all-out thriller, believe me when I say that you will be startled in a few scenes, and certainly touched in others. Giant kudos go out to the writer/director of this film, M. Night Shyamalan, for pulling off a very impressive film presentation.By the way, if this film interests you in the least, make sure that you see it before someone ruins the ending for you, because it truly is one to digest firsthand.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I had... THE FEELING!,"You know the feeling I'm talking about. The buzz deep inside you when you see a film so brilliant that no star rating, any review, anything could possibly convey how absolutely superb the film was. Well The Sixth Sense gave that feeling for the first time since I saw Death in Venice a while ago. Anyhow, the plot sees Bruce playing a child psychologist and a year after he is shot by a disgruntled patient in his home, he takes of the case of Harley Joel Osment, who has the sixth sense of the tile: the ability to see the ghosts of dead people. After Color of Night and Mercury Rising, the prospects of Willis playing a shrink AND working with a child are not good, but he is perfect for the role. Gone are is usual action man histrionics and instead he underplays the role calmly and gives a performance that is worthy an Oscar nomination at least. Child actor, Osment is superb too and mixes his role with sympathy, fear and desperation that put his performance among the child greats. ""Brat"", doesn't even come into the equation. As superb as they are, the most credit has to go to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who skillfully handles his intelligent script and comes up with a chilling atmosphere throughout the film as well as several electrifying shocks, based on relatively simply situations.

One of the Better Gimmick Movies,"This is one of those movies whose major source of appeal is the little gimmick that's hinted at throughout the movie and finally revealed at the end. Huzzah!They're usually a pathetic attempt to give the simple-minded a rare opportunity to feel intelligent once they ""get"" it. Ironically, you'd think a gimmick movie would be worn out after it's watched the first time, since the mystery is gone, but no, it turns out it needs to be watched a second time after you know the gimmick to see everything you ""missed"" the first time around.This one is very interesting aside from the gimmick, though. We have a kid who's apparently mentally disturbed and a child psychiatrist trying to help him in order to quell some old feelings of shame he has rattling around in his mind.The acting of the main child is perfect and you can really feel how he's struggling to grow up not only with the normal hardships of being a rather inhibited and awkward child, but also because he's heavily burdened by his ""condition,"" which makes an already challenging proposition much harder.The ambiance is duly spooky, since it's a light supernatural horror and there are some touching moments. The only significant problems with this movie are the jump scares (unnecessary and childish) and the fact that they tried to push the gimmick way too hard. It seems that this was done for mass appeal, as the situation is obvious from the beginning to anyone with a lick of sense. Anyone who fell for the gimmick is a real simpleton, to be frank.Honourable Mentions: Bad Timing (1980). This is a gimmick movie also involving a psychologist bonding with a person who seems to have a few screws loose. Great movie regardless of the gimmick. Also funny.

overrated,"This isn't such a good film.  I think one of the reasons it has achieved such popularity is because critics everywhere decided to write it as being brilliant.  Viewers think they should love it, so they agree to.  I can remember sitting in a theatre several months ago and being very disappointed in this film.  The Blair Witch Project did a lot more for me.  Willis does not do all that great of job in it.  The kid (his name fails me) does. The script was OK.  The directing was actually poor.  I won't give away the end, for the two or three people who have yet to see it, but I will say that the director gives it away by the end of the second act.  When I went to see it, I knew how it would end with about a half hour left.  This disappointed me. The thing was blocked poorly and the camera could have been used more effectively to keep the viewer in the dark.  The thing felt like it was shot before it was really fully conceptualized.  Also, there were many moments where I found myself wanting the film to be more graphic and frightening than it was.  I get the feeling they were aming to get the PG-13 from start to finished.  This hurt the film.Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but disappointing non the less.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A psychological horror movie that resonates in the soul after the experience is over.,"It's been a long time since Hollywood made a horror movie that relied more on acting and characters than special effects and shameless gore.  Luckily for us, M. Night Shyamalan is as much a fan of Henry James as Stephen King, and his movie, The Sixth Sense, is a masterpiece of psychological horror that would make the writer of 'Turn of the Screw' proud. Shyamalan successfully resists the temptation to throw in cheap thrills, and instead focuses on the characters, how they react to their situation, and how they are changed by it.  The audience quickly sympathizes with the young boy who can see dead people, and the broken man who feels driven to help him.Young Haley Joel Osment gives a performance that is more textured than any since Anna Paquin in the Piano, and Bruce Willis' familiar taciturn demeanour works well for him.  Certainly one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Sixth Sense exploits the helpless afterlife for an extrasensory psychological family drama.,"""I see dead people"", confesses a young and vulnerable Cole. The iconic line of dialogue that surrounds itself with metaphysical delusions, connecting the supernatural with reality. He continues, ""they don't know they're dead"". Ghostly apparitions haunting the streets of Philadelphia, endlessly searching for resolution, realignment and reconciliation. Seemingly, no other soul has this additional sense. Only Cole, an unsociable fragile child whose physical harm and emotion distress fractures the familial bond with his exhausted single mother. Unable to confide in her, he befriends a determined child psychologist, Malcolm. Yearning to rectify the failure from his previous patient whom committed suicide right before his glazed eyes, Malcolm urges Cole to find a purpose for his cursed blessing and enable wandering spirits to achieve absolution. Psychologically mending his fear and the splinted relationship with his mother in the process.Shyamalan's legendary 90s supernatural thriller is often classified as a horror. Such a description diminishes the psychological exploration at the heart of this family drama, shifting the audience's perception entirely. 'The Sixth Sense', unequivocally, is an accessible insight into loss and deterioration. Loss of life. Deteriorating relationships. Weakened mentalities. A thriller that intelligently exploits esotericism as a plot device to strengthen its characters, almost reaching the adolescent depths of a coming-of-age tale.Arguably, the central narrative and focus is pinpointed on Cole and Lynn's fatigued bond, personally the highlight of the feature. The rapidly growing intensity as Cole's hauntings increase in severity, alluding to connotations of child abuse, propels both characters to better each other. Accompanied by two outstanding performances from Osment and Collette, whom essentially carry the entire story on their shoulders. Both actors enhance their characterised perspective of the situation, Cole with his frightening ability and Lynn who cannot comprehend her own son's vivid imagination. The exquisitely staged arguments and reluctant embraces become more tense, until their final scene together which just happens to be Shyamalan's most magnificently directed sequence ever. No score. No sound effects. Just a mother and her son understanding each other in a car, providing that much required context for familial strength. Sensational.Shyamalan surprisingly matches that quality throughout, with several one take sequences and innovative reflection shots to showcase his capabilities to the rest of Hollywood. These technical merits help entice viewers into the unknown, where Shyamalan then inserts his trademark plot twist.Yes, the plot twist of all twists. One of the most discussed, imitated and influential endings in cinematic history. The conclusive five minutes that would catapult Shyamalan's career into the stratosphere. Despite this being my first viewing, unfortunately Internet culture and general word-of-mouth revealed its twisted nature, undoubtedly lessening its impact. Regardless, the problem 'The Sixth Sense' withholds, is continuity errors. Without revealing the surprise (despite all of you knowing it by now...), certain conditions indicate when a ghost is within the radius of Cole, such as the temperature lowering to freezing capabilities. This condition is completely disregarded for the character the plot twist concerns, as is the absence of blood from the frontal wound. Shyamalan does his best to masquerade these obvious indicators to strengthen the shocking conclusion. Yet, instead of pushing me to exclaim ""oh wow!"", it made me mutter ""hang on, wait a minute..."". These subtle manipulations may seem irrelevant to the overall story, however undeniably places a thinly woven veil of deception over the viewer's eyes by disregarding its own rules.Due to the upkeep of this twist, the secondary narrative involving Malcolm and the reconciliation with his wife suffered from minimal onscreen chemistry. Willis and Williams were perfectly fine in the feature, yet their purposefully distant characters failed to provide any emotional surge and proved the primary plot as the more investable story. Oh, and only one jump scare was counted, so not bad at all!It's incredibly simple to understand why 'The Sixth Sense' was popular and successful amongst audiences. Its Hollywood thrills and ominous chills supplied plenty of atmosphere amidst Shyamalan's progressive screenplay. And despite the continuity errors and occasional artificial emotionality, it's one of those rare features that provides two completely different viewing experiences. Supplying myself with a sixth sense for future plot twists!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
'I see dead people...',"An absolute classic! The story focuses on Cole Sear (an incredible performance by a young Haley Joel Osmont) a boy who is inflicted with constantly seeing paranormal activity. Malcolm Crowe (one of Bruce Willis' best performances) is a child psychologist who takes it upon himself to help Cole and further understand how to help him. It's a really beautifully made mystery thriller; it is wonderfully acted, seriously spooky and intelligently crafted story telling. Although you may very well know the infamous twist ending by now, it's still essential viewing and it requires multiple viewings to find extra details as a lot of the best films do! Toni Colette is fantastic as Cole's mother Lynn; a scene towards the end shared between her and Cole is one of the most beautifully paced and emotional scenes you're likely to see. She portrays the role of the mother of a troubled child extremely well; from the angry to the sick from worry and all the feelings in between. Osmont is just stunning in this; during the suspenseful scenes he is literally shaking from fear and you can't help but feel his pain and want him to feel better. Willis is brilliant; one of those sensitive roles that we have since seen in films like Moonrise Kingdom and Shyamalan's project after this one.... Also a tense and creepy music score by James Newton Howard; cementing a long lasting collaboration between himself and the director!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Calculated shocks tactic,"It has to be given to Mr. Shamyalan (or however is written), the merit that he has built an intriguing, disturbing film, from a story plagued with holes. He manages to cover this inconsistencies with calculated shocks, the main, obviously, at the end of the movie. One on the finest features of the film I think are the solid characters depicted, with provides the picture with a sordid, pitiful ambient, with its three tattered protagonists. In this way, I find this film rather influenced by ""The Exorcist"" ambient, which ""Sixth Sense"" owes most of its undoubtable virtues.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Horrible,I have seen many movies in my day but I must say I have never been more disappointed by a movie in my life. The whole time I watched this movie I was bored out of my mind. The little trick ending could not even save this terrible excuse of a movie. I highly recommend that if you are thinking of seeing this movie forget about and pick up a copy of the much more exciting and thrilling Stir of Echoes.

The Sixth Sense,"The Sixth Sense, it took a few days to collect my thoughts on this, is it Shyamalan's best? Is it the best of his work I've seen so far, yeah. There's a admirable flow and eye for detail in this movie that some of his other work lacks. Combine that with the best performances I've seen so far in his work and you have a fantastic movie.It took me back a bit to remember how good Bruce Willis was before he started to do cheaper/action flicks, he owns this role. But that's nothing really, normally I start with the directing, but in this case, this movie has incredible acting. Besides Joel Osment's incredible performance at such a young age, there's another star with a smaller role, Collette, which just solidified once AGAIN how incredible she is. We all know that Hereditary scene. But the car scene here, is just as good, maybe even better because of it's subtleties and build-up. It blew me away. Incredibly memorable. Besides that others side roles are just fine. Shyamalan's scene was short luckily, it's a trademark of his to appear in his own movies, but it tends to feel gimmicky at does pull you out if it's not hidden well enough, here it's obvious, I wish it was more subtle like The Village.Directing, fantastic, the attention to detail, whilst it had some ambiguity its 98% solid. Reading the trivia afterwards makes me appreciate it even more. Also Shyamalan shows his horror chops and makes it work. As for this movie being scary or not, sure, it still has scenes that work really well, and will scare novice viewers. The overall tone is beautifully eerie, combined with the excellent score.Luckily I have not been spoiled on the plot, besides knowing that iconic line. That being said, I've seen a couple of his movies and well it wasn't too hard to dissect. That being said the story is so good, I found myself just totally into it again and not thinking about the details.Excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the greatest,It's just a great movie - style and story are genius. It's just one of those moments in Movie history where it all comes together. It's Great horror story and love story all in one movie. There are great performances from everyone in the movie. Its one of the best child roles I've ever seen. The last child role that had this type of power was probably Tatum O'Neill in Paper Moon.the dark style of this film lends itself to the story and style wise there was really nothing around like that at the time. Then all of a sudden copy cat movies started coming out with a similar style.Not much more can be said - its a classic.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Simply Stunning!,"I thought The Sixth Sense was simply stunning.  I was prepared to see a scary ghost movie, but I ended up watching a film which combines elements of many genres effectively.  I enjoyed the acting thoroughly, as well as the plot. The ending was a real twist, a great wrap-up, if somewhat anti-climactic... Overall, I'd rate this movie highly and recommend it to anyone not impressed by the so-far uninspired summer blockbusters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
What a child actor!,"The Sixth Sense is a very good movie in itself (and yes, the ending is really something, with a twist I only saw that year in Fight Club... great). But the real credit goes to Haley Joel Osment, or ""Cole"". This child can really act. I watched the movie on home video (because I was pretty scared of watching it in a movie theater), and all the time I could only think about his acting; he looked wise beyond his age, more like a seasoned actor than an 11 year old kid. I think he has a great future ahead of him.As a strange coincidence, I watched ""The Exorcist"" 1 day before this film, and reached a conclusion: while Linda Blair was the star of the film (with Max von Sydow, of course), I couldn't stand Chris MacNeil at all. This limited my enjoyment of the movie, since her character appeared too often. Her overacting should not be excused. I couldn't find this flaw in ""The Sixth Sense"", where Bruce Willis acted great.This film stands out from the rest because it makes you spend the entire time trying to figure out the ending, and by the time you think you know what will happen, you get a rather chilling surprise. What a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Fantastic Spooky Movie,"Wow. I just watched this movie for the first time and wow is all I have to say. Throughout the entire movie, I enjoyed Osment's (Cole's) acting.

I truly enjoyed watching the ups and downs and seeing what the main characters would do next. This movie had me hooked from beginning to end, and was truly worth watching.

a blessing,"The trailers for this film piqued my interest only slightly; to me, it looked like another generic ghost/horror story.  Thank god my boyfriend insisted upon seeing it, because frankly I can't remember the last time I saw such an intriguing and well done film.  The actors are wonderful, not to mention the little boy.  This is no Macaulay Culkin; he is nothing less than believable, and his rivetingly palpable terror will draw you in.  The story can be just a tad slow at times, and you're not always sure where the film is going.  However, there are quite a number of refreshingly unexpected twists, and the ending shocked even jaded me.I rarely get excited by movies, but I left _The Sixth Sense_ absolutely exhilarated.

a picture for years,"The pacing was good, and the film hooked me from the first glance; I watched it in one go. Unfortunately, like many others, I managed to predict the final plot twist. It wasn't that easy, especially due to numerous inappropriate scenes that seemed to lack connection to the plot. Some key plotlines were left unresolved, which is sad.Not much time was devoted to supporting characters, and most roles were not very complex. It's evident where the emphasis was placed, and it paid off. The performance of a cult actor versus that of a young wizard, as in this film, is quite distinct. It's a pity that the latter's career didn't unfold as expected.The musical accompaniment is just okay. There's a feeling that high-quality sound would elevate this film to new heights.I enjoyed the blend of drama, thriller, and mystery with a hint of jump scares. Each genre took the forefront at different times, overshadowing the rest. It's a great contrast that should have been reflected in the cinematography style for a more cohesive experience.A cult film that will be discussed for decades due to its simplicity and romanticism. 7/10. I recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Best movie I've seen all year,"Most horror/thriller movies see how far they can go to scare the hell out of a person. They'll usually start with a grisly murder, or something that foreshadows the many grisly murders that will occur during the movie. Though this formula can sometimes be effective, it gets old and sour faster than you can scream bloody murder.The Sixth Sense, however, defies all the conventional horror rules. Instead of putting together a series of unlikely events that ends up as a bloodbath at the end, it slowly draws the audience into its web of mystery and thrills. Though it does start with an event that foreshadows events in the movie, it does it in a way that nobody will expect. In a tense yet nuanced style, it keeps you enthralled in the plotline while finally blowing you away at the end.The performances are Oscar-caliber, at least by 11 year old actor Haley Joel Osment. Though Bruce Willis's performance isn't bad (and a very refreshing change from his usual action fare), its this kid that carries the movie, and drives the emotion home.

"""You have to add twists and stuff.""","Because of the film's surprising twist, I'm going to try not to do spoilers, but note some comments might be considered mild spoilers.The first time I watched 'The Sixth Sense' the twist finale came as a big shock. Then, when I watched it again, I thought, hang on a minute; how is this possible? So I traced back the events to see what I might have missed. If he (I won't say who, but if you've seen the movie, you'll know who I'm referring to) didn't know he was dead, what was he doing all the time, and did he believe everyone was just constantly ignoring him?Fortunately, what might have come across as a plot flaw, is clarified in one sentence: ""They (the dead) only see what they want to see."" So, effectively this means the moments we see in the film, are the moments this particular dead person wanted to see. This would explain everything so much better, and make the events in the film plausible.Ok, lets go back to the beginning. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe. On a pleasant evening with his wife, they are attacked by one of Malcolm's patients, who broke into their home. The film then jumps ahead a year, and Malcolm is now helping a young boy, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) ""with secrets"". Its not until about the halfway mark that we discover what these secrets are, but the build up to this reveal is exciting, and rather creepy at times. Haley Joel Osment delivers a fantastic performance as Cole. I thought Bruce Willis, too, was excellent in a very reserved role for this high profile action superstar.Toni Collette stars as Cole's mother, Lynn, who believes she and her son are drifting apart, and she's not sure why. She knows he has ""issues"", but this is not fully explained until his life becomes a living nightmare. 'The Sixth Sense' is an effective psychological thriller containing many elements we can relate to, and off course those we can't. Fact remains, this is a supernatural movie that feels very realistic.Are you ready for that shock twist at the end? 'The Sixth Sense' is an engaging movie that needs to be viewed several times.

It's also beautifully written, directed and acted.Because it is so unconventional (More Hitchcock than Spielberg), and uses cinematic elements (lighting, sound, editing) rather than special effects to provide its horror, it is not surprising THE SIXTH SENSE crept into theaters.  What IS surprising is its excellent box office so early in its release cycle.

...,"This movie is definitely the best m. Night Shamalan movie I have seen yet and i love him. This was an amazing movie and its ""magic"" was Haley Joel Osment. He is an amazing actor and definitely the best child actor of our time. He WAS the movie and I don't understand why he was seen as the supporting actor and not the main actor. but actual i do understand. It is because they look down on children, which i don't think is fair. Bruce Willis was very good, but I could imagine a lot of people in that role. I can't imagine anyone else in Haley's role. This movie was amazingly written and the music was phenomenal. I hope everyone in the world gets to see this movie because it is one that you don't want to miss. I know I will be showing it to MY children, are you going to be showing it to yours?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of my favorite movies of all time,This movie was an awesome movie and is really the first movie about ghosts in ages that makes sense and not only that but gives me chills.  I think the acting was superb especially by Osment who played the role of the little boy. When I first saw the movie I was like no way at the ending and I was saying thats impossible but after I thought about it I realized it made perfect sense and made the movie even creepier. This is a film I will have to watch more times to catch every little detail. Trust me people you need to go watch this movie immediately and really think hard after the movie to explain to yourself what happened in that movie. A 10 out of 10 but I don't want to say too much cuz that tends to ruin the movie a bit.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"One of the best horror films of all time, and an allegory of alienation","Last week, when I left the theater after watching this film, I had the strange impression that I had just watched something great. Today, one week later, I'm still convinced that I was right.When the Horror genre seemed to be poured out into mediocrity with films such as Blair Witch Project or The Haunting, a new one has just appeared which with no doubt deserves one of the highest places at the all-time horror movies top list.Nowadays it's very difficult to surprise people with a horror movie, or simply to scare people. Everything seems to have been said and done yet. But The Sixth Sense really does both things, so we wonder, where is the secret of The Sixth Sense, if there is any? To find it out we can start by analyzing some of its aspects. Firstly, Bruce Willis does one of the best performances in his whole career (if not the best); Secondly Haley Joel Osment does an Oscar-deserving performance as the boy Cole; thirdly, the secondary actors are close to perfection; fourthly, the screenplay is one of the most imaginative ones we have seen since lots of years ago, with the best ending I could ever have imagined; and finally the music and the sound effects are really impressive, raising the stressing moments to the highest level.Until now, what we have seen is plenty of good points, excellence in all the film details, but not the real secret. The real secret is (and only can be) something present in every aspect of the movie and at the same time independent from each other. What I mean is the DIRECTING. I certainly could write a thousand lines about the directing of this movie, about its structure, about its developing, about the visuals, about the ideas we could extract, but the only thing I will say about it is: Stanley Kubrick is born again! Shymalan has just become a new star in the movie sky, a new director and writer to add to my all-time top ten list. In fact, when I went to see The Matrix, what I expected and didn't get was something like this, and now I'm so glad that Cinema has finally given it to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Shymalan.This film can also be viewed from another perspective: it also shows how some people are not able to see that they are emotionally dead. There's a lot of people in the USA and also in other countries who only see what they want to see, just like in the song Nowhere Man, by The Beatles. The psychiatrist was trying to cure the boy, and he didn't realize that it was *his* problem. Sigmund Freud suffered that kind of problem, and now his teachings are extended all over the USA and other countries like France and Argentina.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Well-done and chilling,"Being the ignorant teenager that I am, I needed to have my mother explain the ending to me, as it went too fast for me to grasp just what was happening.  After that, though, it made perfect sense and was a fitting conclusion to a pretty good film.  In my opinion, it really wasn't as jaw-dropping, shocking, and/or haunting as other people say, but that's just my opinion.  I didn't see it coming, but I wasn't looking for it.  I still wasn't shocked, though, because it made sense, etc.As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was pretty good.  It could very easily have been done as a cheap, gory horror flick, but in the hands of the director (I forgot his name), it actually exhibits a great deal of intelligence and a nice mix of the supernatural and religion.  Yes, Haley Joel Osmont is very good in a role that requires a good deal more maturity than most kids' roles today.  He has many of the frightening moments, and they're all frightening in his hands.  But he also is effective as the frightened little boy who has a very simple desire we all can relate to: not to be called a freak.  Bruce Willis was just okay, but Toni Collette, who plays Osmont's mother, did a good job, as well.  The story as it is presented is very chilling, if not very scary.  There are quite a few frightening bumps along the way, but none that are truly nightmare-inducing. That's probably because this movie is well above the rest of its genre (Maybe not The Blair Witch Project, but I haven't seen that one.) and fits more into the drama area of movies.  Anyway, well-directed, -acted, and -written (except for some stupid parts), and I do recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Not as scary as everyone says, but still an intriguing piece of cinema","The Sixth Sense is the story about a young boy who lives with his mom that has troubles in school, and troubles interacting with all of the spoiled rich kids that he has in his school. He talks with a psychologist played by Bruce Willis. The psychologist tries to figure out what kind of problems the kid has, but then it turns out that the kid sees dead people.The movie isn't scary like everyone says, but it is very intriguing movie as you see what the kid sees, you see why he's so horrified, and you see how he handles his fears. The ending is probably what the film is known for(don't worry, I won't go anywhere near spoiling it for you). You would probably never guess it, but unfortunately, some jerk spoiled it for me. Hopefully no one ever does the same to you.This is a very intriguing movie, and is also very original. In some ways, I think that M. Night Shyamalan was inspired by the creepy movie Pet Sematary. If you watch both films, you might also notice a similarity. Watch The Sixth Sense at all costs, it's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Solemn horror,"Horror films are usually garish and camp.  But this must be the most understated entry ever in the genre, with its mood of quiet portentiousness and overwhelming solemnity.  And though the final twist is neat, its also very clearly telegraphed.  What saves The Sixth Sense is some fine acting, from Bruce Willis as the so-concerned psychologist, and Joel Harvey Osment as the child who sees ghosts.  It's very nicely done, but not so original. Other films (Truly Madly Deeply, Kieslowski's No End) have played with similar material; and put some more life into death than we see here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Bruce Willis at the top of his Game!,"The reason why I wanted to see this film is because of Bruce Willis. I'm a huge Willis fan! However, if your not that into Bruce then don't turn away that quick. This movie is perfection! If you like drama, mystery and suspense then this film is for you. I won't spoil what it's about but I will say I've never seen anything like it. The chemistry between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis is incredible! They need to be in another movie together. The fact that such a young kid can be such a powerful actor is amazing. You should never doubt the youth because you never know what they can do. So check this movie out if you haven't already because it's huge. I've never met anyone who has disliked this film. It's up there with ""Titanic"" and ""Psycho"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
solid suspense film,"The concept of people who are able to see the dead has served as the foundation for any number of suspense films in the past, including the greatest horror film of all time, 1962's ""Carnival of Souls.""  Now comes the most commercially successful of such films, ""The Sixth Sense,"" which, although it does not begin to approach the quality of that earlier film, still emerges as a solid supernatural thriller that eschews graphic violence and gratuituous gore for understatement and thought-provoking creativity.Bruce Willis stars as a renowned child psychologist who has just been awarded a major honor by the city of Philadelphia where he works and lives. On the same night, however, a former child patient breaks into his house and shoots Willis while his terrified wife looks helplessly on.  Cut to a year later as a recovered Willis pursues his latest patient - a troubled child who harbors a terrifying secret: he is, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, able to catch fleeting glimpses of dead people, whom the little boy argues, are not aware they are dead.  As Willis begins to slowly learn to believe the child, a warm relationship of mutual trust and bonding develops.It is this concentration on character rather than the more customary grue and gore that separates this film from so many other horror films of recent vintage.  Also, the director manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of slightly off-kilter otherworldliness through the use of visual correlatives: the eternally grey October sky, shots of creepy statuary or gloomy buildings caught at odd angles, a lyrical use of shadows, leaves blowing forlornly along an empty, windswept street, a glancing glimpse of a graveyard as it momentarily catches a frightened child's sight as he races by on a city bus.  It is these moments, taken as a tapestried whole, that give the film its cumulative suspenseful power.As to the film's widely heralded surprise twist ending, it will come as less of a revelation to those with a knowledge of such films as ""Carnival of Souls,"" ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Ghost"" from which ""The Sixth Sense"" seems to derive much inspiration.  Still, the audience does leave the film feeling that it has, at least, been in the hands of a group of filmmakers who respect its intelligence and have carefully thought out the elements of the narrative before rushing the production before the cameras.  In this day and age, that is a rare treat indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Sloooow moving,"The underlying story behind The Sixth Sense is intriguing, but the movie fails to exploit it effectively.  The screenplay drags and drags.  My advice:  arrive about an hour or so late and you'll see every scene that has anything to offer.  It could have been a 10.  But it's more like a 4.5. Too bad!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Predictable, but strong performances.  Blair Witch is better!","I reluctantly saw the Sixth Sense.  Over all the movie is good, with major kudos going to the boy.  It was his charisma that carried the movie.  I was thinking that this kid should have been Anakin Skywalker.Bruce Willis gave a good performance (and that is a very amazing statement).The plot was predictable.  I saw it coming about 5 minutes into the movie. I then proceeded to watch the movie and was not swayed from my original guess.  I kept waiting for the big ""Shocker"" at the end only to find out that it was my guess.  Everything at the end was so neatly explained that I was let down.What was more of a ""shocker"" was the audience's reaction to the ending.  I heard gasps, and one woman started to cry.  Couldn't they see the sixty-two allusions to the secret?  Oh well.The Blair Witch Project blew this movie out of the water with its creativity, acting, and unresolved yet appropriate ending.  I would definitely recommend this movie as well as the BWP.This movie got 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"It may freak you out, but worth a watch.","One of the most famous movie lines in history - 'I see dead people', comes from this movie. I had always knew why when I first saw this like four years ago back at school (it was after our exams), I will get freaked out at times.Because, I am the sort who does at times believe that ghosts, may be lurking around us but we just don't know it. Call me superstitious, but then I had never did anything serious to believe that. It's just, me.Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) realises that his young charge Cole (Haley Joel Osment) actually has the ability to see dead people. Thus that famous line in the movie.About every corner and turn, it's just suspenseful, and scary. It may actually really scare those who are not really into movies like this, but it's worth a watch. Just don't give yourself too much stress.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Surprising ending!,"I found this film a little bit slow. I was surprised to see it so highly graded. And I was surprised to see that it was so popular at the time.Plot is interesting, especially twist in the end. Hovewer, I saw so many similar plot thrillers that this one somehow looks pale. Hovewer, it did pass almost 15 years since the time of filming of this film, film industry did change extraordinary over these years.Acting is excellent, by all the actors, especially by the little kid.I would not rate this film so high on the ladder of IDBM films 250. I do not think it deserves to be so high.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
not as good as expected,"i went to this movie expecting a really good and scary masterpiece film. But, i was pretty disappointing. There were some creepy scenes in it, but of it was really boring. It was just too much ofthe same things. A ghost passes by, he says something un-scary, he walks away, the boy gets scared and tells about it to Bruce Willis. A few minutes later, the plot has completely forgotten about that particular event. It pretends that we are scared by every stupid ghost with blood coming out of his head, while we weren't. Throughout the film i thought about that surprising ending everyone had talked about, but when the end finally came, i wasn't ""surprised""at all, i knew this was gonna happen from the beginning! Therefore, i can't understand how come this movie is getting so much praise. It is truly overrated. If you're planning on seeing it, let me give you some advice: don't expect it to be as good as everyone said. Maybe you'll enjoy it more, because i thought it would be fantastic and i was very disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
