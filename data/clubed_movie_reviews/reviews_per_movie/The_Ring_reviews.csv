One of the best horrors of the 2000s,"'The Ring' is one of the few horror films that still makes me jump after multiple viewings and is probably up there as one of my favourites of the genre. I've always admired the way this film seems to sustain a high level of tension from practically start to finish. I can't think of many films that have done a better job at creating an eerie atmosphere and a level of creepiness that never seems to erode away no matter how many times you watch it.Part of the reason I like this film so much is it has a storyline you can actually buy into. Too many horrors focus too much on trying to scare the audience without giving enough thought to plot. For me an eerie horror like this with a convincing plot trumps anything that relies on gore and jump scares. Personally I would consider 'The Ring' is be one of the best horror films of the 2000s. Strong story, solid acting, successfully creepy and just as effective on second and third viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
All is Not Well That Ends Well...,"If you watch the video and then the phone rings, you've got a week to wait, to find out what it will bring, or rather what it will take away, as it's quite a significant price you have to pay, just for pressing play, to see Samara spring.Still a great piece of horror film making.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the scariest films I've ever seen!,"I've been watching horror movies for a long time, and I always consider myself to be some what desensitized. When I saw this film when it was released in 2002, I was terrified. Whereas other scary movies I had seen before it tended to be predictable, this one wasn't. Certain images were unexpected and shocking to me. The plot is well-placed and the setting dark and dreary. Such natural things in the world are given new meaning within the film's context.Watching it again 18 years later, I know what to expect, but it still gives me shivers. This is a solid horror/suspense film and I appreciate it in light of the tendency towards gore which followed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Big Scare,"I must say that I consider myself to be a lover of horror, but much too often, sex and gore is subsituted for real horror and you don't get that feeling of genuine fear in the pit of your stomach.  Not so with ""The Ring"". Never have I seen a film that has affected me so.  The images seem to tug at your subconscious, at the dark things we keep inside.  I haven't been able to close my eyes without replaying bits of the film behind my eyelids. I have slept with the light on since I've seen it, and we can't stop talking about it.  Hands down, it was the best, the scariest, the creepiest, and the most intense horror film ever.  The audience in the theater all gripped their armrests, breathed heavily and felt everything the characters were experiencing.  It was excellent!  But beware.... don't expect to leave ""The Ring"" in the movie theater, it will certainly be with you for a long time.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Visually intense creepfest--different purpose than the original,"This film is the American take on the Japanese original and while it absorbs its source material intact, it twists around its formula a bit in order to make it fit its new surroundings. The story is the same: a journalist, after losing her niece to a mysterious circumstance, investigates and discovers a cursed videotape, which gives a viewer only seven days to live.Like its predecessors, the film doesn't spend that much time on the supernatural elements, but focuses more on the mystery. However, The Ring features a lot more supernatural elements immediately and throughout the film than either previous version, perhaps to make more obvious and visceral the impending doom that faces our protagonist. Visually, The Ring has been injected with a shot of adrenaline, being less the brooding mystery of the original and more immediate and menacing. The color palette is colder than Ringu and the story is also more detached and focused on the ghostly mechanics than the human story, which leads the film to be more recognizably intimidating.The story itself is a little more mysterious in that the backstory of our villain is rather thin and unexplained. Furthermore, the villain is clearly portrayed as senselessly malevolent; this weakens at least two significant scenes. The ending, I think, is more clever than the previous versions. I like that there is something to the relationship between the protagonist, Rachel, and her ally, Noah, but it still seems a little weak when compared to Ringu--where one line can effortlessly show the development in the relationship.As far as a horror movie goes, The Ring is a blunt, but nonetheless creepy example. Losing some of the trappings of its predecessors helps simplify the story for faster flow and to create room for more visual creepiness, but also loses some of the complexity that helped the story have more depth. It's more of impressive frightfest than Ringu, but is a little weaker in story resonance. In the end, that makes The Ring just as effective overall: if you want more chills, catch this version. If you want more meat, catch Ringu. Decent entertainment. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Undeclared Horror Masterpiece,"The Ring usually gets a bad rep for being ""too slow"" and some people even say that ""nothing happens"" in the movie. Unless you have ADD or something, you have to at least appreciate what Gore Verbinski achieved in 2002. What he did was he basically took the premise of Ringu, a good suspenseful Japanese horror flick and made it more suspenseful and filled with creepy visuals.I am a huge horror fan, and this is one of the movies that unsettles me the most. The suspenseful pace, the incredible, beautiful but haunting visuals make this a unique experience. I love gory films, but this one relies a lot more on psychological horror and imagery to create scares. No jump scares, just good story telling.The movie may not answer all the questions it creates, but the viewer, if he pays attention accordingly, will be able to figure them out for himself.Unsettling to the bone, The Ring is one of my favorite horror films of all time. Truly underrated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Ringu,I think Aiden is way more frightening than Samara.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great!,"This movie makes you realize why so many other movies fail to be scary...not enough psychological elements. What this movie does right is that it skips the gore, and blood, and over-the-top overacting crazed lunatics that seem the norm in horror movies.I saw this with a friend in the theater and 10 minutes in we were sinking into our chairs with fear. Not even the annoying teens making their phones ring to scare their friends (when you see the movie you will understand why) were a powerful enough distraction to undo the terror we felt.Definitely see it, make sure you have as big a TV as you can get your hands on when you rent it, and that you watch it at night in the dark...if you want the full effect. Also, make sure you rent it on DVD and NOT cassette...you know, just to be safe ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"scary, thoughtful and satisfying which is fine with me","These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow ""Kill Bill"" (2003/2004) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie (but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot). In the derivative ""the Last Samurai"" (2003), Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture: to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper: ""Ringu"" (1998). Against all odds, he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director. ""Mousehunt"" (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but ""the Mexican"" (2001) was a lame movie. Some friends had told me: ""don't watch ""the Ring"", it's a hokey movie"". I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. The main character, Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it. What do these outlandish and eerie images mean? What lies beneath them? At her own risk, she and her son watch the video. She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video. ""The Ring"" could well illustrate this famous premise: ""to understand evil, we've got to go back to the sources..."".What distinguishes ""the Ring"" from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects. Still better, Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story. On an unhurried pace, Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel's investigation. His directing is also worth the price of admission. It is well-crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Besides, what is notable in ""the Ring"" is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer's nerves. This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension. Lighting and makeup shouldn't also be forgotten.The thrust of ""the Ring"" isn't only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So, she's also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream, woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers' fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover, these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols: the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness, the figure at the window (a hint at ""Psycho""?, 1960) might symbolize parental severity.That said, Verbinski's genteel piece of work isn't exempted of drawbacks. Rachel's little boy is a cardboard character, a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999). When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel's companion, it's nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something, all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur... well, you get the picture. But they're minor quibble and don't overflow too much on the thrill of the vision.I repeat it: I haven't seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve, without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches, it can be gratifying. And in the case of ""the Ring"", rightly so...A sequel ""the Ring 2"" opened last year. Is it worthwhile?",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"disturbing, unsettling and downright creepy.","I first watched this movie with a couple of friends. To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.The film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it's viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.The movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting.So if you are looking for a horror flick to watch on Friday night, be sure to watch The Ring, just make sure to watch it at night with the lights off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror with Depth!,"Before I saw The Ring, I used to think of horror movies as something about a supernatural (sometimes not supernatural) force that gobbles up people in bizarre series of deaths usually accompanied by blood and gore. Maybe I ought to blame it on my own selection of movies. But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.The Ring is an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu. Ringu is a well respected horror movie. Rather than call The Ring as an adaptation I would prefer calling it as an improvisation of Ringu. For I have seen both movies and in my personal opinion the producers of The Ring have made the story a bit deeper and of course with the music and special effects scarier.A particular thing worth mentioning is the work done by the child actor David Dorfman (playing the role of Aidan). My personal opinion is that he has done a very good job. And Ehren Kruger, in his script for the movie has given a major role to Aidan as opposed to lesser important role given to Aidan's Japanese counterpart.Full credit to the Ring's makers for a very fine adaptation of the original Ringu. And yes, a small word of advice for those who have not seen the real Daveigh Chase (playing Samara). After seeing this movie, do look up on the net for a picture of hers and make the comparison! And do try and watch Ringu as well. A very respectable movie indeed.A good story, nice scares, decent acting and smooth direction! Enjoy the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best Horror Ever Made?,"The Ring's wonderful concept made the movie an extraordinary experience. The whole idea of a videotape that kills you after a week, is something very unusual and unexpected, not just psychopathic killers and zombies all the time, but something different. Based on the book ""The Ring"" by Koji Suzuki and produced by DreamWorks entertainment, made this an unforgettable experience. The atmosphere with amazing suspense music by Hans Zimmer and mysterious plot that holds on, make things much more interesting. The camera filming was great, I liked when they did some intense zoom-ins and flashbacks from the clues the main character is collecting. I got to say that the main hero, Rachel, performed by Naomi Watts, was playing so realistic and took her role in good hands, with great engagement. Story build-up was great, and amazing way of making a good jump-scare. Many things doesn't seem so scary if you hear about the film, but it's scarier when you watch it. It's disturbing, with many unexpected turns of action. I really liked that they made the film like a sort of mystery to solve. After Rachel watched the video tape, and only had one week to find out, things are getting tighter and tighter, and the perspective is different then. The clues she is collecting is leading forward, and after everything, everything combines and makes a finished puzzle, and that was great! In the end, The Ring was a great horror. Scary, frightening, and disturbing, just as a horror should be. Maybe one of the best horrors I have watched in my entire life, so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Superior, Atmospheric, Twisted Little Creepfest","The Ring did three things no film of late has done. It took the genre of Horror seriously without going over the top. It is derived from a superior story and translated to American film superbly, regardless of what the naysayers say. And, while it starts off typically, it ascends into a beautiful, darkling, twisted, genuinely creepy story, which holds you through to the end.Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. He has left this work well marked with his stylistic shots, and suspenseful progression.Actually, I found this far superior to most horrors done in the last thirty years or so. A lot has been said about Ringu, the work from which this was adapted for American cinema, and inevitable subsequent comparisons made, however, that is certainly NOT the case. That argument is moot, as this work was based on the novel, ""The Ring"" by Koji Suzuki, so if you want something to which an honest comparison may be made, I would suggest you read the book, and leave Ringu where it belongs. Personally, I found the American adaptation much more to my liking than Ringu.This is one twisted little creep-fest! It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You Die In 7 Days!,"Though I haven't yet seen 1998's ""Ringu"" (from Japan) - I certainly thought that 2002's ""The Ring"" (which was its American remake) was (as far as modern-day ghost stories go) a satisfyingly eerie tale of the supernatural. This film actually produced some very real and powerful chills without having to resort to grinding excessive, bloody gore into my face.Featuring plenty of ghostly images to frighten the viewer, royally - Along with a mellow flow of hypnotically haunting music (composed by Hans Zimmer) to set the mood - ""The Ring"" certainly didn't let me down at all as its story went deep into an investigation into the deaths of those who had viewed a mysterious video tape.Impressively directed by Gore Verbinski - There was definitely no question in my mind that this talented movie-maker understood the genre of film that he was working with, completely.For me, ""The Ring"" was a real ""gem-of-a-fright-flick"" whose spooky images and scary story-line actually stayed with me long after the whole horror-show was over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
First class suspense,"The Ring, an American remake of the Japanese film ""Ringu"", is in my honest opinion a spectacular and enthralling film. The writing, directing, performances and replay value are amazing in and of themselves. I especially love the premise, and I will review this movie as it's own film, not a remake. What really makes it wonderful is the incredible performances and suspense. I really love all the actors' and actresses' dedication and believability, there being very memorable deliverances of lines and scenes after the film is over. The suspense is top-notch, because of how well the movie is played out and how creepy and fun the material is, that I was both eyes on the screen every second. Naomi Watts is radiant and brilliant; the scenes where she slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together, or uncovers something dark and haunting are haunting themself because of how marvelous she makes this material.Do not get me wrong, the material itself is great, but it would have been nothing were it not for the cast. The characters are all interesting, and the main story is quite saddening and effective when it is slowly revealed through many different aspects. While it seems as though the main threat, a ""killer videotape"", would be a ridiculous and stupid threat, hard to make convincing, it undoubtedly works to the fullest here and is entirely convincing, the videotape's images and the events themselves all being very interesting and entertaining. While the movie is not a masterpiece, it is not too short from it, having a great replay value and being one of the top 20 most effective horrors of the 00s, in my opinion. I am glad it receives a lot of positive reception, for it deserves every bit of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Scariest Movies Ever Made,"It's hard to imagine a film about a cursed video tape making a big splash these days, but that's just what The Ring did when it was released late in 2022, igniting the box office on fire and starting a long-running trend of Asian horror remakes.Naomi Watts plays Rachel, a reporter who gets the story of her life when her teenage niece and her friends are found dead under mysterious circumstances. After a little digging, she finds out that they all went to a secluded cabin in the woods and saw the same eerie video tape. When she decides to watch it for herself, the phone rings and a child's voice lets her know that she has seven days until the curse comes for her, too.Gore Verbinski gets every bit of dread and tension out of the premise and its ticking time bomb screenplay will keep you on the edge of your seat.

A return to true horror!,"A one line review of this film would simple be `The Ring does what most scary films promise, but never deliver'. That should be enough for any scare enthusiast to justify the price of the ticket, and for the most part no one will be disappointed. I say `for the most part' because it is tough to define what is scary for everyone, and I don't deny that this film may not scare many people as easily as others. It must be said however that this film is probably one of the more successful scare flicks, in the spirit of movies like The Exorcist'.Well crafted, extremely well developed and perfectly executed this remake of the 1998 Japanese Horror film Ringu' is one movie to fit into your top 10 scare flicks. Disturbing from start to end the film quite effectively leaves you writhing in your seat, grasping a loved one until its gripping conclusion without a single piece of gore at all. An art often lost on modern films and obviously inspired by the original (I have not seen the original), the subtle approach to making these kinds of films is delivered to the screen close to an eerie perfection.The Ring is about a tape, a tape that features some rather disturbing yet very `student film' like snapshots of what can only be described as someone's nightmare. The problem is when the tape concludes, the phone rings and a voice tells you that you will die in exactly seven days. When four teenagers die, simultaneously at 10pm exactly seven days after secretly staying at a secluded cabin a reporter named Rachel, who was the mother of a boy named Aidan, who was a cousin to one of the girls decides to investigate. Partially motivated by the will of the dead girls parents to find an answer as to how their daughter's heart simply stopped, Rachel successfully finds the tape the group watched. Unfortunately for her, she watches it and to her horror she receives a phone call, she now has seven days to solve the puzzle or end up like the others. What follows is an exposition mystery about the chilling origins of the tape, and the power behind the sudden death of each viewer.Notably, there is nothing terribly exceptional about the acting in this film, it is by no means truly award worthy. It is however extremely well suited to the film and very well executed. Naomi Watts as Rachel holds up very well as the centrepiece of the film and remains a constant link to the audience making the drama more real. Martin Hendersen as the X-Husband Noah was quite well played and David Dorfman as Aidan was not only well cast, but will most likely go on to be apart of many more films that involve a child like this (very much like the Sixth Sense).The most notable part of this film is its visual and auditory construction, which is responsible for creating most of the tension and scares in the film. There is a great deal in the sound design that will go unnoticed by the average movie-goer, but it features some very subtle sound ranging from scratching to moans and groans and a few other twisted noises. These are woven into the films music to create a deep sense of abnormality during the films more freaky moments and mood sequences.The visual aspects of the film are close to perfect, a delightful blend of colour that looks digitally graded as opposed to filtered. A strong cold blue dominated throughout the entire film, very rarely mixed with any warmth at all, with the exception of a few scenes. The autumn colours are used quite sharply in contrast to the cold to create another level of abnormality that accompanies the sound design and makes certain aspects of the film standout quite deliberately. From there the camera captures the direction on screen perfectly and with some very well paced editing you end up with a visual treat as much as a formidable film. Much of the story is told with the camera and most of the stories best moments come from effective use of visuals.I am afraid now that I can't go on without spoiling the film, except to say that the climax is one of the more simplistic yet terrifying moments I have had in a cinema. To watch the packed audience all twist in their seats, gasp and groan in a sort of painful anxiety while the events unfolded on screen was just as much of a treat as the film. This film should scare or at least in the best part disturb you, but I am not promising anything as there have been the odd one or two who claim they found nothing frightening in it at all. Still, scary or not, it is one of the better made Hollywood horror films and more importantly it does not stick to the Hollywood formula not does it give us a Hollywood ending.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Definite creepfest,"Despite some flaws and limpness in the middle of the movie, this is still a great horror movie. I have to think back when I first saw it and thought it was incredibly creepy. Samara is a great villain. It relies on some jump scares, but there's this air of discomfort that permeates throughout. The only time in the movie you feel part of the real world is the intro. As soon as that ends, you're pulled into this dreamlike series of scenes that paint a terrifying and hopeless story for the characters. The colors in the movie appear so washed out so as to remove you from reality so you question whether you just watched the tape....If you've never seen, you're missing out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The first and still best, J Horror Remake","The Good: I forgot how good this movie actually is. It's been imitated and parodied so many times at this point, that I don't really think it's possible to be ""scared"" by it (Scary Movie 3 absolutely made sure of that), but that's fine. Unlike any of its successors, the original Ring isn't really a ""horror"" movie for most of it. It's a mystery thriller disguised as a ghost story, and it works. The primary tone of this film is dread; the rainy, misty Seattle setting, the blue/green colour grade, the coldness of the world just emanates from the screen.To be honest, nothing ""horrifying"" really happens for a bulk of this movie. It's an interesting structure and makes the final 15 minutes all the more satisfying. That final scene is still so freaking great, 20 years later.The Bad: Characters. That's this movie's main issue. None of the characters are particularly interesting or compelling. They're not fun to watch. Rachel has no discernible personality. Her son...oh my. He is probably one of the most annoying and frustrating children I have ever seen on screen.The Ugly: It's kind of funny to think how little time Samara gets on screen, but how iconic of a villain she is. I also feel like it was an amazing decision to not show her kill anyone until the very end (and even that isn't actually shown). She's one of those villains who progressively got more goofy as time went on (and Scary Movie 3 happened), but respect where it's due: her first appearance was awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An uncommonly strong remake, ""The Ring"" chills to the bone thanks to its masterful visuals and a complex, puzzling storyline.","Remakes! Reboots! Re-imaginings!Terms that have come to be wholly dismissed by the filmgoing public, met with a collective sigh of exasperation whenever they're uttered. Yes the world of entertainment has notably been going through a bit of a trend over the past decade or so... any successful property, no matter how old (or young) or how highly (or lowly) regarded it may be, can and will likely be revisited with one of those labels slapped on.From a business perspective, it makes sense. Familiarity and recognizable names are an invaluable thing to have in the world of entertainment, with millions upon millions riding in the balance and audiences fickle of which original properties they'll give a chance to or not. But from a personal perspective, there are plenty of people who are getting sick of the remakes and reboots. Because they think it represents the loss of original ideas or does a disservice to the original works.But the reason why I personally cannot wholly dismiss good-old remakes, reboots, etc. is because for every few terrible cash-grab retreads... for every couple needlessly gritty re-tellings... for every handful of just plain awful re-treads... there's at least one good one. Sometimes even one fantastic one. A rarity that rivals the original, honoring it while also functioning well as its own artistic piece.""The Ring"", a 2002 horror film from director Gore Verbinski, is one such film.Taking inspiration from the worldwide phenomena that is director Hideo Nakata's Japanese thriller ""Ringu"" (or ""Ring""; inspired by the novels of Koji Suzuki), ""The Ring"" is a stirring, thrilling and often chilling excursion into the world of supernatural terror.After her niece is killed under mysterious circumstances, journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) probes her death, soon discovering it is connected to a mysterious video cassette containing a series of disturbing and twisted images... soon after, a phonecall with the cryptic message of ""seven days"" warns her of her impending doom. Together with her ex Noah (Martin Henderson) and young son Aiden (David Dorfman), Rachel must solve the mystery of this supernatural video in order to save her life.One of the most important things a remake must do in order to justify its own existence is to not only give honor and homage to the original, but also explore the concept, storyline and characters in new, relevant and interesting ways. And that most certainly is one of the main strengths of ""The Ring."" It takes the basic premise presented in the Nakata original, but builds upon and subverts the circumstances of the story in order to retain a degree of freshness. While most noticeable in the obvious and necessary differences in American and Japanese cultures and horror, the film also does a lot of other new and interesting things with the very concept itself and the characters to differentiate the two stories. But it never loses sight of what made the original so effective- that being the grand mystery aspect and the old-fashioned ghost-story. You can watch it immediately after the original, and still not quite know where it's going while still appreciating the wonderful homages to the original and the familiarity of the story. That's perhaps one of the best things a remake can do... present something familiar, but give it just enough of a new spin that it feels fresh once again. Which is sadly something most other remakes fail to heed, with many either being too much a slave to the original or too far removed from it.The other great strength of the film is the wonderfully oppressive and dreary visual direction courtesy Verbinski. While he is perhaps most noted as the big-budget director of fare such as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""The Lone Ranger"", I've often found that his strongest work is his more intimate and low-budget... particularly the quirky drama ""The Weather Man"" and this film. Here, he paints a beautiful and dark portrait of terror, using strong composition and subtle moments of striking fear to create an absolute atmosphere of dread. Along with his keen use of elements like rain, muted color and quick cutting, Verbinksi crafts a wonderful visual guidance that brings you right into the film. Combined with the cool, deathly palate of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli and the freakish and mournful music of Hans Zimmer, Verbinski is able to craft the perfect visual and audible horror experience to tell this tale.The performances of the cast are also quite magnificent. In particular Watts, who is just perfect in her role. There's a great sense of both personal strength and self-doubt that she fills Keller with, and it makes the character memorable and easily identifiable. Definitely one of the best horror-movie leads of its decade.If I were to nit-pick the film's few weaknesses, I'd have to say it's biggest issue is that it can occasionally fall for the rare cliché and predictable moment. And I'd be lying if I said I couldn't help but compare it to the stellar original, which was on the whole just a touch more startling and cohesive an experience. Especially in the way the story comes together in the end and you discover just what's happening and why... it seemed almost a little too far-fetched in this remake in comparison to the original.Still, those minor flaws cannot detract from the overall film, and it remains not only a great film on its own right, but also a prime example of why remakes shouldn't be outwardly dismissed without being given a proper chance. If it weren't for remakes, we wouldn't have fantastic works like this.I give ""The Ring"" a fantastic 9 out of 10.

A Scary Movie with a Disappointing End,"Rachel Keller (the gorgeous Naomi Watts) is a journalist investigating a videotape that may have killed four teenagers (including her niece). There is an urban legend about this tape: the viewer will die seven days after watching it. If the legend is correct, Rachel will have to run against time to save her son's and her own life.The premise is great and the plot is scary. Everything works in this movie: the cast, the direction, the special effects, the screenplay etc. Unfortunately, the end of the story is not so good. Probably the intention of the studio in preparing the viewers for a sequel impairs the end of the plot. Anyway, watching this flick (and Naomi Watts) is worthwhile, which is highly indicated for fans of horror movies like me. Now I intend to watch the original Ringu. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Chamado"" (""The Call"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Pretty Decent Remake,I saw this in the cinema back when it released in 2002 and I haven't seen it since. I then saw this in a box set with the sequel at the charity shop for £2 and bought it.I know this is a remake of the 1998 Japanese film I have yet to see.The story is of a videotape that kills anyone that watches it a week after. A journalist's son watches the video and she has to figure out how to stop it.The son is odd and has  taken out of him in a Scary Movie film. The atmosphere is quite creepy and the long haired girl is quite scary to see. The only thing I hated was a well known TV scene was CGI'd and she crawled out too fast.I would give this a watch.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What a shame...,"It has to be understood as an offense to any savvy viewer who caught the Japanese version of the movie, 'Ringu'.I am aware of the fact that US crowds do not go for movies that do not cast large-breasted blonde psychotic women, but this is a little far-fetched for this story. The movie is meant to be solely based on psychology thrills and brain scare. The American version of the movie does not help in this at all, as all goes into the image and the special effects. Event he plot has to be altered and worsened: the little boy becomes a depressed child with a 6th sense who calls his mom by her first name.Anyhow, you may go for the American remake if you are the kind to be scared by movies with subtitles. However, if you were delivered with a brain and some artistic sense, you'll go for 'Ringu'.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I absolutely love this movie,"The Ring remains to this day one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. It is not particularly violent, like all those cruddy (and the occasionally decent) slasher film. But honestly, is there anyone who doesn't get a chill running down their spines when they show those dead bodies with the gray skin and hollowed out eyes staring out at nothing. This movie honestly gave me a nightmare the night after I watched it.And that videotape. With its odd, seemingly random images flashing across the screen. I remember distinctly the falling chair, a ladder leaning against a wall, a tree standing isolated in the middle of an empty feel. These images by themselves wouldn't be able to generate anything remotely resembling fear, but it's not the images. It's the relative calm and oddity of these pictures that leads to a feeling of unrest, a feeling that something more sinister is lurking just out of sight.This is Gore Verbinski's best movie. Period. I liked all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies a lot, too, but none of them come remotely close to achieving the upper echelons of their respective genres, as the Ring did, at least in my opinion. And honestly,perhaps most terrifying of all...is just seeing-her. With the long dark hair hanging ominously over her face, so no expression is visible.This movie is relentless. Something is always waiting in the dark, around the next turn. And then just when you think it's over...the movie hits full throttle. The pacing starts off quickly, and just continues to pick up speed. The Ring is the definition of the phrase ""Never a dull moment.""This is another movie to watch alone, in the dark, just like Alien. The difference-once Alien is over, you can say the terror was long in the future, on an isolated spaceship. The Ring is here and now. And with nothing stopping her, that cold-hearted terror, it seems just within the realm of possibility that she is coming up behind you now, as you read this, about to strike...",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A masterpiece of horror, one of the best","The Ring may not have as many jumpscares as the Nun, but you will be far more concerned for the characters and more taken aback by the progression of the plot. The story has such an incredible timeline of events; each day of the week in the story of this film feels unique and memorable. The main character feels like a real person and the antagonist so helplessly angry. The Ring surprises you and shocks you, entertains you and makes you look away.The ending is also very unexpected and leaves you with a lot to think about.

"Not without flaws, but better than the Japanese original","After having seen both the original Japanese ""Ringu"" (1998) and its American remake ""The Ring"" (2002), I found the latter superior in almost every aspect (atmosphere, cinematography, effects, soundtrack, acting, pace), though the script is in the usual Frankenstein-style of contemporary U.S. horror films -- borrowed pieces from everywhere put together with visible stitches all over.The original ""Ringu"" is part of the ""new trend"" in Japanese horror films (and since then imported by the U.S.) that goes like ""when everything seems the quietest...when you're least expecting...it's precisely then that...NOTHING happens!"" (add loud metallic noises). The cinema of anti-climax!! ""Ringu"" was full of these anti-climaxes, with an annoying slow pace, but it had other major problems: a very unsympathetic male lead character with Cronenbergian ""Dead Zone"" ESP powers played by a deadpan actor (in the American remake this far-fetched stuff is left out); perfectly expendable characters (such as the grandfather); several plot holes impossible to come to terms with (even more than in the US version), culminating in a very confusing third act.The American remake has several assets of its own: a trimmer pace; lovely and charismatic British/Australian actress Naomi Watts; fine attempts at creating haunting images (the breathtaking horse sequence on the boat; Samara's psychiatric treatment; and especially the ""short film on the videotape"" itself, a gem of surrealistic inspiration and telegraphic efficiency -- no wonder, as director Gore Verbinski was a highly successful publicity director). However, there are some letdowns too, especially those impossible phone calls (how DO you explain them at ALL? Who cares?) and some of the cast (the male lead, insipid; and the boy who plays Naomi's son, creepy beyond any sympathy).Not ""revolutionary"", but with subtler, richer shades than the usual U.S. noisy, in-your-face-special-FX brainless horror routines and much more exciting than the anti-climax Japanese modern horror films. My vote: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A good scary film  but please watch Ringu to see how good it SHOULD be,"A rumour is going around about a video tape that may have some sort of killer virus on it.  Anyone who watches it dies mysteriously seven days later.  Naturally disbelieving the whole nonsense, journalist Rachel Keller decides to investigate further when a relative of hers supposedly views the tape and dies seven days later.  She finds the tape and watches it, enlisting the help of video expert Noah to help her uncover where the tape was made.  Can she solve the tape's secrets before 7 days are up?OK.  It's important to know where a reviewers bench mark is before you judge where they are coming from.  So let me say that I saw Ringu a year back and it really freaked me out.  So as you can imagine I came to this half expecting it to be a rubbish remake of a film that I didn't see any need to remake.  However it was better than I had feared and probably will stand out as one of the best horror movies of 2003 (when it is released in the UK). The plot has changed slightly from the original but not really to the detriment of the film  it actually helps it be more modern and more believable now that it's in America.The film's main problem for me was the fact that it went for the `jump scares' rather than `creepy scares' which Ringu had.  Here we have more sudden movements where Ringu moved slowly and deliberately.  Ring does this well at points too, but for most it will always go for the jump rather than the unnerving creep.  However I defy anyone not to get a little creeped out by the remake as well.  If I hadn't seen Ringu I know I would have enjoyed this more  but I only kept remembering how well it was done in the first place.  For example THAT scene (viewers will know what I mean) is too quick and too jumpy in Ring whereas in Ringu it was slow, deliberate and terrifying in it's sheer unnerving horror.  Likewise in ring we see the child'' face a lot more which detracts from the fear of the unknown  in Ringu it was more of the long hair.The performances are not as good as Ringu in some respects.  Watts is very good and is believably scared.  Henderson is OK but I wanted a more mature man rather than a surfer-dude type.  The support cast were all good, with Brian Cox thrown into the mix.  My only pause for concern was Dorfman  why was he allowed to change the character of the boy? In Ringu he was a normal kid, here he comes across like a poor man's Haley Joel Osmond in 6th Sense? His routine took away from the emotional involvement that should have come with the danger he was in  instead he just comes across as difficult.  The performance is OK but 1, the change to the character is strange and unnecessary and 2, it just felt a little too like the 6th Sense!Overall I enjoyed the film and was scared at some points.  However too often it went for the jump rather than just being consistently unnerving as Ringu was.  Fans of Ringu may dislike this but I think those who haven't seen the original will enjoy this.  Word of advice though  go out and find a copy of the original and watch it first, you'll enjoy it a lot more and it'll show you why Hollywood fell over themselves to try and copy it in a more commercial way.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The best thriller I've seen in a long time,"The Ring is probably the best horror movie I've ever seen. There. I said it. I feel like this movie doesn't get enough recognition compared to stupid things like Friday the 13th with no substance.I feel like this movie is the right balance of mystery and horror. Movies like Poltergeist that are pure horror or like Seven that are (almost) all mystery are interesting on their own. The Ring manages to juggle these genres effectively, without ever feeling like you're watching two movies.Inevitably, a lot of you have probably seen the scene where Samara crawls out of the TV.This scene, and the scenes leading up to it, make one of the most underrated plot twists ever. It's brilliant because it's so simple. Oh yeah, that girl you were helping the whole movie? Turns out she's not so nice.But it my opinion the best shot of the movie is a shot of a car driving from above. It perfectly captures Washington with its greenish colors and beautiful views. Gore Verbinski is an amazing director and there's not one shot I'd change.Beautiful with a compelling story. A must watch for all movie fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Still Scary After All These Years,"It's been 13 years since The Ring was released, and yet, somehow, the film holds up incredibly well. Maybe not in terms of technology, but in terms of scares, it's one of the best out there. I remember watching the film as a teen and immediately regretting my poor decision. Having recently rewatched it, the film still managed to get under my skin, and for good reason: The atmosphere is palpable, and a sense of dread is consistently sustained from the first scene through the end credits. And let's talk about that first scene featuring a young Amber Tamblyn who, nowadays, is instantly recognizable. What a scene to grab an audience's attention! Haunting and unpredictable, it's no surprise The Ring's opening is considered to be one of horror's best, easily as good as the ones from Scream and Jaws.Despite its scares, The Ring is also a surprisingly beautiful looking film, and with a $48 million price tag, it should be. Unlike most horror films these days, cinematographer Bojan Bazelli provides some amazing compositions and frames every scene with unexpected allure, even though the film is filled with plenty of disturbing imagery. Of course, director Gore Verbinski should also be given credit for the film's success. Rarely have I seen a horror film in which all of its moving parts worked together so well. From the production design, performances, the aforementioned cinematography, editing, and soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, it's like witnessing a master who actually understands the language of film.As for the screenplay, writer Ehren Kruger of... (wait for it) the Transformers films, gives time for the story to breathe and build, an uncommon characteristic for a horror flick. Kruger also cleverly writes in an familial subplot that provides an emotional underpinning for its characters. What people tend to forget about The Ring is that even though it's about a journalist trying to solve the mystery behind a cursed tape, it's also about a broken up family that slowly comes together in the wake of a crisis. Because of that, I will say that the ending is unnecessarily cruel and unearned, providing a twist that pulls the rug from under the audience just for the sake of doing so.Still, lead Naomi Watts is able to carry the film on her shoulders through and through. In spite of not being a notable actress at the time, her impressive performance as the strong-willed Rachel quickly put Watts in the mainstream spotlight. Martin Henderson and David Dorfman also provide memorable performances as the remaining members of the family, though it's disappointing to see Henderson has yet to reach A-list status as Watts did. He provides the charisma, charm, and humor required for the role. Cameos from veteran actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also raise the film to another level, and both are terrific in their limited screen time. Overall, The Ring is an unnerving yet gorgeous film, supported by an assured direction from Gore Verbinski and a breakthrough performance from Naomi Watts. Who says PG-13 horror can't be scary and well made?",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psychological horror doesn't get much better.,"Psychological horror films can be among the most effective ones. Their reliance on slowly building tension and atmosphere makes them less susceptible to the desensitization that can come with the repeated ""jump scares"" and excessive gore that can be an issue in other kinds of horror movies. Of course, psychological horror always must be sure to not be too slow-paced, because then it becomes boring. The Ring is a perfect example of what I consider a good psych-horror movie to be, because it unfolds like a mystery and keeps the viewer cerebrally involved...as it scares the crap out of them.There really is a good story here. Figuring out what is going on and why is a great part of why The Ring is one of my favorite horror flicks. It completely avoids many of the genre's clichés, while still providing scene after scene of unsettling imagery. We're talking some really freaky stuff. The characters come off as relatively normal human beings, instead of the annoying one-note caricatures that populate so many of the movie's contemporaries.I really think that it surpasses the original Japanese version in almost every way. The story is tighter, more focused, and more consistent. I love Naomi Watts, so it's no surprise that I think the casting was pretty great. And as I said before, the atmosphere is absolutely stellar. All the greys, blues, fog and rain mixed with the growing despair of the characters, really helps to put the viewer in the right mood. It's amazing how a sense of dread permeates the entire film, even though the main antagonist is seen so sparingly. There's virtually no gore or violence, and everything works exceptionally well without it. This movie scared the hell out of me in high school, and it still does today. It's a great mystery/thriller, artfully woven into one of the best horror movies in years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I saw this movie close to the time it released as a child (and later as a teen) when VHS tapes were still very prominent, and the internet age still wasn't as huge as it is today. It nailed the static of tube televisions and made it into this big creepy horror story tied to a video tape. Sure today where people do not use VHS tapes or barely even use DVDs anymore and research everything due to the prominence of the internet it may not be as scary as it was back in the day.

"Quality of Horror and Plot over Quantity of Bad Horror is This Movie's Focus, and it Works","The Ring is a horror crime drama about a video tape that, if watched, will lead to death in seven days. It's a decent plot for a horror movie, and for the most part is quite well done.The plot is, like I said, well done. It's not what you'd expect from a horror movie, as it's more focused on the mystery of the horror over actually scaring you. There aren't actually that many scary parts in this movie. So as far as the plot goes it was done in a more original way, and it was interesting to watch. The story of the horror itself wasn't terribly original, but it was good nonetheless.The characters were pretty good, especially the main character. She's not a complete idiot (unlike in most horror movies), and she makes choices that are understandable. She does some stupid stuff, but nothing that would make her anything like the average horror movie girl. Everyone else is fine. There's enough screen time for them to show you what they're like, and there's only three major ones. The other ones you know aren't important so they aren't focused on.The horror itself is good. There aren't a whole lot of cheap jump scares, and most of them are more startling and scary because of how the scary thing looks, not because of the surprise. As for how scary it is overall, it really isn't usually. If you're looking to be scared, you probably won't really be by this one.Overall The Ring is good. It's an original take on the horror genre that I really appreciated, and while it isn't fantastic it's still very good.

"Of All The Hollywood Remakes Of Japanese Horror, 'The Ring' Still Stands As The Best","Of all the Hollywood remakes of Japanese horror features that have surfaced since the dawn of the new millennium, The Ring still stands as the best. Encapsulated with a sense of foreboding, making effective use of its ominous ambiance, and treading its material with patience, it's a dark, surreal & visually haunting omen that thrills as well as satisfies.The story of The Ring revolves around a videotape that is fabled to bear a jinx that kills its viewers after 7 days. The plot follows a journalist who conducts her own investigation when her niece & her three other friends die under mysterious circumstances, and ultimately stumbles upon the ill-fated video herself. With limited time on her hands, she tries to find a way to lift the curse.Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring is virtually a shot-for-shot remake of the original but its visual & sound design do give its images a distinctiveness of their own. Verbinski relies on the creepiness that sets in earlier in the story to keep the viewers around instead of going for conventional tricks like jump scares or gore. Also worthy of mention is his firm control over pacing & atmosphere.The whole film has a very wet, isolated look n feel that's further enhanced by its sunless ambiance & cold colour tones. Camera-work is silent yet brooding, shooting locations provide a spectral aura to the film, Editing is definitely a plus, for it allows the plot to unravel at its own pace and is able to retain its mystery till the end, while Hans Zimmer's muffled score silently amplifies the eerie mood.Coming to the performances, Naomi Watts carries the entire picture with a commendable input but she could've done better if more depth was provided to her character. Martin Henderson is almost flat in his part while the kid himself looks creepier than the antagonist. The most noteworthy of all are the contents of the cursed videotape, reeking with such surreal & disturbing images that it has a mystical power of its own.On an overall scale, The Ring is one of the rare remakes that are just as compelling as the original, if not more, and is one of the better examples of atmospheric horror done right. Enveloped with a chilling layer of dread, it is an unnerving & unsettling feature that tackles its tale with restraint and revels in the tension that originates from its sinister iconography. A welcome respite from mindless gore & cheap thrills, The Ring is definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Truly Imbecilic,"Well, this film left me depressed, not because it was creepy, but because it was so stupid and at the same time so cynical.  I may say that there is not a single thing in this picture which makes any sense or has any genuine humanity in it.  The monster is an evil little girl, but there is never the slightest indication to suggest why the girl is so evil or so powerful - indeed, precisely the sort of silence which is a certain giveaway that the picture has been made by people with adolescent mentalities, for adolescents.   You posit some sort of monstrosity, and that's all there is to it, nothing more need be said.  ""Okay, like, there's this evil little girl with incredible powers...?""  To give but two instances of the astonishing illogic which characterizes the film.  For one, the mysterious video which is killing people is said to have been imprinted from the evil girl's memories.  But the video is full of images of things that the girl could not possibly have seen.  For another, the characters are horrified to realize that it is a terrible calamity that her skeleton has been taken from the well, because somehow this means that now she is free to wreak her evil upon the world and kill people.  But she has been wreaking her evil upon the world and killing people even with her skeleton at the bottom of the well! Oh, I'm sorry, apparently she can now actually drag her ugly carcass out of the television set and kill people instead of killing them from inside the television set.  But perhaps her identically melted-face victims would not consider this such an important distinction.  Then there is the clerk who manages the cabins and upon whose shelf the evil video is found - the curious fellow who plays him is given a nice little character-actor turn, interacting with the blonde lady who is the star, trying to perform card tricks, and so forth - and then we never see him again!  What the heck was <i>that</i> about?  What was his part in the sinister events, what was the video doing on his shelf?  We never learn!  We never see him again!  You see, it is as if the screenplay for this film was written, scene by scene, without any reference to anything that had been written before, certainly not with any intention to exercise the slightest logic or continuity, but merely to work certain changes upon the psyche of the filmgoer, who is presumed to be a teen-ager, I suppose, and who is certainly held in utter contempt.

Rachel is understandably reluctant to buy into the rumour, and as soon as she finds the tape down at a holiday cabin where Katie and her friends stayed a week before they all died, she watches it without hesitation. But then the phone rings, and Rachel discovers just how much truth there is behind the talk after all. Now, she has just seven days to live, and with the help of her ex-husband, Noah (Martin Henderson, acting far too cocky), Rachel must delve deep into the mysterious origins of the tape, before it threatens to destroy her.Considering how many previous incarnations of Kôji Suzuki's 'Ring' universe there are, it's quite surprising that America didn't try to pull off their own adaptation of this story earlier. The very first part of this saga was originally brought to the big screen in 1998's 'Ring'. Directed by then-unknown Japanese filmmaker Hideo Nakata, 'Ring' was a masterpiece of the horror genre, and its runaway box office success helped to set a trend for the dozens of slow-burning thrillers to come out of Asia in the last few years, including its own remake from Korea ('Ring Virus'). So, with the benefit of hindsight, Hollywood producers have also cleverly chosen to translate Nakata's take on 'Ring' for native multiplex audiences. Their choice of director, however, is not as sharp, as they have recruited Gore Verbinski to replicate Nakata's subtle hand. But, as the presence of 'Mousehunt' on his filmography shows, ""subtle"" is not a word that first comes to mind when thinking about this inexperienced filmmaker.Verbinski, a former director of music videos and commercials (I'll refrain from using the word ""hack""), is by no means a complete lost cause in the world of 'The Ring'. Armed with tens of millions of dollars, Verbinski is free to design the film's visual and sound schemes with impressive precision, even more so than Nakata did with the original. Every frame of this film has something to keep itself moving along, with the omnipresent greyish green tones adding an interesting flare to the opening sequence. But they remain on the screen throughout the whole running time, and only serve to distract the audience from Rachel's Nancy Drew-style investigations in and around dreary Seattle. There's also some unneeded editing tricks (such as brief flashes of ""the ring"" between scenes) that really do recall Verbinski's music video past, and, disappointingly, a couple of equally cheap ""boo"" moments, which siphon off much of the tension and pace that 'The Ring' should have been made of, and that the original had in spades. Granted, Nakata could easily be accused of some of these tactics, but at least he used them in all the right places. Verbinski never lets 'The Ring' breathe on its own like Nakata did, which leaves the film floundering in a well of largely wasted potential.Even worse, some parts of the film are touched up with expensive special effects in place of the grimy, practical realness of the original. It's never a good thing when CGI draws attention to itself, particularly during the film's climax, which was so unrelentingly terrifying in the original, but here feels forcibly rushed and artificial. In fact, everything about 'The Ring' is far too dressed up with Hollywood production values, when simplicity was the key to making the first 'Ring' so unsettling. Call me a purist of the original if you must, but whose idea was it to give 'The Ring' to a man whose only truly inventive moment was when he created the Budweiser frogs?The script, by Ehren Kruger ('Scream 3'), shows as much promise, but this goes down the drain with the direction. Kruger elects to completely revise the background of Sadako (renamed Samara for this remake), and I welcomed these tweaks, as they would keep the unfolding mystery interesting even for those who already knew how things would turn out. The downside comes when Kruger feels the need to explain everything, from what the film's title means, to why the tape waits seven days to kill. There are even some small lines of ""comic"" relief present in 'The Ring', which seem entirely out of place considering the mood the film is trying to muster. Kruger is far too concerned with catering to western audiences, and never takes that crucial step away from the genre rules to really make a mark.I'm tempted to applaud the makers of 'The Ring' for not dumbing down the material too much, and preserving just a little of the original's integrity. But on the other hand, I'm also annoyed that the sheer creepiness and ambiguity of Hideo Nakata's film has been watered down so much for easier consumption. 'The Ring' was an apt opportunity to blend the potency of the original with Western horror traditions, but Verbinski and Kruger just aren't up to the task, and this remake has ended up as what the original never once was: a mess. If producers ever decide to create a sequel (the twist ending has been retained), hiring a director and writer with some genuine prowess in horror film-making would be much desired.~ 6/10 ~",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Ring is a classic horror film of the 2000s,"Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a journalist who investigates a mysterious video tape that purportedly kills its viewer 7 days after watching it. The Ring is an American adaptation of the Japanese horror film Ringu. Following the success of this movie, it spawned its own sequel and introduced the Western audience to J-horror adaptations, notably The Grudge.There's intense tension, scares and mood developed in this film that are still palpable every time you watch. In doing so, director Gore Verbinski shapes a timely narrative about communal disconnect, modern alienation and the all-conquering power of technology with this adaptation. Naomi Watts delivers a superb performance as Rachel and I'm so glad it propelled her into mainstream consciousness. Martin Henderson too is equally on form as Noah, her confidant.No matter how many times I've seen it, I enjoy watching this film.

Well made horror,"This starts with Becca (Rachael Bella) and Katie (Amber Tamblyn) watching a scary movie. There is an urban legend of a haunted videotape. After watching it, the person gets a phone call claiming that person will have only 7 days to live. It's a classic horror movie intro right down to the girls' school uniforms. It works surprisingly well for such a try and true setup.Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a single-mom reporter with a troubled son Aidan (David Dorfman) who lost his close cousin Katie recently. Rachel decides to help out by investigating the mysterious death. Only the mystery deepens when she gets a hold of the tape. She watches it and receives the creepy call from Samara (Daveigh Chase) telling her ""7 days"".The movie is able to carry the classic horror styles all the way through. It maintains the creepiness from the well made opening. Everything from the set design to the actual tape is made with the same creepy vibe. It also delivers something new to this genre. The Japanese original started the idea but this is a better made film. Even washing out the colors with blueish green creates its own unique creepiness. Naomi Watts is just so compelling, and David Dorfman looks so sickly. And the use of the ring motif also works. Just about everything works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Superior Horror,"One of the best horror films of recent years, which isn't saying much when you think of the competition, but The Ring is a very good horror movie.

I haven't seen the Japanese original but I don't think this version would have let it down. I went to see this at the pictures on a Saturday night after a few beers so I feel I really need to see this again at home on DVD. The film contains several jump out of your seat moments, proper ones, not the pathetic attempts to shock the audience in the likes of ""I still know what you did last summer"", which actually shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as films as classy as this one.

Gore Verbinski's magnum opus,"I'm going to kick off this review with a bold statement: While I adore ""A Cure for Wellness"" (2016) and ""The Weather Man"" (2005), I firmly believe that this remake of ""The Ring"" (2002) is Gore Verbinski's magnum opus.And I'm not done with the bold claims: Certain characters and some of Verbinski's directorial choices in this American adaptation surpass those of Hideo Nakata, who helmed both the second film in the American series and the original Japanese version.The color palette chosen for Seattle, Japan's atmospheric twin in America, and its subtle darkening in the Oregon scenes are masterful. The sound design (which is phenomenal even on the DVD version that I own), the impeccable casting of Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox, Adam Brody, and David Dorfman (who, interestingly, later became a lawyer) - who seems like an android created specifically for these films - the ship scene, the horse scene, the fleeting yet meticulously crafted shots... The cinematography, the work of Bojan Bazelli, is simply breathtaking.To promote ""The Ring,"" numerous websites were created featuring characters and locations from the film. The cursed videotape was even played on late-night television programs during the summer of 2002, without any reference to the film itself. Physical VHS copies of the tape were randomly distributed outside movie theaters, even placed on people's car windshields. Living in Turkey, I wasn't privy to this exclusive experience, but the film's impact in my country is still etched in my memory. Sadly, we don't have such immersive marketing campaigns anymore.And let's not forget the haunting score by Hans Zimmer.Yes, perhaps I'm being a tad hyperbolic, but at the end of the day, art and literature are remembered most for how deeply they touch our lives.

"Not only an excellent remake, but also an effective ghost story in its own right","'The Ring' is an eerie and atmospheric supernatural horror flick from the early 00's that simultaneously entices and yet disturbs you at the same time with its creepy imagery and chilling and melancholy atmosphere which gives off an unnerving sense of dread and an oppressive hypnotic tone that sears its way into your subconscious, which alone is good for several terrifying and spine-tingling moments that keeps you tenterhooks throughout its runtime. A remake of the classic Japanese horror film 'Ringu' and a fantastic adaptation to boot that kick started the American J-Horror craze of the 2000's, however this stands as the very best of a rather mediocre bunch.The Plot = A journalist named Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) must investigate a mysterious videotape which seems to cause the death of anyone one week to the day after they watch it.The movie manages to take the terrifying original premise and grounded it into reality and the experience it provides and disturbs the audience on a psychological and subliminal level in way that very few horror films can attempt to especially for a remake which is astounding and even to this day this movie remains quite unique and memorable. Another aspect that works so well here is how it deftly puts its dramatic elements into its horror beats and balances these elements effectively and yet still manages to be creepy, intense and gut wrenching in equal amounts. The film's central mystery is incredibly intriguing and offers some fun twists and turns into its engaging narrative. The direction by Gore Verbinski is of course top notch as he gives the film a cool gothic and isolated look to the production and provides many intense set pieces that manages to sustain your interest right up until the final climax.The performances here are strong with Noami Watts providing an excellent leading performance and proves more than capable of carrying the film on her shoulders. The supporting cast are well chosen with Brian Cox providing a memorable and engaging performance and Martin Henderson and David Dorfman both does fine work in their respective roles.Overall 'The Ring' is not only a fantastic remake but an effective ghost story in it's own right that proves that filmmakers doesn't have to rely on cheap tricks and jump scares to make a good horror film just some good old fashioned great storytelling and a genuine sense of creeping dread.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Chilling and beautiful,"Gore Verbinski's The Ring is a commendable effort of chilly atmospherics and bleak grey cinematography, with a nice central performance by Naomi Watts. Before I get scolded for giving this airtime when it's based on a Japanese fright flick, I've seen that one and I think this is the stronger film (same goes for The Grudge). It's just got such a personality all its own. Watts plays Rachel, a journalist who stumbles on an eerie mystery after a suspicious death in the family. She's led to a videotape containing stark, disturbing black and white images, a video tape that's purported to kill you in seven days upon watching it. She, of course, watches it, spurring on a delirious search for the truth behind it before it's too late. She's led from dreary, rain streaked Seattle to a remote horse farm on an island off the coast, the adopted home of a strange little girl with some vaguely terrifying abilities named Samara (Daveigh Chase, also Donnie Darko's little sister and Lilo from Lilo and Stitch). Underrated Martin Henderson plays a colleague who helps her out in the investigation, and creepy little David Dorfman is her strange kid. Brian Cox, as Samara's adopted father, walks away with his segment of the film, giving him fierce heartbreak and fear. Heart stopping secrets are unleashed, and the threatening presence grows and follows Rachel. I like that the film never really clarifies exactly what is wrong with Samara, just makes it very clear that it's something very wrong, which for me is much scarier than spelling it out in bland exposition. There's some skin crawling moments in this one, mostly iconic now, but I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it and will say no more than the sequences involving a well, a television and of course the omnipresent video tape are highlights. It all looks fantastic too, the colours absent in favour of a suffocating monochromatic tone, punctuated occasionally by gasping breaths of red in the fall colours at the motel she visits, and a few other moments of brief vibrance among the gloom. A true fright flick that takes its time, ratchets up a slow, mounting fear, and releases it in short bursts of stinging shock moments, bridged by lapses of pure atmosphere.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Impressively Restrained,"Most horror movies suck.Its sad, but true.

Was I really scared by it?  No, not really (although the climatic ending was appropriately jump inducing).  But it did a great job of maintaining an atmosphere throughout of ""wrongness"".  Nice soundtrack work, quick cuts, disturbing images, just enough revelation, kept the world feeling just a little off, and a little creepy.Unfortunately, not much happened, and what you had was a movie long on atmosphere, but almost boringly devoid of chills.  But its not often I have the pleasure of making that complaint about anything not arthouse, so I'll gladly take the tradeoff.Overall a well made, mature, horror film.

"Good, but unnecessary remake","After seeing the fantastic original 'Ringu', I watched this remake suspecting it would be a noisy, gory slam-bang hollywood rehash. Fortunately, I was wrong. The Ring is a well made remake and follows the original quite closely, even in atmosphere. It's close enough to say that if you hate this movie, you probably won't like the original either. Some sequences are even shot-by-shot the same. Acting is adequate, cinematography is excellent, the pace is good. Unfortunately, there are some issues with this remake imho.They replaced some important storylines of the original with that really lame horse nonsense.The 'scary' make up effects are overdone and not scary at all.The 'samara' character is too flat and too young. She's just plain evil in this flick where in the original she's a 18ish teenager with a more complex and sad background (see Ring 0: Birthday) which makes it more thought provoking and believable that she became what she is.The ending is not as satisfying as the original.While pacing is good (I'm glad it still has the quiet pace of the original), it's not as good as in the original where its momentum gradually builds up until it's firmly stuck under you skin.Now I still think it's quite good, but it doesn't add anything over the original to make it really worthwhile. If you don't mind watching a subtitled japanese movie, definitely go for the original Ring (aka Ringu).",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Chilling and Effective American Remake of a Horror Classic,"The Ring (2002) is a remake of the critically acclaimed Japanese horror film Ringu, directed by Gore Verbinski. The film follows a journalist, Rachel Keller, as she investigates a mysterious videotape that supposedly causes the death of anyone who watches it within seven days. The Ring effectively brings the chilling atmosphere and iconic imagery of the original to American audiences, while also adding its own unique twists to the story.One of the film's major strengths is its ability to create a sense of dread and tension throughout. The eerie visuals, haunting score, and suspenseful pacing all contribute to a consistently unsettling experience. The performances, particularly from Naomi Watts as Rachel and Daveigh Chase as the terrifying Samara, are also noteworthy for their ability to convey the fear and desperation of the characters.However, the film does have some weaknesses that prevent it from reaching the heights of its source material. The third act, in particular, feels rushed and less focused than the rest of the movie, with some plot threads left unresolved or underdeveloped. Additionally, while the film's special effects are impressive for the time, they can occasionally feel dated or overly reliant on jump scares.In conclusion, The Ring is a well-crafted and chilling horror film that successfully adapts the essence of the original for Western audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Verbinski's Horror Succeeds,"Journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates the existence of a strange videotape that, according to an urban legend, causes the death of anyone who should watch it, thus making it the ultimate video nasty. After locating a copy of the vindictive VHS, Rachel not only decides to watch it, but also lets her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) have a gander, and leaves a copy laying around for her son Aidan (David Dorfman) to see!!! Needless to say, the legend proves to be true, the tape allowing the vengeful spirit of freaky murdered girl Samara to literally scare viewers to death.As someone who can actually be bothered to read sub-titles, I generally dislike it when Asian horror hits are remade to appeal to a Western audience, particularly since very few of them turn out to be as effective as the originals. Gore Verbinski's The Ring, however, is a genuinely worthy effort, because instead of simply being a quick Hollywood 'cash-in', it is actually a lovingly crafted movie.Storywise, Verbinski's film stays fairly faithful to Hideo Nakata's Ringu and effectively replicates its creepy atmosphere, but The Ring avoids being just a slavish copy by expanding on certain plot points, providing a few crowd pleasing jump scares along the way, and best of all, by being as visually impressive as possible, with coloured tints and CGI effects used to great effect throughout (I usually moan about such things in modern horror films, but here they actually work).I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Ring is better than the original, but I think it is equally deserving of a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ring around the collar,"Watch it, and die. That's the basic premise behind this horror thriller, one of the few scary movies out there that carries a PG-13 rating. See, there's this videotape, and anyone who watches it gets a phone call as soon as they're done. A voice says, ""You have seven days."" And seven days later, you're deader than David Caruso's movie career. So what's behind these weird deaths? To find out, the mother of a teenager who apparently watched the tape (along with several other ill-fated friends) asks her sister Rachel (Naomi Watts), a newspaper reporter, to look into the matter. Rachel has a little boy named Aidan (David Dorman, looking a lot like a Culkin brother), who was close to the suddenly deceased teen. Rachel's travails take her to the stereotypical isolated cabin, where the group of teens stayed, and she discovers the tape. And watches it, of course, as I'm sure we all would. Does she also have seven days? Will she die of fright? And what of her cherubic, quiet son? And how about the neo-hippie, Bohemian ex-lover Noah, whose expertise in video production she needs? Rachel and Noah - who also watches the tape, against Rachel's wishes - find out more and more about the tape's origins and especially about the various specific images on the tape. You see, anyone who has taken a film class in college has seen student or arthouse film shorts that are steeped in abstract art. The images on the tape, very evocative and eerily mesmerizing, are all tied in together somehow - but how? What begins as an investigation of a seemingly harmless urban legend spawns a hysterical, desperate search for survival. It'd be one thing if Rachel had just been able to find out who was behind the tape - you know, a kind of ""I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that snooping reporter"" thing - without actually watching the tape. But she HAS to watch it, and we have to watch along with her. There are some truly disturbing moments on the tape, and there were plenty of people shuddering in the movie theater. The main problem with the movie is that it never makes one think it's real. Sure, movies aren't documentaries, but a movie is much more enjoyable when the audience really feels as if they're in the movie, or at least feels as if the movie could be happening. But The Ring doesn't quite hook its audience; instead, it feels disconnected, as if - surprise! - you're watching a movie. This is not to say that the characters are not endearing or well-developed, because they are. Rachel is an excellent heroine - she's very smart, can think on her own, she's inventive, curious, creative, and adventurous. (She's also gorgeous, but that aspect isn't played up at all, refreshingly.) And Aidan is a wonderful multilayered character - like many things in the movie, Aidan is not always what we see. Is he a just a quiet, smart kid? Does he know about The Ring? Director Gore Verbinski does a great job in setting the mood; what Rachel feels, we do, although we still realize that what's happening is happening on screen only. There's excellent atmosphere, including a creepy scene with a little girl in an insane asylum; it's all very lurid. Watching Rachel piece the mystery together, while racing the clock, is fascinating - but again, it's like watching runners in a marathon on TV. You can see them sweat, and you can see them gasp, but you can't feel the pain they're going through, either physically or mentally.   The pacing of the movie is also above average - truly suspenseful moments are drawn out, and the real terror isn't seen, but imagined. As with The Sixth Sense, the act of building tension in a scene can really make or break a horror/suspense movie. Lesser films show you everything, and that's why they're lesser films.   So what's the bottom line? Is this a movie worth watching? Yes, it is. It's not the full-blown horror classic it wants to be, but it doesn't miss the mark by much. And the scenes on the infamous videotape have to be seen to be believed. It is a movie that'll haunt you for a few days or weeks? Probably not. It has a lot of evocative images, and it's well acted, but it lacks a heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Really solid American remake,"The Ring definitely commits to being an American remake of a Japanese film by recontextualising everything for a western audience even if it comes with some of the worst tropes of doing that. Everything is bigger and flashier even when it doesn't need to be but this still succeeds as a satisfyingly bleak horror film.It's a film in which people attempt to apply meaning on a series of creepy abstract images, allowing the film to explain a lot whilst losing none of its mystery. It sets itself up as a wholesome story in which a fractured family is going to rekindle what was lost by working together to save each other, only to reject all of it for a much darker ending.Naomi Watts gives a great lead performance, she has a solid reason for investigating the tape and she brings a sensitivity which makes it clear that she's only doing this to help those close to her rather than for any personal gain. Martin Henderson is a likeable ex and works well with Watts despite the fact that he doesn't get as much depth.Gore Verbinksi's direction doesn't need any gore or an R rating to get the desired effects. Even with a neutered PG-13 rating this still has an effectively unsettling atmosphere, enhanced by the relentlessly bleak colour palette. In a lot of ways the PG-13 rating actually helps because the film's inability to revel in the violence often makes those moments scarier.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A fantastic remake of the Japanese original,"When I saw this film, I was genuinely scared by what was happening. The idea that you only had 7 days to live once you watched the video was chilling, and when I saw the girl climbing out of the TV and into the room, I literally felt my blood run cold.
Considering this is a remake of the original Japanese film, Ringu, it hasn't meant that it's of low quality, and in fact has retained all of the fright of the original. I highly recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An unbiased view,"I haven't seen the original Japanese version of this film, so i was able to watch the film without having to compare it to Ringu. As a result i quite liked this film. I found it to be genuinely scary and well acted. Unlike most horrors that are produced in Hollywood nowadays this film turns its back on ""teen horror"", and the opening sequence can perhaps be seen as a kind of tongue in cheek rejection of teen based horror movies. The storyline in this movie manages to captivate you into the film; you find yourself caring for the main characters as well as feeling a fascinating mixture of pity and horror for the family featured in the video tape.Overall therefore the film comes across as a decent horror movie, with the director Gore Verbinski wisely using suspense over blood to scare the audience. Verbinski is triumphant in so far as he has created a film whose dark mood manages to leave an unsettling psychological effect on the audience by the end of the film. The main actors too are in good form, in the shape of Australiasians Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. Another major plus for this film is the cinematic use of colouring. There is a distinct use of dark greenish imagery throughout this film which greatly heightens the gloomy atmosphere that Verbinski clearly wants to create.That said this film is not without criticism. The ending is unsatisfactory and damages much of the good work of the film up until that point. There is also little attempt made at making sense of just who the little girl really was, and why she was doing what she was. The boy too is a bit tedious, his character almost seems to be saying to the audience ""we wanted Haley Joe Osmond but he is now too old and too expensive.""

There's just something creepy about this one!,"I saw The Ring last night after my brother rented it out and i found it scary....ish!. Now it takes alot to scare me because i laughed all the way through when i watched The Exorcist, Stigmata and The Omen plus i hate horror films anyway but i decided to give this one a go mainly because Naomi Watts is in it and i think shes really sexy. I thought the film was quite well made but typically Hollywood in its over the top production. That girl in it i think her name was Samara god she was horrible, creepiest little girl i've ever seen in a film, i think the secret to a good scary horror movie is to have a weird little kid causing all the havoc. And im not ashamed to admit that after i watched it and went upstairs to sleep i had to switch each light of and ran as fast as i could to the next one, you know one of them ones.

Good little thriller,"Before you judge The Ring remake, you should see the original Jap version which is clearly one of the scariest movies ever made. Gore Verbanksi and Ehren Kruger have made a decent remake with beautiful cinematography and a great performance by Namoi Watts. The little boy who played Aidan also gave a great performance. The film isn't extemely scary but it is tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat during some points. Dreamworks cut out a lot of the scares and a subplot involving Chris Cooper that would have resolved the film more. Hopefully the sequel which we know is coming will have the oringial Japanese writer involved. I give it *** out of ****.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a Hollywood remake done right,"I saw ""The Ring"" last summer and thought it was a splendidly-designed and carefully paced thriller, but I was also disappointed that the movie tied up all its points a bit to cleanly (some more ambiguity would've been welcome to keep the viewer on edge, but I suppose that's minor).  Well, I recently saw the inspiration, ""Ringu,"" and was thoroughly unimpressed by it, so I decided to give the American version another look and, by god, it is a little better than I initially gave it credit for.  With a welcome infusion of COLOR, pace, more accessible dialogue, engaging characters, and some fantastic special effects (which translate surprisingly well to the small screen), ""The Ring"" comes out victorious (granted, it's not a long-standing classic for the ages, but it is diverting).  Another factor is the intricacies of the plot--whereas ""Ringu"" merely set up a spooky concept (mysterious videotape that kills a person 7 days after viewing) and didn't build much around it, the American version has a more complicated narrative that induces some genuine heart-in-throat intensity.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
good idea with bad realization,"I watched this film 2 years ago but I remember it for long time Many people criticized this film like this: ""In this film fear is a result of terrible face, harsh sounds ... And Japanese version better"" I think in this film the action is not main thing but only a scene,space. And main in this film I think is to show people, their relations...to help people became a bit kinder. And this film shows this. In this film Samara wasn't an absolutely evil. She had some singularities. And her adoptive parents put her into psychiatric hospital where she was alone for many hours, she lived in a stable and in the end her adoptive mother broke her in the well. As for me it is a enough reason to take offense. Some people write that it is very non-original and stupid story and many films has story like this. Yes this story is very simpler than story in book of Koji Suzuki. But main mean of this is not a difficult, long and very interesting criminal story. Americans when they were making this remake they didn't understood this idea. They tried to make a very scary film. So they put this in their film (this history is modified history from book of Koji Suzuki) but their main intensification was directed to make a good action. So this film has a good history of Samara with bad and stupid history of Rachel and company.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best scary movie in a LONG time.,"Buuut, it's obviously not for everyone. I thought ""The Ring"" was extremely well made, with great pacing, acting, cinematography, characters, and a suberbly creepy soundtrack. My wife and son were so freaked out by it that they refuse to even be in the room when I watch it - but, then we all have very active imaginations. My brother, on the other hand, and two of the people I work with could not get into it and were not scared in the least, so to each his own. I think the key word with this film is ""subtlety"". If you like horror/suspense movies that scare you with the subtle things you can't see, then ""The Ring"" excels. If you want some knife-wielding maniac to jump out at you every 10 minutes, then you will probably be bored and underwhelmed. As far as the ""holes"" in the plot, several explanitory scenes were cut from the final film because they disrupted the flow. I still think the movie worked just fine leaving some things unexplained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Didn't live up to the hype!,"Maybe I'm just getting old and have seen too many horror movies through my lifetime, but this one failed to impress me.It was very formulaic - tension in the right places, and times that made you jump, but that doesn't make a good horror story. I am a fan of this genre but feel this one offers nothing new. Even the acting performances weren't particularly notable.I am quite capable of suspending belief for the sake of a good horror movie, but saying that, some of the reactions to certain situations just didn't add up for me. There were too many flaws - style over substance. It might have more appeal to younger people who haven't seen a huge selection of the horror genre yet.

Wraps Itself Around You.,"Atmospheric and definitely disturbing modern horror film that sticks with you like crazy glue during its running time and beyond. Teenager Amber Tamblyn dies mysteriously one night at home and it appears that the youngster was literally scared to death. Aunt and Seattle news reporter Naomi Watts quickly learns that her niece had supposedly viewed a strange video tape a week earlier. Tamblyn's three friends had also watched the tape with her and died under odd circumstances. Watts' investigative skills lead to the discovery of the video, but she makes a huge mistake by viewing its contents. Now it seems that Watts is the target of the curse and she must race against the clock to find out how she can overcome the evil powers. Former lover Martin Henderson and young son David Dorfman also fall into the trap of viewing the film and their lives become jeopardized as well. Together Watts and Henderson embark on a journey together to save their lives and save the life of their young son. Naturally mystery lies in every direction as the contents of the film are slowly presented in real life, but what symbolism do the striking images possess? ""The Ring"" is one of those odd films that really leaves more questions than answers. It is a disturbing film that has some dark imagery that will stick with you long after viewing it. The PG-13 rating is very misleading as this should have been an R hands down. The movie wants to be a darker version of ""The Sixth Sense"" and somewhat succeeds in that regard. However, ""The Ring""'s tone makes it a film that bears sharp comparison to films like ""Night of the Living Dead"" (the 1968 version) and ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the fact that it relies more on confusion than clarity. The direction is solid, the screenplay is all over the map and Naomi Watts steals the show as she did in the equally confusing ""Mulholland Dr."". While ""The Ring"" does not match the brilliance of Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."", it is still a striking work that ends up being a success by the last intense act. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

In my post I doubted that the Hollywood remake (that was still in production then) would be any better. I was wrong. ""The Ring"" is spooky, spooky, spooky! Nice additions to the story have been made as well as really effective shock scenes. There are beautiful haunting pictures that teach movies like ""Feardotcom"" what ""atmosphere"" means. I can't remember when I last saw a remake that was so far superior to the original. If only I had seen the remake first.

Slow Version of a Slow Original,"The pacing of both the original and English remake of the Ring seems to be rather slow. While there are some creepy moments in this version of the story its still as over rated as the original. For the most part the two films are almost interchangeable in my mind, although the images from the cursed tape is better in this version. The only real differences being the location and the episodes around Brian Cox.The question of which is better ultimately comes down to whether you want to read subtitles or not. For me there is something creepier about the original version and its lack of digital effects that makes the final several minutes of this version less scary because its less real, but thats a minor complaint and either version is fine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the creepiest films ever!,"This has to be one of the creepiest films I have ever seen! Verbinski manages to set the perfect mood for this movie.

A piece of good advice...,"...watch Ringu instead, the Japanese original.This version is only good if you can't read english, but then you wont be reading this either. The ring is nicely executed and has some shocking moments. I also like the lead actress, but all in all it's not that very good. It has a lot of inconsistancies, stuff that doesn't really make the most sense and are only there to kinda make the movie look a bit more exciting. When I watched it, it was pretty ok, but when I started thinking about it I found more and more illogical things and other stuff that didn't really have to do with anything but which were cramped into this movie anyway. I had a hard time following The rings storyline, because some things arn't explained but just happen. That is not the case in Ringu. In that movie you'll understand everything sooner or later!Ringu is much more tight, there is a lot more suspence, the story is almost completely logical and it is not overdone like The ring is. So if you have the choice, go for Ringu and skip The ring completely!The ring 6/10 Ringu 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

R.I.N.G. -- Remade Into Nauseating Garbage.  Another perfect example of how to Americanize (aka ruin) flawless Japanese cinema.,"Being a huge fan of the original RINGU series, I was eagerly awaiting this American remake for several months.  Don't get me wrong, I was wary at first, but as the release date grew nearer and the trailers and positive reviews started pouring in, I became more and more anxious to see it.  I walked into my local bug-infested, foul-smelling cinema with high hopes. Plopping myself into a sticky, soda-encrusted seat, I began feeling a sense of overbearing excitement as I impatiently waited for the godawful previews to end and the lights to dim.  However, ten minutes into the movie, I knew exactly what I was in for: a dull, formulated, vastly overhyped letdown. As the film trudged to an overlong, disappointing conclusion I was constantly reminded of a little promise I had made myself after seeing NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990), PSYCHO (1998), and OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2001): under no circumstances will I ever watch another remake again, especially those remakes whose originals are completely faultless in and of themselves, and couldn't possibly be effectively updated and/or improved in any way without detracting from the superiority of the original.  How I wish I could keep my own promises!In the 1998 masterpiece, a distinct feeling of dread and uneasiness was constantly present, slowly but tensely building into an unexpected and downright terrifying climax.  The mood it created was absolutely haunting and so carefully executed that it stuck with you long after the credits rolled.  It didn't need to rely on big-budget special effects and continuous loud, cheaply startling jump-cuts.   Unfortunately, that's all THE RING has going for it.  It doesn't even try to tap into the nail-biting atmosphere of the original.  Sadly, with the permeation of trashy stalk-'n-slash gorefests during the 80s and trendy, pop-horror SCREAM clones during the 90s, it's safe to say that modern American horror has dug itself into an inescapable rut of thoughtlessness, unoriginality, and an embarrassing dependency on attractive characters (who, might I add, are usually half-dressed or nude at some point, if not most, of the movie) and gross visuals.  THE RING is no different.  It is typical, contrived, and pretentious to the nth degree.The lackluster remake also strips RINGU bare of its enigmatic nature, spending way too much time trying to explain everything.  There is nothing left to the imagination.  Everything is spelled out for us, right up to the trite, tacked-on ending.  In RINGU, the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions, but not here.  Everything is wrapped up nice and neatly. God forbid we have to think!THE RING just couldn't seem to get anything right, not even the movie within the movie.  The videotape in RINGU contained about 30 seconds of grainy, abstract, and unsettling images.  After it is played for the viewer, you feel as if you are now part of the curse.  In THE RING, it is stretched out into a lengthy, laughable mishmash of arbitrary nonsense.  RINGU's tape worked because it was brief and of extremely low quality, making appear as if VHS is far too new a medium for its content.  This also succeeds in adding a great deal of ambiguity to the tape's origin.  Upon seeing the video playback in THE RING, you'll find that it's just the opposite: long and overproduced, complete with sharp color, fluid motion, needless gross-outs, and even computer-generated images.  Give me a break!  Noah's braindead character chalked it up accurately when he mumbled ""it's very student film"", except for the fact that many student films are actually way more interesting.Although I was deeply disappointed in this movie, I realize now that I shouldn't have been so eager to believe that it had even a smidgen of potential.  After all, what on earth could I have been expecting from the writer and the director of such insipid, braindead pictures like ""Scream 3"" and ""Mouse Hunt""?  Shame on me.Next time you're standing at the box office, contemplating which overpriced movie ticket to spend your hard-earned cash on, take my word and pass on THE RING.  At least wait about two or three weeks when the general public realizes it sucks and it ends up at the $1 theater.  Or better yet, order yourself a copy of RINGU instead.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stupid ending ruins another possible great,"The first ending, where everything was resolved was great. The movie seemed great, I was ready to say ""great movie"" 10/10. But then the second ending came along and made me feel nothing. This totally subverted the movie making it seem a mere trick of the director to frustrate the audience. 6/10.All the symbolism became mere gimmickry. The movie led us down a clear and intelligently presented thread, only to abruptly change its course in the last few minutes. This is incredibly annoying. Oh wow, the ring is a ring - it has no ending... gee the symbolism! bleh.It left me feeling the way as the movie ""Adaptation,"" which I thought was brilliant until the single/signal word ""kill"" is uttered by the lead actress. It was so wrong and so forced and so awkward that it left me feeling nothing for the ""first"" movie.-Zafoid",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It all depends on how you define the word 'Scary'...,"This movie offers me everything that I could possibly expect from a ghost story and more. A good plot line, a reasonably good amount of emotion from the characters and amazing camera works are just a few of the things that make this film so exceptional.If you ask me, the movie is frightening, not scary. It doesn't make you want to scream and run away while watching it. It just sends a shiver down your spine which I wouldn't say gave me a nightmare. It doesn't give you any cheap thrills but goes on with a vague presence of death and terror all along.The movie may seem a bit incomplete to a few people because the making of the Tape was never shown or even hinted towards. But I quite liked that part of the movie. Humans have been fascinated by the thought of ghosts from ages ago. We don't know how they work or what makes them tick. So withholding that bit of information from the audience is a well thought out idea.I could give the movie a 8 or 7, mostly due to it's overly clichéd general outlook of it. But I suppose I'd just be lying to myself if I said that I didn't watch it at least 6 times. So, I award it a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Well crafted remake, but not as scary as the original","My middle schooler has been interested in going back to watch what is considered classic horror films. Although I don't consider THE RING a classic, it is something of an iconic film. I had just yesterday watched SMILE, another ""cursed object"" horror film that reminded me of IT FOLLOWS and THE RING, so I figured it was a good time to revisit this one. While the original Japanese version, RINGU, is far more scary, this American remake is better than you'd expect. Director Gore Verbinski, who'd later go on to direct the tentpole Disney franchise, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, brings style and atmosphere that reminded me more of Christophe Gans' well-crafted and underrated SILENT HILL than say the bombastic horror style of Paul W. S. Anderson (RESIDENT EVIL, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR, though I do love his movie SOLDIER) which is what I was cynically expecting out of a Hollywood remake of an intricate and layered foreign film. Kudos to Verbinski for getting right what the original did so well, slowly building the lore of the cursed VHS tape, filling the film with imaginative and frightening imagery that builds an ever-growing sense of dread, as opposed to focusing on cheap jump scares and action set pieces. Credit also has to go to Naomi Watts, largely unknown at this point in her career outside of David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DR., who brings significant heart and genuine emotion to her role, trying to solve the mystery of the cursed video and to protect her young son. Overall, I'd probably have rated this film higher if I hadn't already seen Hideo Nakata's superior original film, but THE RING is still well worth watching. FUN FACT! The producers offered this remake to David Lynch to direct, but he turned it down. Lynch and Watts had just worked together the year before with his seminal film, MULHOLLAND DR.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

* * *1/2 out of 4.,"*Please note that I have not seen the 1998 version of this film. I never read any reviews or even a plot description for the 1998 version.Emotionally devasting, deeply disturbing thriller will stay with you long after you have walked out of the theater.

After a group of teens who supposedly watched the tape are all found dead, she begins to investigate what is happening. Adding urgency to her mission, is the fact that she has also watched the tape herself.A terrific performance from Naomi Watts and a good supporting cast along with realistic special effects, richly detailed direction, a bone chilling & expertly plotted script, and a ending that will haunt you make this a must see film for all horror fans. If you have never seen the 1998 version and you think you have figured out the ending, guess again because more and likely your way off as to which direction this film is heading.

"All in all, not bad","If you have not seen the original Japanese version of the film, then you are definitely missing out.  Rent it, very worth it if you can find it.This movie creeped me out, and thats not an easy task.  I've been at the movie game for a while so I am a master at predicting endings, and turns, and twists.  This one genuinely had me on the edge of my seat!  The story is very interesting.  You are presented with a thousand little puzzle peices that end up neatly tied together in a very gruesome realization.  Aside from some Hollywood special effects fluff that was unnecessary (the coming out of the TV scene), the filmmakers managed to completely creep you out with just good acting, a great script, and greeeeeeat filmmaking.9 outta 10.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular","Several days after their cousin's death, a reporter and her young son find that a cursed videotape watched by individuals leads to their death in seven days and forces them to uncover the meaning of the tape and how to stop its terrible curse before it continues to be passed on.This does have a few pretty nice points about it. Among the better areas here is the fact that this manages to really do some stylized individual scenes to give this some exceptionally enjoyable and chilling moments. From seeing themselves in a live surveillance monitor where they notice their face is all distorted while everything else around them is fine, another starts pulling something out of their mouth that just keeps coming and looks like a long string with something on the end of it and another featuring a bunch of marbles coming together on the floor to make the image of a pointing arrow. It's also got the ability to build up some great scare scenes with a really weird dream where they see an image of a young girl who grabs her on the arm yet when they wake a hand-shaped burn mark across her arm where they were grabbed is noticeable, the incidental videotape itself is incredibly tense and chilling and makes for quite an effective central piece to the puzzle and the revelation at the cabin with the discovery of the well and the big highlight where a partially decomposed girl crawls out of a well on- screen and then crawls out through the TV, onto the floor and then starts walking toward him chasing him around the apartment which is just all sorts of chilling. The only other thing that really works for the film is its final resolution which is a rather chilling outcome. These are all great in making the film quite watchable even though it does have some pretty sizable flaws. One of the biggest issues is that the film didn't need to be as abstract and ambiguous since it's a mystery, and as such should provide us with a clearly defined solution. It's apparent the girl was quite twisted, yet we have no idea why she was mental even before being confined as there's absolutely no explanation what made her that way. What's even stranger is her sense of priority as nothing is given as to what she is trying to get out of all of this. It's obvious we're supposed to feel bad for her, but if they're completely crazy, then there's little chance of it happening. It's also not given how she got inside the videotape anyway, or why a videotape which too obsolete a technology to make much impact. This dates the material greatly and really makes the fear seem less important. Along with a plot that tends to go back on itself by never completely solving one mystery before starting to investigate another, these lower it substantially.Rated PG-13: Language, Violence, children in danger and animal violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This is how you make a horror movie!,"There's nothing scary about vampires. Or werewolves. (I've never seen one, so why be scared?) There's nothing scary about blood and gore. (I've seen plenty, so why be scared?) What's scary is the situation--when your TV turns itself on and you see something that makes you wet your pants. That's scary.And that's ""The Ring"". You could call ""The Ring"" a ghost story, and that would be fair, but instead of starting out showing us the ghost, the movie builds up suspense by first showing us what the ghost is capable of, then why the ghost is so angry. After we understand this, then and only then do we see the ghost. This creates an understanding in our mind of what this thing is going to do. So when we see it, we scare ourselves.You see, the scariest stories involve the mundane (like televisions and video tapes). They take the things we see everyday and ask, ""What if..."" This bypasses our rationality because we accept the plausibility of the scenario. And when a person can't think rationally, it doesn't take much to terrify them.Psychology 101.

a great remake,"Something different was done with this version of the ring. And that is that like unlike most remakes, this one did not suck. It stuck to its principles and made the movie enjoyable. There was also not many jumpscares and the actual scary parts were done in a way that was not expected. Naomi watts stars in this as our hero and she does a really good job at portraying a mum on the verge of being killed by a tape. The mystery and intrigue was there which made the movie more compelling and the design for samantha morgan was pretty creepy and great.

Not Scary....,"I can't really take scary movies. They don't even have to be scary.. I've never been one for ""haunting"" movies either. After I saw ""The Sixth Sense,"" I had trouble sleeping for over a month (utterly pathetic, I know). I thought it was really ironic, then, that everyone found ""The Ring"" to be soooo frightening. Maybe it is just because I had expected it to be sooo scary that I worked myself up for something extraordinarily ""scary"", but when I saw it.. I was left thinking, ""well that was kinda stupid..."" I mean the movie was entertaining, and sure, it was suspenseful.. but come on .... a girl walking out of a TV? Really now... ""The Ring"" is a good movie and it's pretty clever, but for me it didn't really do it.

It Did Absolutely Nothing For Me - Except Put Me To Sleep,"From the high ratings and good reviews this movie gets, I approached it with very high expectations, which ultimately led to a major disappointment. The movie was spoiled from the start by a story that made no sense whatsoever (incoherent is a word that comes to mind to try to describe the plot), was then further burdened by weak acting galore and then ruins the only hope for its redemption by not even being bad enough to be funny - it ended up just plain bad (and not in the least bit scary.) Out of a mountain of problems, let me highlight just one: where in the world did the video come from? The story (such as it is) revolves around the concept that anyone who watches this video dies exactly seven days later. But the origin of the video is never satisfactorily explained. Yes, it has something to do with Samara (the deceased girl whose evil powers are still being used from her grave) - but how? And since the video is the centrepiece of the movie, I found that a major stumbling block that I couldn't get over. The truth is, this movie put me to sleep for about 40 minutes in the middle. When I could make no sense of the ending after waking up, I assumed it was because of the 40 minutes I had missed; so I went back and watched those 40 minutes. Clearly I was a glutton for punishment.

Couldn't sleep for a week!,"Out of all the horror films I have ever seen this wins heads down. I wouldn't consider this as a horror movie as I normally associate horror with blood and gore and terror with mind haunting and chilling. This is a terror movie. My eccentric old maths teacher made my class and I watch it as punishment for 'scaring' him all year. From the moment it started I couldn't rip my eyes away from the screen. Most of the girls in my class were screaming when that poor girl got killed. The atmosphere was so effective as well. The constant raining in Seattle, the clouds, the TREE (I still have dreams about it) and the cursed people's clouded faces when ever a photo was taken of them or if they were under video surveillence.I couldn't concentrate for the rest of the day (and to be honest I don't scare easily!).

Watch the Sound of Music a few times and you'll be back to normal"" my drama teacher said. Its been over 5 months since I've seen the Ring, my friend recommends that I see the Japanese version. It doesn't have as many special effects but what it suggests it much more terrifying, is what he said. I think I'll pass there. After watching the Ring you think more deeply about the plot and what the 'video' was really about. So the reason Naomi didn't die at the end was because she let her husband watch it and so pass on the ring to someone else.

A Race Against a Personal Doomsday Clock,"The Ring (2002), directed by Gore Verbinski, is a successful American remake of the Japanese horror classic Ringu. With its atmospheric tension and memorable scares, it earns a solid 7/10.The film follows journalist Rachel Keller, played by Naomi Watts, who investigates a mysterious videotape that seemingly causes viewers to die seven days after watching it. Watts delivers a strong performance, effectively conveying a mix of skepticism, determination, and growing terror as the story unfolds. Her portrayal anchors the film, making Rachel a compelling character to follow.Verbinski's direction shines in creating an atmosphere of dread. The cinematography, with its muted color palette and stark, unsettling visuals, establishes a haunting mood that persists throughout the film. The iconic images of the cursed videotape, with its surreal and disturbing sequences, are particularly effective in leaving a lasting impression on viewers.The supporting cast, including Martin Henderson as Rachel's ex-boyfriend Noah and Daveigh Chase as the eerie Samara, contribute to the film's chilling ambiance. Chase's portrayal of Samara is especially memorable, with her unsettling presence adding to the film's horror.However, The Ring is not without its flaws. The pacing can be uneven at times, with certain sections of the film feeling drawn out while others rush through key plot points. The reliance on jump scares, while effective in moments, sometimes detracts from the more subtle and psychological horror elements that the film excels in.The narrative, while engaging, occasionally struggles with coherence, particularly in its attempt to balance the supernatural aspects of the story with a grounded investigative thriller. Some plot twists feel predictable, which can lessen the overall impact of the film's climax.In conclusion, The Ring (2002) is a commendable horror film that effectively translates the eerie essence of its Japanese predecessor for an American audience. Its strong performances, atmospheric direction, and iconic scares make it a noteworthy entry in the horror genre. While it has its imperfections, it remains a chilling and memorable experience for fans of supernatural horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Why The Ring << Ringu,"To put it simply where Ringu was elliptic, The Ring is a heavy-handed horror flick. Ringu mastered a blend of horrific fantasies with simple reality. The shuffling pace of its horror perfectly fitted the narrative structure: 'We want to know, to know only. But we have to experiment...'Yes, this is kind of the same premise as most slasher movies like, say, Scream 3. The difference is Ringu concentrated on it, leaving behind every over-used scheme, building its story and its rhythm over the journalist's investigation. The Ring drifts from this, focusing not on the journalist's investigation but on the journalist herself, her lovely sixth-sense lucid little boy and, last but not least, her dull-blank ex-boyfriend. But developing the central character is definitely not the point: it's all about the horror itself, stupid!'It's a remake, dude! Let's make it thoroughly understandable and bigger than life.'Producing an American version means lots of out-of-the-box rough-tunings. So first they build the story around Naomi Watts, director Verbinski revels in nice close-ups of his star all along her 'seven day pitch'. Then they used every narrative and horror cheap trick available. Of course they jumped on the opportunity to build up that little boy that sees. In the way they designed a sad witness for the source of horror (oh, the poor cursed father!). The horror cheap tricks are mainly expensive special effects: sophisticated ugly make-up and some digital stuff, all ringing out of tune.Eventually where is the horrific suggestive strength of Ringu? Why alleviate the original ending after dragging these leaden ballasts all along? When a movie/book is good enough there's no room for an adaptation. But I must be wrong since The Ring gathered more than $100m.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Surprisingly good remake of a Japanese thriller,"The Ring is the version of a Japanese thriller from 1998. This Japanese idea was original, chilling and very intense. You know what that means if the USA finds out on something like this..."" Let's Americanize it !!!"" I'm sorry if that sounded sarcastic but, usually, that IS the general rule behind it. But certainly no complaints this time ! Upcoming genius in Hollywood Gore Verbinski did a great job with it and I even prefer this remake over the original Japanese version. Ringu deserves all the credit it can get for originality and plot but when it comes to entertainment and production, The Ring is far more superior.The story behind the videotape is far more detailed and there's a lot more to discover. You're a lot more involved in this one and the background of ""Samara"" is fascinating up to the highest possible level. There already was a good amount of suspense in the Japanese version but Verbinski goes even beyond that level and delivers a rarely seen gem here. Certainly one of the better horrorfilms since The Silence of the Lambs. You almost are afraid to wink your eyes in order not to miss anything that could be an important plot element. It's good to see they still make them like this. Verbinski wisely didn't exaggerate with the horror elements. There are some frightening make-up scenes in it but the suspense keeps you focused well enough. A story like this really doesn't need too much blood or make-up, it all depends on the script and the acting performances. Speaking of which...they're great !! Naomi Watts is, besides a very beautiful woman, a good and promising actress. She got my attention after Mulholland Dr. and she certainly confirms it here. I hope to see her many times again in movies like this. Brian Cox never gives away a bad performance so there's no need to say that he's absolutely perfect in his role here as well. I still can't believe that this guy is so underrated. He should be right up there with other big names of his generation like Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman. He is at least as good as them ! And let's not forget the little girl who played Samara here. Daveigh Chase is really spooky in her role and highly believable. Certainly a girl to keep an eye on in the next few years.The Ring is one of the best films I've seen since the new Millenium and therefore I surely recommend it to as much people as possible. And if you like this film, I advise you to watch a 1980 film called ""The Changeling""...you'll find a few interesting similarities between these two titles. The Ring is the ideal film to watch with a group of people when it's late a night and the weather outside is dark. The perfect atmosphere for the perfect form of suspense.

Overall a nice spooky start but ugly to look at,"Spirits and ghosts are a strange topic for various people. Some have no awareness of such phenomena, while others are quite in touch with the subject matter. So much that they keep a very far distance from anything related to it. Of course there are also others that find it crazy and still decide to pursue answers even though it is not recommended. There's also complexities in translating supernatural instances like this for certain markets depending on where they came from. For the United States, this kind of movie wasn't really a big thing. For last several decades, horror films consisted of monsters, serial killers and undead creatures. This film however is what reignited people's interest.Originally the concept was based on a book and adapted into a movie in Japan by Kôji Suzuki during the mid-1990s. The American release would not come out until almost a decade later. The story is about Rachel (Naomi Watts) a private investigator who's looking into the death of her friend's daughter. The reason for her death witnessed by her friend was due to a mysterious VHS tape that she had watched a week earlier. Perplexing as that may sound, apparently the girl who died wasn't the only one who saw the tape. Seeking answers, Rachel pairs up with her separated husband Noah (Martin Henderson) to look into the details of the tape. Meanwhile they try to help their child Aidan (David Dorfman) cope, as he was friends with the recently deceased. The screenplay was adapted by Ehren Kruger, the same writer from the first three Transformers sequels.Kruger did have a horror film under his belt before though with Scream 3 (2000). Directing this feature was Gore Verbinski, who after this would go on to direct the popular Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Together these two produce an adequate viewing experience. The idea and how it began has a nice hook to it. Viewers will definitely find it creepy and for younger viewers not knowing what a VHS is will make it all the more alien. The story itself is also interesting as to how things came about. Slowly but surely, pieces to the puzzle are revealed which allows the audience to understand (mostly) why things occurred the way they did. Not all of it makes sense but the creepy visuals help with that. The practical effects use in the movie look good and the spirit played by Daveigh Chase has burned the iconic image of a horror girl into the mainstream conscience.People who love gore may not be as pleased if violence is to be expected. The acting is believable though. Naomi Watts is best known from Mulholland Drive (2001) but has played in several other movies too. Martin Henderson as the father does okay for the role. He would later play a character in Smoin' Aces (2006). David Dorfman as the child is okay too, being that the character he plays is stricken with grief the emotion doesn't need to be very involved. Dorfman would play one of the children in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) remake. Believe it or not, Daveigh Chase is the voice from Disney's Lilo & Stitch franchise. There's even an appearance from Brian Cox to provide some context to the story. The acting in general is effective enough to help the story along in what it needs to do.The cinematography on the other hand was less than desirable. Shot by Bojan Bazelli, the color palette to this movie is just ugly and it wasn't by accident. The film crew purposefully chose the hue of the movie to completely be muggy, foggy and murky green. There's only a few moments where other colors exist but they are far and few in between. It's funny because Bazelli is quite competent with credits to movies like Pumpkinhead (1988) and Burlesque (2010). The film score was surprisingly handled by Hans Zimmer. Not known for composing scores to horror films, Zimmer's work is a decent effort. It is certainly not the most memorable but it does have its own motif for the franchise, using mainly piano keys. Not much else has to be said about Zimmer as his influence is about as prominent as John Williams.Although it lacks any kind graphic visual horror or clear cinematography, it is still a fairly creepy film. The story itself is unique, the acting is fine and the music is also effectively spooky. A good start to the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
one of the best of all times,"Definitely amazing movie. It is not a movie of just empty jumpscare scenes and absurd irrelevant scenario.

How can traditional horror get any better than this?,"Let me be blunt for a second: I hate most everything that is defined as ""traditional"" or ""classic"" because they're almost always synonyms for unoriginality and predictability. Movies with those tags usually amount to nothing more than a big-breasted woman (who is topless half the screen time) being chased by a killer/monster(s) until she either finds a way to kill him/it or dies. That's all. Point A, topless sex scene, fake scare, ""Oh my God! The monster is real!"" scene, chase, woman lives/dies. For reasons like this, I have always preferred horror movies like Saw where every rule/plot you think you know is thrown out. However, The Ring completely made me remember that traditional horror can still be complex and original . . . and actually scary. In more way than one, The Ring is The Shining of its time.First, let me get the cinematography out of the wayit's gorgeous and incomparable. The blue tent has never been done to this level of effectiveness, and the camera angles take me back to the time when people actually put effort into cinematography.The plot is one of the most complex and memorable a ghost story has ever had. Also, it's revealed through action, mystery, and actually requires the main character to actually physically do something rather than just talk and talk until I fall asleep, as in most movies anymore.The acting is solid on all fronts. There is entertainment value, rather than just another cliché social commentary. The storytelling is never bloated or boring. The Ring also never plays it safe and uses the easy clichés that it could use. I also can't point to a single cheesy moment, ever.Overall, I cannot think of a more perfect example of truly flawless traditional horror. It ranks among The Shining and Alien for me. I can understand why a lot of people wouldn't like it, and it isn't for everyone, but I loved it. Watch it and make up your own mind. Just know that the original Japanese version has had more impact on the horror genre than most any other movie of our time, and the remake, in my opinion, is far superior.10/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Really not that scary.,"Course that could be for a reason: I saw Scary Movie 3, which spoofs it pretty well, before I saw this. Or it could just be that while the effects are cool, the plot just isn't too scary. Scary would be the acting jobs of the two kids, which do give the move a slight flavor of weirdness and creepiness. But not enough to compensate for the rest.Personally, Ringu is better. Granted, it's only about as scary as this, so slightly to mild, but it does a better job of explaining things, and the lead charcters don't seem to be quite as stupid. Also, it doesn't involve the death of a horse, which just bothered me with The Ring, though it made sense later.Still, it was a good movie - just not that scary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

That Face Moment...,"Let me preface this review by saying that I despise horror movies. I don't like creepy movies, I don't like movies with jump-scares, I could go the rest of my life without seeing a film like this. So why did I watch ""The Ring""? Because my wife wanted to watch it with me and because I'm a good husband.With that in mind, I actually didn't hate ""The Ring"" as much as I thought that I would. The acting was good, the tension was... tense..., and I enjoyed the twist at the end. I wish there was a little more explanation as to *why* that twist was necessary, but I still didn't mind it.As a whole, this is a solid entry in the genre (I don't have much to compare it to), though it relies mostly on creepy images and jumps to create fear.Best Character: Noah

Pathetic excuse for horror,Absolutely unbelievable more and nothing really creepy about it at all just a bunch of psychobabble about some those running around terrorizing found it more of a sleeper film than anything horror involved. Its almost like the writers were stretching for a plot and couldn't quite grasp how to draw the viewer into it including me. After about 30 min of this film I really found the only horrific part about it was it wasn't over yet. Even the draw up to find out the reasoning for the terror occurring was more of a huge disappointment a complete waste of time.

A CINEMATIC NIGHTMARE,"I am 45 years old and considered an extremely knowledgeable film buff. I am NOT a teenager.Only ""The Exorcist"", upon its original release, had this terrifying effect on me. This film sticks with you--it's extremely difficult to shake off. Sure, it contains a number of schlocky tactics, but they are effective. You could shoot arrows through some of the plot holes, but this is a supernatural tale, and not responsible for totally explaining itself.The haunting images and creepy atmosphere suggest a nightmare gone several steps too far. The makers of this film have tapped into exactly what scares an audience. There are several scenes that linger long after viewing this movie. I have seen it twice at the cinema and rented it today, on the debut of its home video release.

-cough-,"I liked this movie. It scared the dook out of me and it still creeps me out when I think about it. Yet, there are some things that made me scratch my head.

What happens then? When you think about it, it is a little bit unrealistic that all of the 'video' victims just happen to be at home when they are supposed to die.

Images of Hell,"This is not the most scary film since the Exorcist, the Blair Witch or the Sixth Sense, it's the most scary film ever. It's a remake of the Japanese film Ringu, which is apparently based on a novel(?), but I don't think the novel can have been as frightening. What does it is the suggestiveness of the images, the unimaginable terror that, it is hinted, lies behind the surface. Obviously the strange phenomena are not explained: what with the horses, the tree, the amulets, what sort of hellish method was used to conceive that child? What do the victims see in the last moment before they die (the short glimpses of their faces was possibly the most frightening thing in the entire movie)? If you have an vivid imagination, the images and thoughts that will come to mind for days after watching the movie will be at least as scary as the actual thing.

Let's cut the pretense. This movie was ultimately crap.,"While the more arrogant people in the room like to say that those who point out the gaping plot and story holes in this ""film"" just don't get it, this flick is merely a bone thrown to the jack-asses who have been jonesing for that grainy, Zapruder-like offering to salivate over since the first Blair Witch.When the audience is left having to figure out HUGE gaps in the movie, it's not because the film is trying to be a think-piece. It's because it's a piece of crap. Leave big enough holes and everyone can feel smart by making up the explanations. The talk of the sequal only feeds the people who are starting to realize you can't really defend this movie. ""Well, we only know part of the story now. You'll know it all after the second movie."" Sorry. That's a little flat for me, and only reinforces that this movie was poorly made.To be honest, though, I didn't have that bad of a time watching. You certainly feel cheated when it (finally) ends, but until then you don't know how many loose ends will be left unexplained.Like with Blair Witch, though, it really doesn't pass the ""waaaaaait a minute"" test just after you walk out of the theater and start thinking about what you just saw.Finally, I really don't give a crap how good or bad the foreign versions of this film were. I don't watch Japanese films. I'm not about to start watching Japanese films. I'm out of college, and no longer have to pretend to enjoy foreign or ""indie"" films of ANY kind, so I rarely do, save for Life is Beautiful, which kicked ass.In a nutshell, the ride isn't bad, but when it's over you'll be left to guess a great deal of the story, and I don't consider that intellectual entertainment.

Outstanding,"I have read many, many dismal reviews over this film.  I personally think it was a break through in cinematic horror.  Long have we waited for a movie to terrify us while leaving us scratching our heads.  Not since ""The Sixth Sense"" have I been so inspired by a horror movie.  The directing is pitch perfect.  Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job capturing shots that will stick in my mind for many years.  The acting was as well great.  You don't go into a horror film expecting good acting.  Sometimes, the acting is completely absent all together.  In this film, it was well above average. Bottom line:  not just a great horror movie, great movie.

Be careful if you get a VHS copy,"The Ring earns 8 bags of popcorn. A classic horror movie that haunted me as a child.This movie has cemented itself into my childhood as one of the scariest movies I saw. It scared me so much that even seeing the parody version of the girl in scary movie 3 still gave me nightmares. And to this day, I still get scared when I wake up in the middle of the night and my girlfriend is standing in the dim light of the tv, facing me with her long, dark hair covering her face.The Ring tells the story of Samara and how her cursed tape murders people who watch it. The protagonist, a journalist who seeks out answers to a mysterious death, finds herself racing against time for not just herself but for her son's as well since they both watched the tape.As much as I still enjoy this movie, I think the original Japanese version has the better ending with the entire second half of the movie being stronger than the English counterpart.As someone who grew up falling asleep watching VHS's of either rugrats or dragon ball z, nothing was more terrifying than waking up to a static screen. Those days are far gone now, yet the fear invoked by seeing that ghostly static girl is still as powerful as it was when I was a child.If you haven't seen it then go see it.

Better than average ghost story,"It starts off silly, like the writers were fishing for ideas for another teen scream flick and decided on using a video tape that kills people, instead of a psycho that kills people, or a web site that kills people, or a car that kills people, etc. It does get better though, and the whole video tape thing makes sense later on.There are a couple of things that didn't make sense, like how the girl in the opening scene died of fright yet looked like she was just unearthed from a tomb. The coroner said she had died of a heart attack -- people don't look like that after a heart attack. Obviously they just decided they needed some scary makeup so they stuck it in.I heard this is a remake of a Japanese film. The original probably relied more on story than effects and so was probably better.But after a clumsy beginning the movie pulls you in. It turns out to be an intelligent creepshow instead of the teen slasher flick that it starts out becoming. It ends with an original twist that extends the movie considerably and ties together all the loose ends. You need to review the movie in your head, but you will see that it really did come together.Definitely worth seeing if you like a good scare. But the beginning should be redone to fit the rest of the movie, and they should remove the superfluous and distracting makeup effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best J-horror Remake ever!,"*Contains Spoilers* Based on the Japanese horror sensation ""Ringu"" the American remake ""The Ring"" launched the J-horror craze in the fall of 2002. Ever since several Japanese and Asian film have had remakes but none have had the power and success of ""The Ring"" Before you die you see the ring.Set in the wet and ominously gloomy city of Seattle single mother Rachel, played by Naomi Watts, works as a journalist who comes across the mysterious story of a video tape that has deadly consequences 7 days after watching it. Her son Aidan is a strangely mature and articulate little boy who seems deeply troubled but he is just another part in the thoroughly creepy and inventive story. The opening scene of two teen girls talking about the tape has been spoofed many times but effectively sets up the urban mythology of the killer tape and gets Rachel involved as the victim was a relative and one of Aidan's closest friends.7 Days.When Rachel starts to investigate she finds out that a bunch of teens that stayed in a cabin at some resort all watched the cursed video have all recently died. So what would be the logical thing to do? Watch the video of course. Rachel drives to the resort and stays at the same cabin, number 12, she views the short black and white video of bizarre images and immediately afterwards the phone rings. When she picks it up a voice echoes 7 days and the countdown begins. She enlists the help of ex-flame and current co-worker Noah to help her find out the origins of the tape.The technology portrayed in the movie is in that period where everybody still had the big tube television and VCR's were still hanging by a thread. Those two things made all the difference in making it as creepy and scary as it is. HDTV's and DVD's are just too cold and clinical. The old technology has a worn in grungy feeling that is indispensable. But also in a strange way the movie invented the term viral video.Their research has lead Rachel to a horse farm on a remote island where what's left of the Morgan family resides. The old patriarch Richard Morgan lives there alone with nothing to do but work the land. His wife Anna had committed suicide years earlier. But wait there's more, desperate for a child the Morgan's adopted a daughter named Samara. Now this is a creepy kid and the key to the cursed video. We learn the disturbing back story of Samara and the Morgan's and its Rachel's job to set things right and stop the curse. Then comes the clever twist that sets this movie apart and brings us the movies signature moment.Almost three years later we were given a lame duck sequel directed by the guy to did the original Japanese version. Needless to say the original stands alone as an entertaining and frightening experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Glad I waited until it came to the discount theater,"This movie is not nearly as scary as everyone made it sound.  My friend had me believing it was so scary that while i was waiting for it to start I was wondering if I should have decided to see Die Another Day instead.  Well, I'm glad I saw it for only $4 w/ unlimited soda and popcorn, but I won't be seeing it again.Short summary: If you happen to watch this videotape, you'll die in 7 days. After her niece's mysterious death, Rachel finds the tape and watches it. She decides to figure out who made the tape and why, and how to possibly avoid death, before her time is up.To me, there are different horror categories. First there are the realistic and the unrealistic.  Realistic are the ones with human serial killers or ghosts.  In the unrealistic, the ""killers"" may be some kind of robots, aliens, or in the case of The Ring, a videotape.  I like watching both types, but the realistic kinds scare me more because I walk out knowing something like that could really happen, or have happened.  There are 3 other groups to divide horror movies.  There's the scary ones(like Scream), the creepy/spooky ones(like The Others), and the sad/freaky ones(like The Ring).  This movie will probably scare some people, but not me.   I usually get scared at movies that have a lot of suspense and moments that make me jump.  This movie was suspenseful, but there was no moments to jump.  And I don't understand why people would scream.  It really is more of a mystery type movie than a horror movie.  And even though I gave this a 6/10, if you like horror movies you should watch it anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enjoyable Movie,"The Ring is a film starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase (from Donnie Darko and Spirited Away). Personally, I did not find this movie scary, even the infamous ""walking out of the TV"" part. It follows a woman who is trying to uncover the mystery of a mysterious videotape and why people die 7 days until they die. Naomi Watts is that woman and she is a journalist and very good at uncovering the mystery, while both she and her son must race against time because they have both received the mysterious phone call saying they had seven days. This is a movie that does not follow the conventional, commercial means of getting a cheap scare, and it is above average with its intelligence. The answers to all of the mystery are very interesting, but sometimes this movie borders on silliness. It was remade from the Japanese movie Ringu, which is much more praised and also much more scary.

Great concept,"""The Ring"" is a classic supernatural horror film that left a lasting impression on the genre, but its execution may not resonate with everyone.""The Ring"" is often praised for its eerie atmosphere and the iconic image of the cursed videotape, but it's not without its drawbacks. The film's slow pacing in the first half can test the patience of some viewers, and the plot, while intriguing, has its share of implausible moments and unanswered questions.On the positive side, Naomi Watts delivers a solid performance as the determined investigative journalist, and the overall sense of dread and impending doom is effectively conveyed. The concept of a malevolent spirit coming to life through technology was innovative at the time and added a fresh twist to the genre.However, as the story unfolds, it may become increasingly convoluted and, to some extent, reliant on jump scares. Additionally, the scares can feel somewhat dated compared to contemporary horror standards.In conclusion, ""The Ring"" is a significant film in the horror genre and has left a mark on popular culture. While it has its merits, including a haunting atmosphere and a unique premise, it may not fully satisfy modern horror aficionados who are accustomed to faster pacing and more refined scares.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A captivating and terrifying mystery.,"First, it's important to know that this movie is an American remake of the Japanese 1998 film, Ring (which I'll call by its literal title Ringu for this review), which is itself based on the novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki. The critical and commercial success of The Ring brought in a whole slew of remakes of J-Horror movies, like Dark Water, Pulse, One Missed Call, and most successfully, Ju-On The Grudge(both the original and remake are quite good, though the original is perhaps a little better). And this is a remake that outshines the original.The plot is simple; Rachel, played by Naomi Watts and her ex-husband Noah, played by Martin Henderson, have a week to answer the mystery of a cursed videotape, which has claimed the lives of several teenagers. Telling anymore spoils the mystery, which is the heart of the movie. A fair bit of it is different from Ringu, but for the majority, these changes are far better for the movie.The intrigue of the tape and it's background is the real grip of the movie. The contents of the tape itself are incredibly disturbing, and at first appear as a seemingly random string of images. Each little piece gets slowly revealed to the viewer, and you begin to piece it all together, without the film telling it all to you. You solve the mystery and are invested in it just as much as our heroes.And thankfully, these heroes are excellently played. Watts performance of Rachel is a grounded, level-headed, and intuitive one, making Rachel a sleuth in all but name. Henderson brings some much-needed humour to the earlier parts of the movie before the horror starts to creep in, but soon reveals a versatile and human nature to Noah. Brian Cox (without saying too much) also has a few unfortunately brief, but powerful scenes, that bring real gravity to the situation. Our villain probably has less than 15 minutes of screen time, but her presence is constantly felt throughout the last half. The other actors aren't all that much to write home about however. They're far from bad, but instead feel only like links to where the plot will take the mystery, or to tell you about some dark event.The Ring is a great balance of mystery and horror. While Ringu perhaps focused too much on the mystery, and could only scare you a handful of times, The Ring has scares spaced out sporadically to keep you on your toes. There are jump scares, but a lot of the terror is from what you don't see. As mentioned earlier, you constantly feel the villain's presence, just breathing on the back of your neck. The soundtrack is unnerving, and the music that you would expect to play in the calmer moments is distorted, just to remind you that things are never safe. Two scenes in particular start with an almost mundane scenario, and soon escalate to something nightmarish (one of them I had to pause the movie for a few minutes).Now to air out a few of the bad things, but these are almost petty. The child actors are...well, child actors. They're not amazing. But for what they have to do, they do it well enough. Much of the film also has a green hue to it, but I suspect this was because it came out no long after the Matrix, and being green was the thing. Viewers may also find parts of it quite confusing. I saw Ringu and read the book before seeing this, so I knew the plot fairly well, but I can understand anyone's confusion.The Ring is a fantastic film, combining elements of a classic mystery and psychological horror. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout/ The Ring eclipses Ringue in my opinion, though I know many who might disagree. Ringu worked really well for a book. But The Ring works even better as a movie. If you like a good mystery, some unknown terror, or just watching a good movie, The Ring is one of my highest recommendations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Entertaining But Silly Horror Flick,"""The Ring"" is more or less a run of the mill horror flick: after a young woman is murdered by a mysterious killer, our heroine must race against time to find the culprit before she herself becomes their next victim. If you've seen ""Psycho,"" ""Halloween,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" or nearly any other horror movie ever made you've already seen ""The Ring."" The film is well made with impressive cinematography and capable performances, and overall I found it mostly entertaining. But what begins as an intriguing story with a creative premise devolves into a cliched and silly murder mystery with some of the most annoying tropes in horror movie history. I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen ""The Ring,"" but this is one of those movies where the story relies on our main characters making obviously dumb choices, and a disappointing twist ending ruins the third act. The central mystery is never truly resolved and crucial plot points are often left unexplained. I found ""The Ring"" mostly fun, but ultimately unnecessary. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Creepy Girl Inferno,"Of course, you will read those reviews who claim that the Japanese Ringu is the better one (because you know its from Japan, and the original one, and blabla), but in my opinion both are good movies. The Ring is a fine little horror movie with some (almost) iconic scenes (the videotape for example) and Naomi Watts for sure is a fine actress. My recommendation: watch The Ring and Ringu, and have some good old creepy fun time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Japanese Water Torture,"Following in the footsteps of ""Panic Room"" (see my review) and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" as critically praised pieces of trash, ""The Ring"" comes from underground to bore you to death at a theater near you.  This is one of those movies that is off the charts STUPID, like ""Blair Witch"" STUPID, where anyone whose brain is in the ""on"" position realizes that this is nothing more than a lame fright film that has been done before a hundred times.  It is far from scary and defies all logic from frame 1 to the end of the flick. This film may have the bells and whistles to entertain 11-14 year old kids, but anyone who is above the age of 20 should be embarrassed if they enjoyed this garbage.The problems are mostly plot related and I don't feel like ""spoiling"" any of the logic defying twists and turns that nearly put me to sleep.  Let me just tell you that if you like really slow movies that don't require a pesky plot, or continuity, this is your cup of tea.It's a horror flick, so for the most part the acting is poor.  The ""acting"" in the opening sequence is quite horrid, as if the untrained kids were reading their lines off of the script just beyond the camera.  Brion Cox, who I have seen in other films, is quite scary in his delivery, as if he forgot that he has 30 years of film experience.Naomi Watts is the one and only positive in this stinker.  Her presence alone carries this movie, as in Mulhullond Dr. (another piece of junk) and she needs to learn how to say the word ""pass"" when she is offered fine fare such as this.  She still manages to remain relatively unscathed as the entire movie crashes and burns around her and hopefully will star in something better soon.If you think that ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" are five-star, grade-A films, this movie is made just for you.  I think those movies are amazingly dumb and I felt stupid after I watched them, and felt even dumber after watching this film.  I think ""The Ring"" actually symbolizes the large plot holes that are readily apparent if you are paying attention.  If you are willing to check your brain at the door, you have a chance to not hate this movie, but I doubt it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Riveting and Suspenseful,The movie has a riveting storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.  The actors are excellent and Naomi is exceptionally superb as Rachel.  The cinematography goes a long way to lend to the mood of the movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Loved it.,"The plot twist at the end sent me. The movie is a masterpiece. It is the horror movie of all horror movies. It wasn't that suspense or jumpscare-y, but it had it's suspense moments. And the ending of the movie. The plot twist. It just sent me. Pretty hard not to spoil it, but I won't, even tho the movie is like 20 years old at this point. Everything made so much sense at the end of the movie. It didn't make me feel uneasy or anything. It was just a pretty good horror movie. From my experience, it was a whole lot better than most of the new horror movies that I have seen. Cinematography wise, it was really good. The filters, the colours. Everything was on point. The way the movie looked, was responsible for the whole aura of it. And it surely didn't disappoint. A heads up tho. It won't make you have nightmares if you have a weak stomach, but it will surely make you feel like you've watch a pretty decent horror movie. It's about what you would expect from a horror movie that was made in the early 2000's.I can finally say that I would recommend it for others, as it was pretty enjoyable. It is a classic at this point, so pretty hard to beat that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The Ring is one of those rare exceptional thrillers that, unlike most productions of its kind, doesn't need to rely on overt violence to make an impact","Perhaps the most successful of the American remakes of Japanese horror features, The Ring is also a landmark for the careers of director Gore Verbinski, who, thanks to this success, gained carte blanche to develop the initial Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy (2003-2006 -2007), and actress Naomi Watts, in her first work after the acclaimed City of Dreams (2001), and whose good performance here opened the possibility of being nominated for an Oscar the following year, for 21 Grams (2003). The positive reception, however, opened Hollywood's doors to a flurry of eastern horror remakes, all with far lesser results. It was a time of cultural fervor in the horror genre, with news from all possible corners, giving the Americans the creation of a label called J-Horror, or Japanese Horror, a genre of Japanese culture that is at the base of the films mentioned in the previous paragraph , as well as in the various remakes made after the rise of Samara, characters inspired by Sadako, from the film starting point, Ringu, directed by Hideo Nakata, a creature who managed to found his own mythology in American territory, with positive results, both in aesthetics as in the dramatic issues that lead us to contextual debates and reflections.One of the greatest merits of this film is the construction of the narrative, director Gore Verbinski delivers a horror story that does not resort to the typical easy scares (so hot lately), the fear is precisely in the tension, in the gloomy climate that narrows down to reach the great climax. Verbinski already shocks us with that wonderful opening scene, which in a way reminds us of the equally great opening of the classic Scream. From there, the script goes to the investigation plot, which by the way is very well worked and which gradually reveals the secrets surrounding that tape.Verbinski's elegant driving and Watts' safe driving as the protagonist give The Ringa differentiator - something that not even its sequels (The Ring2, 2005, and The Ring3, 2017) have managed to maintain. He was given a detailed development of a supernatural story with detective touches and a final twist that appealed to the public, all taken by surprise by a curse that was just beginning - thus ensuring its sequels. She was already responsible for introducing a female figure that not only emits cries for help at every scare. On the contrary, she is not only responsible for her actions but also for those whom she ends up affecting in the course of her actions. She is a mature, confident woman who is not afraid of haunting her path.The script by Ehren Krueger, playwright who reorganizes an already structured text, having as its function the complex task of cultural translation. Thus, the dialogues change, as do the characters' actions. There is, between the two mothers of both narratives, basically the same dramatic need. Keeping yourself unscathed for the sake of your children. It is a theme that works within what is conventionally called ""universal"", a general idea that reaches east and west. In the American version, by the way, realism is also present. Rachel is the protagonist, but she behaves like any other human being, full of flaws that characterize her as a normal woman, full of imperfections. Rachel is intense but not perfect. She is a relapsed mother and with a strange relationship with little Aidan, a silent and sad boy, a kind of mirror image of Samara Morgan, responsible for the curse of the video. A journalist for a print media, she has no qualms when the need for the scoop or the answers to save her life speak louder than the values established by what people call ""ethics"", with the good thing about it all, the form how such characters circulate in the spaces conceived by the aesthetic elements of the story.The ghostly atmosphere is complex, as evil is mediated, as in a criticism of television. This becomes apparent when Rachel visits Samara's father's farm and in an argument, he vents her opinion about the media professionals: ""What do reporters want? They take someone's tragedy and spread it like a disease"". There is a scene where Rachel watches the neighboring building and all the visible apartments have their televisions on, with people doing the most diverse activities. In an era of depression and loneliness, television has become the silent and ubiquitous relative. The TV is Samara's portal, part of a scheme to destroy our brain molecules, as pointed out by two characters in the opening. And what about the family? Without the common standards established by traditional society that has been crumbling for eons, here we find a mother who must work hard to support her child, without the proper help of the omnipresent and irresponsible father. The search for motherhood seems to be a theme that tries to emerge in the narrative fabric of the work.Another positive point of the film that gained immense repercussion was the figure of Samara, the cursed girl who is responsible for a wave of deaths - and which the protagonists try to avoid. The hairy little girl determined to make them pay for all the harm she suffered in life has become a popular icon, not only being generically repeated in later similar titles, but also surrendering to self-parody - all the fear that inspires this chapter The initial opening ends up being reduced to an uninspired pastiche in the following episode. Samara was abandoned by her natural parents, adopted by a couple who do not understand her, and left to die at the bottom of a well for exactly one week. After these seven days, she returns, now to get revenge through an obscure recording found on a dusty VHS tape. Whoever watches it, immediately receives a phone call: on the other end of the line, a female child's voice says only ""seven days"".""The Ring"", interestingly, makes no mystery about the content of the tape (a series of dreamlike, seemingly meaningless images), which is presented to the viewer as the protagonist, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts -the blonde from ""City of Dreams"") sees her. This creates a curious complicity between the audience and the character. Both, after all, are in the condition of passive spectators, with unvirgined and cursed eyes, which facilitates the unfolding of the plot, which follows Rachel's saga to unravel the film's message, the only chance to save her life and that of her son.The film draws attention to its team's brutal effort to create an atmosphere. As in the successful ""The Others"", there is no room for ironies or jokes here. Everything in the film is very serious, rigorously thought out to the smallest details, and its look is treated absolutely differently from the average Hollywood production today. Photography at this point helps a lot in the mood, the director opts for palettes in greyish and bluish tones and this combined with the often rainy and closed weather makes the scenes denser, more dramatic and somber, besides, of course, giving a finish and a better aesthetic than the narrative. Despite the photograph full of shades of gray, striking images to the point of recreating the damned video in the film itself, and a game of disagreements proposed by the script between what is supernatural or just impression, the most interesting of this The Ring ends up being, in a closer analysis, the family issues that are raised. Samara just wanted to be loved, and no one around her is willing to make that effort. Yes, it takes dedication and commitment to take care of a child, as we learned in the complicated relationship between Aidan and his parents, Rachel (whom he refuses to call ""mother"") and Noah (whose identity is not even assumed). It's an interesting parallel, which perhaps deserves a closer look, but which still, in the format in which it is delivered to the public, manages to go beyond mere cliché.As a curiosity, there are several tributes to the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, in sequences with references to his classic films such as Psycho (1960), in the passage where there is water running down the bathroom drain when Rachel is taking a shower (in a reference to the famous scene from shower murder), or Rear Window (1954), through Rachel's building neighbor, who is watching television sitting in an armchair with a broken leg (recalling James Stewart's similar character, who liked to watch his neighbors with a telescope). Other curious facts were the quick appearance of images of subtle circles of varying sizes throughout the film, a clear reference to the cursed video symbol, and the absence of actor Chris Cooper, who had filmed some scenes as a child murderer and was cut into the final edit.The Ring is one of those rare exceptional thrillers that, unlike most productions of its kind, doesn't need to rely on overt violence to make an impact. On the contrary, the ubiquitous tense atmosphere of the production ensures audience interest throughout the duration of the tape. Such atmosphere is achieved by the competent work of Bojan Bazelli (photography), Hans Zimmer (soundtrack) and Gore Verbinski (director), in perfect harmony, aided by the excellent editing of Craig Wood. The tightly tied conclusion also provides a natural hook for the sequel to this intriguing film that deserves the attention of fans of the genre, and regardless of the veracity of the approach to an urban legend in a cursed video, it's always good to remember the words of sensitive boy Aidan, when worried he told his mother about Samara's vengeful ghost: Don't you understand, Rachel? She never sleeps...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Suspense!,"When I saw the tagline of this movie (You see a video, and after 7 days you die) I thought this movie would be some lame horror movie. But it sure wasn't!

A Masterpiece of Dread,"A rare remake that improves upon the original film in several ways, The Ring is a tense and terrifying experience from start to finish with a fascinating central mystery at its core. It's a slower burn that some might be accustomed to, but it gives us an exciting ticking time bomb of a situation that escalates everything - 7 days after you watch a cursed video tape, you will die. We don't know how you'll die, but from what we've seen on previous victims, it's not going to be pretty and The Ring effectively uses this to build dread and tension throughout the film. We want Rachel (Naomi Watts) to figure out how to stop this curse before it claims the life of her and her son.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Could have been a ringing endorsement.  Too bad...,"It's that time of year again when the leaves are turning kaleidoscopic colors, the air is tinged with the crisp scent of renewal and brain busting midterms are once again a distant painful memory. It also means that we will be bombarded with ads for half-baked horror flicks that have been gathering dust on studio shelves, in the vain hope of scaring up some cheap Halloween thrills. Worse yet, the gullible masses will inevitably take the bait.Everyone is shocked when Rachel Keller's teen aged niece literally drops dead for no apparent reason. An investigative reporter, Rachel's curiosity is piqued when she is hears that Katie and three of her friends died after watching a cursed videotape. Determined to debunk an urban legend and make great copy in the process, Rachel inadvertently stumbles upon a sinister secret.  If she doesn't solve the ensuing mystery in seven days, not only will she blow her deadline, she dies. Nothing like a little incentive.Based on the 1998 Japanese film of the same name, The Ring rises above it's contemporaries: it doesn't rely on elaborate eviscerations, naked nubile teenagers or multimillion dollar CGI effects. The first hour of the film is a pure Hitchockian-style thriller with a supernatural bent, mixing disturbing surreal imagery with quick cut away shots and an eerie score to devastating effect (there were moments where the hairs on the back of my neck literally stood on end).  It's too bad that the remaining fifty minutes are a different movie.The second half of the film serves as a caveat for film makers on what not to do: introduce irrelevant characters, lose sight of your plot and allow it to ramble aimlessly, have a fake climax (that's never a good thing), and wrap with a predictable ending.  The biggest glitch however is the `villain' of the piece.Whether demon, psycho, monster or serial killer, there needs to be some underlying motivation that drives the antagonist to seek vengeance.  While the killer in The Ring was indeed wronged, it is never fully explained why this happened, and the victims are in no way associated with these events. Consequently, the antagonist's actions make no sense within the context of the film, especially when efforts to ameliorate these injustices only serve to magnify her rampage.Regardless whether you prefer the thinking person's subtle horror stylings of The Sixth Sense or the pea soup expectorant head spinning of The Exorcist, The Ring will leave you unfulfilled and annoyed for having let you down.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Didn't make sense,"This movie had potential to be very frightening but I just didn't feel it. I was the most scared when they switched scenes and would play a screeching sound and show an eyeball or a ring between the shots.  The whole point was that the girl wanted people to hear her story but why would she kill them once they did?  If she had this amazing power to just kill someone, why wouldn't she just kill the people who didn't know about her or some how make them find out her story.  A lot of stuff wasn't even explained like how did she make the tape?  It seems kind of impossible to me that a tape just appears somewhere.  The girl looked pretty freaky but other than that, this movie was not scary.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Definitely one of the more thought-out and intelligent horror movies...,"This is one of the best horror or science fiction movies you will ever come across. It competes with the likes of Poltergeist, and is an instant classic in all respects. As is usual, it takes a certain type of person to appreciate it for what it really is, and those who were more than content with it likely didn't bother to comment on it here. So you can disregard just about ever negative post here, since you have to really go out and see it for yourself to make that judgement.Regardless, The Ring is an excellent flick with a winning idea behind it. It has a symbol (the ring itself, of course) and what has to be one of the most original plot lines anyone has seen. A video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it, subliminal hints at what will become your ultimate fait, and a truly unique character to be afraid of. Yes, it will leave a lot of loose ends untied at the end, but that's the point. You will remain affected by this movie long after you have finished watching it.This is a deserving addition to really everyone's home library, whether you thought it was just 'okay' or utterly fantastic. It's truly a one-in-a-million movie, much like The Sixth Sense, Titanic and Poltergeist. Don't pass this one up. At least bother to see it once before giving up hope.Anyway, to wrap things up, this instantly became one of my favorite movies and has all the fixings of a well-done theatrical feature. And I really, really hope they slap on a sequel to clear up some of the confusion that seems to be plagueing a lot of watchers.

Rip offs and Hodgepodge,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Ahhh, ""word of mouth""!  The best advertising campaign a movie can have.  Just ask ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". Positive word of mouth had me anxious to see ""The Ring"".  Not many clever horror/suspense/thrillers come around these days.  It appears the moviegoing public is so starved for this genre, that we can turn mish-mash into success at the box office.  Don't kid yourself.  This is a stupid, poorly made, well conceived milkshake of a movie.  It blatantly steals from the best - ""Poltergeist"", ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Sixth Sense"".  Even the lead actors appear to be rip-offs:  Naomi Watts (excellent in ""Mulholland Drive"") mimics Rebecca DeMorney and Theresa Russell, Martin Henderson takes on Viggo Mortenson and Elias Koteas, and little David Dorfman does his best Haley Joel Osment and Adam Hann-Byrd (""Little Man Tate""). actually have talent.  Director Gore Verbinski (""The Mexican"") seems to be a big fan of horror movies and by golly, was going to get every idea he ever had into this one. And I think he had Brian Cox use one electrical appliance for every one of his ideas.  Nice premise with the video tape and 7 days, just poor execution.  The film does offer up some wonderful visuals in dream sequences and video.  The past is much more interesting than the present for these characters.

"Brilliant, best remake made, doesn't disappoint!","Tightened script, extraordinary use of visual story telling methods, and well cast actors make this version of The Ring a feast for horror fans. All the gimics of the genre are incorporated, while the suspence of the Japanese original remains intact. Many of the original sequences are reborn and enhanced, and along with this rehashed script, are not dumbed down in anticipation of Hollywood audience prerequisites. The idea of Sadako/Samara is fantastic. Perhaps the main difference in feeling from the original lies with our perception of her: In the original one understands Sadako to be non-human, supernatural, and a product of some ancient sea torment. The Ring (2002) however, portrays Samara as a fundementally evil entity out for revenge.

Sometimes scary other times not...,"When I started watching this movie, I thought it was going to be really scary, but it was actually not so scary and I can't blame the people who didn't like it, probably it is all because of the very little content of horror or they didn't understand the script. The beginning of it looked as if it was another ghostly movie with ghosts and scary settings, but I must say ""The Ring 2"" has much more supernatural horror than this epic. In some scenes I felt like I did not understand a single various thing like at the very confusing end, but I think you have to watch it again to get the full meaning. Also, in some scenes, were actually scary and it kept me on the very edge of my seat, wondering what is going to happen next. So there are ups and downs for this movie, but the bring it to a conclusion, I would say, it was an OK movie but if you're looking for something scarier - watch the sequel to this.Naomi Watts, another successful actress, took the chance to perform a single mother and in my opinion she did it really well. She was the perfect choice for Rachel Keller and you could see she really tried and surprisingly it looked as if she was doing it for real. As for Martin Herderson and Brian Cox - they are really marvellous actors. Like every actor/actress in this movie, they truly done there roles fantastically well and they really tried their very best. So the performances really brought this movie to the next level - which was great. But there was a real let down on the script, like I said, I didn't understand anything in some particular scenes. I mean, in the end and some scenes in the middle...what? I did not understand! So, like the content of horror, that was a negative point to the movie that is what makes the movie get poor ratings.

Better than most American remakes,"The Ring was an American remake of Ringu, one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Many people I know who have seen both movies find this version superior.

I Don't see lightyears of differences, but I will say that Ringu is a slower movie that builds into a great ending. The ending to Ring is also scary, but I don't think it's near as frightening as Ringu.This film has a scary atmosphere that kept me tense for the entirety of the film. The performance of Naomi Watts is one of the best in horror history. Regardless of whatever Ring film you pick, you can't go wrong.I would give this film a 10/10 had I not seen Ringu first.

Some people who I've discussed this movie with hated it, simply because it was too weird for them. The movie is extremely imaginative and fairly surreal, so if you go into the theater expecting the ending to have every single question answered and a solid ending, you'll probably not get what you want.

This however is a positive factor as it allowed the writers to tool with the concept of the cursed videotape, giving Sadada/Samara an interesting, new back story for us to follow.This film could have been like any other modern day horror, knives, blood and mindless violence. This film, however focuses on a more mystery based Thriller, which is good as it doesn't ruin the atmosphere of the original Suzuki novel.The acting is very good, Naimoi Watts does an amazing job at capturing the films horror psychologically. The child actor playing her son is very skilled as well and creates an eerie feel to some of the scenes.The film isn't very graphic and focuses on a more artistic horror. This is a nice break from the amount of mindless slashers like saw and the stupidly on going Jason series. The film only doesn't get a 10 stars because the book had a slightly more gripping back story for Sadada/Samara and explained a bit more about why the cursed videotape exists. Still this film is a classic and will remain in my DVD collection until blue-ray out-dates everything, pff unlikely!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I got much amusement from the crowds responses,"If you want to see a scary movie, this is a good one. There are a fair amount of scenes to make you jump, but there's more than that. The storyline is decent and it's well filmed and acted. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by it's PG-13 rating. It's not a gore-fest, but there are some unpleasant images that cross the screen. I'm pretty hardened after watching scary movies all my life, but I can still appreciate them. If you're going to see this movie, you should see it in a theater. I got much amusement from the crowds responses. There were three ladies in their 30s on my right, about half way through the movies I noticed they were curled up in their seats with their hands on their foreheads, covering their eyes anytime they thought something scary would happen. Then on my left there was a couple...they guy got a bit verbal at some of the last quarter of the movie. Not talking to his mate, but usually uttering one curse word at key moments. It all added to my enjoyment of the film. As a kicker, for those that have seen the movie, I got home and turned on my cell phone and the it immediately went off with a message. I laughed outloud. No worries, it was just my friend, Vince, inviting me to come over and watch the world series. I have not seen the original Japanese Ringu yet, but I am looking forward to seeing it as I've heard it's better and scarier!*** (Out of 4)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Riveting Horror,"I simply loved The Ring. It's an incessantly entertaining horror film that will give you goosebumps every time you watch it. It will be hard to sleep that night.That, however, is not what I loved about this film. I loved the plot and the mystery that the main character (Naomi Watts) is trying to uncover. The ending, although scary, is very satisfying, and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat.The Ring is a million times better than its cheesy sequel, The Ring Two. I loved this film, I must have watched it a million times after I bought it on DVD. My parents kept asking ""Didn't you just watch that?"" And I did. Over and over.

It's an insult to compare this to The Sixth Sense!,"I only gave this a 3, instead of a 1, because there was some fantastic imagery. Otherwise, this really was one of the bigger waste of time movies I've ever seen.This was NOT a truly scary movie. It was creepy. Absolutely creepy. But, the expectation that I would suspend my disbelief was SO high I simply couldn't do it.Many people have said there were too many questions left unanswered - that is totally true. I was more frustrated after the movie ended simply because there wasn't enough information provided about the WHY of the premise.Unfortunately truly bad acting by the two main adult characters did not contribute positively to my viewing experience. I had a hard time caring about anyone in the film.

Packed with substance,"This is more than just a horror movie, it's a dramatic mystery. The tension kept me invested the whole way through. What it aims to do, it executes beautifully. It's really eery and atmospheric throughout, with some disturbing sights and sounds. I think some more in your face scares, or a slightly more decisive ending could've made it a 10 in my mind. I'm a little surprised this isn't rated higher. I think looking back this will easily hold its place as an iconic classic. They just don't make movies like this anymore unfortunately.

"Before You Die, You See...","In the gloomy Pacific northwest, an unlabeled VHS tape awaits the curious. After they press play, unlucky viewers are condemned to five minutes of eerie film school snippets, a breathy telephoned warning and an unexplained death within the week. Mourning one of the cassette's latest victims, a tenacious newspaper reporter tracks down a copy, watches it, answers the phone and pursues the truth behind an urban legend. And then carelessly shares the curse with a few loved ones.Maybe it's because I've been watching so many iffy-to-bad horror movies lately, but The Ring really stands out. Not just as a good thriller, but as a top-quality film regardless of genre. It can scare without going over the top. Pose complex, troubling questions and see them through. Set a tone and stick to it. That last point is a particular strength: drenched with pervasive blue-green tones, dense mists and steady rain, this is a film with an excellent knack for atmosphere. It looks and feels like a headache brought on by too little sleep; a clinical hangover punctuated by a steady fluorescent hum. Which puts us in the same dazed, panicked head space as our protagonist, who certainly lacks for a good night's rest during her increasingly hectic seven-day investigation. As the tragic ghost story unfolds, so does her own. Side by side, we learn about the cruel origins of that haunted tape and the tangled knot that's become her private life. It's an efficient, satisfying plot, one that succeeds on multiple fronts and doesn't press the audience too far beyond the limits of their disbelief.We catch some frights, but the camera never lingers. In fact, it often relegates the biggest, nastiest stuff to a spot on the fringe or a quick, fleeting glance. The Ring is an intelligent horror film, one which understands that what we thought we saw is often far worse than what we did. And when the time finally comes to pay out, it does that very well, too. Our climactic meeting with the dank, bedraggled little girl in the video - literally crawling through the CRT screen and shimmering with dirty static - is an unforgettable slice of cinematic trickery. The rare case of a big budget Hollywood horror movie that actually gets it, this one goes to some crazy places and most everything still makes sense in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Very well made, but see the original for a scare","(I promise no spoilers here!) There are things I liked about this movie, but it could have been better.  The mood, the setting and the casting was all excellent.  But the pacing and the story needed work.  For those who do not know, this movie is a remake of a 1999 Japanese Film called Ringu.  If you combined the pacing and story of Ringu with the casting and setting of this movie you would have an awesome movie.  The Story?  But it's a remake, it has the same story doesn't it?  Well, yes and no.  While it has the same premise, and even the same twists, the Japanese original is much more streamlined, and more vague at times.  How is this better?  Well it lends more suspense and more mystery, more creepiness to the whole thing. Believe it or not, sometimes less is more, and that is certainly the truth with Ringu.  That does not mean that this film is bad though.  It has it's own creepiness, and its own mood.  Naomi Watts is awesome, and David Dorfman as her son is terrific.  This movie comes off mostly as a mystery and not horror, although that is also true of the original, this version almost reminds me of ""The Lady in White"" for some reason. Horror, but horror based in mystery.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has not seen the original and is looking for a good suspense/mystery.  Avid horror fans should seek out the original, and much more scary Ringu.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

quite a flick but not quite....,"(ok...please don't read the review before seeing the film because it will ruin the surprises you are going to get...)the ring is a good film compared to those awful horror movies which only have one goal...scare people...while the concept and direction are innovative and scenic, there are quite a lot of similarities to normal horror movies. sure we have seen most of the story in one film or the other. but considering the thrilling experience which is accompanied by annoyance due to the lose ends and unexplained things can hook you into your seat for two hours. they should have really worked on the story in a better way which would have made the film much more successful. first of all...how would samara make a tape...let us say she made it...she decides that if the person who watched this tape doesn't make a copy of it in seen days, he will be dead...and she makes a phone call for fun...makes the person's image blurred in photographs...weak...too weak....and to add to this we see all kinds of weird things on the tape like the well in which she was drowned(the tape was made well before her drowning)...i guess this is the problem with almost every horror film...but avoiding these weak links and delivering a meaningful story makes a horror film a better horror film...don't you agree...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Scary Horrer Movie?  How did that happen?,"The Horrer Genre over the years has degredated into teenage supermodels running around half naked in the woods being picked off by Axe murderers. Somewhere along the line people forgot that Horrer movies were suposed to scare you beyond a few startles. Enter: the Ring, this movie was an exelent example of what a horrer movie SHOULD be.  It's not just another blood and guts slasher flic, in fact the movies suceeds in scareing the crud out of you wihtout showing more than a few drops of blood in the entire film. The ring follows a female reporter who investigates a mystrios video that suposadly kills you seven days after you watch it.  After veiwing the video, she finds out not only that it's real but that it kills you in the most horrible way possible:  It scares you to death.  Victems of the video are found with a horrible looks of terror etched on thier face. Not only does this woman have to figure out how to survive the vieo by solving it's mysteries, she has to save her son who watches the video himself! The director does an exelent job of being very spooky.  Scenes don't jump around like most movies, it uses very slow cuts and disoves to give the movie a very slow pace, and belive it or not the slow pace makes the film. You find yourslef stuck in a slow process of anticipation, you don't know what's going to happen, but you fearful of it.  The reason this movie is so freak is it INCLUDES you as part of the film.  You have to think that since you yourself saw the video, that your in the same situation as anyone else. You know that it's just a movie but in the back of your mind you can't forget what you saw and the fear is still there. Basicly your freaked out, and will stay freaked out for days after you've seen it.  You won't be able to walk though a dark hallway with the same vigor ever agian.  And don't think your to big a man to be freaked out this movie: that kind of man does not exist.  This is the first move to ever really scare me. My advice?  Check it out, you won't regret it.  It's a purly entertaining, and it'll have you guessing until the very end.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very clever horror flick,"I haven't seen the original film 'Ringu' from which this movie was based but I would have to say that Hollywood did an OK job on this film.  The plot is not Hollywood's, thank heavens, because in recent years any horror movie with any plot coming out of Hollywood seems to need to conform to the Scooby Doo format.  By that I mean by the end every little mystery has been explained in full detail.... unfortunately at the expense of the real ingredients, fear, suspense, etc, etc.The idea of this film is very clever, if you didn't know anything about it then you would be surprised at what is going on and you would not be able to predict the ending even if you were convinced you had it right, you'd be wrong.  Having read reviews to other Japanese horror movies it seems that many of them have intelligent and curious causes to the supernatural phenomenon as well.  An influx of American remakes may follow The Ring.To give some sort of review I would have to say that it is for the most part one of the very best horror movies of the last 5 years.  There is a deep and disturbing atmosphere, although I will see Ringu next and compare to see if it comes close.  There is an excellent score of music to set the mood and tone of what the director wants you to feel during the scenes and the sound effects are used well to develop the tension.  The storyline itself is by far the movie's strongest point and compares with any horror I can think of.In short I would definately say watch this movie if you like supernatural horrors, or maybe you should see the original 'Ringu' first though??",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent movie!,"Though I can't compare this to the Japanese version since I've never seen it, this movie on it's own is quite great. The soundtrack is also interesting, containing a creepy tonality but fast paced tempo which provides the feeling that the viewer is unraveling a mystery. This movie has a few jumps, but what makes it great is the creepy atmosphere (greyish tint the whole time) and the psychologically induced terror. I imagine this movie was scarier when the tape format was more prominent, but this film is still worth watching. The Japanese version of this movie really created what most people today consider Japanese horror, and the American version is no slouch. A must-see for anyone interested in horror or mystery!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horses in Place of Volcano-A different look at a horror masterpiece,"Now that I've seen the original Japanese version of THE RING, I would be hard-pressed to choose between the two films. Both films are not that faithful to the novel, I understand (Can't verify it until an English translation comes out), but the US version is generally a mirror of RINGU. Except that the female protagonist in the US version is a much stronger character than her Japanese counterpart. That is because of the difference in our cultures.Another difference is that we seemed to replace the volcano from the original with the strange death of one woman's horses. The horse-owner replaces the psychic, placing more of the power in the daughter (It's also interesting that it is the mother in the US version who throws the daughter into the well, while it was the father in the Japanese version). Verbinski (or the script writer) was wise to set it in the Seattle area, so to echo the original's obsession with water. One last observation, The scene at the hospital was taken from RINGU 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Unpleasant Experience,"Well, a horror movie should not be a pleasant experience, should it? What I actually mean is that 'The Ring' is an unpleasant artistic experience, and this despite being actually well filmed. The director seems to be one of these technically skilled people, capable of taking a story and translating it into good cinematography. The problem is that the story has no logic, time is badly manipulated, there is no emotion to connect the viewers to the guys supposed to be good in the story, and frankly not enough thrill to make this a memorable horror film. The end which is suppose to explain what this was all about (need it?) is kind of a ridiculous joke, imported from the 'Gothic' stories. I realize that many people actually liked the film, but in this case I need to be rather on the critics side. 'The Ring' is a mediocre film, and there are not too many reasons to recommend it to my friends. 6/10 on my personal scale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scariest Film on Earth,"If you have not seen this film, then I highly recommend you watch it. This film will give you the creeps you will never forget. The film spooks you into the belief of the story and Samara's death. The film is extremely convincing about the websites being read by Naomi Watts.This film is the remake of the Japanese film RINGU and I saw this few weeks ago and RINGU is not too scary, but Hollywood feeds on dramatizing reality and this time they were successful with THE RING. The Ring is a simple story of a lady who watched a 30 second spooky video and is cursed to death, after which she conducts research on the truth behind the 30 second video and finally gets successful in her mission. All this is too simple to read, but wait till you watch THE RING, I guarantee you that ""Friday The 13th"" will seem lame.My credit goes to the director of THE RING and he has done an excellent pre-production plan prior to the making of this film.WATCH IT AND STAY AWAKE ALL YOUR LIFE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sill relevant and atmospheric,"Even in 2023, the movie looks decent. Also, after watching the original 1998 film, you may notice a deeper level of detail. The shift in focus on the sensory abilities of children rather than adults. Adults try to analyze every action and event, unlike children who simply don't have that experience. Therefore, the overall picture of children's naivety and lack of deep analysis and consequences of an event becomes frightening for adults.In this respect, the 2002 movie is more atmospheric in terms of conveying the emotion and stimulus of fear through the children's sensorics. But the detective line is also retained, as exciting as in the original movie.The balance of depressing atmosphere, detective, and fear of the transience of time makes the movie still relevant today, and rightfully shows the horror genre, even without the screemers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

mixed review,"I've been waiting to see this movie for a long, long time. Of course I never saw the original one, because of no distribution whatsoever in the United States. But even so, the trailer (which I viewed nonstop on the Internet) was ... breathtaking. It reassured me that a good and well made scary movie was finally going to come around.It's definitely well made. The movie looks absolutely amazing. The music is perfect, really makes you feel like impending doom is about to be unleashed.But the film did a horrible job in explaining the plot.. I had a talk with some of my friends after the movie, and it took us about an hour to fully get it.Other bad things: the dialogue is pretty weak, and we have another cliched boy wonder (David Dorfman) who has big, big eyes and is in tradition of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. He knows lots and people confide in his words. Ugh.Nonetheless, the film works on some levels, mainly the ones I stated before. The video itself is pretty damn creepy, in grand tradition of the Nine Inch Nails ""Closer"" video (with chairs spinning really fast upside down and all, etc).

She promptly shows it to her ex because he insists then her son sneaks and watches it.  So the reporter has to solve the mystery or in seven days as a phone call tells them they will die.  Some of the problems for me included the girl in the mental institution...you never find out why she is there or how she knows things.

Worth watching... just barely,"A videotape that kills people when they watch it. *sigh* All right...The argument of the story sounds somewhat intriguing and the first sequence of the movie makes you think you're going to have a hard time trying to sleep that night. Well, I for one didn't.As the storyline develops the whole videotape business goes down the trash and the movie slowly turns into a ""What lies beneath"" or ""The sixth sense"" kind of film. I didn't like that one bit. By the end of the movie, and specially in the last sequence, you have to remind yourself ""Oh yeah, the tape! That's what this was all about!"". In short, the movie weakens itself progressively and finally collapses, just to have a little spark of life in that ""last confrontation"" scene. Still, the very ending, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of dumb. And Naomi Watts' performance doesn't help the story much either. It's just not convincing.I think the movie is worth watching for two main reasons:The videotape itself gives you goose bumps. As they say in the movie, it's something you'd only see in a nightmare. - The ""last confrontation"" I mentioned earlier contain some of the scariest images you'll see in any movie. The director chose many of those shots so that they would look like an individual point of view, and that has a big impact when you're alone in your room watching TV. But then again, most of this new wave of thriller movie directors do the same.Aside from this two sequences the movie does not contribute anything to the genre. Recent movies like ""The sixth sense"", ""The others"" or ""Signs"" have a much bigger impact on the audience using only the atmosphere built throughout the film and a few carefully selected shots and sounds; they don't rely in visual FX: just good directors and good performances.

Horror with Depth,"Horror with Depth!Before I saw The Ring, I used to think of horror movies as something about a supernatural (sometimes not supernatural) force that gobbles up people in bizarre series of deaths usually accompanied by blood and gore. Maybe I ought to blame it on my own selection of movies. But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.The Ring is an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu. Ringu is a well respected horror movie. Rather than call The Ring as an adaptation I would prefer calling it as an improvisation of Ringu. For I have seen both movies and in my personal opinion the producers of The Ring have made the story a bit deeper and of course with the music and special effects scarier.A particular thing worth mentioning is the work done by the child actor David Dorfman (playing the role of Aidan). My personal opinion is that he has done a very good job. And Ehren Kruger, in his script for the movie has given a major role to Aidan as opposed to lesser important role given to Aidan's Japanese counterpart.Full credit to the Ring's makers for a very fine adaptation of the original Ringu. And yes, a small word of advice for those who have not seen the real Daveigh Chase (playing Samara). After seeing this movie, do look up on the net for a picture of hers and make the comparison!

"Officially freaky, but...","Horror movies had been for a long time regarded as the more bloody it is, the scarier it will be. Take for instance the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. After a little while, it became ridiculous. When ""The Sixth Sense"" came out, M. Night Shyamalan re-ignited the sense that scary doesn't always have to be someone after you, but the unknown. The mystery.A mystery is a good description for ""The Ring"". The scary story comes out of the belief that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. Why? That is what the story is all about. That alone is kind of freaky. Just to think that by watching a video you will die kind of gives one the ""eebie jeebies"".""The Ring"" doesn't waste time on gore. There are only a couple of moments that there are glimpses of disturbing images. They are on the screen so briefly that it almost acts as a camera giving you a mental picture of what the people looked like after they died. I was surprised though that it only received a PG-13 rating. I really don't recommend to anyone that they allow there 13 year-old to see it. They WILL have nightmares. Either that or they'll never want to watch another video again. Especially if they just find it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Brilliant,"This is the first movie that truly terrified me, I couldn't even finish it completely when it first came out.The movie is filled with bizarre visuals and amazing effects. Also, it has a beautiful atmospheric tone to the entire thing. A blue-ish hue with rainy/foggy weather. It really sets the tone.What a beautiful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"As good as the first, but just.","As scary movies go, it's not bad in spite of taking a very creepytheme - death by videotape - and making it PG-13 material.  Whichmakes me want to rant on WHY this one made a PG-13 rating inspite of its thematic content and yet a light romantic comedy likeKissing Jessica Stein received an R. but I'll abstain.Comparatively, this version is more engrossing than the Japaneseoriginal (1997) and although it does flesh the original script out abit, it still fails to live up to its creepy theme - that a supernaturalpresence is killing people by having them watch a videotapedpicture puzzle riddle.  The Japanese version depended too heavilyon the metaphysical and internal struggle of its heroine (and herclairvoyant ex-husband) and as a result it doesn't pack much of anemotional punch.  The American version brings more of that innerturmoil to the surface and we are able to follow along as she tripsand stumbles and figures her way through this nightmare.The production values are all good, particularly with re: to thevideotape itself and the collective imagery it holds.  It's a well-shotmovie, and the DOP deserves kudos for a job well done.The performances are all fine, and the story is full of possibility, butthe delivery is lacking and could have been much better.  I blamethe director, Gore Verbinski, who has failed to live up to hispotential before (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt).  In what otherprofession can a man make millions by being mediocre?Naomi Watts deserves better material than this, as does theunder-used Jane Alexander, who makes an appearance here asan island doctor who may or may not have a clue to what's goingon.I think, in greater hands, this might have been an excellent filmgoing experience.

12 years and I still get scared!,"I dare you to watch this movie and not be afraid of your own TV a week forward. Or at least look at it with caution. As if it would betray you. As if you are afraid to happen to see something you shouldn't have seen.It doesn't matter how many times i see this movie, the atmosphere of it gives me the chills every time. The performance is flawless from everyone involved. It does not rely on cheap jump scares or shaky cam or the recent find footage trick. The find footage in the movie is actual find footage and is important to the story.Many horror-movies tried to copy its formula for the years to come. Iwould say that even paranormal activity was inspired by it. All fails to comparison to the ring. Only one that came close was the grudge.I've never seen the original Japanese version, but I never felt the need to do so after watching the remake, simply because I was satisfied and scared at the same time.

Unraveling of mystery adds to appeal of film,"One aspect of this film that I particularly liked was how the main character unravels the mystery:  by studying the tape,  going to the internet, newspapers, hospital records, the old farmhouse, etc.  This was so well done so you felt these were real clippings, real records.  The photos of the lighthouse, the horses, Ann Morgan, the snippets of text in the articles were haunting.  The music adds to this.   This reminds me a bit of ""Blowup"" where a photo is searched to find a killer. Another eerie investigation takes place in ""Angel Heart"".   Also in The Shining, Nicholson discovers the history of the hotel by looking at old articles in the basement. The viewer becomes as obsessed with the history as the characters in the films do. In The Ring, one is left wanting to see more of the history to explain what has happened.  I could have had another hour or so on this investigation side of the film.  This was a really classy horror film.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting,"A smooth mix between scary horror and put together piece by piece criminal thriller.I most admit, it was quite scary. And the feeling was enhanced when I was walking home that night, pitch black, thick fog and alone in the north part of Sweden.As a film I don't fancy it. Lame actors, no extraordinary sounds, no deep. Not anything remarkable about it.But as a horror film; a little masterpiece. Excellent editing. The flashes in were the corpses are revealed are genial. A very good way to scare the audience, indeed. The picture loses little of it's supernatural charm in the end, but that is typical. Not many movies are good and amusing right through.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Superb!,"This stunning American adaptation of Japanese novel ""Ringu"" bucks the horror movie trends of jump-scares and torture porn in favor of creepy, muted atmospherics and hypnotic psychological chills. Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger move the setting to Seattle and the San Juan Islands, which Verbinski films in gorgeous, washed-out grays and greens occasionally punctuated by sunlight and blood, both of which are used sparingly. The effect is to make the film seem almost black & white, like the videocassette recording that kills you a week after you watch it. Naomi Watts leads a superb cast as the journalist investigating the unexplained death of her niece and perfectly combines both the grit and determination of an intrepid reporter and the growing fear and desperation of a mother trying to protect her child from a malevolent force she can't completely grasp. Happily, the movie doesn't try to wrap everything up in a neat package -- it gives you enough information for its central themes and mysteries to resonate hauntingly, but doesn't try to explain away every last detail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Watch it for the atmosphere and the brain shut,"Is this remake of a Japanese film scary? It depends. Depends on how much you care about the plot and characters because even the scariest of scenarios will fizzle if the character does something stupid. On the other hand this is a atmospheric film with a strange, scary vibe(thanks to Gore Verbinski). To describe The Ring, two adjectives leap to mind: spooky and lame. The former refers to the tone and atmosphere, which are about as good as it gets for a ghost story. The latter refers to the storyline, which is about as poorly constructed as can be imagined - a sad amalgamation of irritating contrivances and gaping plot holes that defy even a generous attempt to suspend disbelief. And, while I normally appreciate open-ended motion pictures, The Ring takes things too far by leaving about 75% of its questions unanswered. This isn't an artistic choice; it's screenwriting sloppiness, and it results in a profoundly dissatisfying experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Is it just me or is this movie just okay...,It is surprising to say this movie didn't really scare me. The Ring is about a woman who comes across a video tape that seems to be causing the deaths of people who die seven days after viewing the tape. It's probably my own fault I waited too long to see this movie. I have seen so many horror movies that this film didn't really scare me. However that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It has a good story and some really effective imagery. I was not scared but I was pretty creeped out. In my opinion if you have yet to watch this film and if you are easily scared watch it. But if you are not easily scared watch this with a group of friends so they can get scared and you will have a good time with it. It does have its ups and downs but it was an okay horror movie.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"OK, well I found it scary!!!","It seems to me that if you have seen the Japanese version of ""The Ring"" the new American version isn't scary at all, but as I haven't I found the movie effective in every way. The build up of tension was perfect. Not a scene went by when I was on the edge of my seat simply waiting for the next scare to come. I have no idea how I am going to manage to sit through the Japanese version when I spent half the film saying 'f**k, f**k, f**k' over again as I waited to be scared out of my head.The best performance of the films came from the youngest members of the cast. The portrayal of the haunting Samara Morgan played by Daveigh Chase was outstanding and paired with the performance of David Dorfman as Aidan Keller the two seemed to both spark in a way that is rarely seen in such young actors/actresses.Overall I found the film haunting and moving in ways that I didn't expect. Not only was it a horror story about an killer video tape, it was a story that explored the relationship between mother and child in both the case of the Keller's and the Morgan's. You should see this film simply for entertainment purposes.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant and shocking!,"THE RING is my favorite horror movie of all time for many reasons. It is a remake of an excellent Japanese horror film named RINGU. I love both films and own both DVDs. Now since there are so many reasons why I love THE RING, I'll organize all the things I love and the very few things I would change about this brilliant and creepy film. But first let me give you a short version of the plot: after the death of her niece, investigative journalist, Rachael Keller finds a strange tape that her niece apparently watched one week before her death. The rumor behind the tape is that if you watch it, you will die seven days later.THE INTRO: The introduction to this film is very smart. At first it seems like a cheesy teenage slasher flick. But that my friends is a trick. After about 3 minuets into the film you realize just how mature and suspenseful of a film this really is.THE CHARACTERS: The characters of THE RING are great. Rachael Keller is the perfect journalist. She's very inquisitive and smart; she certainly does allot in this movie and keeps the plot going. Also Rachael Keller is a great mother; she puts her own life in danger so she may save her son. Noah Clay is sort of a comic relief, he's sarcastic and stubborn but is also very smart. Noah helps Rachael solve the mystery of the cursed tape. Aidan Keller is the son or Rachael Keller, Aidan is quiet and wise beyond his years, he was very close with his cousin before she died a mysterious and horrible death. The character list goes on so I'll skip ahead to the villain. Samara Morgan is the antagonist in this film, and boy what a villain. The secret to Samara's past is a sad and brutal one, which would explain the things she does through out the film.THE STYLE OF HORROR: I love horror films like THE RING. THE RING is very unique in it's style, it is filmed like an Asian horror film; full of flash backs, creepy imagery, nightmares, mysteries, and hallucinations. It's very bizarre and surreal at times, which isn't very out of place since this is a supernatural horror/thriller. If you ask anyone who has scene THE RING ""which scene do you remember the most?"" they'll probably tell you ""the closet scene!"". This is referring to the 2 seconds of footage of Katie, dead in the closet. This scene is the biggest jump scene in the film. There are a lot of different types of scares in this film; jump scares, suspense, shocks, chills, and intense terror!WHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There is very little I would actually change about this brilliant horror film. In fact, there is only one scene, the climax. I guess I would like one that's a bit longer. The climax in this film is still satisfying but I definitely wouldn't mind a longer one.THE ATMOSPHERE: Atmosphere is something I highly prize in any film, but especially in horror films. It's industrial in some places and fantasy-like in others but it's always tinted green or blue. It's almost always raining and the settings are all very nice. The settings go from Seattle to the forests of Washington to a fictional island and beyond.In conclusion I would like to once again say that this is my personal favorite horror film of all time. I highly recommend this movie to any one with intelligence and an imagination. THE RING is an amazing horror movie, a cult favorite now and a cult classic in the future, a blockbuster, and so much more. The critics loved it and so will you, trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Disturbing and Genuinely Creepy.,"""The Ring"" is about a woman named Rachel Keller. She lives with her young son, Aiden in their Seattle apartment, and holds a job as a journalist. She comes upon the story of a bizarre video tape with strange and frightening images. Supposedly, if you watch the tape, the phone rings, and you die seven days later. She is a little skeptical at first, until she begins investigating the death of a teenage girl who died seven days after watching the video. She heads to a cabin in the mountains where the teenage girl was staying with her friends, and comes upon the video itself. After watching it, sure enough, the phone rings. Now a believer in the tape's mysterious power, Rachel begins to uncover the mystery behind it before she becomes the next victim - and she only has seven days to save herself and her son.A remake of a Japanese horror movie, ""The Ring"" is a well-made American retelling of the unique, creepy story. Naomi Watts delivers a great performance as the heroine, and does it quite convincingly. The video tape displayed in the movie is really creepy, loaded with all kinds of gruesome images and bizarre things. I really liked the plot of this movie, it was rather original and creepy, aside from all of the unoriginal, dime-a-dozen horror flicks that are carted out constantly. The film may seem to drag a little for those who are so used to the fast paced slasher films, but if you pay attention it's actually quite interesting.Naomi Watts leads the cast as Rachel, and is believable and empathetic - both good things for her character. David Dorffman is her mysterious but intelligent son, and Martin Henderson is Rachel's ex-husband/friend. The cast performs well and all was believable. One thing notable about this film is it's disturbing and vivid visuals, which are really great looking and add the movie's spooky and strange atmosphere. There are plenty of bizarre and scary sequences in this film, mainly in the video tape itself and the horrifying backstory behind it all.Overall, ""The Ring"" is a pretty good horror movie, not perfect but very good for sure. I found it to be pretty creepy, and very different from most horror films out there. Definitely see it, it's sure to scare you even if it's the slightest bit. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great story but.....,"Gonna keep this short. What the Japanese version Ringu (1998), the meaning of water for Japanese people, the way it was shot, symbolism and the over all plot development is, to this day, is phenomenal. Dated yes, but can stand up on its'own.Sadoko in the Japanes version is just freaking scary. Those who have seen it, know the well scene can scare the living daylights out of viewers.Nevertheless credit is due to the American version where the lead female character Rachel, played out by Naomi Watts is more fleshed out and modernized. This may be a cultural thing, but the Japanese Reiko Asakawa comes across as submissive to her male counterpart.The ring a a great movie and the pacing is well constructed, but if you have seen the Japanese film first, than you may end up not liking this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Awwh the famous ""nothing happens movie""","Verbinski also makes sure that he doesn't ""show"" you anything either. That's ok when a horror film is actually good and scary. The movie basically feels like a two hour trailer. Just a lame attempt at a horror movie. Naomi Watts is a great actress and it's a shame that she was forced to star in this. She does the best that she could with the material. The pace is tedious, too many convenient plot devices and too many stupid character motivations. Most of The Ring is just unforgivably boring. The film starts to finally have somewhat of a decent build up of interest and tension starting at the last 40 minutes, then proceeds to have the stupidest conclusion possible. No real onscreen violence or scares. Definitely would not recommend. I heard there is a part 2. Not even remotely interested.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Very scary, but leaves you with lots of unanswered questions","Without doubt, I can call this movie the scariest to hit the theaters this year. A must-watch if you're a fan of horror movies.

Those last ten minutes in the movie changed the rating I gave it from a 9 to a 7. Those last 10 minutes without which the movie would have a near great ending.Walking out of the movie with a heartbeat that slowly returns to almost-normal, you think back about the images that the movie left you with in your head that will haunt you for a couple more days, and all the unanswered questions that you hear everyone around you ask. Where did that videotape come from? Who shot it? Who is the little girl? How did the old man know about the tape? How does the little boy know everything? Why did they decide to call the movie 'the ring'? Why didn't they use pictures of David Hasselhoff to create some of the scary party in the movie? Why do the Germans love him so much?A strong 7.5/10.

Exceeded expectations!,"For a long time before watching this movie, I assumed a PG-13 rating on a horror meant that I wouldn't be scared or entertained enough while watching it (an assumption started by the AWFUL Lazarus Effect), but The Ring actually changed my mind, and I've enjoyed many such movies since seeing it!As a 1997 kid, movies from the early 2000s always scare me the most. I don't know if it's how they're filmed or what, but they always seem to take me back to the easily-scared days of my childhood.I might recommend watching The Ring with a little energy left in the night, not RIGHT before bed, as it's more of a drawn out horror than some and might leave you drowsy. All the same, I was entertained throughout, and surprised at how creeped out I felt!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Please get ahold of the original.,"There are not many cases in anything that where a copy/remake is as good as the original. The main reason I think is that the original gives you an experience that you never had before. That is why I would be tainted haven seen the original Ring. Ebay rules! (Don't get me started on Battle Royale.) The thrill is gone, somewhat.  I will say this about this American version. I was suprised that it stayed with the slow buildup of the original movie. It did not try to get really exciting until it was necessary. I think it is hard to get an audience to stay with a film when it has such a buildup, especially post slasher quick fright films, like Halloween,Friday 13th, Nightmare.. Scream etc. The 10's are reserved for the Rosemary's Babys, Exorcist and the like. This movie is not in that category. But there are 2 aspects that are. 1. Rick Baker is a bitch. The little that you saw of his work in this movie substantiates his title as best in horror make up. 2. The music by Hans Zimmer was mesmorizing. It was in the same league as Tubular Bells of the Exorcist.  It was so good, I stayed, as I usually do anyway until the end of the credits, just to hear the music; I mean that was just f**king scary.

Quite good!,"Me and my friend were talking about horror movies and he suggested this one and it was quite good!The story itself - I guess - is similar to many of other horror stories and movies. I actually thought that the end of the movie was when she 'rescued' the girl from the well and you see the reporter with her love interest sitting on some old bench. OK, so she did a good thing - 'heard' the little 'evil' girl and now that the wrongdoing is kinda redeemed, everything can be as before. I was wrong! That is the beginning of the twists that happen in the last 6, 7 minutes of the movie and last two minutes being the ultimate twist!I liked that the movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end. I did not expect the ending to be what it was! Actually, at one point I thought that the little evil girl is now grown up ( not dead or in the mental institution) and that it is the girl who moved to the apartment of the reporters ex love interest ...I did expect however the drawings of the kid to be explained. Especially the last ones he was drawing on the floor - the big black hole. But it was not. There were too many drawings circulating in the movie with not really clear connections or purpose - at least, I believe. So, I do wonder what they all mean and above all why the faces of the girls / people were blackened / distorted.

A good mystery story with scares,"Greetings from Lithuania.Rewatching ""The Ring"" (2002) recently in 2024 I discovered to a bit of my surprise of how the story of this movie actually is.

Too many unanswered questions!,"If u wanna just watch a movie to get your adrenaline pumping, then it's okay if u watch this. Because other than a little thrill, there's nothing in this movie. Good thing about this, is that it has some scary scenes which will give you goosebumps. A big thumbs up for the makeup artist. Costumes were mediocre. Writing is shit(maybe it's better in the original version), and directing is okay. Acting is also okay, although I expecte more from Naomi Watts.
 
Throughout the movie I had so many questions! I kept thinking ""why?"". You will know what I'm talking about if you've watched the movie. Well, it was 2002 when it was released, and it's 2018 now, so there will be a lot of difference between the horror movies made now and at that time.

Not bad at all!,"I've been a fan of the original Ring (Ringu here), and sure The Ring doesn't meet up to the quality of the original, but this is still a solid horror movie and an adaptation if you want to compare.Ringu drew the horror with its intense mood (rather than shock/jumping scenes), and The Ring doesn't fail at doing it either. Acting is solid, and the music is as creepy as the original. It is definitely a ""different"" type of horror movie than the traditional American ""slasher"" films, and I'm sure both horror movie fans and non-horror movie fans can enjoy (and be scared) this film.The downside is that the plot was almost as I expected, leaving me with nothing new to take away. I guess its unfair to judge it this way, since it is an adaptation, but I did hope that the director would add some kind of change that made The Ring distinct from Ringu.Also, I felt that the presence of Samara was very toned down compared to Ringu. In Ringu, Sadako was an angry girl that I would wet my pants upon meeting, but in the Ring, Samara seemed almost like a sad girl with a sad past and no more. I'm sure other people would disagree, but at least the character of Samara did leave me with less fear for compared to Sadako (which was borderline traumatizing). But in either case, fans of American horror films would most likely feel a lack of impact that the main villain would leave, compared so lets say Freddy Krueger.Otherwise, its still a solid movie. I suggest anybody to watch it for a taste of so-called J-Horror adaptation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling.,"Having seen the Japanese version,its tempting to compare the two. But I prefer to think of them as two parallel stories in the same world. Which you prefer, is up to you. Honestly, for me, its this one.It starts with your classic Slasher scene: Two teenage girls in a big empty house basically outline what to expect in the coming movie. But before that scene is over, its clear that this movie defies expectations. More than that, it manipulates them.The imagery in it is really chilling. I'm talking insomnia inducing. Ever scene is surgically crafted to freak the hell outta you, and boy does it work. Our every fear is manipulated (long painful death, claustrophobia, bugs, being forgotten.) and I defy anybody not to be shocked at a particularly brutal scene involving a horse. The film looks unique, somehow washed out and hopeless, even in broad daylight.The effects are well done, but just subtle enough so that you are never really quite sure. Did you see what you think you did? Did she really look like that? Did she make the right choice? And thats the beauty of the film. You're never quite sure about anything. The lines between the heroes and villains are very blurred. And the one time you are sure, you're then proved very wrong.But the movie is really made by two scenes in particular. One, is the rightly lauded ""Money shot"", where the...villain, I suppose, appears. I saw it 5 weeks ago, and that still freaks me out. You have to see it to believe.The other is the last scene: Poignant, moving, and somehow the most horrifying of the whole film.Don't go alone. Or perhaps it would be best...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A haunting mystery,"""The Ring,"" directed by Gore Verbinski, is a chilling horror film that blends supernatural elements with psychological suspense. The story revolves around a cursed videotape that causes anyone who watches it to die within seven days. Naomi Watts stars as Rachel Keller, a journalist who investigates the mysterious deaths linked to the tape, only to find herself entangled in its deadly curse.Watts delivers a strong performance, portraying Rachel's determination and growing desperation convincingly. The film's atmosphere is drenched in eerie visuals and a haunting score that amplifies the sense of dread. The use of muted colors and unsettling imagery creates an oppressive mood that lingers throughout the movie.One of the film's strengths is its ability to build tension gradually, relying on atmosphere and suspense rather than cheap jump scares. The narrative unfolds like a mystery, keeping the audience engaged as Rachel uncovers the tragic backstory of Samara, the girl behind the curse.However, some may find the pacing a bit slow, and the story occasionally veers into predictable territory. Despite these flaws, ""The Ring"" remains an effective horror film that leaves a lasting impression, making viewers think twice about watching strange videotapes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Why so many good reviews ?,"Very surprised at all the good reviews and high ratings. The movie is full of suspense. But horror? No way, there was no horror. Just suspense. Even that would be fine if the story was strong enough. But it was not.A story was cooked up without an end to it, without a solution...just an open ended flick. The story telling was nice, but yet looked like a figment of imagination since there was no end to the story. The movie doesn't address Why, How, and What of the story. Creating emotional upheavals by putting children in danger and not giving a closure is the worst a story teller can do.So this movie has been nothing more than a jumble of random events. To me this was not worth the watch.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of only three great horror movies,"I always love to see a good horror movie. Almost always I am disappointed. There are very few movies in the genre that I really like and think `A-Ha, that's a good scary movie'. Some of what qualifies usually under this genre I don't think as `horror/scary ` movie (like the six sense and psycho). I hate slasher movies. I loved `the others' but as a good `ghost story' that is lightweight. There are only 3 memorable scary movies for me: The Exorcist (of course, #1), `Angel Heart' (underrated, not many people saw it even though it had Robert DeNiro and Micky Rourck) and now `The Ring'. Here is finally a movie that is creepy enough, close enough to home, and has one original new scary though and scene thay you will remember forever.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good enough remake.,"Congratulations Hollywood for seeing that Japanese horror movies make money. I think I'd like to believe I speak for everyone when I say that you milked the cash cow a bit too much over the years. But I enjoyed The Ring. The American version explains more than the Japanese original and goes a bit deeper into the reasoning of the main antagonist.A bunch of students return from a retreat only to die a horrible death a week later. An investigative journalist thinks this story goes a bit deeper. She finds out that they all watched this videotape that kills you seven days to the minute you view it.Would you believe an idea like this? I felt like there was something missing from the American version. I couldn't be drawn into the suspense and terror that existed in Japanese. I think they did an excellent job in introducing Samara.

I felt it had a ""Sixth Sense"" feel to it though, the eeriness and the plot. The only flaw I can find in the film is the way in which it felt unfinished at the end. The story-line throughout did not fall into place at the end, although I am aware they may be leaving that for The Ring 2, but all the same. I'm a regular cinema-goer and enjoy most films, from Shrek to Lord of the Rings to films like The Ring and would give it 6/10. It's well worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Any fan of horror movies must watch!,"If you love to be scared silly without any vulgarity or gore, this is a great film to turn to. I am an avid horror movie fan and I just ADORE this movie. Horror movies don't usually scare me, but after viewing this one I couldn't sleep for a week. And since it is basically clean except for a little language here and there and some scary images, anybody above the age of maybe 10-12, depending on if they scare easily, could see this film (maybe more or less.)The film revolves around Rachel, who finds a mysterious tape that supposedly kills anyone who watches it a week after viewing it. When she watches it, she has just one week to find out how to break the deadly curse. Worst of all is that her son Aidan and Noah, her ex husband, father of Aidan, have also viewed it. But with the help of Noah, she is determined to put a stop to this once and for all.I give this movie a 10/10 rating, because it creeps me out in a classy, psychological way, rather than gross and unnecessary things.

"a remake with its own impressive, terrifying perspective that works","Coming back to The Ring, having (unfortunately) yet to see the original Ringu or Japanese Ring features, it is most involving and absorbing as an effort of a filmmaker who takes the materials of convention and forms them into terrifying shapes. It's all about ambiance, really, and director Gore Verbinski doesn't take any of this in a silly manner, or one that he would want us to think is too silly. It's about a video tape that when watched in seven days the viewer of said tape (a series of images not unlike a master's class at a university in gut-wrenching and eye-tumbling surrealism) will die.The characters in the ring investigate this, and come upon some familiar tropes of the ghost story and of things like sentience (I got a particular feeling and connection back to the Shining, no pun intended), but Verbinski's intent is to grip the viewer in a story that keeps to itself very well, is filmed without the gimmicks of, for example, Michael Bay's productions of remake-horror crap, and features actors that can make us believe this material. As with other superior ghost-story horror movies this decade like the Orphanage, it appreciates what is possible in just lighting a room, in letting a character take time to see things and experience them in a visceral manner so that we can as well, and Verbinski and his write bring on images that are inescapable (i.e. the horse on the ship, the girl crawling out of the TV and going across the room).It's a crafty piece of slick Hollywood horror, and it's intrigued me enough to go back to the unseen source material, which is the best a remake can do aside from its potential re-watchability. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This Movie Is All About Goose Bumps,"I swear this movie has a Chinese origin, remake or Japanese. I knew it. Tell me about little drowned girls undead in a wet dark well - I was hit the hardest.The DVD cover claims ""the best since the Sixth Sense"". Technically it is very good, clean straight horror, no hanging parts there. However there is an important difference. Sixth Sense speaks a powerful humanity, ghost or not, a palpable longing for living that is very sad and beautiful. The Ring has some good moments - the island, lighthouse, a mysterious pall reminiscent of Hitchcock's Vertigo. But it's mostly about a kind of pure, wantom evil, that after the paralyzed state I start to want badly to fight back, tooth and nail, come what may. As of the moment, millions of worms are squirming on my screen(in the DVD extra). My hair is still raising but the scare is giving way to rage, sort of. Strange to be so worked up. Rachel, handles herself admirably 7 days up to her scheduled doom, but the film detracts greatly with the end.

"Be afraid, very afraid.","I saw The Ring (Gore Verbinski, 2002) yesterday.I went by myself to the cinema, leaving my fiancée at home by herself (knowing that the movie would be far too much for her). I was almost an hour early and waited upstairs, staring blankly at a large TV whilst watching the trailers of countless movies to come. The hour passed swiftly and I was soon inside the cinema theatre, seated happily in my usual spot (yes, I'm one of those sad people that always sits in seat B12). No popcorn, just a half full bottle of cherry coke. The movie started ominously. The Dreamworks' logo crackled. Glee. Joy. Happiness. I'm a Ring fanatic.The original (Ringu, 1998) by Japanese director Hideo Nakata, chilled me to the bone. The sequel (Ringu 2, 1998) and prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) were equally potent. They're all members of that fading school of horror cinema in which blood makes almost no appearance (or if present, is a catalyst to the atmosphere, rather than a tool overused by the director to weed out the squeamish). I must admit at this point that I have not seen the Korean remake Ring Virus (1999) also known as Ring, but am planning on getting it from Hong Kong when I can scratch up enough cash to buy a few more oriental horror movies. It's high on my list.Back to the Hollywood English-language remake by Gore Verbinski: I was positively thrilled. He was almost entirely faithful to the Japanese version, but fortunately he also added to the entire Ringu mythology with certain elements. He anglicised others, changing the name Sadako to Samara for instance, and used Western imagery instead of Oriental. He added nice elements of symbolism such as the burning tree, the stagnant water that seeps through the floorboards and under doors, the entire equestrian idea, and others. Fortunately, they all worked well. Gore Verbinski did however add a little gore, taking a bloodless film and adding the odd writhed, decomposed body - a rare occurrence, granted (there is far less gore in this film than in the mainstream Se7en, 1995), but one that Nakata did not use. My feelings about this are quite mixed, but as a whole, I think I liked it.The best way to look at the 2002 remake version is to quite simply look at it as an entirely new film. If you do this, you will not be disappointed. If you look at it in the context of the Japanese versions (and Korean, I imagine), you will find this a thrilling appendix to the Ringu mythology. Either way, you will enjoy it. Unless you are part of that large group of people that actually ran out of the theatre half-way through the film yesterday afternoon. That is always a good sign.Personally, I found that the English-language remake version was as strong, if not stronger than either of the other sequels, but still remain adamant that the original Ringu is both more potent and horrifying than any of its offspring. This is the only horror film in which I have seen myself obliged to switch the light on to watch (I own Ringu, Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 on DVD). The final Sadako scene in Ringu is the most frightening, terrifying, chilling and unreal scene I have ever set eyes upon. Samara's final scene in The Ring is almost there, but this is where I must loudly voice my disapproval of Verbinski's handling of this scene: He cut it with the Rachel's car scene, dispelling in my eyes the uncut, continuous horror of Samara's appearance. This is in my eyes, the single flaw of the Verbinski version.I would recommend this film to all the horror fans out there. This is without a doubt an unforgettable movie and it will hopefully lead you onto a desire to watch the Japanese and Korean versions. Do not see this if you have even the slightest heart conditions or are easily spooked. You will run out of the cinema. Another word of warning: This is not an easy film to watch; it demands your entire commitment to the story and especially the atmosphere (the soundtrack is amazing). Do not watch this film (or its forefathers) on DVD whilst munching popcorn and chatting with your friends. This is not ""Watch over the weekend during a Horror movie marathon"" material. Your attention is required from beginning to end, switch off the light, pull out the phone cord, close the doors, and be afraid. Be very afraid.I shall now go and build a little shrine to Ringu.

Ring Me Up Baby!,"This movie has to be an ultimate classic, the way that they used an innocent girl and made into a grungy well crawler was magnificent.

"Interesting concept, ultimately flawed","This movie has a very intriguing concept behind it, but it's ultimately flawed pretty badly.  The main problem is that most of the characters and situations are forced to the point where they simply can't seem realistic or natural at all.For one, take the kid in this movie.  Not only is his character completely unbelievable in the way he acts and talks just like an adult and expresses zero emotion, but he really wasn't even a neccessary part of the movie. He's not the exception either: Hardly anybody in this movie is really a believable character.  First there's the mother who seems rather callous towards her son and is always never-too-flustered that she is going to die in a matter of days after watching the videotape.  Then there's Richard who seems to react to strangers in a completely random and unexplainable fashion.  And then there's Anna and Samara who seem like they're pulled straight out of a German fairy tale or something.  In fact...the only character that seems somewhat realistic is Noah.The ending of the movie leaves a lot to be desired too.  Yes there's a plot twist, but it comes off as more of a cop-out than any attempt to seriously explain anything or bring closure.

Very Americanized in a good way,"I admit the American Ring is very faithful to the Japanese original one as I've seen the original one as a Japanese. Though it was very interesting that I didn't feel scared much comparing to the original one. That might be simply because that I knew the story already, but I would say the expression of horror is very different from Japaense way. As Japanese horror tends to hide the most scary part and let viewers expand their imagination to get scared, American version is more revealing the part you should get scared. The depiction of mother and child is also bit different and seemed very American to me.I thought it must be very hard to translate this Japanese way of fear into American way, but I think this gets really well translated in the end to the understandable Americanized version of the Ring. I could enjoy the movie as a totally new version.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Alot of movies leave me wondering well what about that or this, not this one.  The ring thoroughly explained every question that I had or would have had.

Creepy but not totally satisfying,"A Seattle newspaper reporters (Naomi Watts) cousin dies seven days after watching a video.  The video contains grainy, weird, frightening images and, after viewing it, you get a phone call saying ""seven days"".  Seven days later, you die.  Watts hears this but doesn't believe it.  She gets a copy of the tape, views it, then the phone rings...The plot is intriguing (and based on a 1998 Japanese film).  Also the movie takes itself very seriously and there's (thankfully) no stupid comic relief. Also Watts gives a powerhouse performance as does David Dorfman playing her really creepy little son.  There's no gore, very little blood and the scares are mostly quiet ones.  I usually love horror movies like that.  This one just misses the mark.The plot is way too intelligent for its own good (I got confused by the end).  It throws in a very frightening twist at the end that I didn't buy at all, and leaves lots of loose ends hanging.  Still, for 99% of the way, it works.

"Unnecessary, irrelevant","Take ""Ringu"", make it visually slicker, overexplain plot elements that don't really matter and remove the paranormal explanation and you have ""The Ring"". The moviemakers involved in the remake had the laudable idea of taking the near-perfect original plot in new directions, but all their initiatives fall flat by the 75th minute. In-depth character development is not a necessity in a genre movie, just a brief explanation will do. I can't blame the American team for trying to dig deeper, but their new ideas don't hold water and go nowhere. The actors don't even sound like they believe their own lines in a few scenes.There are some great moments in ""The Ring"", but they were integrally lifted from the Japanese version. The way the story unfolds in ""The Ring"" may seem unoriginal to someone who has already seen ""Session 9"", ""Stir of Echoes"" and M. Night Shyamalan's work, but that would be unfair since all those movies were obviously inspired by the J-Horror wave of the late nineties, which arguably culminated with 1998's ""Ringu"" (although I hear the recent ""Dark Water"" is brilliant). If you thought ""The Ring"" was good and if you don't mind sub-titles, do yourself a favor and seek out movies by Kiyoshi Kurosawa (""Cure"", ""Seance""), Hideo Nakata (""Ringu"" 1 and 2, ""Dark Water""), Masayuki Ochia (""Hypnosis""), Takashi Miike (""Audition"", ""Visitor Q"", countless others) and Higuchinsky (""Uzumaki"").",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is probably the best supernatural horror film of all time.,"I first saw The Ring in 2006 while house sitting alone one evening. After seeing it in their DVD collection I decided to watch it to overcome boredom.Without really saying anything about the movie, it was a very disturbing experience all the way through, and after it finished I realized I had made a mistake to watch it alone in the dark at night for the first time. It was the most terrifying horror movie I had ever seen, with psychological effects lingering hours and days later. I was unprepared for what this film was about, which is why it affected me very deeply and I needed time to recover. I've watched it a few times since, and while the experience isn't as impacting as the first time, it's still an effective psychological film.This type of horror is definitely not for everyone though, because it's a rare moment of cinematic excellence that can really affect the viewer. With that said though, the filmmaker and crew did an excellent job. I never encountered a film like this before or since, and even compared to the original Japanese film, Ringu, The Ring wins hands down.I had hoped other films would raise or surpass the bar this film set. But in 15 years I've yet to see it. As a result, I believe this film will continue to remain among the best horror films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie stays with you...,"The weirdest thing: this movie is not all that scary. Well, it is. But not the ""scary"" that most American audiences expect, with decomposed-faced ghosts popping up, grabbing your ankle, weird noises in the wall. Nope, this ghost hardly makes any appearances at all. There are one or two jump scenes, but nothing that will really freak you out. What makes this movie so scary is the sense of impending doom, like a black raincloud hanging over your head, ready to burst any minute. It's the kind of fright that hasn't been successfully made since The Sixth Sense or even Psycho. Hardly anything is shown, but everything else is shoved in your face to make you think that you saw everything that you didn't really see. And that's what gives you nightmares.What's also creepy is that it's not your everyday plot: psycho killer on the loose, or even boy who can see ghosts. No, this plot has been weaved and woven to the point where only those with enough patience are able to sit down and unknot the plot until they can go ""oh! now I get it...."" but just like fractions, that's not the end. There's back story and after story and clever twists and turns and meatballs every now and then.So if you're interested in a good psychological ghost thriller, grab a trustworthy pet to cuddle and a glass of water and, contrary to what many critics say, watch it alone! It's juicier that way and will have you leaping backward away from your television set faster than you can say ""seven days.""My take: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Why another remake?,"Why another remake?Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Ring, a relatively good quality remake of the classic Japanese ""Ringu"". It was rather faithful to the original, made good use of atmospheric elements as well as providing a good setting for some fairly good acting. But, unfortunately, it was incapable of keeping the viewer's attention focused on the atmosphere and had to rely on what I deem cheap camera fast-panning tricks (*rapid movement* followed by ""Boo, are you scared yet?"") and gore (blood/decomposing bodies), something that the original had none of, which leads me to believe that Hollywood is incapable of making a horror film that will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat without the use of these two rather amateurish features.This film does make me wonder why everytime a quality film is made in a non-Hollywood studio, America always has to vandalise this original piece of work and attempt to Americanise it by remaking it into a white-Caucasian, adrenaline joyride. Are our colonial cousins incapable of savouring an original piece of work in its original form? Or is this simply a testament to a fast-food culture where reading subtitles is simply too much effort?Anyway, I'm getting carried away once again.

Scary and eerie with what you'd expect out of a film like this but The Ring is an overall failure of forced horror.,"The idea that you watch a video tape, receive a phone call and then die within a week of engaging in these two events is an interesting idea but at the same time, not that scary  what is it that's going to cause you to die that is so scary you can't get medical or authoritarian help? But that's what The Ring is; a film that doesn't rely on character logistics or 'what should be done in that situation' but rather relies on eeriness and uncanny things to get across its scares.I will not deny that The Ring is scary because it is a very unnerving and creepy film  although there's no violence or gore, I was still finding myself looking away from the screen once or twice but I realised afterwards that this was due to the fact I had absolutely no idea what it was I was dealing with in the film. If you were to make a ten second film of someone opening a creaky old door, going inside to a pitch black room whilst all the time having eerie music playing over the events and really dark lighting over the images, you'll probably find your audience looking away merely because they don't know who any one is, why what's happening IS happening and what's going to pop out at them. This is The Ring to a tee.The Ring is a horror film that takes a detective route and the character of Rachel Keller (Watts) takes on the detective role in a rather tired way. The introduction to the video tape in question is a very brief and rather crude way of setting up the events  no, I don't believe that fate would have one girl mention 'the tape' literally minutes before the other girl would succumb to its curse and no, I don't believe that characters at the funeral would be able to free roam their way through the bedroom where the death happened since it should be a crime scene, but there is no help in the form of authoritarian figures, remember? This is a world without police and the FBI to investigate strange occurrences which is ironic because at times, The Ring does feel like an episode of The X Files.Once it's established that this tape exists, The Ring turns into a film that relies on its breaking of everyday rules to crank up suspense. I mentioned the bedroom/crime scene occurrence which shouldn't have even happened because people wouldn't have been allowed up there. Also, the car ferry scene where a horse bolts from its carriage due to Keller's presence; again, it shouldn't have happened because once a car ferry starts moving, passengers aren't allowed on the car deck. As it was, that scene was self-motivated by the character of Keller (who could've stepped away when the horse got agitated) and turned out to be rather unpleasant.The film consists of Keller and her sidekick Noah Clay (Henderson) attempting to solve the case of the tape whilst avoiding the uncanny events that happen in-between every now and again. These include the horse/ferry scene, the taking of a fly from the video, nose bleeds, flashing images from the video itself and a creepy Sixth Sense-come-Omen type male child who the film relies on to get most of the uncomfortable atmosphere across; needless to say it works but on a basic level. Why anything's actually scary in The Ring is because you will not have too much of an idea to what is going on. The confusing plot that only really becomes clear in the final fifteen minutes merely toils on your mind more and more as each eerie scene goes past being able to cope with the scares and with the working out of the plot is hard work. The fact the film makers have a license to include just about anything in the form of scares doesn't help too much.I found the finale of the film a little disturbing but only because Keller involves her child in a way that I didn't think was necessary in fact The Ring ends rather downbeat and more like a tragedy when it becomes clear what the motivation of the tape actually is. The Ring has its scares and maybe two jumps at the most but this is very much a case of seen it - don't need to see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
SEE THE JAPANESE VERSION!!!,"I can understand why people are so blown away by Gore Verbinski's version of The Ring. After all, american horror fans are somewhat desperate for halfway decent film making so I'm not suprised that the public has gobbled up this watered-down retread. Ladies and Gentlemen, do not be deceived.Hideo Nakata's 1998 film ""Ringu"" is the scariest, most perfectly crafted horror film ever made. It is a masterpiece of sheer terror and imagination. It is everything that the american version is not.Dreamworks doesn't want you to know that, that is why they are suppressing the release of japanese film in this country. Everywhere else in the world, ""Ringu"" is known to be the greatest horror film ever made. But, not in America. Why? So Dreamworks can take your money and shove an inferior film down your throat.Do yourselves a favor.

Good remake,"The Ring will inevitably be compared to Hideo Nakata's original, and I'd say both end up about even, with tradeoffs between the various things they add or subtract. The original's snappier pace meant fewer indulgences in atmospherics, which are in full effect in the more leisurely remake; the backstory in Nakata's film is fairly airtight while Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger don't smooth over all of their narrative potholes. But what make both films work is the same: the creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplainable, which is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films, particularly ones that come out of the big studios this time of year.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not bad, somewhat derivative","Can style make up for weak material? Only so much. Basically, it's a junior high campfire story done up as a ""Sixth Sense"" wannabe, with a dash of ""Blair Witch"" and some throw-away Hitchcock references. I give the movie credit for using scary atmospherics instead of continual gross-outs and ""Boo!"" moments, but sometimes it was just plain slow. It also dragged on too long, and I was tired of the movie and checking the time before the movie finally decided to call it a day.The Hitchcock references gave me a chuckle of recognition, but at the same time they seemed like an overly self-conscious display of style, just like the odd coloring throughout the film.If your standard of horror consists of slasher flicks, this movie is going to look pretty good, a cut above the rest. If your standards are higher, this movie will probably seem like an also-ran. The movie tries hard, but it also has too many copycat elements.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Scariest PG-13 movie I have ever seen,"After seeing this movie, I got the chills for weeks. And that's saying something because it was rated PG-13. The story line was spectacular about a girl who was murdered by a mother and used a video tape to get her revenge on society. You don't pay much attention to the acting in this film. Naomi Watt's son in the movie was very creepy however and he really stood out in my mind. The creepiest and positively the coolest aspect of this movie was the contents of the video tape like a woman brushing her hair, a ladder and a girl in a mirror. Only the ring can make the nicest things seem so horrifying. The girl popping out of the video tape and the phone ringing saying ""seven days"" helped the movie a lot too. The very beginning and the very end were the coolest parts of the movie. The only downside to this movie was that the entire movie wasn't plain horror and suspense. A lot of the movie consists of boring dialogue, but when the movie is over, I guarantee you won't even remember these stretches.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A decent thriller but certainly not that scary,"I should begin with clarify that I saw The Ring for the first time a few weeks ago. Everyone talked about it when it came out, but at that time I was only eleven years old.When I finally came around to see it I really thought it would be genuinely horrifying. Instead I was met by a dark investigative thriller that reminded me of The girl with the dragon tattoo. It would have been frightening in a cinema, no doubt about it. But come on. It is not that scary. However, the sense of unease that Gore Verbinski tries and succeeds with portraying is a rarity. The phasing is on point, Naomi Watts does a stellar performance together with David Dorfman and it's always a joy to see Brian Cox appear in a small but memorable role.My review had been different if a saw it when it came out, of that I am certain.

Mediocre remake of a horror masterpiece!,"To the untrained eye of ""John Q Moviegoer,"" this might appear to be a strikingly original ghost film, but in reality its a pointless and half-assed retelling of the scariest film ever made (with typical Hollywood ""bigger is better"" excess).Dreamworks didn't release the original over here for a reason...because they don't want people to see the superior version! Do yourself a favor, track down the original Japanese trilogy (bootlegs can usually be purchased on EBay). Not only is it scarier, but it makes more sense!Just goes to show that imagination and not money (the remake literaly cost 60 times more) dictate how scary a movie is.Fun fact: The producers of the remake saw the original and were so blown away that a 1/2 hour later, they bought up the remake rights.

The acting is good, Hayden, the little boy, I did not like him, but this movie is compared so much to the sixth sense, and he doesn't quite match Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense, but that's because Osment's role in the Sixth Sense had a greater depth.

Not bad for a horror movie,"Compared to all movies, it was better than average.  But for a horror movie, it was MUCH better than average.  It all depends what you like.If you are a fan of the horror genre, I would go see it...if not, wait until video.  The theme was the standard ""evil never dies,"" but it was done in a different way.  There are some things that go unexplained (like how Samara's thought's got on video in the first place)...I would have liked them explained, but, I am not sure it was crucial to the movie.I won't spoil the ending but I thought it would have been better if it has ended about 2 minutes earlier than it really did; I do have to say that the ending was much better than where I thought it was going to end while I was watching it.

"A top-notch thriller chiller, a two-hour freight","The ring is Gore Verbinski recent contribution to the cinema scene. Verbinski who made his feature film directorial debut with the comedy hit Mouse Hunt, and then the action comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini is probably best known for his award-winning work as a commercial director creating the iconic Budweiser frogs. Verbinski has also been honoured with four Clio Awards and a Cannes Silver Lion Award for his innovative work on an assortment of memorable advertising spots, working for companies such as Nike Coca Cola and 7-UP.The Ring was based on a novel written by Kôji Suzuki. It was originally entitled ""Ringu"" (The Ring), and was initially  published in 1989. The work was supposedly based on an urban myth. Urban legends are the most enduring, are often the most disturbing-stories of murder and mayhem happening to ordinary people that are shared around campfires, retold at slumber parties and spread through chain emails. Suzuki, who wrote the book, actually a series of novels, was once a somewhat obscure writer, but is now referred to as the Stephen King of Japan.  Japanese director Hideo Nakata brought the story to the screen in his gothic horror mystery ""Ringu,"" which was released in January 1998. It quickly became a phenomenon, spawning the most successful horror film franchise in the history of the Japanese cinema. The mainstream Hollywood film community then picked up the basic story of the ring. Ehren Kruger who attended college at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts then rewrote the story to attract the western film audience. Kruger's subsequent credits include the hit horror sequel Scream 3, directed by Wes Craven and John Frankenheimer's action thriller Reindeer Games. The new adaptation of the ring was then produced to Hollywood standard using special effects by a top production team, including Walter F. Parkes and Laurie Macdonald the husband and wife team and heads of Dream Works Pictures and two of the most active producers in Hollywood today. Mysterious videotape is killing off anyone who watches it. Whenever the victim watches it, the phone rings, telling them they have only one week to Live. A young reporter named Rachel is investigating these events, but after she and her small son watch the tape, it becomes a race against time to find out why the tape is killing everyone and how it could be stopped. The story centre around Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a young journalist with a divorced husband, Noah (Martin Henderson), and a son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Her niece was recently found dead with a look of pure shock embedded in her face as if something scared her to death. Upon Learning that her niece's three friends died at the same time, too, and hearing about a disturbing videotape that is said to kill you seven days after watching it, Rachel comes into the possession of that same tape. Now, as time grows short, Rachel And Noah race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken horse ranch and a very strange little girl named Samara.The ring is a top-notch thriller, chiller horror for a Friday night date. A successful nail bitter of a Film that rattles the nerves and the imagination. If you're looking for a jumpy Friday night of a film look no further but the Ring will not play on your mind, don't expect to remember the film in week. The shots are cliché and at times I found myself bored but the ring is successful in it's appeal it is nothing more than a two hour long fright as it's full of jumps.

Cheap scare tactics,"Having been told by everyone I know that The Ring is the SCARIEST MOVIE EVER and MADE ME LOSE SLEEP FOR WEEKS, my expectations were fairly high.  I honestly don't understand why this film has everyone pulling the covers over their heads.  It's average, nothing more, and it's cheap.  Most of its supposed horror is of the ""jarring musical chord as a door is opened to reveal a mutilated corpse"" variety.  It wasn't effective in Friday the 13th Pt. VII, and it's not particularly effective here.  Once in a while something will disturb you or make you jump - the girl lurching out of the television, or the disgusting makeup job on the victims of the killer videotape - but on the whole The Ring is inconsistent and annoying.  The two main characters were so irritating, inept and aggressively stupid I not only didn't care what happened to them, I wanted them to die BEFORE their seven-day countdown reached zero.  There's simply no reason we should care what happens to them.  The son is nothing but another incarnation of the ""preternaturally intelligent or intuitive child"" archetype we see in too many movies these days.  His connection with Samara is never explained. The ending is smug and self-satisfied and makes no sense; I could almost see Gore Verbinski (who also directed Mouse Hunt) standing up in his chair, yelling ""1 4M CL3V4R!!!1""If you want to watch a movie that's as creepy and atmospheric as The Ring tried to be, watch the vastly underrated The Mothman Prophecies.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Thrilling, but doesn't resolve the issues it addresses","The Ring is a horror movie about a video that kills people. If you watch it, you will experience hallucinations for seven days, and then die mysteriously. The movie's protagonist, a single mother named Rachel, watches the movie in the hopes of finding out what caused the death of her niece; but Rachel soon realizes that she is going to be the movie's next victim.In The Ring, we find that the video was created by a girl named Samara, an adopted child whose origins are never explained, much like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. But, while Bronte's novel shows Heathcliff's demented psyche to be the result of much harsh treatment at the hands of his adopted family, this movie shows precisely no explanation for how Samara came to be the satanic, sadistic child that the movie reveals her to be. She was adopted by a couple who wanted a child. Was this girl the creation of witches, or goblins, or Satan himself? There are hints that she is an aberration upon nature itself: her presence causes horses to go mad and pitch themselves into the ocean. Similarly, in Macbeth, the title character causes nature to go awry because, by murdering the king and taking his place, he has interrupted the great chain of being. But Samara, as far as we know, has committed no act that violates nature. She simply is a violation of nature, was born a violation of nature. Either that, or her adopted parents were extremely cruel to her, but nowhere in the movie is there evidence of such cruelty.The movie is a fantasy – televisions turn on by themselves; people's images are distorted in photographs; a mysterious phone call informs Rachel, moments after she watches the movie, that she has ""seven days"" to live (couldn't she do *69 or something to determine the source of the call?). Yet it also does a remarkable job of imitating a detective story. One by one, the odd images of the videotape are all explained by what Rachel sees in her research. Unfortunately, her research never does more than lap the surface.How, for instance, did Samara create this videotape in the first place? How did she distribute it? Why does she attack people whom she does not even know? The ready answer is, ""She is evil, it is her duty to do evil deeds."" Rachel's ex-boyfriend Noah remarks, upon examining the videotape, that it does not read like a normal tape and that its lack of a proper imprint is like a person being ""born without fingerprints."" That captures Samara to a T: she has no fingerprints. She came from nowhere, she returned to the nowhere, and she insists on dragging people with her retroactively.Samara has no remarkable effect upon anyone's personality. She has nothing to say about the real world, or how people ought to live their lives. For all practical purposes Samara is not a person at all, but simply a monster whose form happens to be that of young girl. Rachel knows she will not bring her niece back from the dead; she watches the videotape out of curiosity, and love for her niece. Five minutes after she has watched the tape, the niece is as good as forgotten, because Rachel must protect her own life. She investigates for the sake of survival, and because the story behind the tape is, I must admit, moderately engaging and it arouses her curiosity. But we watch because the evil of Samara terrifies us. Ignorance has always been the chief source of fear: the less comprehensible the object, the more powerful the fear it inspires.This focus on the concept of fear lends itself to the fact that the movie is, in the end, about a videotape. Most people in the world have little or no idea how a videotape actually works. You pop it in the VCR, and the movie starts; you neither know nor care what happens inside of the VCR. It is only the image on the television – the surface, not the depth – that matters. In our modern world of information technology, we are farther and farther distanced from the inner workings of the mechanisms that daily serve us. We want only the images, not the wires and sparks within. And so this movie asks the question, ""What happens when a videotape is possessed by a fantastical spirit? What kind of repairman do you call for that? He'd be just as confused as anyone else.""The Ring contains no redemption, or morality; it is horror for the sake of horror. Needless to say it is not the first of its kind; but it is a half-hearted attempt to be something more. My problem with The Ring is not even that the movie raises questions and fails to answer them – the questions themselves are never formed or articulated. Throughout the movie there is a loosely visited theme of families staying together, but neither Samara's family nor Rachel's family obtains the unity it deserves. ""How can we live without any love?"" Rachel's son Aidan seems to ask of the audience. Aidan alone seems determined to coexist with Samara, to live within the bizarre parameters that she has set. They are parameters we can neither see nor chart, but they are there, and Samara has provided a way to survive if you can figure out the route.There is no ""ring"" in The Ring; the title refers to something different, although you might figure it out before I did. Relationships between people end unhappily in this movie, but the evil of the videotape runs uninterrupted. Samara is, somehow, the absolute, and when the movie finishes her hold on the world has not been weakened. And although Rachel solves the mystery of Samara's effect on her adopted parents, Samara's origins remain a mystery, and the filmmaker shows no interest in solving this other, deeper mystery.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Once you've read this, you will die in seven days.","As far as remake's go, Gore Verbinski's version of the Japanese horror film Ringu is one of the rarities that are as good as the original.Based on the same premise as it's predecessor, The Ring is about a mysterious video tape that when viewed, causes the watcher to die in seven days. Reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) catches wind of said tape after her niece dies under mysterious circumstances after reportedly viewing such a tape. She then tracks down the tape and views it for herself. Then what follows is a race against time as not just to save her own life, but the life of her son who accidentally watches it.What makes The Ring stand out is it relies on genuine scares and psychological terror to strike fear into the audience. Whereas most films use the 'it's-only-a-cat' routine, there is nothing in the movie that leaves the audience screaming at something ludicrous.In terms of acting, it is of high quality, especially from the Haley Joel Osment type sprog who has a sixth sense type of ability (that's being able to see dead people for those who haven't been initiated to the genre).Verbinski has proved himself a worthy director and the movie could stand him in good stead for future blockbuster's.

Horribly Overrated,"This movie was terrible.  I can't believe the amount of hype that this movie received.  I went in expecting a movie that would be somewhat scary but all I got was a movie that was laughable at best.  Let's see, there were so many weak points, it's hard to know where to start.1. The lack of a coherent plot severely crippled this movie.  It took too long to figure out what was actually going on and the ending was a tad lame. The ending didn't really answer any questions and at best, added to the confusion.2. The lack of good acting skills also hurt this movie.  In my opinion, the best character by far was the little boy.  Everybody else was just gravy.3. The capabilities of Samara were not scary, but just so far out there that it didn't make any sense.  With the abilities that Samara was given, she should've been able to destroy everybody...weird...she didn't...4. This movie was just plain overrated.  If this is what is considered very scary, people need to watch the classics again.  To relate this movie to The Exorcist does not do The Exorcist justice.  That movie was truly scary. The Ring went for some cheap scares and it shows.In the end, this movie was pretty poor.  Too often, the standards of the general public falls when they view a string of weak movies.  This movie might be scary compared to what has been released lately, but it is nowhere near the quality of The Exorcist.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Truly Scary and high-intense thriller..,"I like this movie very much and absolutely be one of the scariest horror thriller that ever made (after the exorcist and rosemary's baby).When the first i saw the original version of japan i thought it would be better if i see the usa version.And Ooo..My GOD!It was more truly spooky,scary,thrilling and make me couldn't sleep in the night and gave me paranoid with television until Now!WOW!the director,the plot and the stars were much better than japan.even i still said that japan the best cause,they were the original version but,i couldn't refuse that usa have better film.I'm just give suggest to everyone in the world....GO TO VIDEO-RENTAL,RENT-IT AND WATCH IT!!i bet you will die in seven days...",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jon Monsarrat review:  intelligent & scary,"Normally, I don't like horror movies -- although a thriller like Silence of the Lambs is similar and OK. This one I thought might be a thriller but it turned out to be pure horror. My experience with this genre is limited, because I've always thought I've got plenty of nightmares and problems in my own life. I don't need to spend $10 to see a film that tries to emotionally scar me for life.However, since I did see it -- I must say it was thoughtful and well-done. Unlike films such as Halloween 3 or Poltergeist, where the story is basically ""Oh, they're magic so they can pretty much do anything,"" the mysteries of The Ring are partially explained and the story actually goes somewhere rather than consisting of a lot of running around.The acting, cinematography, were powerful and the film was quite scary. There is only a little gore in the film; it was definitely more cerebral and less hack-n-slash.Who should see this film:-- horror fans only, but it's worth your moneyI'll give this film a 7 out of 10, even though it really deserved an 8, just because it's not my thing personally, and for the ending which worked but created more loose ends than it tied up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I always knew my tv would get me.,"This is a very scary film about people who die seven days after watching a mysterious videotape.  It's been compared to ""The Sixth Sense"" and that's a fair statement.  Both films involve death and extrasensory perception, and both involve someone reaching out from the grave to the living.The story is about a reporter, Naomi Watts, who discovers that her niece died at the exact same moment as her boyfriend and another couple.  Upon some investigation, she discovers that all four watched this videotape together.  She tracks the tape down and watches it herself, and then the phone rings and a little girl's voice tells her she has seven days to live.I don't want to give away any more of the plot or the ending, but suffice it to say that it's a scary ride.  The mood of the film is enhanced by the spooky images throughout, of scenes where time is warped.  You're given little clues during the woman's search for what's behind the video, but the ending is surprising nonetheless.It's a good horror film.  And wouldn't you know it, about five minutes after I turned off my television set and was standing alone in an empty house thinking about what I'd just seen, the tv turned itself back on ......

Like this one a lot but why is it Cert PG ???,I just sat through a screener of The Ring. Being a horror fan i was looking forward to a blood and guts terror ride. It never really came about but the film leaves the viewers imagination to do the rest. Yes plenty of jumpy scenes and and a fairly good story line.I have heard this is going to be a PG big mistake. if thats the case there are going to be a lot of scared young kids with messed up heads in the near future.All in all its probably the best horror of the year and beats One Hour Photo and the like hands down.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling to the bone. You won't see this twice !,"As a fan of horror films, I continually keep an open mind and interest in modern horror films. At the age of 21, perhaps I should grow up? I found this film absolutely chilling, at times I had shivers down my spine and all my hairs were on end. The scene at the start is fantastic, you have no idea what to expect as the girl walks up the stairs, and opens the door. I found the most brutal image the picture of the girl in the closet at the start. This film is seriously scary, do not see it if you are easily scared. The audience all breathed a sigh of relief when the credits rolled at the end, it is that gripping. I found the storyline somewhat ambigious, the scenes are sometimes very David Lynch style, but the ending is left to your own interpretation. Read the user comments here for possible answers to your questions. The filming is excellent, close ups and meeky colours add to the atmosphere. I was reminded of the final scene in 'The Blair Witch Project,' some of the scenes stay in your head for days, with the words, 'She never sleeps ...' I also found the ending unexpected, I thought it was over, and it continued again! Overall, excellent for a scare, if you don't scare at this then I'm not sure you will ever, (do you understand?) and this one will leave you at first frightened, but later you will want to find out the answers to your questions.8/10.

Beautiful and frightening!,"The Ring is a very well-made mystery thriller. First off, the writing is very good for a film of this genre. Sure, there are some flaws in the screenplay, but ultimately, very well written with touches of drama, suspense, and mystery. Namoi Watts is a strong leading lady, and she gives a great performance here, touching on all the emotions her character should go through. A small cameo from Amber Tamblyn is great, she is truly a strong young actress. Martin Hendeson is good, but nothing special. The true standouts in this film were Brian Cox, David Dorfman, and Daveigh Chase. Brian Coz is one of the strongest older actors working today, and he does the best with his small screen time. Both David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase give two of the best child performances I have seen in recent years. Both are genuinely very creepy and mysterious.The Ring is technically perfect. Gore Verbinski is a really talented director, and he makes the film be as creepy as it is. Another aspect of the film I found to be masterful was the photography and cinematography. There are so many beautiful shots in this film. Some are scary, some are mysterious, some are just well-crafted. I think this might be the best shot 'horror' film in the last 10 years. There is so much depth and color to each shot. The film is also very high on atmosphere. It might also be the most atmospheric film of the decade, even more-so than The Others from 2001.Overall, The Ring is a beautifully shot suspense/horror film, with some really scary scenes. It is flawed, but it achieves so much. It has all the elements to become a future horror classic, among films like The Exorcist and Poltergesit.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Suspension of Disbelief factor,"This movie depends on how much you're willing to let slide.  Lotta plot holes.  Lotta stuff that just ""don't make no sense"".

Will the scary stuff outweigh the ""huh?"" factor?  You should check it out and see.  And I also think this one would be better in the theater (but I think that's the case with all scary movies.)6 out of 10 ""seven days. . """,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""You weren't supposed to help her.""","In a sometimes disappointing line of US horror remakes, 2002's The Ring stands out as bold, tense and beautifully shot. The diluted, grey-green lighting is just one of the effective uses of atmosphere within Gore Verbinski's remake of the original Japanese Ringu (the film that effectively started a globally J-horror craze).Naomi Watts is a relatable, sympathetically portrayed character who finds herself tied up in a sinister case regarding some untimely deaths and a creepy video tape. The story has a fairly slow build up of tension, unravelling each detail of the mystery for the viewer to feel a part of and follow along with. Watts is a strong character from the outset, a tough woman whose main focus is to get some answers rather than running scared.The high rise flats that Watts inhabits with her son adds a note of claustrophobia to the movie alongside the muted colours, and the use of 90s technology, with busy and cluttered offices, telephones and stocky televisions brings uneasiness in the place of nostalgia. There are some images in particular that will burn into your brain, fever dream nightmare images that only add to the feeling of ""what the hell is going on here?""The Ring has always been highly regarded as a horror and it's easy to see why. The scares may be less effective with more rewatches, but the disturbing mood and story is one that will stick with you long after you turn off your TV (but be sure to leave the room and don't look back, just in case!)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The mysterious atmosphere makes this film,"""The Ring"" is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"", which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), ""The Ring"" is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. ""The Ring"" effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's ""The Grudge"" and it's sequels.Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of ""The Ring"" and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent ""From Within"" (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of ""The Ring."" Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What a horror flick should be like,"As a great fan of horror movies, I feel that the future looks promising for this genre. During the last two years, there are two movies in particular that have made an impression on me, ""The Others"" and ""The Ring"". What they have in common is the lack of excessive gore, something that otherwise seem to be the foundation of American horror. Instead, they are creepy and scary, ie they will terrify you, but they won't make you sick.The storyline of ""The Ring"" in short: A young reporter investigates the events surrounding a strange videotape, where a few people have died a week after watching this tape. During her investigations, she watches the videotape, and immediately after receives a phonecall by someone, telling her that she have seven days left to live. This quickens up the pace a bit, and this reporter eventually uncovers what she believes to be the truth of this cursed tape - Case closed? No, there is a twist, you see... And that's about all I'm going to tell you, watch the movie if you like to know more. ;-)In difference to some of the other reviewers that consider this to be a crappy movie, my verdict is that it is one of the greatest horror movies I've seen in recent years. A simple reason to disagree with them is this - Each and everyone with an internet connection and an e-mail address can write a review here on IMDB, regardless of experience, knowledge and judgement, and I know that writing reviews is NOT easy, if you like to communicate anything more than your own opinions and personal interpretations. Some reviewers claim that every movie they've seen is either the lowest piece of crap they ever seen, or the greatest movie to ever hit the market, with a total disregard for the fact that there is quite a span between ""utter rubbish"" and ""finest piece of work ever done"". It's hard to take that kind of shallowness seriously.Thus, I rate ""The Ring"" as 8½ out of 10 - It's a great horror flick, but I don't think it's the best I have ever seen.Others have complained about ""The Ring"" as being too much of a 6th Sense-ripoff, and claims that anyone who compares this movie to ""The 6th Sense"" is doing the latter movie a great injustice. Well, on the contrary, in my opinion - ""The 6th Sense"", although a good horror flick is far from as good as ""The Ring"", as it relies more on blood and gore (all the ghosts you see are either decaying, covered in blood and gore or puking) than horror, in order to scare you. Unfortunately, blood and gore equals to horror to a good part of the American crowd, but I believe Europeans have a little more taste than that. Covering everything with ketchup is a very cheap trick, and it don't work on me. Otherwise, ""Black Hawk Down"" would be the pinnacle of the horror genre. ;-)The bottom line is this: If you like to watch a great horror flick with a creepy mood, some unexpected twists and a good deal of mystery, this is the movie for you. If blood, gore and excessive use of sound effects is what you like, I'd recommend you to watch ""Pet Sematary"", ""Night Flier"", ""Terror on Elm Street"" or some other splatter movie. ;-)""The Ring"" is a horror movie, no more, no less.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very Well Done for the most part,"For the most part this movie is very well done. Its extremely creepy in the beginning and towards the end is also extremely creepy. The acting isn't bad, Naomi Watts could have been a little bit better but she was good, the kid was creepy but at times I thought at times he was trying to be like Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense. The script was also underwritten in areas, not much but a little bit. In the end the movie doesn't end up making alot of sense. You still don't know who made the tape, but that might be explained in a sequel or a prequel.

Entertaining nonsense.,"A movie about an evil VHS cassette.  Why not? -- we've clearly run out of other ideas.  But before you ladle on the praise for originality, please recall that this is a remake of a much tighter Japanese cult-shocker.*The Ring*  is equally weighted with virtues and faults.  The actual videotape in question, which will kill you exactly one week to the minute after you view it, is itself a rather clever take-off on some of the Surrealist work of Bunuel and Dali from the Twenties  (but without Bunuel's REALLY horrible imagery, like eyeballs getting slit with knives).  An advance here is that the imagery on the tape comes alive, right through the TV:  a filmed housefly can actually be plucked off the screen, as the days ominously pass and the curse gathers strength.  Needless to say, the housefly is merely foreshadowing for much nastier  ""interactive""  horrors to come.The plot is full of holes or is otherwise incomprehensible.  The movie never considers, for instance, that a person could simply be in a place where there are no televisions when his or her week is up:  without the medium of television, the ghost isn't able to manifest itself in order to kill him/her.  Or perhaps you simply die, whether you're near a TV or not.  Who knows?  There are other absurdities, but to give them out would be spoiling things.  (For those in the know, I'm referring to the efficacy of making copies.)It's not that I require water-tight plots for my horror films -- or indeed, for any films.  But it's to be assumed that a movie without a strong plot will have many other virtues to compensate.  *The Ring*  mostly fails here, as well:  Verbinski's idea of setting a mood consists of covering the camera lenses with icy-blue filters; the cast, with the sole exception of Naomi Watts, is low-wattage and includes a Haley Joel Osment copycatter  (at one point, the kid in this movie even wears an undertaker's dark suit); and the suspense is disappointingly light, except for the splendid beginning when we aren't sure what to expect.But having said all this, *The Ring*  also avoids being completely ridiculous.  The main characters, who operate and investigate under a cloud of certain impending death, seem caught up in a psychological anguish which is unusual in a genre where sudden scares are the norm.  Self-sacrifice in a horror flick hasn't been seen since the finale of  *The Exorcist*, thirty years ago.  All in all, *The Ring*  gamely continues the mini-Renaissance of decent scary movies that began with  *The Sixth Sense*.  Worth watching -- 5 / 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Why this movie is crap,"First of all, as it was said before, this movie is a remake of the excellent Japanese movie ""Ringu"" by Hideo Nakata. I saw ""Ringu"" several years ago and really enjoyed it.

It's just crap compared to it, and above all, it's not scary an inch ! ""Ringu"" is really scary, but this remake has lost all that made ""Ringu"" so good. The work that Hideo Nakata made on ""Ringu"" is pure genius, whereas ""The Ring"" is just another bad Hollywood horror film with only a bit of originality since the story is Japanese. The music that tells you when it's going to be ""scary"" before it happens..., the same shots seen a thousand times as in all Hollywood horror films..., the roughness, the crudeness, and the gore effects that are supposed to be terrifying..., this is only a glimpse of what makes ""The Ring"" so dull and stupid. Of course if you haven't ever seen any Japanese horror film and only know the Hollywood turkeys, you may find ""The Ring"" scary, but it's nothing compared to how terrifying you'll find ""Ringu"". Watch ""Ringu"" and you'll see what Hollywood can't do and why Hollywood horror films are so pitiful compared to the Japanese ones.

Since we can't talk about originality (this is a remake), our attention focuses on the way the concept is handled. As a horror movie, it has a great idea to watch: a cursed tape, which kills anyone who sees it in seven days. Naomi Watts comes across the tape, and the story unfolds, revealing finally that such original concept wouldn't survive for long. Soon, the formula comes roaring, and you'll start to see some clichés (face it - ever since ""Shining"" we have seen endless times a creepy girl with a covered-up face that says ""you're gonna die"" or something like that). Even so, it manages to twist a little and to get some surprises. I was glad to see that they didn't repeat the ""screeching orchestra"" gag too many times, which is always nerve-challenging.

"Stylish, Disturbing, and better than 'Ringu'- a lot better (no spoilers)","First thing first, I saw ""Ringu"" about the time I first heard they were shooting an American remake. I watched it and didn't find it bad at all, just- not that good (and I love subtitled movies, so that had nothing to do with it). So it was with some trepidation that I walked into the American version of the film directed by none other than the man who made ""The Mexican.""Well, my worries were unwarrented. This movie was great. I'm a huge movie buff, especially horror movies, and none of the classicly ""terrifying"" films have ever really gotten to me. I have jumped during movies before, but I can honestly say that no film has ever really gotten under my skin until this one. I'm not sure what it was, it's not particularly scary, it just hit the right buttons I guess.After getting ""The Ring"" on DVD, I rented ""Ringu"" just to refresh my memory of it. I was immediately reminded of why I didn't like it very much, and the points were made even more blaring watching the two side by side. ""The Ring"" is very stylish, and in certain scenes/shots rather graphic in visuals (the nail through the finger) or themes (Richard's abuse of Samara). The original, which did also have graphic bits, for me, just lacked intensity. After watching both films probably five times or so I still just can't be affected by ""Ringu"", and I try.From what I've read and people I've talked to, it seems that people who saw ""Ringu"" first prefer it and people who saw ""The Ring"" first prefer it. I don't fit in either category, seeing ""Ringu"" first but finding ""The Ring"" vastly superior.

They ""went away"" and came back with her, telling everyone that she was adopted; Richard said that Anna wasn't ever meant to have a child and that Samara wasn't his child and yet we see the birth certificate in Richard's house, naming him as the father.Katie clearly took the death threat seriously, since she told Aidan about it, so what was with the joking and then ""sudden realization"" that it was all true the night she died?How did Samara manage to live in so many places for so long?  She lived in the barn, she lived in the hospital, she lived in the family's mainland home. . .  And why hasn't that tree gotten bigger in the last 14 years?Why did Aidan say all that about ""the horses keep her awake; she doesn't like living in the dark"" when he should have said, ""she's *evil*; don't help her""?  That is, of course, why Rachel couldn't drag Aidan around with her, not because she'd be exposing him to danger, but because the whole movie would have ended right then.Why bother setting up an ongoing theme of maternal love and rejection if the real message was ""she's evil and it's never going to stop""?I understand that this movie is the remake of a part of a trilogy, but they should have made this movie make sense within itself, rather than, apparently, just copying down the bits that were revealed in the corresponding movie in hopes that the American moviegoing public will foot the bill for two more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not a patch on the original,"Well, the original Japanese version of this film was fantastic! It's such a shame that the Americans decided to do a remake.... The premise of the film has been slightly changed, incorporating bits from both Ring and Ring 2. The new plot is pathetic, the in-film 'video' didn't have the mystery that the original had, and the storyline has been interweaved with irrelevant rubbish. I wasn't expecting much from this film, as most American interpretations of foreign film are dire to say the least! The use of visual metaphor, story, situation and casting were all terrible.

a real scare,"Most people I know have seen both this and the original Japanese version and concluded that the original is way better and scarier. Nevertheless, ""The Ring"" does scare .As the lead character, Naomi Watts is about as close to perfect as she can possibly be, and in such a movie it would be easy to solely concentrate on her. However, one can also be made to worry for the parts played by Martin Henderson as her ex-lover and that of the child David Dorfman.Some scenes, including the videotape itself are very disturbing. It uses such imagery and atmosphere that it's quite an intense experience to watch and I have to say this goes down as one of the scariest films I've seen. The direction was utterly unsettling it had me on the edge of my seat and left me crept out in the end. But putting a little thought on it, some elements don't make sense. This is where the film loses some points. In an effort to explain itself, the whole sense of the story is lost along the way.But disregarding that, it manages to get out of its deep well to give a real scare.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Overrated,"I wasn't terribly impressed by this film. Although it's well produced and surprisingly convincing despite it's overly fantastic premise, there are far too many contrived plot conveniences that the audience is expected to either naively accept or overlook entirely.The story involves a videotape that grants the viewer only 7 days to live after watching it. The origin of this tape is vaguely explained, but the origin of its creator is not. The audience is expected to accept--Deus Ex Machina--that the creator is simply evil, and for all intents and purposes, magic. Why the creator chooses to torment those that watch her tape is not explained. How the creator is able to kill the viewers of the tape is yet another mystery. Indeed, the mysteries build up as the movie progresses (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing these mysteries), but very few are fully explained in the end.Overall, the story is well filmed, and there are some truly unnerving scenes (my favourite involving a horse on a ferry), but there are too many unexplained plot features. Perhaps this is what happens when one builds a story around a somewhat silly premise.6 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"All in all not bad, but...","Having just seen ""The Ring,"" I will say it definitely was creepy.  Lots of nice, disturbing visuals accompanied by a shrill noises and sudden bursts of sound...Only problem was after leaving the theater I knew I'd been cheated. All throughout the film there is an impending sense that we're obviously being led somewhere, hopefully to the mystery behind the tape on which the story revolves around.  Unfortunately, it seems the film makers have taken the easy route and left out any explanation whatsoever for anything that occurs in the film.  My guess is that we're being set up for ""The Ring 2."" All I know is throughout the climax of the movie all I could think was, ""Now, why am I supposed to be scared by this?""Oh, and I figured out what ""The Ring"" was the first time we get to see the tape for ourselves...that probably didn't help to heighten the suspense.

I didn't like this movie.,"I didn't like this movie and was mad that i spent money renting this at Blockbuster and I am also angry that I ordered pizza for this movie because I thought it would be really sweet. I'll explain why this movie wasn't good to me. THIS WILL SPOIL THE END OF THE MOVIE AS I WILL MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ENDING!1. This movie was in no way scary to me. You see some dead face for .5 seconds in two different scenes throughout the entire movie. That is not nearly enough to scare me or even entertain me. Maybe if they had like their hearts ripped out or there body was taken apart and like their bodies were hanging from a wall.2. The lapses between the two so called ""death scenes"". Waiting the entire movie to kill off one character. That is simply ludacris. Maybe if you found some pictures or something in a cabin that showed the high school students who had died in the beginning.3. Aiden ,or whatever the boys name was, did some stupid stuff throughout the movie. ""I couldn't sleep!"" What the hell kind of excuse is that. And why did he now so much about the girl.If I have some more time I might go over a few other details that annoyed me. I must say the ending was a little innovative but it seemed to make two mistakes. I would of enjoyed this movie more if after Naomi Watts and Noah (don't know actors name) the movie simply faded out and the credits began to roll. BUT, this didn't happen and the ending had Noah die and then they make a copy of the take and the movie ended. Well I think that the director should have went beyond that and had something more happen. I honestly have no idea what should of happened but there NEEDED to be something else to happen after that.Oh, yeah and the horse jumping off the boat was like the funniest thing I ever saw in my life. It was like just about to clear the railing and then it's back legs hit the railing and the horses face collides with the side of the boat.

Blissful horror....,"One can safely comment that this movie is absorbing and highly entertaining..The concept that the viewing of a videotape leads to a certain death 7 days later and the struggle to prevent such demise in the meantime while time is steadily running out attracts the attention and interest of the viewer who is captured by the charm of the dark life threatening secret from the first scene and is not released until the end or long after it even...The acting is solid ,the characters behavior not always ""smart"" but believable , the visual effects convincing ,the atmosphere impressive and it maintains both the agony and the guesswork in your mind active throughout.""Im scared but i love it "" would be an accurate description of the experience. I wont reveal the exact plot but i will make a couple of general comments on it so if you belong to the category of viewers that don't wish to know anything about the storyline don't read any further.The first observation is that the actual killings are not shown while committed .This ""just before and after"" approach which is handled well gives the film a less bloody profile and effectively helps to remove of it the label of ""another horror movie"" since bloodbaths have become very much a cliché that provokes disgust but not necessarily fear. But is the movie a thriller proper? Well , if you expect at the end of it to leave the movie theatre with all the answers you will be a little bit disappointed.As in most movies that employ the supernatural as part of the explanation more questions than the ones answered are created and that for me is not a triviality.. If on the other hand you are not bothered with such approaches you can be sure that you will be in happy agony for 2 hours .It is certain that you wont regret your choice to see this otherwise impressive piece of film making. i would rate it 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"This is no tacky Hollywood cash-in horror film, this is the real thing.","It's so hard to explain the premise of The Ring without making it sound dumb, so I'll be brief and then get to why it is so good.First up though: The Ring is the best remake / reimagining / reboot or whatever you wanna call them in the last decade. Films like this and Dawn of the Dead justify the 573 crappy films that come out every year trying to capitalise on the skill and/or success of other films.The Ring starts with a mystery VCR Cassette that appeared from nowhere it seems, whoever watches it gets a phone call that whispers only ""7 days"", 7 days later something is summoned and the viewer dies, usually with a look of pure wretched terror smeared across their face.Now that sounds straightforward, and upon scrutiny we can tick off a lot of other clichés from dozens of other horror films:* The protagonist is a woman (named Rachel).* Rachel is a single mother (to son Aidan with ex Noah).* Aidan is creepily mature and emotionless.* The ghostie moves strangely, and is a girl whose face is covered in long black hair.Check. Check. Check. Checkity-Check-CHECK!""So tell me then Mr, why is The Ring any good?"" I hear you ask.Well doubter, The Ring is better than just good, but for too many reasons to explainI'll try anyway;Firstly, Naomi Watts isn't afraid to make herself look like a goose, I've seen the film a dozen times - I love the film - but I still think that it makes hardly any sense.A VCR summons a chick from a horse farm via a well in a chalet through a TV?Whaaaaa????Yet Watts is deadly serious throughout, though perhaps the furrowed brow represents the fact that she has no clue what the hell is going on. Nevertheless there is no hamming it up from anyone, even the no-name cast of randoms play it all straight up and Brian Cox in a two scene cameo is convincingly nuts.The film gives you nothing that you don't earn as a viewer, if you snooze for a little you'll miss key info, in saying that the fact that none of what happens really makes any sense anyway if you think too hard, so perhaps it might be better not to concentrate What do I know?Secondly, despite the fact that in the opening scene a young teenage girl on a sleepover is the first victim, there are no big ""Wow"" setpieces in the film. No carefully staged, well choreographed deaths with multiple fake loud noise scares and perhaps a flying cat suddenly appearing to shock you. Everything grows through Rachel's investigation, with each seemingly minor discovery building the tension and creating further unease.It's again fair to say that a lot of the unease is found through not knowing exactly what is going on, but random bloods noses and photos of flies coming to life aren't run of the mill occurrences.The video itself is also pretty creepy and most definitely offputting, with staccato imagery that appears to be randomly spliced images, some cringe-inducing. When you later see some of the actual images crop up during the film it is a little eerie.Thirdly, none of the growing unease and serious stuff would mean squat if there were no payoff to be found. The final third of the film finds everything falling into place, again there are no earlier clues and they don't join the dots so to speak, each discovery leads them to another place to look. In the end though once Rachel and Noah ""solve"" the case and breathe a sigh of relief we the audience think well that's that thenOnly it wasn't.Fourthly and finally, the real finale of The Ring gets the hairs on my arms standing on end every time. What should be hokey actually works so well that it demands repeat viewings, most horror films lose 60% of their impact after the first viewing, and a second often wraps up any loose ends from the first viewing that you missed. For real scare value there are precious few horror movies that hold up, simply because you know exactly what's coming up and the surprise factor is gone. Only this film, Session 9 and perhaps the Exorcist hold up to repeat viewings, they may no longer scare but I grin inanely in the moments prior to the reveal because I know what's coming.If you can get a newbie to watch it with you that's even better.Writing about this film is annoying, as trying to explain it only confirms the logic holes and flaws, even if you simply try to cover the early events. If you are a horror buff and you have doubts after reading the above please ignore my shambolic inane ramblings and give the film a chance, it is worth your time.This is no tacky cheap horror film, this is the real thing.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. A horror film for those that claim horror is an inferior genre and not worthy of respect. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Loyal recreation of the original,"A horror film that focuses more on suspense than bloody violence.Disclaimer: Saw this movie as a kid, scared the crap out of me.The Ring is a horror classic, no doubt about it. Yet the film plays more as a mystery/psychological thriller film than a conventional horror film. The suspense and dreariness of it all really allow for a slow burn of story development.The Ring is full of creepy imagery and disturbing storytelling. It's straightforward and will leave audiences squeamish.Leave it up to Gore Verbinski to keep true to the original RINGU film in the atmosphere, plot, and all. Yet, I found the dedication a bit closer to copying rather than an emphasis on innovation. Reworking something more suitable for a western audience or simply plagiarism?Also, I found the green, static filter over the entire film somewhat annoying. I can forgive low budget horror, but at least make it look good.3.5/5.

just wait till the end,"The movie does posses some really disturbing imagery, but the movie makers didn't rely on that, what they did was they made the story tasteful that will draw you the viewer in, the movie main plot may be ridiculous but the delivery is masterful, the cinematography and the effects were good enough and the movie delivers the chills that horror movies are suppose to make you feel.The problem with this movie will have to be the actors themselves, I felt they were not just the right set of people to have been used to deliver this movie, although Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2 and 3) directing was masterful and was able to outclass the actors poor delivery you will still notice a lax that makes you wonder how greater this movie would have been if it had been done by other actors in it.Tagged as the best Japanese Horror remake ever, this movie is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu. The films are based on Kôji Suzuki's novel named Ringu, the book is about a mysterious cursed videotape, which contains some disturbing images. After the viewer is done watching the tape, the viewer gets a call, upon which she hears a girl's voice telling the viewer that he/she will die in seven days.The movie plot is similar in foundation to that of the book, it features a journalist who is investigating the death of four teenagers, there is a weird tale going around that the death of this teenagers was caused by the videotape that they saw. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) the journalist took the tape home, and she and her son watched it (not intentionally though).Now Rachel has to race against time to save her life and her son's from a mysterious girl.The Ring was met with considerable amount of criticism but most of which were positive, it was also a financial success, production cost was 48 million and the move raked in over 240 million dollars, such numbers led to the studio making a second part to this wonderful horror movie. The sequel still bordered around the events of the first film, but it was not as good as the first.If you have not got the time to sit down to see this horror flick, maybe you should, just to get the fun of the chills, I guarantee that this movie will make you smile, smile in fear.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"creepy, creepy, creepy","I like a good scare so this was a good choice to watch alone, at night, in the dark. Except for maybe a couple scenes, it wasn't exactly scary. But the atmospheric imagery and sounds definitely give a creepy vibe.So there's this video tape which causes a person to die 7 days after viewing it. We all know that from the previews. The intrigue comes in slowly learning why the tape exists and how the people end up dead. Most of The Ring involves a newspaper reporter (Naomi Watts) researching the history of the tape, once her family comes in contact with it. It becomes a bit of mystery film, before reminding you again that it's also a horror movie. Not a mindless gore flick, but a clever thriller that aims to give you some big chills. It's one of those movies that may not be as enjoyable after the first viewing, because you know all the twists. But I definitely want to watch this one again, to see what new info I can pick up during a second viewing.The DVD has nice menus that emulate the surreal video tape shown in the movie. Unfortunately this disc is pretty lacking in bonus features (and the trailer for ""Catch Me If You Can"" feels pretty out of place). But there is a 15 minute montage of deleted scenes, which give you a little more insight into the story. There's also a hidden feature that lets you watch the full contents of the deadly video tape.

It Was Okay,"I've read a lot of reviews for this movie, most of them either loving it or hating it. I find myself in a position of liking it but not being overwhelmed by it.I won't go on about the storyline specifics. I thought that the story was very interesting, held a lot of great detail for the backstory and I didn't find myself wanting for additional detail. I think the movie sewed itself up very nicely and that nothing else was required.The acting was acceptable, it didn't particularly stand out.The actual film itself was not terribly frightening. The scariest parts were when my wife dug her nails in to my arm (she's easier to frighten than I am, apparently). Probably the creepiest part for me in the whole film was when Samara actually came out of the television screen to kill Noah. That was extremely cool. Other then that, it was wanting for any real chills or thrills. I spent most of the film calmly sipping my soda.I will say that it was better than I expected but not as good as I could have hoped. Still, my expectations for horror films have been at at an all time low for the last couple of years so that's not saying much.Overall, I give it a 7/10.

Surprisingly good,"The Ring surprised me. I have to admit, I didn't expect much. My son rented the movie from Netflix, and before I sent it back I thought I would check out a few minutes.

Some of the scenes were very David Lynch.I like a story where the characters behave (more or less) believably in unbelievable circumstances, and I think they did a pretty good job in that regard.The pacing of the movie is very good.

Bringing Japanese Horror Stateside,"Here in the United States, our horror movie culture is defined by mask-wearing, knife-wielding psychos like Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees. Over in Japan, though, their horror is much more dark and symbolic. ""The Ring"" (an adaptation of the Japanese ""Ringu"") brings that cinematic style over here.For a basic plot summary, ""The Ring"" introduces a video tape that, when watched, will result in the viewer getting a phone call telling them they will die in seven days...which is usually exactly what happens. However, when the tape is seen by a journalist (Naomi Watts) and inadvertently by her son, they become engaged in a race against the clock to try and decipher the tape's mysterious imagery and the real story behind the ring.The dark, disturbing imagery in this film is really what makes it a horror stand-out. Since we are accustomed to more in-your-face scare scenes, this oblique style proves to be even more terrifying. The young girl with the straight hair over her eyes, the well, the dead horses, and the horrifying faces of the tape's victims all add up to a cornucopia of disturbing images.""The Ring"" is also an exercise in the cerebral. Not all the answers are given up front or thrown in the viewers' face. Instead, we are forced to evaluate all the imagery and subtle clues to piece things together. To paraphrase Hitchcock, what we don't know/see is often scarier than the obvious.Overall, I consider ""The Ring"" to be a seminal horror film for fans of the genre (right up there with Halloween and Saw). Given the chance, I would have bumped the star-rating up to 4.5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

As I got home tonight I looked on my caller ID and saw the phone number 000-0000 called at 6:13 PM. 7 days, 7 rings, coincidence? I don't know. But its got me shaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Help...,"Oh My God.I went to the theater having read and heard a lot about this movie, so my expectations were pretty high.I really almost s*** my pants. I haven't been this scared during a movie since The Others. The only difference is: The Others stops being scared when the movie's over. The Ring haunted me for at least a week. Because seven days later I actually got scared again, thinking: ""Crap, at what time did I see the movie? How long do I have?"" Luckily I survived.Go and see this. Be sure to pick a date and time when the chance of being in a theater full of highschool kids is minimal. It will ruin a lot if you're a person like my who likes to ""expirience"" a movie. Children tend to resort to laughter when emotions get too big to handle.I can't say very much about the Japanese original(s), but I've heard they are even scarier, so I don't know if I'll be able to sit them through...One definite advantage the Hollywood version has though is Naomi Watts, Mulholland Drive fans, eat your heart out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Chills and thrills, but maybe just eye candy...","I just got back from an advanced screening of ""The Ring"". If there was a point to this movie, I would honestly be surprised. Although I didn't find the story line all too intriguing, I did find the acting, direction, cinematography, editing and sound design to be quite good. Throughout the whole film I felt like I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen, but it kind of left me high and dry towards the end. There are a lot of great moments where I nearly p***ed myself, so I can't really call this a BAD movie. Aren't films made to entertain?Great cinematography and believable acting kept me engaged, but I couldn't recommend this film to anyone who looks for a deep meaning when they make a trip to the theatre. If you want to be scared sporadically over the course of 90 minutes, then this is the film for you. I rate this film a 6/10... By the way, don't let the PG-13 rating steer you in the wrong direction, because this film was one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a long time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie is so creepy!,The Ring is a very creepy film with one of the most amazing plots. This is an excellent film! I never have seen Ringu but I've never been one for Asian films so I'm glad this was remade in an American version and still came out as good according to the people who have seen both films. Naomi Watts is a phenominal actress as good in this film as she was in Mullholland Drive as she adds a suspense element to her charachter which a lot of other actresses wouldn't be able to play on screen. The other actors in this film were nothing all that special though the young child actor who plays Ms Watts son in the film is a very good actor. The child villianess is as creepy as any horror boogeyman and the legend of watching this tape then dying 7 days later holds an urban legend like mythos that made this story truly terrifying.I loved the fact that even though I love horror films with excessive gore scenes The Ring was just as good without any gore in it.If you haven't seen this DO SO!!! One of the best horror films of all time! Thank you for Amercanizing a truly haunting film.***** out of *****,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Verbinski's vision reigns supreme,"When a novel like Koji Suzuki's 'Ringu' spawns films in Korea, Japan and Hollywood, it's rare to find the one made in Hollywood beats all that came before it. With The Ring, Verbinski has broken Hollywood's usual curse in this respect, and delivered a fine horror film.Fanboys often claim Hideo Nakata's earlier Japanese film based on the Ringu novel is superior, and Verbinski's film is a shallow copy. Nothing could be further from the truth. While Nakata's film is faithful to the novel, the execution was flawed by several items in my opinion. First was a low budget which limited the scope and production values severely. The most annoying however was the suspension of disbelief required with respect to the psychic powers of the ex-husband. Although common in Japanese supernatural films, Western audiences find this plot device very hard to swallow. Nakata also attempted to explain too much of the back story of Sadako/Samara and ended up losing some of the impact of the story. While the back story may have worked in a novel, it doesn't work well in Nakata's film. Finally the ending scenes of Nakata's film were perhaps the weakest of the entire movie and robbed the film of impact.I submit that Verbinski's The Ring is a superior interpretation of the original novel to the screen. Verbinski took the core elements of Ringu, transplanted it to Seattle with a much larger budget and a superior cast and overlaid a certain sense of style earlier interpretations lacked. Unlike Nakata, Verbinski deploys no deus ex machina plot devices and the key characters in the film are much more believable to Western audiences.The result is definitely one of the most original horror films in the last ten years. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best horror since The Exorcist,"When i saw The Ring first I got nightmares and every time i was on my own in the night i kept thinking about it! No film has done that to me since The Exorcist, Every other Horror since The Exorcist was totally S***E! Like c'mon how could you be afraid of s***e like Scream, I know what yo did last summer, Candyman Urben Legend 13 ghost's, Long time dead etc all those STUPID films? But i Suppose you do have sad people out there that are even afraid of their own Shadow!! The ring however was Fu**ing BRILLIANT! I loved the part where Samara came out of the well then out of the t.v set it was very freaky! The whole idea of the ring is great even tho i no its a remake. I give it nine out of ten coz the end could have been better.And even tho Samara isn't in the film a whole lot she plays a great part And Lets hope its not true and you don't find her coming out of your t.v in the near future!!!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Modern horror at its best,"After watching so many diabolical let-downs (House on Haunted Hill and Ghost Ship for a start!), it was so refreshing to finally find a modern horror film that is actually scary!  Indeed, not only did I revert to a silly wimpy 7-year-old - sleeping in the lounge with the light on for 2 weeks - but I also found it impossible to stop thinking about this film!This film worked very well for me, but I can understand why so many viewers thought it was poor.  I saw this version before watching the Japanese one or reading the book.  Indeed, neither film is very close to the book, which is a shame as I thought it was very good.  However, after seeing the Western version and knowing what the concept was all about, I thought the Japanese version was dull, slow and an anti-climax, mainly because the film was so dark I couldn't see it and because the special effects were rubbish. Indeed, Rick Baker made a much better job, which, ultimately, saved the film from being a potential farce.  However, had I seen the Japanese film first, I would probably be championing that instead!The black-and-white film quality and eerie sound effects maintained suspense right through the film.  My only complaint would be the decision to cast Dorfman as the ""cute"" kid, who looked more like the scary midget in ""Don't Look Now""!Action-packed from the start, intelligent and original with fine performances from Watts, Henderson (come a long way since Shortland Street!), and especially Cox, this is a masterpiece of modern horror.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Apparently a lot of people scare very easily,"I am on a quest: to find a movie that will truely frighten me- what does a girl have to see to scare the pants off of her? With all the hype surrounding this movie, which so many have called ""the scariest movie ever"" I was hoping to have found a truely scary movie. I did not.My conclusion from watching this movie is a lot of people are very easily frightened. What on Earth did people find so very frightening about this movie? It doesn't have a more than mildly frightening scene in it up until the last 15 minutes. Personally, I wouldn't rank it in the top 20 scariest movie, never mind *the* scariest. I should have know better than to expect it to be scary when one of the ads compared it to Rosemary's Baby, which is about as scary as 3-day-old leftovers- you know, before they go all green and moldy.However, if people thought The Ring was really scary, they should see Session 9, another non-scary horror movie that has a similar ""feel"" to it, which seems to scare some people, anyway.Don't get me wrong, though, the Ring is a pretty good movie, I'd give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10, but it's just not very scary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The kid was really my only complaint dealing with the acting, he just came off like a rip off of Haley Joel Osment's performance from The Sixth Sense.The Ring represents Gore Verbinski's best work as a director, though there was one shot that maybe a ripoff of Rear Window.

Very Well Done,"Much much better than the average movie of this type, with fine acting and an intelligent script. Starts slowly but the punch in the last half makes it well worthwhile. Drawbacks are the inevitable difficulty of child actors although the boy does his best, and the uninvolvement of the police or other authorities in grisly deaths which lends an air of unreality to the proceedings.

Hollywood Polishes Japanese Inexpensive Original,"This American remake of a Japanese inexpensive but ambitious horror, Ringu, shows what Hollywood can do in order to give a film production a better surface. The U.S. version, The Ring, arguably has a better content of the cursed videotape, with an apparent influence from the surrealism. The viewers may be more easily identified with The Ring's Noah (Martin Henderson), who is skeptical about supernatural phenomena, than with Ringu's Ryoji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who possesses an ESP. In The Ring, the protagonist's son Aidan (David Dorfman) has more significant role, in both storytelling and creating the atmosphere (wearing the archetypical Hollywood's horror-flick makeup), than the Japanese counterpart does. Several details added in the American version (e.g., a horse jumping into the sea from a ferry) deepen the backdrop, while the post-production that manipulates the pictures into a blue tone generates a chilly mood. Overall, in this case, what Hollywood offers works, resulting in making a more polished entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A classical horror movie,"I was sceptical at the begin because I was afraid of some teenage-girl-slaughtering (you know, ""Scream"" etc pp), and the first scenes seemed to direct into that way - although it kept the suspense by the haunting atmosphere of the clean, lonely house (""Shining""?).

THE RING (DIDIER BECU),"Advertised as a horrormovie with a high intelligencegrade ""The Ring"" became one of the biggest hits on the horrorvideocircuit and for those who have their doubts it arises above the average horrorstandard.

A Ballad Of Rising Horror,"Now, imagine yourself going on a camping trip with all of your friends. You're all planning on staying in a cabin for a week. While there, you come across an untitled videotape in the lounge. What harm could it hold? What danger does this present? None . . . Right? It's just for laughs, right? Your friends take it and play it in the cabin. What you all witness is terrifying beyond all imagination. Once it ends the screen turns to static and the phone rings. One of your friends pick it up, in their ear comes a whisper. ""Seven days,"" it says. Your friend, horrified, puts the phone back down on the receiver. You all have seven days to live, and why? . . . You watched the tape.""The Ring"" is merciless, or should I say -- Samara is merciless. But, then again, who's considered the villain here? Is it Samara? Her parents, Richard and Anna Morgan? Or, is it the videotape itself, which Samara created before her death? These are questions circulating around the mystery of ""The Ring"", which is a ballad of rising horror. It's execution is excellent, feeding the audience bit-by-bit the mystery of the cursed videotape that kills people seven days after they watch it. The color palette is dark and gray, it feels like there may not ever be hope for the heroes, and while there really isn't, for they have seen the tape, there is still a mystery to unravel. The dark colors add to this hopeless atmosphere, because as Day 7 nears, the hope begins to fade away faster and faster, because death is now inevitable. There's no stopping it.Horror films based around fictitious Urban Legends, or legends themselves seem to tend to be a lot better than the average common horror film that deals with masked murderers, demons, a little paranormal activity, and the new continuous, uninspired, cliched horror sequels that just keep churning out. This is because films like ""The Ring"" and ""Candyman"" (1992) have a lot more imagination and creative freedom to spread around their films. Of course ""The Ring"" is a remake itself, of the 1998 Japanese horror film ""Ringu"", but it is a more than worthy remake by itself. Anyhow, these films have a lot more liberty to be creative because the world has never seen these creatures or anything like them before, which is a huge positive going towards these films. In 1992 ""Candyman"" surprised audiences by being something new. Adding a new face to horror. In 1978 ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" did the same, and in the same year ""Halloween"" became a cinematic horror classic by terrifying audiences with pure evil that was embodied by Michael Myers. Then, in 2002 a new, fresh face was added to horror. One that had never been seen. It was Samara and the cursed videotape. Audiences squirmed in their seats as Samara slowly came towards the front of the screen, and then . . . Slowly, crawled out of it and into the real world. These films that surround Urban Legends have the liberty to create something so everlastingly terrifying because they are new ideas. They're something new and inventive brought into the world of horror. You watch the tape and you die in seven days.One of the most intensely disturbing parts of ""The Ring"" come when the audience is first subjected to the so-called cursed videotape. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) inserts the tape into the VCR and soon it comes to life and abstract images dance across the screen. A ladder leaning on a wall, a woman brushing her hair in a mirror, deceased horses seemingly wash up on a beach, an inferno burns a tree on a hilltop, a ring appears on a pitch black screen, and then . . . Static. The tape is over, and the entire audience has just watched it. The phone rings and on the other end comes a voice that hoarsely whispers, ""Seven days."" What makes the scene so unnerving is that it is presented in a POV (Point of View) form of the video itself. This means that the viewers are subjected to literally viewing this entire cursed tape with no cutaways whatsoever to anything else. There's no seeing Watts' reaction to the tape, and instead, the audience is all left to wonder what they have just watched. The scariest question of all is asking yourself the question, ""Was it actually cursed? Will I die in seven days now?"" It's an eerie thought, but then again the tape was extremely abstract and disturbing, so I wouldn't doubt its realism, which certainly shows that the filmmakers did a fantastic job.The standout performances are without a doubt from Naomi Watts and David Dorfman. They are put to the test with having to present a wide variety of emotions, and Watts definitely delivers with a lot of silent acting and then downright loud acting, with having to present some extremely realistic, believable emotions. Especially the cries and pleas of help for her own son, Aidan. With that being said, Dorfman does a great job as the creepy kid, Aidan, who, like many of these horror movie kids, finds himself drawing a lot of pictures in his spare time. He scribbles with pen, marker, crayon, and pencil drawings of pictures that just appear in his head. David Dorfman was also the go-to creepy kid, as he performed as 2003's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""'s own creepy kid, Jedidiah. Martin Henderson gives a good performance as Noah Clay, Rachel's previous lover, and Aidan's father. While Henderson doesn't give the greatest performance in the film, the most important thing about him here is that he is likable, because really, all the film needs is for the audience to be able to root for him, which the audience can because his character is likable. Scattered across the film are some pretty good performances, but none of them are as great as David Dorfman and Naomi Watts, which is fine because all the other performances are really well done.""Don't you understand Rachel, she never sleeps""""The Ring"" is quiet, building terror. It's a ballad of rising horror, and then, by the third act the terror is let loose. It leaves the audience terrified in their seats. In the end, what's left of this sad world that ""The Ring"" lives in? Terror for the next poor souls I guess. It's a really powerful ending that leaves a small bit of hope. The ending leaves a small ounce of hope for our protagonists, but also rightfully so, the film leaves a bit of ambiguous terror with its ending. It's spectacular, something that leaves terror in the minds of most of its audiences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not a bad remake but not near as good as the original.,"The Ring is an American remake of the Japanese 'classic' Ring  (no ""the"") that was one of the highest box-office draws ever in that country when it was released in 1998. It was widely referred to as ""the Japanese Blair Witch"" even though it had nothing to do content-wise with that film. This comparison was due to the deliberate 'novice' appearance of the film and it's surprising success with the movie-going populace.The film concerns a bootleg poor-quality video tape that is being circulated hand-to-hand amongst teenagers as a thrill game. The story goes that anyone who views the tape will die exactly seven days later. To give you ANY more of the plot would be an enormous disservice. This film is most potent when viewed without knowing any more than that.First off, let me state that the original version is FAR better than this remake. If you wish to see Ring and can get a hold of the region 3 import DVD and don't mind watching a film with subtitles, see the original. The original is not only better than the American remake but it is ten times as creepy and disturbing and fifty times as scary.That is not to say the American remake is a bad film. It's not. If I had not previously seen the original I would likely be raving over the American version. It has some clever plot rewrites that actually improve upon the original (and unfortunately a few deletions that equally detract from it). The cinematography is excellent and quite enthralling in it's 'non-Hollywood' presentation. The lack of opening credits and poor sound quality at the beginning are a masterful addition by the production team (you won't ""get it"" until after you have seen the film). The film's antagonist is GREATLY watered down (no pun intended) from the original but still remains quite terrifying. I never will understand why Hollywood feels the need to 'tone down' foreign remakes for American releases. It really won't sell more tickets since more people would likely go see a scarier better movie.The actors and actresses are largely unknowns (with a few familiar faces) but they all turn in outstanding performances. Some of the non-traditional storytelling elements are truly inspired. Unfortunately I cannot reveal them without giving away parts of the story, but they are very well-done and very clever in the way they are presented.No blood. No nudity. No profanity. Just some very disturbing imagery and a truly scary story. I would not recommend this film for pre-teens, but anyone older will likely enjoy it (or at least be scared and somewhat disturbed). It's sad that this film is not getting more of a marketing push. Even though it's a remake, it's FAR better than any of Hollywood's recent pre-packaged aimed-at-teenagers supposed-to-be-scary efforts. It also is gambling on it's ability to attract audiences by word-of-mouth. Don't be fooled into believing that a poor box-office showing on opening weekend is any indication of a film's quality (go rent ""Zero Effect"" for another good example).If you like horror films, this movie should be on your 'must-see' list. It's a fairly faithful re-make of the film that the recent Feardotcom plagiarized for most of it's ideas. This version of the film is a great treat for casual horror fans and  people looking for a good fright film who would never see the original under normal circumstances. True horror afficionados should really seek out the original. The Ring is a great film, but the original Ring (and to a great extent it's sequel, Ring 2) is a genre landmark and should not be missed by scary movie fans.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My Favorite Horror Remake!,"The original ""Ringu"" from 1998 is a horror classic that shall never be forgotten. The movie is beyond terrifying and it has a fantastic atmosphere that builds up to the horrific ending, that I won't spoil. But the remake by Gore Verbinski is, in my opinion, the greatest horror remake in cinema history and that's a very high bar when it comes to these kinds of films. Most remakes are filled with godawful characters and even worse writing for the most part. But ""The Ring"" managed to stay true to the original classic as well as throwing in its own Western spin on the story. Verbinski does an excellent job with building atmosphere much like ""Ringu"" did all the way up to the epic and famous finale. I give it a solid 10/10!P. S. I do not recommend the two sequels, as they are GARBAGE. But if you want to laugh at something hilariously bad, go ahead and check out ""The Ring Two!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Atmospheric and mysterious but not without faults,"""The Ring"" is the Hollywood adaptation of the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"", which was itself based on the novel of the same name by Kôji Suzuki. I haven't read the novel, nor have I seen the original film, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of this adaptation. My only point of comparison for this review is other genre films.In that regard, ""The Ring"" is a cut above the usual horror fare. Relying more on atmosphere than cheap shocks, the movie engenders in the viewer a keen sense of unease. The central mystery of the story is absorbing and creepily presented.The story revolves around a videotape that somehow causes the death of anyone who watches it. When a young female journalist (Naomi Watts) sets out to uncover the mystery of her niece's death she ends up being exposed to the tape's malign influence. With just a week before her appointed death, she frantically attempts to unravel the mystery in an attempt to escape her fate.While the story is interesting, the cast isn't especially impressive; that is, apart from the beautiful and talented Naomi Watts. The male lead, Martin Henderson, isn't too bad but he seems to have been cast more for looks than acting prowess. Young David Dorfman contributes a pretty good 'creepy kid' performance but his character is a little underdeveloped. The always reliable Brian Cox is a welcome addition in support but most of the remaining players are satisfactory but nothing more.Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely handled with a good understanding of building tension and sustaining mood. The visuals are often creepy and the cinematography is appropriately gloomy. The score by Hans Zimmer is also a key part of the film's foreboding atmosphere.However, while the movie does several things right, it isn't perfect. There are at least a few scenes that are like something out of a more conventional, teen-oriented horror movie. The central mystery of the story also may be a bit too obscure for some viewers. The ending also seems a bit forced to me, coming from a time when last minute twists were particularly fashionable. I also feel that the final act extends the movie a bit beyond its ideal running time.Ultimately, though, ""The Ring"" is definitely one of the best horror movies of the last decade or so.

"One time special, the VHS is better then DVD...","Me personally I found The Ring a bit creepy. But then again I let it be. I can watch any type of zombie movie that can be thrown at me. But this movie has a less then direct way of getting to you. An artistic approach to the typical what's ""behind the door"" style of suspense really lets this movie push people's senses. When the movie first starts you won't really know where there going but after the first 15 there is a defining moment in the movie that will keep you weirded out for the remainder of the film. But as it's been stated before, only of you let it be. I heard a few rumors about this film that `It's the next best horror / suspense film since 6th sense'. So I dimmed the lights except a candle or two and challenged the movie to get to me. With the DTS on full alert (Try it in Pro Logic II for the hard core VHS guru's out there). I was well surrounded by the unique yet eerie sounds this film had to offer. And let me tell you the sounds are the money makers with this film. The plot can easily be put on paper; the film can be easily watched. But if you let the sound put you in the movie... be prepared to be crept out... for a few nights. I watched this on DVD but I have a good feeling for those of you that watch it at home on a quiet night on VHS. You probably will get a little more out of the experience of this movie then the rest of us...//NYReload  (10 out of 10)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
scarey and gripping,this film was very good.  the first 30 mins are frightning especially the first 5 mins.  answering a phone after that was scarey.i got lost in the story and found it hard to understand it. but this is quite a scary movie.the tension is well built up in the first 30 mins but on the last 20 mins of the move u just dont know whats going to happen which i like in a film8/10,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best horror movies in the last decade,"This was a freaky movie that will definitely have a sequel.  It has an exciting plot and is original.  It doesn't follow typical ""cookie cutter"" type horror flicks.  While it is not as good as the Excorcist, it is not a huge distance behind.   It is the best new horror film that I have seen in years and years.   9.5 Stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very Overrated,"After watching both versions,the original and the USA remake,all i can say is that both are very overrated,im not saying they were bad movies but just to overrated,especially the USA version. Maybe the reason of this could be that,comparing to the other ""horror"" films of hollywood from the past years,like Hallowen Resurrection,Jason X,Scream,etc,almost anythyng else could be scarier,even seeing a fly pass by,and so the audiences think the Ring is so good just because is not another slasher-teen crap.The film creates a good atmosphere,but trows a lot of irrelevant plot events that made a lot of confussion,and the ""scary"" moments come more from cheap editing tricks,in a very hollywood style,when they are going to understand that especial effects don´t make a movie good?I didn´t like the ending,and the ending of both versions are similar,but in the USA version,because of all the unnecesary elements they put it in(horses,bugs,nosebleeding,puting the son of Rachel in a six-sense context,etc) the ending seems more weak that in the japanese version.Also,the face of Samara doesn´t scare at all,meanwhile the face of Sadako it´s complettly more frigthening,and when she crawl out of the TV is more convincing too. Overall,The Ring is not a bad film as it´s own,but saying that is one of the most spooky movies of the last years,again,just because the other USA horror films from the last years(Scream,Blair Witch,etc) sucks a lot that doesn´t neccesarilly make this one the ""best"" of all,just a little more good from the average,that´s all.At first,i gave it 2 stars of 4,but now i really aprecciatte a lil more this version,and after seeing that the Japanese version is not worthy of all the hype(but also not a bad film),i will give it 2 1/2 stars to the USA version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Who said this movie was scarier than the ""Exorcist""?!?!","Ok.....some of you kiddies who have seen this movie are probably not going to like this but ""The Ring"" doesn't hold a CANDLE to ""The Exorcist"". We're not even talking the same sport here, let alone the same ballpark. After all the hype and all the stories going around that this movie is as scary as or scarier than the ""Exorcist, I decided to let my daughter go out an buy it since I'm a BIG horror/Sci-fi fan. I popped in the DVD and we were on our way.  The first scene, poorly acted, by two teenagers was the first omen that I was NOT going to like this movie. I don't mind ""campy"" or ""corny"" horror movies provided that they're not hailed as ""the horror movie event of the century"" or ""The scariest movie ever made"".In any event, After the opening scene, I decided to give it a chance before leaving the room.  Well, I'll tell ya what......when she opened that door with the water leaking out from under it to reveal the TV playing that water well in black and white and the camera RUSHED at her face.....I nearly poopied in my pants!!!   (LOL).""Ok"" , I thought....""you got my attention!!""  That was ONE of the three, maybe four scary scenes throughout the entire movie.  Enter Naomi Watts.......Where did this girl/woman get her license to act!??!?!........In a cracker jack box!??!!?   MY GOD, MAN.....she was absolutely horrible! SO bad, in fact, that she ruined the entire movie in my opinion.  Ok.....so there's more bad acting.  I figure, what the heck, let me finish it because I really have to see what everyone is talking about. And besides, that opening scene was really something.She watches the tape and blah blah blah.....she tries to figure out what's going on with the death of her niece and more blah blah blah......Then there's a horse that escapes from his container on a ferry boat and jumps in the water and more blah blah blah.....THEN, she finds Brian Cox, who by the way, played in ""Manhunter"" aka ""Red Dragon"", the first Hannibal Lecter.  He's a GREAT actor and it was a pleasure to watch him. He's no Anthony Hopkins, mind you, but still a great actor.Anyway, moving right along here.......Instead of telling you what happens and giving away scenes, I'll just tell you that, overall, this is a VERY decent thriller despite the horrible acting and slow scenes inbetween the scary ones.  The moments in this movie that are scary, are TRULY HORRIFYING.  I'll give 'em that one!   There's a scene near the mid-end where her ex is watching the TV and Samara starts to emerge from the well. OH MY GOD!   That's All I'm going to say!  If THAT doesn't raise the hair off your skin, nothing will!It's just a shame that this movie wasn't done a little better. It COULD have easily been as scary as the Exorcist but the poor acting and holes in the plot prevented it.  Again, the foundation is there for a brilliant thriller/horror movie but it just didn't make the grade.  I'll give it 7 out of 10 for the really creepy scenes that were truly horrifying. I just get upset when you have all the makings of a GREAT movie and then poor acting and holes in the plot ruin it.  And as always, I hope I haven't offended anyone.

Overrated,"Many critics heaped praise on this film, some even calling it the scariest film since ""The Exorcist"". I can name several horror films that were far more scarier than this film. Is it is a good horror movie? Yes. A great one? I don't think so. ""The Ring"" is just as overrated and devoid of scares as ""The Blair Witch Project"". If you want a good scare, I suggest horror films like ""The Omen"", ""Suspiria"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Changeling"". ""The Ring"" isn't a patch on these horror classics.""The Ring"" is obviously a remake of a 1998 Japanese film called ""Ringu"", which is a much better and scarier version. I liked some things about this film--the sense of foreboding and atmosphere of the film, the background score, most of the performances. I thought Naomi Watts gave a fantastic performance, as did David Dorfman, who plays Noami's creepy young son. Brian Cox and Jane Alexander were both quite effective in their small roles. Daveigh Chase gives a chilling performance as Samara. I didn't like Martin Henderson's performance. I thought it was rather empty. All in all, ""The Ring"" is a good horror film, but its not really that scary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A new breed of terror.,"Let me preface this by saying: if you think slasher movies are horror movies, you will not like this movie.The Ring is not intended to scare you during the movie itself, first off. It's the first horror movie I've ever seen wherein the real scare is what you get out of it later. That feeling of looking at your TV late at night and just waiting.The plot needn't be explained, both because it's already been shown and because it's best to go in not knowing what's there. But what should be said is that this is a paced movie. It's not like your Dawn of the Dead where the scares are from gory makeup and chase scenes. Rather this is a movie that gets to you by breaking down the gap between the movie and the viewer, it manages to invade the concept of ""well it's only a movie"" that gives you that safety net after viewing.Trying to explain what makes The Ring so incredible is like trying to explain Stephen Sondheim to TRL pop fans. It's so different from the formulaic ""horror"" movies most are used to and is so much better made that most won't know what they're looking at, and will chalk it off as poorly done.I've purposefully said very little about the movie itself, because that's what YOU should see. But rest assured, it is incredible. From the slow beginning to the heart-stopping finish (which may be the most terrifying bit of cinema ever captured on film), The Ring is something special.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

7 days and 8 stars,"This movie feels like it is about to climax for the entire last hour and it is just unrelenting hit after hit to the gut. That could be taken positively or negatively, but here it is overwhelmingly positive.What this movie has that a lot of horror films do not is a genuinely good and detailed story that feels fresh and different. I do wish we could've gotten a little bit more background on Samara and what her deal was but other than that this was pretty A+. It was genuinely scary with a solid creep factor that didn't solely rely on jumpscares.... It was super engaging. The acting was solid, the pacing was on point and while it definitely had that ""hokey early 2000's ""vibe, it was not overwhelmingly so.I know this is a remake of a Japanese original, and I have not yet seen that, but this is obviously an instant classic in its own right and I would thoroughly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Amazing Horror film,"Let's face the facts:1) The concept was even dumber than Minority Report2) Horror films are just a mixture of drama and bad luckHaving those two things as disadvantages to the film, still did minimal harm, it's a great movie that I'd recommend to anybody.I don't generally like horror movies, and this movie was slightly too unrealistic in the sense that there were WAY too many coincidences in a row, however, it kept me entertained throughout the entire duration. The ending was a little stupid, but I guess where it left you is probably the best that could have been done, as horror movies don't often have sequels, at least none that are related to the original AND good.The Ring all in all, is a good movie and a good story, I can't say it's a good horror, simply because I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. It's arguably the best horror I've seen (that instantly comes to mind) and as much of a movie buff I am, that is saying quite little.By no means is this movie a waste of time, it took a stupid concept and turned it into a great movie.

At least I saw it at the cheap second run place.,"Movie Review for The Ring By MaxDRoger Ebert said of the movie Pearl Harbor, that is was 'a two hour movie crammed into three.' I mention that only because Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, performs a trick of time manipulation similar in scope and power. He manages to make two hours seem like four. Essentially he has crafted a test of human mental endurance: How long can a mind be subjected to the insanely boring?The Ring tells the tail of a cursed videotape that kills who ever watches it precisely seven days post viewing. Whoever watches the tape gets a phone call right after the tape ends. A whispery voice, says 'Seven days.' (It is interesting that every one who gets this call knows that it means they have only seven days to live. No one ever thinks to ask, 'Seven Days what? Who is this?). Our heroes are a divorced single-mother of a withdrawnchild-professional-journalist-torn between her career and motherhood-type, a withdrawn child who draws weird pictures and is mildly psychic, and the slacker-video expert ex-husband. The journalist is put on the case by a grieving sister confused by the mysterious circumstances of her daughter's death. 'You ask questions its what you do.' Says the grieving sister to the journalist. Great. From there on we know that at the very least the journalist and the withdrawn boy-who draws eerie premonitory pictures will see the tape. That much does not shock us. What is shocking is the fact that no one takes the news, 'seven days', too hard. We might expect this from the journalist, she is used to working with deadlines, but what about the kid? Or how about the slacker ex-husband? In fact no one really gets too worked up about it at all.The Ring begins much the same way Scream, a superior movie to be sure, did, with one minor variation. Instead of one young teenage girl alone in a big house out in the middle of nowhere, there are two. Actually there are other variations in this scene. For instance, Verbinski opted to substitute snappy dialogue with the utterly banal. He also managed to remove any tension or malice from the opening scene or any scene. We, the audience, are never scared, we are never made to jump, and we never, ever care.What is on the cursed tape? It is supposed be like someone's nightmare. However it is full of images that are not as menacing, disturbing or scary as they could be. I will not bore you with the details I wish the film had not bored me with them. Actually I will bore you with one detail. Embedded in the images are the all clues an enterprising journalist with a mildly psychic son, and a video expert ex-husband need to unravel the motives, and origin of the malevolent force behind the tape. The son however is no help at all. While he is obviously in contact with the malevolent force, and could provide some valuable information to the other heroes, he is a cliché.He is the disturbed boy who voices his deeper revelations through cryptic drawings. This means that to the rest of the cast he will only speak in sentence fragments, nods and grunts while trying hard to look mysterious and somewhat beyond.The mistake Gore Verbinski makes, well the most important one anyway, was to think he had a film more important than he really did. At the heart of this film is a Friday night teen horror flick. He misses this and instead tries to make a film that is deeper, and more mysterious. He cannot do this because he is, after all, working the script he was given. The result is a ponderous film, that tries to beat into you, with clichéd shot after clichéd shot (the film uses every cinematic convention in the horror filmmaker's arsenal), that it is a film with depth and originality. On top of that he steals from truly engaging suspense/horror films: Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Scream, The Sixth Sense. I am sure I am missing others, but I hope you will not fault me their omission. After all, about 20 minutes before the film was to roll the blessed credits, I had pulled out my cell phone and began playing brick attack.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"If you are a fan of horror movies, this is a new thing.","I love horror movies and I find it strange that there are people who tend to think of horror movies as not-realistic!!! There is no such thing as not realistic. Once a mind can imagine something, that something has officially become reality. It has logically shifted from something that didn't exist to something that exists.Horror movies have something pleasurable about them even if the same idea of people getting killed every time is being repeated. There is always the new way used for eliminating the victim and the factor which is causing the horror. This is the case with the ring, the source of horror this time is a regular video tape and here lies the originality of the idea.I am fanatic when it comes to horror movies. I love to watch them at late night with the light off and nobody is around to feel the tensity of the movie and to enjoy it more.

This movie is utter garbage, an insult to anyone with a three-digit IQ and a disgrace to the cinema everywhere.

The nauseating use of twisting plots and poor characterization is almost as infuriating as the distinctly plagiarized shots. The absurd plot makes suspending belief for `Star Trek' look easy.We are bounced like a ping-pong ball in our sympathetic expectations as audience members until we drop on the ground suffering from a bad case of futility.

My very first horror movie I have ever watch.,I really like this movie a lot due to the story and the atmosphere. The story is interesting with a journalist who is investigating a cursed videotape and discovered the story behind it. Its builds up really well throughout and the opening does a good job setting up the movie. Throughout the movie we see what the tape does to someone when they watch it and the supernatural stuff that happens to them. I like the history behind the videotape and the Morgan family which is interesting and chilling over the backstory of them. I also think the jump scares works really well due to the creepy atmosphere the movie presented here. And I found the twist to be pretty good and have a chilling climax to it.One flaw I have with the movie is that in current scenes the characters action doesn't make sense.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fine adaptation of a disturbing book,"I returned to The Ring franchise to prepare for the newest entry: The Ring 4. In 2023, I have a vision of whether the first three films in the franchise will stand the test of time, starting with 2005's The Ring.This film is the American adaptation of the Japanese adaptation Ringu, which in turn is the adaptation of the book Ring by Koji Suzuki. The premise is the same in all works: a curse falls on people who watch a cursed video cassette tape. Seven days is the remaining lifespan of the cursed.As much as these are the best known adaptations, there were others, but I didn't watch them to be able to do a comparison.I think the negative point of The Ring, as well as Ringu, is that the film fails to capture the essence of Suzuki's book, which is the investigation. Suzuki's work deals with dark and prejudiced themes that would certainly not make it into the adaptations, but the essence of the investigation that Suzuki discusses in his book is lost in The Ring. Same as in Ringu, in The Ring, the curse of the videocassette tape already exists in urban folklore, facilitating the beginning of the investigation into the origin of the tape.Another element that film adaptations have failed to translate is the tape's message. In The Ring, the tape is just morbid, whereas in the book the tape exists for an elaborate reason.Now, if we remove the comparison lens, is The Ring worth watching? The film uses good visual effects for the time. The atmosphere is dark for the entire length of the film, yet the film uses some cheap tricks. In 2023, The Ring is a horror classic that, like most classics, suffers from the fever of being a good movie that perhaps no longer caters to younger audiences.However, perfection is just a wish. The Ring struggles with forced exposure due to the inclusion of Aidan in the story, a child prodigy with psychic tendencies. Aidan moves the plot without apparent explanation, just because he feels things.The ending is as expected if you've read the book.The Ring does not reinvent horror by focusing more on the spooky factor than on the pseudoscience proposed by Suzuki, but the film is a horror classic.

Perfect,"The Ring is an eerie story about a cursed video tape that kills whoever watches it in exactly seven days. I have heard from my friends that this was a very scary movie. I thought to myself after hearing this, ""How scary could something be that could never happen ever?"" One Missed Call was laughable. One Missed Call was more of a comedy than a horror. But, The Ring was the first movie that contained many things that could not happen, but had an interesting story line from the beginning, and had you wanting more at the end.

One of the scarier movies I've ever seen,"This is a very freaky film. It's about a tape and after you see this tape, you die 7 days later. Sounds interesting, yes? So then you have Naomi Watts whose niece died from this tape and she is a reporter and decides to investigate. So it's a horror/mystery/thriller. She watches the tape and so the race is on against time to solve the mystery. She also shows it to the dead-beat dad of her kid (who also watches it on his own).There are a few criticisms I have. One is that there were too many B-movie thrills in it. Things like when the lady in the convienience store tells the dad ""You're going to die"" followed by ""from smoking too many cigarettes."" Haha. Real clever there. Then there are dumb things like when Naomi comes home the babysitter is sleeping on a couch and it looks like she's dead. There are some stupid jokes thrown in also and it seems only for the ""well we need to correct the joke-to-thrill ratio here""The other main criticism is the ending which was rather bleh. Apparently in the original RINGU movie it was the ending that made the movie but I think the ending ruined it here. Basically they spend most of the movie solving the mystery. Then after they solve it, they really didn't solve it! Wow. Then they use some lame claymation technique that looks like it came from ""Clash of the titans"" to scare you.

"I could be disappointed of it weren't so ""funny""","I cannot believe this movie made it past the director, editor, boom operator and test audience. It's what a really bad movie could be, if it tried.The most annoying being the boom mike in almost every other dialogue scene from the beginning.  It was a constant reminder I was watching a show. I could have watched it in a barn with horses.  Two that stick out prominently in my head are: The entire boom ""arm"", mike and cord in the upper right corner in the scene where Rachel leaves Noah's apt the first time and is standing by the elevator discussing poo-poo drivel.  The other goofy use of the mike is in the scene where Rachel interviews wacko at the insane asylum. Not only can you see the mike you can watch it go back and forth from wacko to Rachel during their talk.    Stink-o. The frames of the solo face shots cut off the chins in a not-art-film way and the love for her son was about a genuine as a frog and a rock.   The up side was the kid was the best part. He was a little creepy but endearing and I appreciated the dull overall color to add to the mood. Otherwise, maybe the ""deleted"" scenes that some say there are would explain the confusing David Lynch attempt they were going for.

I owe Naomi.,"I would personally like to thank Naomi Watts for bringing her considerable talent to the big screen. I was totally mesmerised by her performance, just as I was in 'Mulholland Drive'. She's got that Bette Davis-like presence which transforms good movies, which 'The Ring' definitely is, into very good ones. I cannot think of a better actress than her, and whilst films like this don't win Oscars, I'm sure she will one before long. The minute she appears, after what is already one of the best starts of any movie I have seen for ages, you're gripped, and, mainly because of her convincing style, you don't so much suspend disbelief at the plot, but actually want to believe that it's all true. There are many creepy moments. This isn't, thankfully, a gore-fest, nor does it have you jumping totally out of your seat, but it does get you on the edge of it on a regular basis. And for once, CG effects complemented the film, because at least you don't have to worry about cruelty to animals any more...hopefully! My one criticism is that it seemed to me to deliberately leave a big opening for a sequel.

Basically, this remake of the Japenese version, is more creepy than 'scary'...it doesn't have a lot of jump out of your seat moments, but the real fear stems from the chilling after effect. I watched this late one night, in the dark, and I thought it was pretty good, though not as good as I had heard, until I saw the end...all I will say is that the movie ends, and then it doesn't...kind of like The Sixth Sense.  I found the final 20 minutes to be incredibly exciting, and the end to leave a profound feeling of 'huh'?  You really have to watch the movie more than once to understand all of the story, I still don't understand a few things, but I've heard there will be two more sequels coming out, so hopefully they will shed some light on the mystery.Anyway, the next day was when I got creeped out by the movie...it may not scare you that much once you watch it, but if you start to think about it (and if you have a tv in your room), you may think otherwise.Overall, one of the better horror films to come out, though I don't really think it should be classified as a horror film.  There are some parts that could have been done better, IMHO, but otherwise, you have a pretty solid film with good acting and great suspense.  I recommend this one, but remember, this is more psychological than 'scary'.  8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Deep story. Spooky. Unusual.,"This movie didn't really scare me but what I am fascinated of is the deep story behind it! I would recommend to watch the plot about it on YouTube first, so you will understand more background information.The way the story is being told is very similar to ""The Grudge"". One person researches about the life of the antagonist and by doing that the story unfolds itself, bit by bit. In ""The Ring"" though, this happens in a much bigger extend. You get a lot more to explore and research, together with the protagonist. More people. More places. Things which are untold. And this is what makes the story even more interesting than ""The Grudge"" in my opinion.I would very recommend this movie if you are rather looking for a deep spooky story instead of a pure jumpscare-movie.

"a daring, intelligent, suspenseful modern thriller ...","I thought this was an excellent movie, and its high quality surprised me. Long before this ever came out, I was a big fan of the original Japanese version and when I heard Hollywood were doing a remake, I thought ""oh no...""However the result is very good. Okay, granted, parts of it are slow and cliched. But the good qualities by far outweigh the bad.A modern horror movie with hardly any violence or gore? Yes, that is the Ring! As a result it was panned. I think it was brave of the filmmakers to make a modern horror movie without buckets of gratutious gore. They do throw in some shock moments that are very disappointing (they're there to make the movie more scary apparently but doesn't work - mere Hollywood stereotype pandering) but for the most part its psychological suspense, not physical.It was panned too for not being suspenseful enoguh. True, there are very little action sequences. This is more like reading a book than watching a movie. It is a mystery thats all about story, and if you warm to it, then it WILL be suspenseful for you.Naomi Watts (so vastly different than in her excellent performance in David Lynch's ""Mullholland Drive"") is a great actress; and her intelligence and grace really benefits the movie. Also check out Brian Cox's cameo. This excellent actor steals the show in his few minutes of on-screen time.Compared to the original, which just went for unexplained weird, this movie makes the attempt to explain many things... which some felt weakened it. I disagree: I think it makes the movie more complex and intriguing.On a final note: the opening scene. It starts out very cliched, like the start of a typical Hollywood slasher movie (the scene with Drew Barrymore in the beginning of ""Scream"" gave birth to this): two young girls, alone in a dark house on a rainy night, one of them walking around clutching a cordless phone. I think the filmmakers were not being unoriginal, but rather starting the movie this way on purpose: making you think you were about to see a typical horror/slasher, then changing course and delivering this instead -a daring, intelligent, suspenseful modern thriller. Watch it!BEFORE YOU DIE YOU SEE ... THE RING!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Puts the horror in horrible,"Ever since I saw Ringu I was hooked on everything connected to it.  So I needed to see the American remake.  A lot of people told me it was a scary and very good movie.  The reviews talked about a must see movie. How wrong they all were. I was slapping myself all true the movie and as the story progressed got more and more annoyed with the whole thing.  Then I saw the ace actor Brian Cox and thought that maybe he could raise the level of the movie a bit. But he saw that there was no saving this movie and he quickly killed off his character in a very very strange way.  This was just one of the things that does not make any sense. This remake loses the steady pace Ringu and adds all kinds of things I still don't know what these added to the story.  What was that with the horses? Why does the kid think he sees dead people (pun intended)? Horrible movie, watch Ringu and Ringu 2 (a few scenes of which also end up in this remake adding more confusion) instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very good film with one caveat,"Loved it. Excellent Script and direction. Incredibly creepy with several memorable scenes. But if anything, I thought this movie explained too much.

Fantastic scare-fest thriller!,"Best scary movie in a long time. Better than 'Sixth Sense'. Better than 'The Others'. Some people contend that the original Japanese version, 'Ringu' is better. WRONG!

True Horror is back,"All I can say is that this movie was SCARY!!! I am a big horror buff and it really takes a lot for me to say a movie was scary. Most horror movies I like are just entertaining.The Ring does a great job with introducing you to the horror about to happen in the beginning. The questions around what has happened is eventually answered in the end, but it takes you through a maze of events that have you glued to the movie waiting for the answers.What I really liked about this movie is how it was so scary with so little gore. Sure there were scenes that made you just shudder at the sights of certain things, but no real blood and guts. I loved that.I tried to write this comment without giving out to much information about the movie, because I think viewers need to look at this movie with no idea of what is going to happen or why it's happening.

Essential 2000s horror mystery thriller,"When The Ring was new, everybody was talking about it. I believed it's just some trendy teen movie and I wasn't interested. Perhaps I also feared a little that it might actually be as scary as people say. I was more into older fantasy-type horror like Dracula and such not into current movies of the time.When I finally watched the movie I was surprised it was actually quite good. Tonight I watched it for the second or third time and it's still good. Perhaps even getting better. I'm ready to call it a 2000s horror classic.Everything in this movie works. It has that Asian style surreal weirdness that makes it creepy, but it also has a logical mystery plot that makes sense. I think the balance is good. It is a very visual film with great looking scenes. And most of all it has pretty great acting. Naomi Watts is the star. She's one of my favorite actresses and she does a excellent performance here. Without her this movie would be more average. But also the smaller roles are pretty good.I haven't seen any other Ring movie, the sequel or the original Japanese ones. Will check those out at some point. I would guess the Japanese ones are more creepy and weird, but since this version is already my favorite it probably will stay that way. Making international versions of foreign movies is a task that often goes wrong but at least this one ended up a good movie.It's quite creepy horror movie but the reason I like it so much is that it also has a very interesting mystery solving plot around the supernatural elements. It is very interesting to follow the characters try to find the meaning behind the strange video tape. But also, even if you have already seen the movie, it's still worth watching again because of the cinematography and acting. I think it's generally just a good film that is pleasant to watch. If you still haven't seen it, check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"YES!  Finally a GOOD ""scary movie""!","There are scary movies that are your typical no-brainers with silly little plots that really don't drive the movie, but rather hinder it.  These movies are purely for fun and not so much for mulling over at the water-cooler on Monday.  Then there are those scary movies that make you think...question...and ponder.  The Ring is definitely the latter.The premise:  there exists a video tape that when you watch it, you have seven days before you ""see the ring"" (ie: die).  Sounds silly enough...at least I thought so upon seeing the previews.  I will happily admit I was wrong since The Ring turned out to be one of the best scary movies I've seen in years.The acting was well done on all accounts, right down to young David Dorfman as the Keller's young son, Aidan.  The imagery is incredibly freaky and was enough to make me sleep with a light on (Not something that happens very often, mind you, having seen about every horror movie I could lay my eyes on).  The plot was good enough without the standard ""cheese"" associated with most scary movies.  I like a movie that can make you think!If you're into a movie that holds your hand throughout and gives you a neat, tidy little explanation in the last thirty minutes or so, this movie is not for you.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it DOES give you answers; but it makes you think for them.  With subtle innuendos, imagery, and whispers of conversation, the viewer is able to decipher Samara's message and the overall ""meaning"" of this thrilling ghost story.  And while attempting to understand Samara's message, she will scare the bejeebers out of you.Honestly, a very good ghost story with few ""plot holes"" (regardless of what other reviews might state...there really ARE explanations).  Overall, The Ring deserves a 9 out of 10...not quite the BEST, but quite close.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Very poorly done, Not even a hint of scary","This movie could not even come close to the comparison of the 6th Sense. The 6th Sense was very well done, had a story line which kept you in suspense.  The Ring was like a cheesy attempt at making a suspense horror film.  The events did not even blend well, nor were the PG13 rated `scary' scenes.  Perhaps if the movie were changed to a Rated R movie with extreme violence and gore; at least it would have the elements of a cheesy no plot horror flick which is at least entertaining to watch.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Interesting Movie... Interesting Concept.,"I found the film very intriguing being that the concept of this type of killer video is relatively new.  I've seen the original Japanese version of the film and find both of them delightful to watch.  The American remake added other storyline which is fine because it adds another dimension to the horror/drama.  Instead of just spirit photography, this is a form of spiritual rage video where the outcome is horrible death.  Very interesting and different.If one wants to see another movie that had to do with a kind of killer video then one should view VIDEODROME.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ringu is better,"I saw ringu a while ago and wanted for a while to see this to compare. I watched this today and whereas ringu was the scariest film I've ever seen this wasn't by a mile. Sadako is much much scarier than Samara for a start. Ringu just has a scarier aura whereas this is just like any old american horror film... ie: not very scary at all. My advice is see ringu. It is much better in every way and especially ""the scene"" (as I have heard it referred to. You'll know what I mean when you see it (well if you see ringu because the ring's version of it is lame in comparison)). If this was original it would be OK but it's not so just watch the original.

"Underrated, one of the best horror movies ever made in the US","Woefully underrated American remake of the Japanese classic. Inexplicably, more recent re-reviews claim that the movie has not dated well and / or that it relies too much on the cliches of this kind of movie and / or, stupidly, that the screenplays retention of VHS as the haunted medium is also dated. The latter reviewers clearly don't know their history, as VHS, while certainly being displaced by DVD in 2001 when the movie was made, was still hanging on. At one point in the film we are shown a pathetic scattering of VHS tapes on a shelf in a motel lobby, which, while pulled directly from the novel, which was written more in the heyday of VHS, does seem like a nod toward the impending demise of the medium.The other similarly wrongheaded reviews show a complete lack of understanding of The Ring's place in the lineage of this genre. The ring and its Japanese counterpart themselves helped define many of the genre elements these reviewers are referring to. In other words, it is the movies that came after The Ring and the classic cycle of J-horror from around that time that tap into the genre elements that have since become cliches from overuse.The Ring stands out as one of the creepiest American horror movies ever made. While there are a few minor inconsistencies with the film's internal logic, they don't detract from the overall effect, plot, or story. The acting is top-notch all around, and Hans Zimmer's score lends the creepiness additional depth.The movie within a movie - the notorious VHS - is even more creepy and atmospheric than the Japanese original. In addition, as good as the original movie is, the remake's cinematography is moody and at times bone-chillingly creepy.It's unclear to me why this movie hasn't attained classic stature and isn't ranked among others like The Exorcist and Halloween as one of the greats of American horror Cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

scariest movie I've ever seen!!!,"Hi there!!I watched ""The Ring"" for the first time a few months ago, and let me tell you, I got the scare of my life!  I went to go see it in the afternoon so that I could have a good night sleep, instead of waking up horrified from a dream the involved a gruesome little girl coming out of a tv, so that's why I went to go see it in the afternoon!When you see the movie, at first you think: ""Wow, that was freaky!"" after jumping up from your seat, but then, the movie has this way of sticking in your subconscious.  I couldn't even go by my TV at home after watching ""The Ring"" withought thinking about that little girl!  And man was I terrified! Even looking in one of my mirrors at home ( which looks like the same mirror that you see Samara's (the little girl) mother brushing her hair! No joke, it's a crazy coincidence! I almost flipped after realising it!) just gave me goosebumps!Because of that movie, I also experienced one of the most scariest moments of my life, what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth, I not just saying it so that I can make the movie look good or anything, but it's really scary, and just goes to show that the movie was so well maid, that it had that much of an impact on me!Ok, it's not that long of a story, all that happened, was that I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night (approx. 3:00 in the morning) and had a nose bleed! This was on the same week that I just watched the ring, as if it was one of those signs that I was going to die.  No this was not a dream, my brother ask me the next morning what I was doing up in the middle of the night!So anyway, very freaky!

Thank God someone still knows how to make good scary movies,"Gore Verbinski... Before The Ring I had seen only one movie from this director. I must admit that I really enjoyed Mouse Hunt and its pure old-fashioned slapstick style. But still, Mouse Hunt wasn´t the kind of a movie that would make its director a top director in the world of cinema.I´ve never bothered to watch the Mexican because it simply doesn´t interest me. I don´t remember when I first heard about the Ring, but when I read all the positive reviews I knew this was a film I didn´t want to miss. And when the movie opened in Finland some weeks ago I went to see it with my friends. And I was so glad that I catched the movie during its cinema run.The Ring is a movie that shouldn´t be watched in daylight. The best place to see it is a theatre with lots of people. If you watch it home, wait until its dark and then play the movie. And if you have a home theatre system the experience will be even better. This is a creepy movie that will scare you at least a couple of times.I´ve never been a fan of ""horror"" films like Friday the 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street. I enjoy creepy ghost stories like What Lies Beneath, the Sixth Sense, Poltergeist etc. Horror is a very difficult genre because you can easily cross the line between being scary and being funny. Take Thir13een Ghost, for example. I couldn´t even watch the whole movie because of its stupidity. That film didn´t give me any creeps at all. But luckily every now and then a good creepy movie comes out of Hollywood and the Ring is such a movie. I was very impressed by the movie´s autumnal style, dark atmosphere and performances. You rarely see memorable performances in this kind of movies.It´ll be interesting to see what Gore Verbinski´s next movie will be like. Hopefully it´ll be something as memorable as the Ring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
As good as original but in a different way,"I watched both this newer version and the japanese original in the same day. Thus, the japanese version was not as frightening, as I knew what to expect and when to expect it. If I had seen the japanese version first, though, I think I would've found that one better.One notorious difference between the two Rings is that the japanese is just about 95 minutes while the american one runs for almost 2 hours. It becomes clear why when they are compared in the same day as I did - the japanese main characters seem to have some kind of psychometric powers, i.e. the ability to see past events related to an object or a person that they touch. The american version is more true to scientific method and lets the characters find out more for themselves in a ""logical"" manner. The quote-marks I just used are of course there since there isn't much logic to be expected in this movie.I definitely love both versions, I am giving both 9 out of 10, perhaps I would give the japanese a 9 and the american an 8.5 if possible, but they are good in so different ways that they're almost two different horror movies, although you recognize most scenes and often even the camera angles and architecture of the rooms and the steps inside the houses where the action takes place!

Effective and hauntingly intriguing,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW MAY RUIN THE ENDING OF THE FILM.I thoroughly enjoyed the film, both for its spine tingiling special effects and narrative. I had expectations of a typical teen horror, as their was no star vehicle to promote the film, but I was wrong. The spirit of Samara is portrayed not unlike waht I have observed in the film Thir13een Ghosts. The seven last days before each victims death is also a poinyant number to note, like the film Se7en. There are many copycat American mainstream techniques presented in this film, but this is what makes itr original. The idea of a lonely island, with many hidden secrets, linked with diseased crazed horses and a psychotic child reveals a mystery genre.The idea of a child creating so much chaos and havoc, reveals that children are not as innocent as they seem. Bith leading protagonists in the film gave a brilliant performance, but the casting was not heavily delved into. It can easily be believed taht Naomi Watts could be romantically involved with Martin Henderson, it is almost impossible to comprehend that David Dorfman (who plays the character Aidan, son of Hendreson/Noah and Watts/Rachel) a smart, well-dressed, intelligent young boy could be the product of such a young girl. I think the character Rachel is too young to pass as a young mother.Setting aside the castiong issue, a throughly recommend the film to any thriller/horror fans of films such as Thi13een Ghosts, Se7en, Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nice compilation of the Japanese versions,"A few weeks ago I saw all 4 of the Japanese Ringu films and was very curious about this American remake. I didn't think the original was 'the most scary movie you've ever seen' - like everybody said, but I really like the concept of the cursed videotape and thought the Japanese did make a great movie. This US-version is a very good remake and also takes some information from one of the sequels. And that was what I missed in the original first movie.Though the story is just slightly different (e.g. the horses) it's the same idea. Some scenes in the beginning are literally copied from the Japanese and that is wise 'cause the scenes were good as they were. Later scenes obviously had to change because the tape was totally different from the Japanese tape (and not the same as someone here wrote).They succeeded in creating the same uncomfortable atmosphere by such small things like a fly and a bloody nose. The tension is always under the surface and is not spoiled by loads of special effects. I thought - even though I knew the story - this one gave me more creeps than the original. The scene with the horse on the ferry had my heart pound like crazy! And a big thumbs up for the cast. This is how I like my scary movies. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Easily the best true horror movie of the past 20 years,"Ever since the horror genre reached its peak in the late 70s and early 80s, it has almost completely dropped off the map. There are movies branded as ""horror"" films, but they are either crummy rip-offs, sequels, or lame ""slasher"" movies that provide no atmosphere. Or, they are psychological thriller types like Silence of the Lambs, which is a great movie but barely fits into the genre. The truly great ones have told interesting stories while frightening us with the ugly side of our nature. The truly great ones, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Exorcist, are unsettling enough to make a grown man like me have a little more trouble sleeping that night.The Ring is one of two horror movies of the past 20 years that I think are legitimately worth owning (the other being The Sixth Sense). It is a great movie for the same reasons that The Shining, The Omen, and The Thing are great movies – because it is creative, it tells a great story, and it has great atmosphere. It also features a threat that you can't hide or run away from. The monster is scary because you don't get to see it for most of the movie. When you finally get to see the ""monster"" at the end, it is a spectacular, surprise climax – one of my favorite horror scenes of all time. The Ring is highly unpredictable, and at the end, it has a meaning that is completely different from what you expected it to be. It is a movie that gets better the second time that you see it, because once you know how it ends, you notice the themes a lot better – themes that are relevant and play off of the things that we see in our life that scare us.I have seen mixed opinions about whether The Ring is better than the original Japanese Ringu. It is rare that I say this, but in this case, the remake is better. If you ask me, a lot better. Why? In my humble opinion, it is because of the outstanding cinematography and production values that this movie showcases. The vibe of this movie is ""David Fincher meets Twin Peaks"". The sound effects, especially, are fantastic. The movie revolves around a mysterious videotape that is supposedly fatal to watch. When you finally get to see that tape, we see that it is nothing but a bunch of short, black and white video clips spliced together. But boy, is it creepy, and that is because of the sound that comes out of it. It is so creepy that if you hadn't been told how dangerous it was during the movie, you would immediately figure it out on your own.This movie does have one big weakness and that is the acting. Bryan Cox is in a brief supporting role, and he is good. Naomi Watts gives a somewhat flat performance as the main character. When she has to step up and show a bit of emotion, she doesn't do it very well. For the rest of the cast, it's no-name city. Watts's son and ex-boyfriend are equally ""meh"" in their performances. I don't mind that much though, because Watts's character dominates the screen time, and she is almost a passive observer. Although she has a personal stake in solving the movie's mystery, she spends almost all of the movie just asking people questions, researching, and watching.The Ring is a movie that deserves a score higher than the one that it has here on IMDb. I would give it a 10 to try and prop it up, but it's not quite a masterpiece like The Thing. I think that The Ring suffers a bit, public perception-wise, from having started the short-lived ""Japanese horror"" fad of the mid-oughts. Creepy ghost children became old hat almost immediately, so now this movie looks like just another flick that tried to score cheap thrill points by following along. What none of the other ""creepy ghost children"" movies like ""Dark Water"" and ""The Grudge"" ever had was an interesting reason for the creepy ghost children to exist, or an interesting story. The Ring has those in spades, along with the ability to make itself linger in your mind for a long time after you turn off the TV.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ring a Ding Ding,"***SPOILERS*** At first I thought that ""The Ring"" was the telephone ringing right after one watched this crazy video tape about trees deep water wells a fly in the ointment and finally a desolate island with this strange looking woman and lighthouse with only a ladder and chair in it! All taped in grainy black and white. It came as a complete shock to me when it was reviled in the movie that anyone who watched this mind bogging tape would die in exactly seven days! I thought that anyone who was able to sit through the whole God awful video tape would have died a whole lot sooner!It's after her niece Katie, Amber Tamlyn, suddenly died of fright seven days after she saw the tape that Seattle newspaper investigative reporter Rachel Keller, Naomi Watts, decided to check what was the cause of Katie's mysterious death. As things turn out not only does Rachel track down the strange killer tape, at the country motel where Katie spent the weekend with her friends, but also ends up watching it! What made things even worse is that Rachel's six year old son Adian, David Drofman, saw the tape as well without his mother knowing about it. This set the stage for Rachel, after finding out that the tape can actually kill anyone who watched it, together with her live-in boyfriend and Aidan's father Noah, Martin Henderson, attempt to somehow find out how to prevent the tape from not only killing Aidan but also Rachel as well as Noah who, you guessed it, also saw the tape!The movie ""The Ring"" never fully explains why this weirdo video-tape has this strange power to kill anyone who takes the time to watch it! We get this half-ass story that it had something to do with the creepy Morgan family who were champion horse breeders and lived on the island depicted in the video-tape. Anna Morgan, Shannon Cochran, the strange woman in the tape is shown killing herself by jumping off a cliff on the island. Anna's even stranger daughter Samara, Daveigh Chase, the person who the video-tape seemed to be all about seems to have had completely vanished into thin air after the tape was finished. It's old man Richrd Morgan, Brian Cox, the only surviving member of the Morgan clan who seems to be the only person in the movie who knows the secret of what this off-the-wall tape is really all about. But with him being tracked down and unmercifully harassed by Rachel into having him reveal the tape's secrets he just flips out and and ended it all in grand fashion. Richard goes out in a blaze of glory by electrocuting himself with some 20,000 volts of electricity using his overflowing bathtub as the electric volts powerful grounded conductor!***SPOILER**** The movie starts to fall apart as it slowly, and I mean Slowly, lumbers on to it's shocking as well as brainless conclusion. It's then that everything goes to pieces when the long dead, it turned out that she was murdered, Samara comes back to life in both the bottom of a 150 foot empty well as well as in, and out, of Noah's TV set! By the time the film is finally over you begin to realize that not only you but those who made it have absolutely no idea what its supposed to be all about!P.S ""The Ring"" seems to have copied, even though its based on the recent Japanese horror thriller ""Riongu"", from the 1983 David Cronenberg Sci-Fi classic ""Videodrome"". The big difference between the two movies is that ""Videodrome"" despite it's complicated storyline was both thought-provoking as well as entertaining where as ""The Ring"" never even managed to get off the ground!",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Bucking the trend,"The Ring has finally bucked the trend, started by The Sixth Sense, of trying so hard to have a surprise ending that you write yourself out of a decent story. The great mystery writers of the past never lied to you about which person committed the murder, they convinced you that you didn't need to know who did it until the end of the book, this is the best way that I can explain the way that The Ring redefines the budding modern horror/thriller/mystery genre.I felt that, after The Sixth Sense, M. Night was trying too hard to do something special, and lost sight of filmmaking. This is also true with alot of lesser filmmakers who have tried to make a decent entry into this genre.The Ring may be a remake, but it is a truly original piece of work, I haven't yet seen Ringu, but boy do I plan on it now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Just amazing!,"To say that The Ring is a fantastic movie is an understatement.  The cinematography alone could have made the movie.  Fortunately for Mr. Verbinski, he also got outstanding acting from everyone in the film.  The score fit perfectly into every scene and leaves your heart pounding again and again.  It's been a long time since a movie has kept me on the edge of my seat and this film should become a classic.  Move over Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, even The Exorcist and every other film that thought they had the throne of freakiest movie.  There's a new kid in town.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Is she still in the dark place?,"After the mysterious death of her niece Katie, journalist Rachel Keller starts to investigate an urban legend about a videotape which kills you seven days after watching it. With dire consequences coming her way if she can not solve the mystery....The sentence, English language remake of successful foreign horror film has been known to instill fear of the wrong kind in many a genre fan. So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.Starring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger (adapting from Kôji Suzuki's novel) successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, because after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock theme that is driving Rachel on. So as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take a hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's the kind of impact that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.Though the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its meaty structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. However, with much relief he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up previously. The ending here works a treat, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating?What is left though is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller - come horror film. One that even on revisits manages to bother and keep one on the edge of the seat. It made an $80 million profit in America alone, ensuring that a sequel was sure to follow. Now was that one a bad idea! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great film but ending was too open ended,"This movie had tons of shock value with disturbing images, I'll give it that. It also proves that a movie these days doesn't have to have tons of gore and death to be scary. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat more or less for the whole movie. By the time it got towards the end my heart was literally pounding, wondering if she was going to die or live. One great comment I have about this movie is how it leads you on that it's over. It makes you feel comfortable by giving you that warm feeling of seeing the kid's mother and father holding hands and then cuts to the scene with the kid's dad. The ONLY gripe I really have about the movie is how open-ended the ending is. It just leaves too much out and doesn't even really give you a solid clue of what happens after the end. It doesn't even really give you enough to think about to try and form your own hypothesis. I probably would've given the move a 9 if there was more closure at the end. Still a GREAT film and I highly recommend it to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Battle of the Rings,"I've seen both versions of The Ring, the American before the original, and I prefer the American version better.  Although the Japanese version has the definate trump card of preceding the American, it's too mucked up in Japanese mysticism to really have universal appeal.  The American movie is not without its flaws, the horse branch never really plays out, and the ostensible holes, yet the tone and feel is overall more creepy.  It may go for the 'jump' scares rather than an overall feel of unease, but these jump scares linger with you for a while.  There are some truly ridiculous parts in both movies, but the Japanese scene where they decide to empty the well takes the cake.  See both because it's ultimately just personal preference that wins in this battle.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great Suspense and Tension,"I saw this movie on a sneak preview and was not expecting much. After the first 10 minutes I thought i was sitting and watching another crappy teen horror movie, but i was very wrong. This movie was perhaps one of the most well done suspenseful movies in recent memory. I never get scared during crappy horror movies, but this one had me on the edge of my seat. There was some disturbing imagery, and had scenes that were stuck in my head for days to follow. It rivals ""Signs"" as one of great suspense movies as of late, and i think even surpasses ""Signs"" in that regard. The tension is great, added even more so by a countdown of sorts. It is a phenomenal, tension filled movie that will scare the bejesus out of more people watching it. Very well done movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
does the job better than others,"i love horror/supernatural movies, rather then slasher types, because of the thoughts that it implants into your head. i saw the exorcist when i was 15 and it wasnt the movie that frightened me, but the thought that the devil could take over my body. i know it was stupid, but the movie did it to me.it is the same for the ring. the movie itself was no scarier then the sixth sense, but the thought of footage that kills you played on my mind. the dvd i watched had the entire 'real footage', and after the movie i began to watch it. the movie was so effective, that as i watched, i subconsciously looked away for a few moments at a time so i didnt watch the entire footage. about half way through i was forced to eject the dvd (on command from the brother's friend) since the footage could not be stopped. however, i will end up watching the entire footage later (i hope).the movie itself was not as scary as i thought it would be, but resembled the sixth sense quite a bit. but i recommend watching the 'real footage' alone in the dark after having watched the movie. it will give you the biggest scare of your life. another thing would be to watch it with mates, and create myths about the 'real footage' actually killing people or the rumour that the japanese version of the movie had put people into physciatric hospitals.to conclude, the thought of the ring itself is scarier than the actual movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Genuinely Disturbing,"Upon rising from the seat I had been at for the duration of the film, I felt both exhilareted and terrified. Hours earlier, I had assumed this would be some tacky, poorly put together horror film, almost synonymous with the new horror emerging from Hollywood, and not even touching various masterpieces like the Cabinet Of Dr Caligari or Halloween, unsurpassed since.A Videotape that kills people a week after they watch it ? It almost screams cheesy horror, something to waste your time one saturday evening with nothing better to do. But what emerges is an excellent mix of plot and horror and still makes the audience jump out of their seat. Like the main investigator ( reporter ), the audience learns more about the tape as she does, leading to a lighthouse and a family, all culminating in a spectacular finale.

Truly Terrifying,"Gore Verbinski (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt) has run with his first opportunity at making a horror movie and, in the process, handed fans of the genre a taught, suspense filled thriller with brains and scares. The movie opens with what has become an obligatory `opening scare' that involves two girls, Katie and Becca, scaring each other with talk of a videotape. The tape, it seems, is cursed and after the viewer watches it, he or she receives a call explaining his or her fate: death will come in seven days. Kate admits that she has seen the tape. In a scene of brilliant tension, this opener takes us through Katie's final minutes; it has been exactly seven days to the hour since she has seen the tape.We are then introduced to Katie's cousin, Aidan, and her aunt, Rachel Keller (played by Naomi Watts, Mulholland Dr.). Rachel is a newspaper reporter and, at Katie's wake, begins a search for the cause of Katie's death. Rachel learns of the cursed videotape and is quickly tangled in the mystery. Her detective work leads her to Shelter Mountain Inn where she watches the video tape and receives the legendary call. `Seven days,' she is told, and the count down begins.Rachel and friend Noah (who also watches the tape) work together to discover the origins of the tape. The hints are many and varied and, at first, don't seem to add up to much. There are horses, a lighthouse and a family called the Morgans. How they are linked and what they have to do with the videotape, I will never tell. Midway through the film, the urgency the investigation carries is increased and the ramifications of the reality of the urban legend are amplified.The movie is expertly directed. There's a drenching rain to many of the scenes and even when the weather clears up, their remains a wetness of dread. The colors are subdued except for a red that figures prominently into the story. Overall, Verbinski has shown his talent in droves here, successfully keeping the pace taught, the visuals interesting and the tensions paramount.The acting is great across the board. Some mention was made of the performance of the young boy, but I found him to be quite charming and much better than many child actors. Naomi Watts does well (even if she is handed some questionable lines) and very much shows her versatility of the actress. Her work here is completely different than knockout performance in Mulholland Dr..The only problem I found with the movie is that, taken in a series of unnerving parts, there are some moments that feel very familiar. The film borrows heavily from other popular horror films. Aside from this, however, the sum of the parts shines as an excellent horror film.This film has a long history. It is a remake of a Japanese film, Ringu, which is an adaptation of a book. I have seen Ringu and find that film to be slightly scarier, though lacking in plot. The Ring fleshes out the story and accurately recreates the impending dread of the original film. This movie is a genre fan's dream: a suspenseful, smart horror movie that, as a whole, is highly original. The Ring make no attempt to spoon feed the audience and leaves the viewer to connect the dots.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

one sleepless night later...,"I'm not going to write a review of this movie so much as tell you how it has affected me. I am and always have been a horror movie fanatic. I was raised on Puppet Master, Return of the Living Dead, Phantasm, Halloween, etc. I would say that I am pretty desensitized. I WOULD say that, but I won't because apparently I'm not. I watched this film last night with a few friends in my apartment. At the time, it seemed good and scary, just my type of movie. That was until everyone went home and my roommate went to sleep. I blame this on hormones plus it being late, but once I walked into my bedroom, my anxiety skyrocketed. I paced around the apartment for awhile before finally giving in to the possibility of some sleep at about 2 AM. Yeah, right. Radio on, door closed, no closet, lamp on and I still couldn't relax enough to get any shut eye. Every 15 minutes my eyes would fly open and I would peer around the room to get my barings. This is horrible. I have never lost sleep over a movie, and I've seen it all. All of these years I've never understood people who disliked horror films, but I think this one sleepless terrified night is all that it will take to sympathize forever. See it. It's fantastic.

Scariest film ever!!,"I am not normally a fan of horror films, for the simple reason that films generally don't scare me. I say don't normally, because this did. Some films can feel genuinely creepy and make you feel unnerved in some moments, films like Signs as a recent example, who didn't feel the blood leaving their chest when the first got sight of one of the Aliens in the Brazilian home video scene. The Ring has scenes like this throughout, and it makes you feel uncomfortable throughout the movie, and gets you really jumpy.There are big shocks and lots of little shocks and it is down to some first rate editing, directing and sound editing, as well as some unsettling imagery. The cast are all good, the gorgeous Naomi Watts is excellent in the lead and very convincing and there is a great cameo from Brian Cox, in suitably creepy mode. David Dorfman is good as Watt's son, he is a very good child actor, and in this sort of film it is essential to have a good actor for the child parts, Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense being a good example. Martin Henderson is also good playing the ex boyfriend of Naomi Watt's character Rachel.The film pans out brilliantly. From the initial opening death sequence to Rachel's investigations of the tape that apparently kills people if they watch. The tape holds within it a vengeful spirit who kills their victims seven days after they watch the tape. Gore Verbinski's version of the classic Japanese horror is excellent, and intriguing, it is how a horror film should be, it genuinely unsettled me, no film for years has done that, not even the Exorcist did.You should definitely watch this, and I hope there will be a sequel.

Scary?  Yes.  Deep?  Maybe...,"I should say up front that I am related (not closely) to the director of this movie.  However, trust when I say that any bias I have would cause me to feel more negative than positive about a film if it was not up to par. I was, frankly, quite disappointed with The Mexican, and was hoping Mr. Verbinsky would have chosen better material this time around.  In my opinion, this source material gave him the ability to demonstrate some real talent.First, the good.  The look of this film is very Fincher-esque.  The grays, the blues, the blacks, they are all used heavily.  In less capable hands, this would only convey sadness and depression.  Here, the dreariness conveys something beyond a simple, sad world.  This world is haunted.  Every shadow, every corner, every closed door seems to be hiding something.  The atmosphere it generates is perfect for this story, and doubles its effectiveness.  The soundtrack (or lack thereof) complements this.  There are no cheesy moments of thumping melodramatic compositions getting in the way of things.  It's understated and haunting, often going for creepy white noise instead of overwraught symphonies.Beyond the good looks, there is substance.  This leading lady is no pushover.  She is determined and driven, never helpless.  The remaining cast plays out well, too.  All of the cast members seem to have exaggerated features, which gives them almost the feel of a comic book, and adds to the surreal feeling of this world we're looking at.  These are not the usual horror movie flakes waiting to add to the bodycount.  These are accessible characters with real flaws but are smart enough to make you believe they have a chance of thinking, not fighting, their way out of the situation the find themselves in.  I found this quite refreshing.The scares come early and often.  This is not a slasher movie, since a large part of the mystery here is wondering what the heck happened to the people who get killed off.  You get bits and pieces, just enough to tease you each step along the way.The plot is effective, some things are very subtle and will likely not be picked up by everyone.  In discussions with others, I found that people were looking for plot holes in the wrong places.  The video, how it was made, that's all there and reasonably explained if you pick up on it.  This subtlety is nice for someone like me who enjoys figuring things out and picking up on seemingly innocent clues.  Sadly though, there are some key plot elements that do not hold up under the same scrutiny, and that holds the film back from true greatness.My score:  8 out of 10.  Good scares, great acting, beautiful to look at. Lets you dig deep for answers, but you'll find bigger holes along the way. If you can forgive that, or at least suspend your disbelief, you'll have a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A good movie if you're willing to turn your brain off.,"***Spoilers: If you have not seen the movie, you shouldn't be reading this***Overall, ""The Ring"" was a fantastic movie, mainly because out of the limited number of horror movies I have seen in my life, this one actually managed to scare me. All the creepy little details are perfectly done, and it also has some great shock moments (the scene with Rachel's body in the closet made me jump about a foot). The tape itself is very mysterious and disturbing, and is, in my opinion, the best part of the movie.However, there were several things that were rather dumb, and the more I thought about them after I watched it, the more I didn't like it. It's the kind of movie that you can't analyze too much, or you'll ruin it for yourself. For one thing, the entire premise of combining supernatural mysticism with VHS technology is a bit goofy. But what really turned me off about this one was the kid, Aiden.Aiden drove me crazy. I'm supposed to feel scared for him, and yet he spends the entire movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He's a shaking, bug-eyed, dippy little nerd. All kids in horror flicks are like this, too (The Sixth Sense, The Shining, Invaders From Mars, etc.), and I'm sick of it. I want to see a horror where the kid stands up for himself like a man. Maybe then I'd care about whether the ghost gets him or not. Nervous outcasts like Aiden just annoy me. If I had a kid like him, I'd LET the ghost get him. After all, if he's not gutsy enough to protect himself from a stupid ghost like Samara, he probably wasn't going to last long anyway.This brings me to my second point: Samara the ghost was indeed stupid. Yes, everything was creepy and suspenseful, until we find out the exact method she uses to kill her victims, namely, crawling out of the TV and... looking at them. What the heck!? How hard can it be to defeat her?? All you have to do is unplug your TV. If you're not swift enough to do that, then just run away! She can't catch you, because she happens to be the slowest-moving ghost of all time.This is why I got so mad at that guy Noah at the end. All he had to do was LEAVE THE DAMN ROOM, but this proved to be too hard a task for him. Samara's inching toward him with these teeny-tiny baby steps, and this guy decides to start falling over and crashing into things like one of the Three Stooges. What a moron. If he's so uncoordinated that he can't walk ten feet without tripping all over himself, then he probably wouldn't have lived long anyway, either.Well, if you can handle the unintended silliness of the plot and characters, and focus on the well-done atmosphere and details, then you will enjoy this movie. Just don't think about it too hard.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Fantastically haunting, tragic, horrifying, the list goes on and on...","To be honest, this is the first horror movie I've ever seen in my life. But I adored it. I watched The Ring with my friend yesterday, and was shocked at the beautifully horrible sadness and despair to the whole thing. Samara's history is heart wrenching and horrible, and so surreal. Even though the story is based around something as modern as television, it has an old Gothic feel. One scene I quite liked was Samara as a pale, yet living child, about to be thrown in the well by her troubled mother, singing: ""Here we go, world is spinning. When it stops, it's just the beginning. Sun comes up, we all laugh. Sun goes down, we all die..."" And then she's a lank, slimy creature clotted with blood, killing everybody who is forced to know of her.

about the ring,"I watched in fear and cold horror of a bizarre movie that now has me unable to even use the toilet for fear of something coming up and grabbing me. After 20 minutes I am unable to leave the presumed safety of my third floor to let my dog out because it will mean leaving this room. There are not enough lights in my house because I remember that bad things happened with all the lights on. I know full well that this movie was made to scare people like me who may have an overactive imagination and through writing out this comment I am hoping to feel better.The idea that she killed the daughter she wanted so badly to have vilifies me. I am trying to make sense of this movie, with all its images, somewhat ingrained on my mind. I am fearful of my sleep tonight and what dreams I may have. This was a superb movie but I can't give it an excellent vote because I am still petrified and being petrified is not something that makes a movie excellent to me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ring Around The Scaries.,"I know how to write a story, craft a tale, create images and immerse people into other worlds. I know the beats, cadences and standards of storytelling, and while I haven't written a 'scary story' I'm familiar with the process. Further, I have studied fear from both a psychological aspect and a mythological aspect.I watched this movie on cable, over a year after its release, in the fullness of the afternoon sunshine streaming into my eleventh floor, three bedroom apartment.And I was scared.This was a brilliant film, so brilliant in its terror inducing imagery and story that I would recommend anyone with an overactive imagination or a low-tolerance for fear, avoid this movie at all costs. It's that good.Technically speaking (directing, acting, scripting, cinematography, lighting, score, et al) the film is highly proficient in all areas. There may have been flaws, but none that I observed on first viewing. In that regard, you could do much less rewarding things instead of sitting down and watching this movie. It was engaging, enthralling and unabashedly creepy.Be aware as I repeat myself: If disturbing imagery or scary tales are too much for you to handle DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. There is very little in the way of gore, and the mortality rate is low for this genre. But the movie is definitely going to make a lot of people's skin crawl.ESPECIALLY when they watch it at home.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

However, I was able to look past these short burst of ""camp factor"" and enjoy a really scary flick.  I judge a movie and its power to impress me based on, what I call, the ""chill"" factor.

The film itself evoked my previously-eaten taco to become uncomfortable in my tummy and work its way up my throat. I'll let you read about the plot holes (more like plot abysses)from other reviewers as I am not interested in wasting much more of my time with anything associated with this flop of a film.

Bah to all you old people.,"I see that so many of the comments here are based on such ancient films as Friday the 13th, Last House on the Left, and Nighmare on Elm Street. You people could never hack it as critics. You were to busy looking for what you considered ""horror"" ( i.e. blood and guts, gore and cheap shock scares ) to give The Ring its due credit. This film was not the horror you grew up with. It isn't Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Night of the Living Dead. It is a movie such as where Alien broke ground as a new Sci-Fi based Thriller. This one being though, a Paranormal based Thriller. You all ask ""Well how did they do this?"" or ""How could it do that?"" ... well, I truly hope none of you watch any ""One-Man army"" movies and think they are great. I don't know how those guys get anything besides being killed accomplished.Original, and filled with new ideas, the Ring was indeed a movie which carried an involved story line from start to finish. Well, maybe drifting away a bit at the ending, but still keeping you wanting to see what happens. I'm sure not one of you can say that you turned the movie off. A chilling scene indeed when you get to finally see this alleged death tape, espescially if the phone rings suspisciously afterwards .. which I am expecting the director may have anticipated to happen in a small percentage of watchers houses when it came to DVD. I didn't have any sort of anticipations when I watched this movie. I thought it would be another run-of-the-mill modern day teenage angst horror flick. Instead I got a great story, an interesting charcter back, and brooding, rainy Seattle.A cute tale of terror. Not horror.8/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The horror! The horror!,"And I thought The Exorcist was scary... I'm usually bored, when I see a so called scary movie. These days they're all about a masked avenger stalking young, hot looking girls with a knife. But this one, The Ring, was different. I was so scared during and after this movie, that I expected to have a heart attack. Half the time I couldn't even look straight at the screen, which was a first for me. It has been three days since I went to see The Ring, and I'm still avoiding my VCR. This movie had great actors who I had never seen before, great plot and real live and loud horror. I'm surprised if I ever go see another scary movie in my life! I'm glad, that there is still someone out there who can make a real horror movie. But at the same time I wish I had never seen this one.

stop the comparisons,"I believe this film stands on its own as a well made thriller. Unfortunately, people immediately feel the need to find every scene in the movie that was remotely similar to another film. Good directors borrow, great directors steal, right? Right. Anyway, aside from a few overdone scenes and contrived scares, the Ring is a competent remake of the original. The main problem lies in why a remake was made in the first place. For money, I know. This is a shame. Read: There were no holes in the plot. Anyway who disagrees, please email me and I will explain. Just because you didn't get it doesn't make it a bad movie.The American additions to the screenplay tend to hand hold a bit too much but American audiences are stupid, right? I jest. This film is well ahead of the majority of horror/thrillers hitting the screens lately.I hope it does quite well. The genre needs a boost. It is worth your money and time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A truly brilliant and gripping film.,"The Ring is a brilliant and gripping film which thriller fans will adore.The story begins after Rachel Keller's (Naomi Watts) niece is found dead, with no explanation for the death. It would appear that her heart just stopped. But the girl's mother asks Rachel, who is a journalist, to try and figure out why she really died. What Rachel discovers is that her niece, along with the three other friends of hers, watched a video tape exactly seven days prior to when they all died simultaneously.The Ring has a rating of MA15+, and it earned it. This is a very scary film that will have you on tenterhooks the whole way through its many twists and turns, but is not exceptionally gory, nor are things jumping out at the central characters every few minutes. The film is scary because of the creepy way it goes about things, letting you only have another piece of the puzzle that Rachel is presented. But the frightening imagery that the film uses makes it creepier then the story would have been. The scenes that stay with you especially are Rachel's encounter with a horse, her final meeting with Richard Morgan, the owner of a horse ranch on Moesko Island, and the gripping finale.But, the powerful imagery doesn't only come in the forms of scares. Certain scenes, like one simple scene where Rachel stands on her apartment's balcony and looks out at other people's lives gives us a snapshot into other people's lives, just showing that everyone you see has a tale to tell, something different from the last, and that people always have secrets.This film for me doesn't come under the ""horror"" category, but rather the ""thriller"" category, even though it is a very frightening piece of cinema. It is a classic, and even though it's a very scary piece of film, it's easily recommendable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I'll never watch an unlabeled videotape again!!,"Let me start by saying, I'm not one to be unnerved by scary movies.  I don't believe in the supernatural.  The usual horror fare (Scream, Halloween, etc) doesn't phase me in the least.This is hands down the most scary movie I've ever seen.  I watched this movie alone in a hotel room and I did not have a very good night.It's not a hack-em-up, gross-things-jump-out-at-you sort of movie.  It builds a sense of fear from the start and keeps building it right to the last scene.  This movie scares you in the way the original Shining or Blair Witch did.I'm not a self proclaimed movie critic and won't go into a long dissertation on the sound, lighting and camera angles used to make this film so scary. I'll just leave it at  this:This movie really disturbed me. If you like to be scared out of your wits and made to feel uneasy for days by a movie, its a must see.

What Suspense and Horror should be,"When I first watched the film I was incapable of sitting and watching the whole thing the beginning had scared me so bad. A couple months had gone by and hearing everyone continue to talk about how good the movie was, I decided to give it another shot. I now own the movie, once I was able to get past the parts that terrified me, I was able to observe the film for what it was and the elements used in the film that made the scary parts of the film truly scary.The outline of the story surrounds the ""urban legend"" if you will, of a tape that was made that if you watch it, exactly seven days later you die. Naomi Watts plays a news reporter looking into this story after a group of teens all die at the same night and time after visiting Shelter Mountain a week earlier. She does her investigating and uncovers more and more about ""The Tape"" and realizes that is more to it than she originally thought.A well paced movie, with great acting, good tension build-ups and good ""Jump"" moments. The music does a great bit of help in the film, without Hans Zimmer's quiet, creepy music, the film wouldn't have been anywhere near as dark without it. It helped carry the flow of the movie all the way to the climax where you might as well be chewing on the edge of the couch because of the thrill it gives with its twist ending.Great horror film with no gore or blood which is how horror films should be made, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A solid remake,"The American remake that launched 100 more American remakes to varying degrees of quality. The truth is if the movie wasn't so damn good it wouldn't have started such a big trend. That being said its really one of the only ones that adapts it's source material quite successfully. It takes the story of an evil girl whose thrown down a well and haunts a cursed video tape. That if you watch it you get a call and only have 7 days to live. It's truly a nightmarish concept that has an urgency that just works. The original Ringu is superior and a brilliant film that is saturated in Japan's religion and mythology. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) adds a domestic spin to the material that doesn't overdo it and just works. I remember going to see this at a preview show weeks before it came out and people freaked during the finale. In fact one grown man ran out of the theater. It's easy to see why the film was such a word of mouth big hit and deservedly so. From the stylish direction to the star making performance from Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) as well as solid work from hunky Martin Henderson (Torque), David Dorfman (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Amber Tamblyn (Grudge 2) and Brian Cox (X2). Unfortunately it was followed up by an overly mediocre sequel and an awful reboot. Hopefully somewhere down the line they'll be able to continue it all successfully. A direct sequel to the first wouldn't be a bad idea.Budget: $48m

Absolutely Scary,"This movie was the only movie in a scary movie genre that actually set out to do what it wanted to do: scare the crap out of the audience. I seriously did not want to be alone by myself after this movie and watch tv. I liked the idea of combining electronics/technology we're familiar with to heighten the sense of fear. That little girl was creepy. I saw her at the People's Choice Awards or something like that and she did the ""You're all gonna die part"" and it freaked me out again, even with her in normal clothes. Now that mess is freaky. The movie was a little slow at first. I tried to rationalize to the characters that they should just keep watching the tape over and over to extend their time to die. You know, like write it in the schedule: ""Must watch tape so as not to die this week"" kinda thing. Then I began to wonder about the plot of the movie. It didn't make sense that a girl from the early 20th century is making videotapes. How is that possible? Could we see that process? It didn't make any sense to me. However, she finally killed someone and then it became scary and I loved it. It's still my fave movie as a scary film and I think it should be a classic. I didn't get the dead horses part and I don't understand how her adopted father looks as old as Harrison Ford when he must have been born like in the late 1890's. Definitely not quite right in terms of plot holes, but still scary, so I forgive them that.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Naomi Watts and a morbid curiosity carry this art school horror remake,The plot revolves around a particular urban myth about the results of viewing a certain unmarked short video tape.

'The Ring' (2002) silently demands appreciation,""" ""The Ring"" is generally thought of as a horror movie, and it is. However, there is much more to it than just genre pigeonholing. It is a story of life, loss, and the knock-on effects they may have. Loaded with metaphors, fragmented psychological details, and foreshadowing pushed to its utmost (though tastefully implemented) threshold, there is no shortage of ""I wonder what that could mean"" moments when diving into this movie.From start to finish, its atmospheric canvas weaves together a profound sense of foreboding, leading many to question the story's lore beyond what the director has already divulged. Its standout feature has to be its exquisite cinematography, marked by intelligent and purposefully planned storyboards. Furthermore, its location scouting is perfect. In fact, you could watch this movie without a script and still be captivated by its enchanting visuals, which in still form, resemble works of art.But don't let me spoil it for you. Perhaps consider renting it? However the Blu-Ray edition provides additional content that you won't want to miss.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

At first I was skeptical about the teen element being involved (usually a cymbal crashing cue for long holds on tight shirts, tons of unnecessary screaming--not to mention screaming while ""running"" in high heels, and the most unabashed use of one-liners dredged up from every horror flick since the 70's), but thankfully that wasn't the case at all. The Ring was a truly edgy experience! The sound effects alone had me twitching, and I LOVED the puzzle of the video, its solution, and of course Samara's special effects most of all. The cinematography also gets an A+, beautiful work!As far as the acting, Brian Cox was OUTSTANDING (as usual); Naomi Watts was really believable (especially as an angry/frazzled single mom); Martin Henderson was INCREDIBLY hot.Now I realize that the only reason this film exists at all is because of the Japanese original (and of course the book) but what I don't understand is how anybody even thought that the original was ""scary/terrifying/astonishing/blah blahblah"". There weren't any special effects except for those annoying close ups and the screen changing colors (which is sooooo late 60's Hammer I can't even begin to go there). Sudako's ""death face"" had me on the floor laughing every time. If I'm watching a horror movie that is supposed to be legendary for scares, then I want to be scared; If I want to be stupidly amused I'll watch Freddy, Jason and Michael.I LOVE films that have plots that make you think and Japan has a ton of them, especially in horror, they're just not directed in a way that I find terrifying. Now the Japanese manga (comic books) based on The Ring series, THOSE are scary.The American version of The Ring is creepy as hell, and far above its original source.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Confirming what we all knew - VHS is evil,"The Ring follows the story of a journalist ,who, while investigating the death of her niece stumbles across a cursed video which kills its viewers in seven days.The Ring is based on a series of Japanese books which in turn were translated to film in Hideo Nakata's original film ""Ring"". Sometimes its impossible to talk about either film - the Japanese version or the US remake without comparing them such is the division of opinion. Taking The Ring on its own merits though it is a chilling and seriously creepy film.However if you have watched the Japanese version then some parts of the Ring will frustrate you. Such as the insistence US film makers have you holding your hand and explaining everything to you every step of the way. What ever happened to less is more? A big reason why Ring was so scary is that you knew next to nothing about the female apparition Sadako and this lent her an air of mystery. Here in The Ring we see her as a little girl sitting up and talking in bed. Not very scary. Also the main part - the video itself is just too well done in the US Ring. It looks more like a student art house film then a manifestation of evil. The Japanese version was darker, dirtier and plain freakier. As was the music.Don't get me wrong. The US Ring is still a fantastic horror film which improves on the Japanese version is some areas - just not overall. because of that its kind of impossible to say which was actually better. I personally prefer the original for the reasons I listed, but each to their own.After promising myself I wouldn't spend this comment comparing the two its obvious I need to go punish myself in some way.

The Ring ???,"I just now saw The Ring and it left me with more questions then answers. Can someone please help me with this so I will have a better understanding of the movie before going to see part II. Does anyone know where the video came from? Was Samara their real daughter or not? Do they have to keep showing the video to other people in order to stay alive and when Racheal told her son that she helped and found Samara, he was upset and said she never sleeps. I understand that she could not sleep because of the horses but what does that comment mean now that she is dead. Lastly......why was the video killing people in the first place. I understand that part of it was taped interviews when she was in the hospital but it still doesn't make sense to me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You people really make me wonder sometimes...,"You people really make me wonder sometimes, this movie is one of the best to come out in years, and there is still a large chunk of you crying and whining about a little plot hole you think you have found, or you did not like how it ended. Why do you even bother watching movies if you hate just about everything you see? Anyway, if you take the time to understand The Ring you will find it rewarding, as there really is not any plot holes at all, and if you think you have found one, it was most likely put there on purpose as a mystery, people like mystery's, why do you think people gossip about The X-files around the watercooler all day? Because if you knew everything about the story it would be dull and there would be nothing left to ponder about all day.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Easily better than the original,"To remake a 'cult' classic it seems, is to incur the wrath of those who loved the original so much that any thought of remaking it is blasphemy. This, it seems, is despite the imperfections of the original. For a horror film to be truly effective, however, never have the 'imperfections' been so important. For a horror film to work properly, you actually have to be scared. It has to be like the ghost stories older kids told you when you were kids (not the censored version your parents told you).I think in terms of the 'The Ring' I was lucky in that I got to see the American version first. As a result, I didn't know the story and so seeing this version of the story as my first view of the tale had the same effect on me (no doubt) as people who saw the Japanese original for the first time.I often believe that an original is better than it's remake ('The Vanishing', 'Yojimbo', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to name many). Let's not even bring 'The hitcher' into this discussion. In this case, however, the far superiour production values of the original make for a much scarier film than the original. I watched this version - the hairs stood up on my legs as I was watching it. I saw the original afterwards and it didn't have anyway near the same effect. Sure - you say - you knew what was coming! That's true - but then I watched this version again I had almost exactly the same sensation as when i watched it the first time.Why? That's easy. For a film to work you need to be willling to suspend your disbelief. For a horror film to be scary, this is even more important. The superior production values of the remake make it much easier to suspend your disbelief and therefore it is more effective as a horror piece. Compare one directly to the other and you;ll see that the story is in no way compromised - but that the characters are richer, the acting is better, the effects are way, way ,way, way better and the tension is even more drawn out.Simply put THIS is EXACTLY how to take an original film that used story to scare the bejesus out of you and then make a better film that has the same fundamental psychological effect.

Prepare yourself!,"I got the chance to see this movie at an early screening and it was amazing. I haven't seen the original but this movie is outstanding. From the first 10 minutes of the movie your heart rate jumps to 160 and stays there for the next two hours. This movie stands alone as one of the scariest movies I've seen. Everything a good horror movie needs, this has. Note: it's not at all a slasher filled with mindless gore but an extremely well thought out screenplay.  Naomi Watts performance is as riveting as it is different from her character in ""Mulholland Dr"". Unusually, out of the entire cast there was no weak link. Every one gave a strong, believable performance. This movie is definitely one of the better movies of the year. The high contrast, shades of grey look of the film perfectly accentuates the stark images.

In seven days...,"I'm glad I could make it home safe after watching ""The Ring"". The movie itself was not that frightening but the ending was so stunning and scary, I walked out of the cinema like a ghost with my eyes opened unusually wide. Not easily scared by movies,  I don't know how much time will it take until I touch a video tape again. The movie is about this mysterious video tape, that whoever watches it, gets an immediate phone call where he's being notified about his death in seven days. If he or she doesn't believe it, well, they will one week later, after experiencing one absolutely terrifying encounter with a TV. But if he DOES believe it, he will try to prevent his own death, exactly what Naomi Watts' character, Rachel, did in the movie. This was the was the first time I saw Naomi in a movie and I was definitely impressed by her performance. Being a professional reporter, Rachel has no problem breaking into strange people houses, killing horses, stealing things - the usual stuff reporters do, but this time not only for the article in a newspaper, but also for her and her ""family"" lives.  David Dorfman plays Rachels son, unsuccessfully trying to make the second Haley Joel Osment, but he definitely brings some thrilling, unforgettable lines(""Don't You get it, she never sleeps"").  Daveigh Chase, the voice of Lilo in ""Lilo & Stitch"", plays exactly the opposite role here in a performance that would even scare the hell out of Stitch himself. Gore Verbinski , the director, makes it up here for his disastrous ""The Mexican"". Hopefully, he's on the right way. Go see this movie.

excellent!!,"This film is so creepy and well-crafted. I was really surprised at how scary this movie actually was. The scene at the end had me and my friends (I might note, one of them franticly left during this scene, saying they had to ""go to the toilet"". Yeah, right) jumping out of our seats. It was that spooky and the jump tactic worked really well on me, my friends and the whole audience. Naomi Watts does really well, expressing all sorts of emotions such as dread, strength, vulnerability and so on. The music was really eerie, contrasting perfectly with the film's bleak, often surreal imagery. Overall, ""The Ring"" is the most effective horror film for quite some time, and that little girl is truly the most freakiest devil-disguised-as-a-child since Regan in ""The Exorcist"" Two thumbs up!!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Loved this movie,"Purists of ringu may hate me for this but i LOVED this movie. I especially love the introductory sequence and how the director plays on the audience's expectations in a horror movie. the framing is tight and the sequence is brilliant (i just love how when the girl closes the fridge door, we're waiting for a killer/ghost to be behind it). OK, so I don't exactly know how the little girl projected herself onto tape. but does that really matter? the rules are set up in the beginning and for the most part the story sticks to them. ie, you watch a tape. get a phone call. in 7 days your dead. deal with it. the little boy was perfectly cast and the lead actress does a fine job in a role where she could've went over the top.

"Scary, Mysterious, and Flawed, but Interesting and Entertaining","This is a good scary movie if you like stuff like ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Mothman Prophecies"". Everyone knows the plot, as this movie has become quite famous, but i'll tell it anyway: A reporter investigates the circumstances surrounding a videotape that causes your death in seven days if you watch it.This is a very entertaining and well-made movie, but there are a few problems.1. The dialogue in the first scene has to be some of the WORST dialogue I have ever heard in a movie in my life. It is lousy, unrealistic, and just plain atrocious. Luckily along came ""Scary Movie 3"" to make fun of it.2. There are some parts during the movie where the dialogue is also a little weak, although not as week as the absolutely dreadful first scene.3. There are some parts where Naomi Watts' character acts so dumb that its unrealistic. I mean, the character acts really stupid for no reason. I am keeping this review absolutely spoiler-free so I won't reveal any of those moments.That's about it. Other than those problems, the movie is quite fascinating. The acting is top-notch, its interesting, there are very entertaining elements, and its just plain fun to watch. Its also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get sick of (well, for a while at least). In fact, the movie is so entertaining and good that it automatically makes up for all the flaws.ALso, the directing by Gore Verbinski is outstanding. Best part of the film.I said it once and i'll say it again, if you like Twilight Zone or Mothman Prophecies or anything like that, then this is the movie for you.

A crappy remake,"First of all, I'd like to start by saying that, in a very personal taste, I liked Ringu much better than this one. The only thing to receive applause in The ring are, without a doubt, the photography and the make-up. Anything else is poorly done: the story, the way to unfold it, the overdose of go-seek-a-scare scenes and the need to explain things at the end of it (which, by the way, wasn't that clear). Sure, Hollywood did a great job in matters of visual but, in a real content of the movie, which goes from the adaptation of the cursed video to it's plot development, it failed big time. I'm not one against the US remakes. I enjoyed The magnificent seven (from Sturges) as much as I did The seven samurai (from Kurosawa), but, let's face it, Hollywood also has stroke several times on adapting real art foreign films like The wings of desire (from Wenders) as to make a crap film named City of angels. My belief is, The ring, falls on this last category.In terms of pacing I would recommend watching Ringu first instead of The ring, for anyone interested in seeing both. The japanese is slower but sure is better constructed and explained. My biggest complaint about The ring is that this one traded the whole creepy, evil and an air full of a perverse presence atmosphere from the original (and it's sounds), for more expensive special effects and a more sped up rhythm. This changed the whole aura of creepiness for the urge of an immediate disturbance. Sure, I got really scared a couple of times, by being caught with the guard down may I say, but they were moments frightening enough to give me those chilly goose bumps -the best one occurres near the beginning-; but that was it. Nothing else captivated or demanded my attention. It appears to me that Hollywood wanted an attractive package to sell rather than one good film that could be really apreciated by moviegoers with a brain inside their heads.Also, the changes and additions in this film are more than evident. Despite being almost a carbon copy in it's first hour, The ring falls short on it´s task to get you IN the movie starting from the cursed video, that works better as a resemblence of the surrealistic and goofy movie Un perro andaluz (made by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí in the late 20's), than the images that comes from a distressed mind (which actually are). Sure Ringu is slower, but besides the lot of talking involved there's also a strange, weird feeling in the air; it´s something like an evil presence that you can guess and watch in some secuences, and verbinski wasn't capable of capture that in here. That´s way I like Ringu, and that´s why I also recommend it instead of The Ring.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Very, very scary","The film about the mysterious videotape that kills you one week after you watch it. The story centres on journalist Rachel Keller (played by the beautiful Naomi Watts) who, having seen the tape, has one week to solve its riddle or become its latest victim.Personally, I found this the scariest movie I have seen. I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre (not matter what anybody tells you, this IS a horror film) but I've seen most of the standards and can appreciate a good scary film. The whole atmosphere is downright chilling, and the scenes with Samara in the mental hospital are particularly disturbing. Great credit must go to young Daveigh Chase for her performance. Indeed, the character of Samara must rank as one of the scariest cinematic creations ever. She makes the film and the scenes involving her are the scary ones. And I mean SCARY. Her image will linger with you for long after the film has ended and you will never look at a television the same way again.There are arguments and counter-arguments for whether this is superior to the Japanese original. I want to add my two cents and I'll say this: whichever version you see first will probably be the one you will champion. On repeat viewing the film does lose some of its impact because you know what to expect. You know how the tape kills people and the shock will be gone. Therefore, if you see this after the Japanese version it will seem inferior, and vice versa. That said, its still a very effective horror film and, in my opinion, far superior to anything Hollywood has produced in this genre for a long time. Well worth a look, but I wouldn't advise watching alone because if someone hasn't already told you what happens, it will scare the hell out of you.

Worst Movie of the Year,"I just came out of this and I am completely at a loss for words.   It was absolutely the most tedious, poorly acted, unoriginal and boring movie I've seen all year.I thought Naomi Watts should have won the Oscar last year for her amazing performance in Mulholland Drive and now am rethinking that opinion.  I'm starting to think that she owes that performance to typecasting and David Lynch. What I thought was a brilliant job of intentional bad acting for the first half of ""Drive""  may have been the work of a bad actress being brilliantly used by a great director.there is so much wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start but suffice to say that you will lose count of the absurdities that fill this movie.  And all for nothing.  There may be a couple of scenes that make you jump but nothing is in the least bit scary.Watts should give 90% of everything she makes to David Lynch and take out a contract on Verbinski.

Totally Twisted,"this movie is indeed one of the most frightening movies ever!  I haven't had the chance to rent the Japanese version; however, I thought this movie was very well done.It's about a tape that if you see it, you die in 7 days; and then a reporter tries to uncover the true behind the cursed tape, and since she watched it, with her ex-boyfriend and later her son, she must find the true or else they will be dead.The acting is all right, is not fabulous but it's not bad either, Naomi Watts, who plays Rachel, does an ok job.  She is great in some parts, and in others she is just not into it.  Martin Henderson, Noah,  is good too in what he does, but they could have done a far better job with the acting.Now the directing and the plot, that is awesome!  It's very twisted and sometimes even complicated to understand, it leaves a lot of ""holes"" in the story, and that is good, because you keep wondering what happened, what will happen.Well this is a great horror movie, it's been a while since they made a film actually scary and not grotesque like all the others involving murders, curses and lots of dead people and blood.

A terrifying masterpiece of modern horror,"To date, The Ring is the only film that has truly frightened me. No, it didn't frighten me, it mortified me. It petrified me. It almost made me walk out of the theater I was so scared.

Okay, simple enough. I'm sure to many it sounds like B-horror trash, but it is horror perfection. Literally the first half hour alone had me covering my eyes I was so scared. This film is done so perfectly...the acting, the score, and don't even get me started on the images. Some of those have stuck with me to this day.

Unbelievably scary,"This is one of the scariest films I've ever seen; what's great about it is how it doesn't rely on excessive amounts of gore or cheap thrills to scare you. There's barely any blood or violence in the movie at all, and it's still more scary than most violent horror movies. I love how the horror is all atmospheric; it keeps building up to something worse, instead of just hitting you with constant scenes of violence. This is a perfect movie to put on, if you're sitting alone a dark night, in need of a good scare. Nearly anyone will find it scary. The plot is interesting, and keeps developing constantly, so you never get tired of it. The acting is top-notch, by pretty much every single actor involved, major & minor character alike. The characters are believable, and their actions understandable. The movie has an excellent mystery, that leaves a lot of open ends to the audience to figure out for themselves; unfortunately, there may be too many open ends... I've seen it three times, and I still can't make sense of everything that happens in the movie. That's the only complaint, though. Other than that, it's nearly perfect. It's definitely one of the scariest movies ever, especially if you're into atmospheric horror.

Wonderfully creepy!,"One of the few PG-13 flicks that actually managed to get under my skin! Adapted from Koji Suzuki's novel, a female reporter investigates the origins of a tape that supposedly kills you one week after watching it after her niece is the last supposed victim of the tape's deadly curse. This one is way better than its Japanese original, ""Ringu"", of which it was a remake of. For one thing, it's pace isn't as deathly boring and Verbinski directs the movie with more visual flair than his Japanese counterpart. There are some truly scary ""jump moments"" thrown in here and there that caught me completely off guard and the imagery in this film is top notch. The killer tape in this one actually IS unsettling, unlike the one in ""Ringu"", and Samara is 10 times scarier than her Japanese alter-ego Sadako. It's best to think of this as a supernatural detective story and I enjoyed not being able to predict where the movie was going, I was along for the whole ride, right down to terrific ""twist"" ending that is only one of few in recent memory that I didn't manage to see coming a mile away. An oppressed, dreadful and genuinely creepy atmosphere prevails throughout and is possibly the film's strongest asset...this one will get under your skin. Naomi Watts is excellent as well as everyone else involved in this.

The best horror movie ever!!!,"This is the best horror movie of all time. I mean there's something very hair raising about a little girl who walks limping toward you.

I am very found of horror movies and then, in 2002, there wasn't any good horror movie on the market. I hate monster horror movies like vampire movies or other mystical creature movie. I heard of The Ring and I said: ""Lets see what they can do now!"". I took 2 friends and started the movie. From the first scene, there is not one minute when you can rest and not being in constant fear that something bad will happen, and that's great. That's how a horror movie should be. Naomi Watts is excellent (actress and woman), she gives you the filling that she's doing this to save you, because you saw the tape to and in the same time as she.

I found in some of the comments that this movie was unoriginal and in some of the other comments the movie did not follow the horror guidelines...well those two statements are pretty much contradictory which means those people are just blabbing for attention. If you are looking for an original horror movie i guess you can count out scream 1, 2, and 3, all the Friday the 13th and Jason movies, all the psycho movies ie. Silence of the Lambs, etc. Is it possible for a horror movie to be original?? The Ring is about as close as you can get to original.And now to blast away the people who gave negative reviews even further. Most of us know that what we fear the most is the unknown. The origin of Samara and her powers are not revealed to us. But honestly do we have to know? Many things do not need explained but will still scare the crap out of people. If you ever thought you saw a ghost you would neither care or think about how it got there and you would be scared out of your wits. Why are you scared? Because most supernatural phenomena cannot be explained and you cannot possibly understand it. Samara is pure evil...that is all we need to know to be scared of her...the most dreadful sadistic girl you can imagine. She has the frightening ability to burn horrific images into your mind and drive you crazy, all the while you feel your death approaching. This is how scary Samara is...and how scary the movie is. And you don't even need to know a thing about Samara to be scared.The story of this movie is actually well thought of. Contrary to what you may read in some of the negative reviews, this movie does have a great story and is not exactly difficult to follow. I saw one review where one person said that the movie never explained the chronology of events about the horses and how the child, Samara, affected the horses. Are you kidding?? This was fully explained. Anna Morgan was driven insane by the images Samara was revealing to her in her mind. Anna and Richard Morgan decided to banish Samara to their barn, hoping the separation would help stop all of it. While Samara was in the barn, she grew annoyed of the horses and decided to drive them insane. This was an act of revenge for being put in the barn.Now lets talk about the two things that make up a great movie...story and acting. The story is pretty much original, especially the scare tactics. Some of you say they are cheap. Cheap????? They scared the crap out of me. Quick flashes of distorted faces and horrific images do not allow the brain to settle/desensitize. Seconds or Minutes after each ""scare"" that one quick moment is etched into your mind...the summation of all these moments is the main reason why many of us are still scared of this movie even 10 days after we first watched it. The split-second shots of katie's face and Samara's eye did it for me. The storyline is understandable. Some of these people comment about how the story just doesn't make sense. Well I'm sure if they popped in the movie one more time and stopped whining about how this isn't a Friday the 13th or Scream Stabber movie, they would be able to follow the story pretty easily. As for the acting...well Naomi Watts was perfect and the others, while not being excellent, did an good enough job to where their bad acting did not take away from the film.Because this film has the originality that most horror films do not, and because this movie scared the crap out of me, i have no choice but to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Nowhere nearly as creepy as the original-""Ringu"",but still pretty good.","""The Ring"" directed by Gore Verbinski is based on the Japanese shocker ""Ringu""(1998,Hideo Nakata).The film actually has more dramatic elements than the original,which is pure horror!Still Verbinski creates some really suspenseful moments-unlike many directors he realizes that what an audience imagines is far more frightening that what's on screen.The acting is excellent(Naomi Watts is brilliant and really compelling!),there are some very interesting visuals and eerie moments.Still this film is not as scary as Hideo Nakata's masterpiece.A nice try!8 out of 10.Recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This movie is awesome,"This movie was SOOO good! I watched it with my friends at 1 am and we woke up the whole house screaming! It is so terrifying! I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good horror movie. But believe me, do NOT watch this movie alone. It IS scary. But you have to watch the entire movie to understand it, so pay attention. I had to watch it twice to fully grasp it. This is one of those movies that will stick in your head and freak you out.

Best Thriller&Horror Movie Ever,"The best horror movie I have ever watched. I know so many but this one affects me again and again, it. Settles in your psychology with its unique soul. Not identified with explosive action scenes, a cliche story, haunted house or haunted item, exorcism, bustle etc. Only the real ones. Samara was a human, an innocent child like all of us; what happened? An unknown black covered tape exist in shelfs with other normal tapes, different kind of images like a sea lighthouse, ladder; where are they, what happened there? Effort of the maternal instinct?Emotional basis is well powerful and this explains why its my favourite. A protective single human wants to give their child a good life, Family by two people have no good family bounds. A mother's endless effort for her child and the danger is highly contagious and resistant.Already the legendary lullaby theme comes from Hans Zimmer. What more could one ask for?Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Darn good movie - no spoilers,"Personally, I consider myself a seasoned veteran of the movie world, and I gotta say this one was probably the best that I've seen. Excellent usage of photography and suspense through-out was just awesome (the video they watch was probably the most intensely scary part of the movie... made the little hairs on the back of my neck stand on end). I haven't seen the original Japanese versions yet, so I can't compare it to those, so I'll just give it ****3/4 off the bat.The story was well-written (a bit confusing at times, but overall, well written).  The music actually did a lot for the movie;it kept the suspenseful atmosphere going without getting in the way (thumbs up to Hans Zimmer).When I first saw it, I kept thinking it would be the normal cat-in-the-closet type thing... boy, was I wrong!And, this is one of those movies that has definite rewatchability (to catch all the little subtle things included in it). It's well-deserving of at least one Oscar (at least)!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Scary but not rewatcheable.,"I gave this a 9 only because the movie isn't one to buy for watching over and over. Otherwise, I thought the first time through it was a 10. Everyone I know who watched it were just ""WOWed"" by it.It's scary, has a good storyline and decent acting.While not action packed, it keeps you glued. The ideas presented in it can certainly give you a jump when your phone rings.Definitely watch it, at night, alone (or with a member of the opposite sex), and you will enjoy it. It might also be enjoyable for groups of young friends. As with most serious scary movies - you don't want people who lighten the mood. Stay in the right ambiance and you will be frightened.Not a recommended purchase (DVD/VHS) for most.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
the lord of this ring,"Horror is so hard to pull off because usually, we can guess way in advance what's going to happen. Not so with ""The Ring"". Even if you hear what the story is, much of the movie will still probably make you jump.It all begins when two teenage girls are talking about a video tape that you watch, and then you get a phone call telling you that you're going to die. Sure enough, one of them watches the tape. After her death, her aunt Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates further and uncovers the story behind the tape. In the process, she seeks the answers to some questions: What is that ring? Who is that girl? And how does a lighthouse fit into this all? The movie mainly works because they know how to pull off surprises when you least expect it, and they let the answers to these questions evolve slowly but surely.

Best horror movie,"I thought this movie was the scariest horror movie I have ever seen. From the teen's dead face in the closet at the beginning to the girl crawling out of the well and then out of the t.v. at the end and everything in between made this movie great. I read the comment in the beginning and it said that it was just silly. All horror is silly because it is not based on reality, but what makes a movie horrifying is our imagination. You have to have imagination for most everything that comes out of Hollywood especially horror films. I am not known to be emotional, but this movie actually made me move farther back in my seat when Samara crawled out of the well. The screaming teenagers that were probably underage helped with the effect. The reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it was a little slow at times. I was very surprised that the Ring 2 was just as good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not quite as effective as the real one, but a very good remake.","I was looking forward to this remake, after seeing the original a while ago. And I enjoyed it a lot. Though it does change quite a bit of the story, it does a very good job of staying close to the bleak and spooky feel of the original.It's probably because I saw the other one first, but so far Samara hasn't had me lying awake at night or frightened of reflections and televisions, like Sadako did.

"A brief review of ""The Ring""'s plot.","To begin, I have neither read the book or seen the Japanese movie, so my review is about this version only. ""The Ring"" was artfully filmed, with good color choices and lots of tiny features that were fun to find. Visually, I loved this movie. But I watch for the plot, and there wasn't much of it here. ""The Ring"" is the detailed story of a chain letter. It is one of the ""pass it on or die"" stories that I'm sure we've all seen at one time or another. Yes, this is much better written than a usual e-mail, but it's still, in my opinion, an overused and cheap plot. I laughed at the first few scenes of the movie, but from there it went downhill. There were clichéd characters (the skeptical detective, the all-knowing young child, the creepy little girl) and unoriginal exposition techniques. As the story progressed, I began to enjoy ""The Ring"" a bit more, but it left many unanswered questions and loose ends that I feel should have been tied up. Many interesting characters are introduced, and their histories are extremely important to the plot, but we only receive the very minimum information. So many ideas are introduced and never properly explored. I was left wondering at the end of the movie--not thoughtful, more exasperated that they hadn't included more information. Throughout the movie, I never related to any of the characters and never felt like we got a grip on who they were. Each character has a role in the movie, but their stories feel not fully developed and I think this could have been improved upon. If you are looking for a beautiful film with good colors, interesting shots, and carefully placed details, ""The Ring"" isn't a bad movie to watch. But if, like me, you care more about the plot than anything else, I wouldn't recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
what was that?,"The ring is officially the most overrated film of this year. I went in expecting to be wowed and left wishing there was some way i could get my money back. the movie fills its time block with useless attempts at artsy symbolism which in fact are meaningless. The movie tells a story which could have been adequately told using 15 minutes of the material it showed. The only ALMOST redeeming quality was the cinematography...the images were quite nice but hard to appreciate when absolutely POINTLESS. The entire movie is jumbled; it is quite obvious that someone involved in the creation of the story got carried away then lost themselves trying to bring it back (the horse? the fly?).

I recommend this movie for any scary movie fan or just a movie fan. I think you will love it like I do. The best movie of the year. Its the best horror, suspense, and dramatic film of 2002.

Many of the actors and images in the original Ring are more scary, detailed, and authentic than the second movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Delightfully creepy and basically wrong,"This movie should be put under the title of horror, but more one of Terror. The Ring contains very little gore, and apart from a couple of scenes (bath suicide, death of Samara) there is little violence. The film wins by having images which are 'wrong' from the girl in the closet at the beginning with the horribly contorted face, its not bloody but just 'not right', difficult to look at, easy to remember. The same with Samara emerging from the TV and doing 'that walk'.In agreement with the other user comment this does seem to be a movie about settling disgruntled spirits, however in difference the characters fail to do so. The films heroine does link the clues, and visits the resting place of the demon, however she realises that nobody can calm her, and even after trying to bargain with the dead, they still come for our souls, there is nothing anybody can do to escape.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's a grown up teen movie and much more ""Blair Witch"" than ""Scream"".  It does make you think (although if you do too hard you will realize there are plenty of holes in the plot).Basically, a pretty fresh look at horror films and very well directed with some great cinematography too.You've got seven days to see it...

ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES EVER,"This movie is really really good and really really scary!!! It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and also one of the best.  It's not like ""The Exorsist"", which is more gruesome and gory than scary.  This is the real thing, a REAL scary movie.  I was going to go see ""Abandon"", but I saw this instead, and I'm really glad I did.  ""Abandon"" is probably really good, but this movie was definately worth my time.  I actually screamed twice in the theater!!  I highly recommend going to see this movie.At first, it's just freaky, but as the movie goes on, the pieces start to fall together until you understand everything that was in the video. There's alot of stuff in this movie that, when it happens, makes you jump.. or scream.  And just when you think the movie is over and everything is resolved, something  happens that completely surprises you, and the movie goes on a little longer.  This movie is really good, so if you like really scary movies and/or mysteries, you should go see this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Boring,"Never underestimate the ability of the most boring, to just plain bad, films to become big franchises. Now, I've seen 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', 'Ring 0', and 'Rasen', and the only one I thought to be worthwhile was 'Ring 0: Basudei'. The others ranged from boring to just plain silly (I'm thinking 'Rasen' in particular here). I was apprehensive in watching 'The Ring', and thinking about how most remakes seem doomed to failure, what could 'The Ring' offer in entertainment value? In the end, it wasn't that bad. Of course, it wasn't that good either. It ended up being an amalgamation of 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', with various Hitchcock moments thrown in and a sub-plot about horses thrown in, which leads me to: THE HORSES! WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE HORSES. I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.So, apart from the sub-plot about the horses, 'The Ring' is just another journalist investigating a cursed tape. I can't think of any other movie series that involves a cursed tape, so originality points would go there if there hadn't been five different versions of 'Ring' in Japan already. If I wanted to curse everyone with a tape, I'd just project onto the large-screens you see in city centres, allowing for maximum curse-age.Apart from the lack of any scares for most of the movie, my biggest problem with 'The Ring' was the character of Aidan. You know who he reminds me of? The kid from 'The Sixth Sense', and a bunch of other kids just like that kid. I really hate any movie-kid like Aidan. I would gladly trade him for Homer Simpson's talking-pie or killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason, if only there were no more kids with super-natural powers, or kids who seem to know everything about the occult.'The Ring' isn't that scary - it didn't even improve on 'Ringu', which wasn't very frightening either - and ended up disappointing and boring - 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary Fun...,"Over the past few years we have seen supernatural thrillers take a rise in popularity. First, it was films like ""The Sixth Sense,"" which were carried alongside hits such as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Then, there were the crude rip-offs that didn't work, and some that were just ""average supernatural fare."" Well, ""The Ring,"" based on the highest-grossing Japanese thriller ""Ringu,"" gets back on track in the right direction.The film stars Naomi Watts as Rachel, a single mother with a job as a reporter. After a niece of hers dies exactly seven days after watching a mysterious tape, Rachel has no choice but to uncover the deadly - and startling - truth behind the tape. Even if it means her life.Along with her are cast members Martin Henderson as Noah, a computer-tech-guy, and Brian Cox as a figure in the film I will not give away.The cast of the film is good. Above average for a psychological/supernatural thriller. Naomi Watts carries the story at a believable level and Martin Henderson gives some comic relief, but thank God not to the point of obnoxious like so many other thrillers.The plot of this film has its roots buried strongly where they should be, and never ceases to surprise. Some moments are predictable, but there are more than enough pleasant surprises along the way, with an ending that leaves the audience hanging, so that we have to wait for the sequel (yes, Watts is signed for a sequel, and a possible prequel, just like the Japanese film was accompanied with).So, all-in-all, if you want a modest, scary film that never gives out to commercialism or cheap thrills, see ""The Ring"" when it hits video and DVD next month (I saw it in a free theater with lousy speakers - I can't wait to see it on my surround sound entertainment system!)4/5 stars -John Ulmer",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"My lord, this was quite possibly one of the greatest horror movies ever.","My lord, this was quite possibly one of the greatest horror movies ever. This isn't some gory crap like House of 1,000 Corpes, oh no. This is a mental-type movie. It doesn't show you how people are physically damaged when killed, and so there are so very many ways your mind can perceive based on their corpses. I love this movie, and was straight up terrified. Of course, if your all into gore and don't have an imaginative mind, then this is not for you.The terror of not being able to see your enemy is played up in this, which I like. You never really see Samara, except in the hospital and at the end, but you see her effects, and such things are scary to me. And the sense of lack of time is something that also adds a suspenseful feeling. It's one of those things where you really are hoping and praying for the hero or heroine before time is up. And of course, kudos to the ending. I must say I was not expecting that. And the ending makes you think...or at least...it did until they made a sequel, which I have yet to see but am still disappointed. Of course, I won't give away the ending, but I will tell you that if your mind works like mine, you'll be thinking about the future of Rachel.On the downside, the beginning was fudged up. How would anyone know about the tape if they haven't watched it? Doesn't everyone die after watching it? And of course, THEY MADE A SEQUEL! Other than that, I was totally impressed and terrified by this movie. 9 outta 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
' Disturbing ',"This horror film is definitely the most disturbingly psychological movie i have seen for a while. If little children with dark hair creep you out then maybe a film to avoid - yet i watched it. Samara a disturbed and neglected young girl haunts a video tape - If someone watches it they die in ' Seven Days ' -Naomi Watts places Rachel - mother of Adian. Her Niece watches the video tape and she notices creepy pictures in her bedroom and decides to investigate. She has no idea what shes getting herself into. The video itself i found weird and much different to what i expected. This isn't your typical horror it has a lot of twists and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat or hiding behind it whichever. The Ring2 i thought Samara was more creepy in the way she acts and moves, yet the storyline seems abit teedias. I had to watch it a 2nd time to understand little bits. The first is better, because its unusual and no-one has achieved a movie like this. Acting from all the cast is very good. Naomi Watts succeeds in playing the worried mother figure very well. Worth seeing if you would rather have a decent storyline to your horror movie then i would recommend it.

A haunted movie.,"Good God. The Ring is probably the only true horror classic we've had in the past decade, and is more frightening than many of the other classics one can name. It's a shame that more people don't realize how deep and well-crafted this movie truly is, and how well the visuals tie together the whole film. It really helped me appreciate how nearly everything in the entire movie meant to frighten can be traced all the way back to Samara's experience, because throughout the whole movie, she is forcing everyone to share her experience. Take a look at all the deaths that happen in the movie. What is similar about them? Watch it again, and you'll see it's just another way of Samara forcing others to share her pain. The visuals in this movie are tremendous and subtle; I recommend that anyone go slowly through the tape scene, just to see where these visuals are repeated, and where they come from. You've noticed that I haven't said anything of the actors or the plot. They're really secondary to me, even if they all give decent performances. And I'm not going to even mention The Scene near the end of this movie. If you've seen it, you already know it is probably one of the most frightening things ever filmed. In the end, this movie is sucha totally solid and coherent piece, because nearly every moment of it seems to be haunted by the presence of a little girl who has seen horrible things and will never stop sharing them with you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Whoa... ease up,"I really kind of liked this movie. No, it wasn't a heart-stopping, jumpy movie but there is no arguing that it is a well made, skin-crawly, creepy, atmospheric movie. I am the type of person that can enjoy both kinds of movies equally well and I do.Some of the scenes in the Ring are straight out of a nightmare and others are shown so briefly, you're not sure what you just saw - which only helps circulate the creepy atmosphere.I've read some of the reviews on here and have to say that I don't understand why some people take offense at remakes of foreign films. Granted, I usually like the original version as well but I can't possibly keep up with every foreign title. Or perhaps I'm just a lazy American but, sometimes it's difficult trying to get into the feel of a movie with having to read subtitles. Also can't watch dubbed movies, that's just plain silly. But if the remake is done well, what's the problem. I've seen both and thought them equally well made. In a way I am grateful to the people that bring some of these foreign films to the US mainstream. I may never have become aware of this, and other wonderful titles were it not for their Americanized cousins. Movies like Ringu and even Abre los ojos (Vanilla Sky) might still be unknown to me otherwise. That would be just sad. Cheers!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the most genuinely scary movies ever made,"I hardly ever have the motivation to come on here and comment on a movie, but this one is worth that effort. I am a massive fan of horror movies and films of intrigue.  I can easily say that The Ring is way up on my top ten list of scary movies.  And I mean scary movies.There are horror films which are just great thrillers, like Seven and the Hannibal trilogy and others like Friday 13th or Scream that are inventive in their death scenes.  Then there are the very few that genuinely jolt and unnerve you, prompting you to cover your eyes with your hands and make your heart leap like on a rollercoaster. Films like The Shining and Fire Walk With Me.This is definitely one of those.I have not seen the Japanese original so I cannot offer a comparison, but this US version pulled off what in my opinion is one one of the most chilling movies ever made.

fun modern horror movie,"For a horror movie, this rocked! I watch a lot of b-movies, horror movies and slasher flicks, and this was the best movie within those genres within the last ten years ( yes that includes The Sixth Sense.) The cinematography and sound was top notch, the acted was credible and the suspense fantastic. Unlike some movies, this movie is actually creepy an may upset some with weak stomachs ( just ask my ex-wife, it creeped her out!.Naomi Watts, the lead actress in the movie, played the part of Rachel, a reporter and a single mother trying to cope with a young son named Aidan who's mental age is well higher then his actual age. Aidans cousin dies a supernatural death and chaos ensues. Bit by bit Rachel gets drawn into the web of 'the ring' via the viewing of a videotape. Soon she and her sons life are in jeopardy. Enlisting the help of her ex (and father of Aidan), they try to solve the mystery of 'the ring'.The movie is well paced and moody.However, at the 3/4 mark it jumps a little and it seems a whole segment was cut out, but otherwise was very well done.

A waste of my time,"Well, this American remake of Ringu took all that was good and creepy about the original and made everything so obvious, boring and ... well (no offence) American! I suppose it looks good enough... there are some creepy bits... some of the actors weren't utterly useless. But overall it was a huge waste of my time. (I want those 2 hours of my life back... I could have done something more productive like... Oh, Stared at my ceiling?)What made me even more disappointed was that I had seen and enjoyed the original. (If I hadn't then I might just have given this one a 2 or 3 for trying.) It was good precisely because it didn't attempt to shock you at every turn but rather crept up at you and made you feel thoroughly uncomfortable. (In a good way.) Whereas this piece of rubbish tried so hard to be scary that it ended up not being scary at all. See the original instead... it is far superior to this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If you disagree with me start up a message board,"OK so here are my comments, what was was so damn scary about this movie? I thought the scariest part for me was that I paid 7 dollars to see it and not only did I see it once but twice(second time on a date) well OK it starts out really good, great scary account of the girl being found in the closet but then it's like hours of people wandering around like Michael Jackson looking for a small child, I mean c'mon it's so hard to find a movie thats really scary these days, Sixth Sense had some of it, Blair Witch definately did the job, but the greats in my opinion follow the same principal mess with your audiances' collective head, throw in a creepy make uped person once in awhile and you go gold, but this it was like c'mon, so far we had the video was creepy, the closet scene and the end was kinda creepy but I was so bored with impatience I blurted to my friend, ""if some woman came outta my tv I'd be like, 'hey you get in the kitchen and make me some pie' I mean great concept guys, I'm really looking forward to Ringu but next time give us some midway chills, not just oh I have a nose bleed and fly came out of the TV and now I'm pulling things out of my throat, I want to be scared now bored.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The way horror movies are supposed to be,"This film was excellent.  It succeeded in being scary without being bloody or stupid and had a wonderfully complex plot and narrative that was interesting, intriguing and threw you off when you least suspected it.  The ""not knowing"" and fear factors poked at all of our fears of the unknown. One of the most wonderful things about this film was the title.

Simply one of best 4 or 5 horror flicks ever...,"As an amateur film reviewer, I'm genuinely surprised by the number of individuals who rated this movie at an ""8"" or lower. Based on the very weird, surrealistic Japanese original, this film breaks the mold of the increasingly predictable, mega-redundant themes and settings of the horror genre in the US. Please... Visiting a good DVD rental shop with tons of horror flicks lined up together is truly depressing, so commonplace are nearly all productions from US companies.If one eliminates sci-fi ""horror"" films like the great ""Alien"" of 1979, then this film joins a very small select group, like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the remakes of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" and then moves decisively beyond them into some yet-to-be-defined new departure of eclectic imagination. Sure, a few of the scenes really stretch all credibility (as the contrived survival of a key player in one of several sequential ""endings""), but the movement, complexity, and cast of characters in the work render this objection mostly innocuous. Strange, inexplicable occurrences simply remain flatly mysterious or ambiguous. The fly (not a spoiler). Yet the ""shocking"" scene in the scary, revelatory Edward-Munch-like house also shares in the tradition of somewhat conventional ""build-up"" scenes right out of ""The Thing."" Finally, unlike the wonderful ""gotcha"" resolution of ""The Sixth Sense,"" this film concludes with an ominously open-ended question, actually giving the culminating terror a palpable, horrifying moral dilemma that requires no sequel whatever. This is utterly unique. And it simply isn't what American audiences pay good ""horror"" money to see, on screen or video.If this isn't a 10, folks, then I'd like to know one that's been made in the past ten years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Genuine bed-wetter,"Has the Sixth Sense stylized horror? A genre scarred by gore in the 80's and self-mockery in the 90's seems to be taking some positive steps towards the Hitchcock masterpieces of the past. Following on from the success of The Sixth Sense and The Others, The Ring backs an intriguing mystery with some genuine scares. Already a massive success in Japan, The Ring's Hollywood makeover has maintained its allure, proving that originality isn't necessarily the key to success.Taking the premise of an urban myth, The Ring centers around a mysterious video than once observed, leaves the viewer with only seven days to live. Watts (Mulholland Dr., Tank Girl) plays Rachel Keller, a investigative journalist seeking to unlock the reason behind her niece's bizarre murder while juggling a emotionally repressed son (Hoffman) and his lethargic father (Henderson) . When she stumbles upon the video, it becomes clear that she now only has seven days to live. Thus begins The Ring.To disperse more of the plot would jeopardize a brilliant and well told succession of twists, turns and frights. The Ring is genuinely scary, working your sub-conscience into a frenzy of anticipation that keeps an otherwise quiet middle from bogging down the film. Director Verbinski (The Mexican , Mouse Hunt) is in complete control, choosing his scares with unpredictability and providing some magnificently atmospheric eye candy.The performances are excellent. Watts (looking scarily like a blonde Nicole Kidman) and Henderson (Windtalkers) are believable in their fears as the threat of the unknown drives at their splintered family. A good show from the supporting cast is only dented by Hoffman, who, despite looking spooky, comes in several shades down from the peerless Haley Joel Osment in a performance clearly inspired by the seminal child actor of his generation.Horror films have definitely made a positive leap in the last few years and despite some Hollywoodised death scenes, The Ring is a dead set bed wetter. Hard to predict, rarely does the tension let up and the ending is one of the genre's greatest leaving you, at the credits, legitimately fearful of your immediate future.

Weak plot,"Nice looking movie with decent performances. However the plot left so many questions that in the end you just shrug it off and walk away. I would recommend it to a curious soul by saying ""It's a good rental but don't fall through the holes in the plot.""This movie contains one of the best ""how did they do that,"" scenes of all time. It involves a spooked horse and a ferry. Another hole in this movie is that they don't even enlighten us as to how they did it in the DVD ""extras."" Speaking of the extras, the ""cutting room floor,"" scenes only serve to add the confusion.It starts out as a typical teen horror/slasher flick then goes for a ""Sixth Sense,"" look and feel. It does both nicely, but is rudely awakened by the numerous question marks that are brought up. The Riddler would love this movie. I won't go through them, but if you are the type to accept anything presented to you without question, you will love this one. As far as being scary, when I was a kid a movie could have that effect on me. But that was many moons ago. This movie falls into the category of ""next.""",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best Horror Movie in sooooo long!!!!,"The Ring, is one of the best horror movies, or movies in general!

White Noise, Boogeyman, Hide & Seek, The Village, Gothika, The Ring Two, they all sucked. This is a great movie with so many twists and turns, but it makes you think which is kinda a good thing because most movies are just so bland and just plain boring! anyways this movie is awesome and one more thing two new scary movies that are actually scary are The Exorcism of Emily Rose & Cry_Wolf.

A little freaky,"I went to see this movie having only seen the previews for it, and had no idea that this was a remake of a Japanese movie (no, I am not Japanese). I am a huge horror/suspense fan and am not rattled by much.  As the movie opened, the whole time limit on when one was going to die reminded me of Feardotcom, which I thought was incredibly stupid.  So I thought that it would be sort of like that, and it was.  Hear about a movie that kills people, try to make it so that it doesn't.  I was not prepared for what was on the movie, nor the journey that the main character would have to take to make it right.  The main character was very strong, and, being a female in a horror flick, did do some of the typical female things (i.e., watching the movie).  But I was pretty amazed by this movie.  I definitely wasn't prepared for the ending.  By the end of it, my heart was racing and I was scared to go home alone.  And the subliminal images (yes, there were subliminals) were a good touch.  I saw one of them, and none of the three people I was with did.  I felt that the movie did a great job with the story.  Even though there were holes, it didn't hurt it.  I left trying to figure a few things out.  It really made me wonder, and I like that about a scary movie.  I haven't had real nightmares from a movie since Candyman came out (I was 12).  I still haven't been around a T.V. alone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Exorcist scared our parents. The Ring scares US.,"I saw the Exorcist, and though it was a very good movie, it's weak in relation to the book. In fact, it didn't scare me like I thought it would. I saw the Ring, and I was disturbed beyond belief. I still see the image of that little girl in my head.It seems that the Japanese are really imaginative. In fact, a few of my favorite movies originated in Japan (The Seven Samurai, Akira, and now the Ring). The writer of this story is up in the ranks of Stephen King.The actors were great, especially since this is the first movie I've seen them all in. That little girl is the creepiest thing in the world.What I like most about this movie is that it actually scares you. Unlike other supernatural movies (which usually end up as plotless gory bloodbaths), this one has a story, and scares the living feces out of you.This movie also plays with your mind a little bit, which is always good in a movie like this.The video sequence was the most disturbing thing in the movie. There's something about black and white freaky images that really engraves them into your mind.One thing I know. From now on, my entertainment comes from DVDs.

The film sure nearly killed me,"I watched the Japanese original a few months before i heard that Hollywood was making their own version of this film. The original, although not a unique idea, is a very interesting one if handled right. It was a very watchable horror, nothing special, but well worth a view.The remake however it a shambles. It takes a few good ideas from the film it is remaking, and also borrows from many other Hollywood horrors. The two films show the difference between the cinema from continent to continent. Japanese cinema is far more artistic and its audience view the films in a far different way. I can not imagine many traditional Japanese audiences enjoying Gore Verbinski's film.It has a few redeeming points. The special effects, as you would expect go some way to making the Hollywood version watchable, but as for the plot, it makes little sense, and we are simply not interested enough to unravel the bits that need us to.The usual horror conventions of the jump effect loud music are implmenented as the only way to scare us in this horror.

Won't watch your television set the same way again.,"Based on the Japanese horror film Ringu, journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates a videotape, where an urban legend details that anyone who watches the tape will receive a phone call, telling the person that he/she will die in seven days. If the legend is correct, Rachel will have to run against time to save her son Aidan (David Dorfman) and her own life and find out the truth behind the tape and how it could be stopped.More than just a scare you'll find in typical teenage slasher and horror flicks, this film will grip your heart with fear and tug at your mind. Instead of the usual chase scenes, top-of-your lung screams and excessive gore, this movie's scary images will send chills down your spines and its bewildering story will have you both frightened but engaged at the same time, having you eager find answers to the plot elements and its message.From the horrible expressions of the victims' faces to the scenes of ghost Samara crawling out of the television set, these images might echo in your mind long after the movie is over.

Cinema Fun Fright,"See this film alone in the front row of the cinema to get the full effect. Well worth it.It is a roller-coaster of emotion. No point seeing it on tv with friends. It works in the same way as 'Scream' it gives false endings & makes you conclude an ending, then gives you a different one. Very rewarding as a ride. This film is a unique reminder of why we need cinema & not DVD or video, this film in the cinema makes us 'feel' emotion against our will. It is never about plot or resolution it is always about making us have emotion against our will. Skill.Rating - 8/10.

This film is not big or clever or deep, but you will appreciate the artistry involved in making you 'feel' or gasp. To make a tree look scary & to make the audience scared by it, takes great skill.

AMAZING except for the ending,"This movie was most wonderfully made. It moves at a nice, brisk pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

I'm giving no spoilers away here, but the ending was a bit anticlimactic, and the final explanation wasn't that great.

Fear is a personal thing.,"Take into your viewing of this film no presuppositions; fear is a personal thing, and when it aims to seep into the mind as deeply as this, some people will pass it by without a sideways glance, and others will just laugh.Some films scare on the surface - Halloween, Psycho, The Exorcist and TTCSM are superficial, almost enjoyable thrillers, laced with gore, comedy and shocks. That is the modern idea of horror. It is unlikely that a person of sound mind will take the scenes to bed with them, less still have any nightmares.The Ring has some of these, but the real genius are those moments that cause nothing more than aghast silence, and a sense of bewilderment. Don't Look Now has such moments; Eraserhead goes, perhaps, a little too far, but still hangs around like a bad taste in the mouth. Some of the imagery in The Ring is too intense, it needs comic relief, but around each corner is another thug of a moment : blood red, hyper-polarised, in your face.As I have said, real horror is a personal thing, and I won't be losing the baggage that this film has left in my head for some time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Genuinely disturbing movie,"This is without doubt the scariest horror i've seen in recent years, Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, Shining and anything else dont even come close.  What I liked best about this film was the fact that it managed to maintain the fear factor right throughout the entire film, unlike other chillers such as Sixth Sense or Jeepers Creepers which were scary for forty minutes before losing themselves in the latter parts. This film is scary right up to the end!The main reason I felt compelled to write however concerns the Ring, Ringu debate. To those who dont know The Ring is actually a remake of a Japanese film Ringu which came out in 1998.  The general consensus on here seems to be that the original is much scarier and darker, a view to which I cannot subscribe. I watched Ringu first, about 3 months ago and although I found the story inriguing it wasnt really scary at all until right up to the end,(which was shocking I must admit!). The original Japanese version, obviously made on a low budget had a made for tv feel about it, and the acting wasnt really that good either. I cant honestly belive how anyone watching the two films could say the original is scarier, it just so isnt! Anyway one thing the original did do better however was to flesh out the story. I wont spoil either film by saying what happens but in the original the history of the girl is much better and explains things more.  I would recommend watching both films as they both offer something different from the usual teen slasher horrors we seem to get all the time nowadays. The only similar film I can think of is FearDotCom which by the way was terrible, so I would recommend this or the original Ringu to anyone wanting an original, scary horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Truly Frightening,"I do not get freaked out very easily. Only one other movie had me shaking after watching it. That was Stanley Kubricks ""The Shining"".

The great thing is it has absolutely no huge stars. But is still being loved by everyone. Maybe Hollywood should take note.On that note the acting was superb.  Naomi Watts does a great job. In her first leading role. The two young actors David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase. Give chilling young performances. Best I've seen in a long while.

Highly recommended,"I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film. I had been told that it was worth seeing, but nothing more. The two main reasons behind me wanting to see the movie were :1) It was around Halloween & I wanted to see a scary movie 2) I had seen Mulholland Dr. and really liked Naomi Watts' performanceWith that in mind, I expected the film to be decent.But the film was much more than decent. It was downright creepy. Very creepy. It's important to understand the difference between ""scary"" and ""creepy"". Scary can be accomplished in a matter of seconds (someone jumping out from behind a wall with a knife). Creepy is something that takes a while to accomplish in a film. It takes a long time on the part of the director. It requires more attention and time on the part of the viewer. This film managed to accomplish creepy very well. It reminded me of the older generation of horror films, which managed to grab you in a way that was very psychological (""The Omen"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and of course ""The Exorcist""). Those types of horror are the ones that always stick with me. They are the ones that endure. They are the ones that I inevitably have to watch for at least a little bit when I pass them on late night cable even though I have seen them countless times.creepy filmvery well madeone of the best films of 2002",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fails in Comparison to the original,"I had high hopes for this movie.  I had been reading about it for a while through other sites, and it intrigued me.  When I learned that there was going to be an American re-make, I immediately wanted to see it.  But, having read that the Japanese version is a great horror movie, I wanted to see the original first. So, I did.  And I was blown away.  The movie was almost perfect.  It was scary, had a genius plot, good direction, and a spectacular ending.  I went to see the ""The Ring"" on opening night, keeping in mind that some said it stayed true to the original.  The opening scene was like the original, but then the movie heads off into something else. The screenplay for the U.S. version was terrible.  They should've stayed along the lines of the original.  I really do not like how the U.S. version had to explain everything, it left nothing to the imagination.  Movies are much more frightening when the viewer has to imagine what happened, rather than throwing it right in their face.  The Japanese version made the perfect setting, and it just gave that dark, eery, suspenseful feeling.  ""The Ring"" Americanized the original, with cheap scares and typical ""american suspense."" Although the re-make was better than recent horror, it does not live up to original, and it threw too much different ideas in, i.e. horses, Samara's father, the extensive footage of the cursed video tape.  If you want to see a true horror movie, watch ""Ringu"", and try thinking for yourself.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Ring vs Ringu,"I have never known an original to be less of a movie than the remake but in this case I have to give it to Gore Verbinski for keeping the tone of the original in-tact but amplifying the chills a few notches. I was disappointed with the original (I tried very hard to like it) although the tone was decidedly creepy. The remake really delivers. It is everything a scary chiller movie is supposed to be (including plot holes and far fetched premise). The story line of how the girl came to be so evil was nastier in the original (but why did they switch from the father being the culprit in the original to the mother in the remake??) but the tale around how the tape came into existence was more plausible in The Ring.It gave me the creeps throughout without resorting to gore or special effects. Also,I thought that the character development of Rachel was very cleverly done and more developed. You were meant not to care for her parenting skills in the beginning as it gave the chance for her to redeem herself as a parent when the father did not. Naomi Watts character was certainly flawed and this added to yourself being drawn into the movie. Cardboard cutouts never do well in this type of movie.  The role of the son was more prominent in this one which was no bad thing although 6th sense comparisons are inevitable.All in all I would suggest to see both the original and then the remake and make up your own mind. I actually think they compliment one another. I certainly think more of the original now then I did before. This is maybe because I saw it in a more 'western' context and it filled in a lot of unanswered questions I had before I saw the remake.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well done remake,"I went to see this film expecting to be disappointed, considering the low quality of horror films lately. The Ring is well made, and decently acted, but like The Cell, the 'look' of the film is what is most appealing.After seeing it I saw the original Japanese film from 1998. The Japanese version (Ringu) told a similar story but without some of the touches Gore Verbinski used to appeal to Western audiences. Ringu was much more subtle about revealing the secrets of the tape while Ring is a little more blatant about some things, like the 'seven days' revelation near the end. I thought it was a very disturbing and original film. The people who think The Ring is stealing ideas from Feardotcom or some PS2 game obviously don't realize where the concept started.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
aggresive marketing and advertising as the sum of all evils,"I love this movie. I had wanted to seem it in theaters but as usually I just stayed home and got drunk. So finally I rented it and watched it at home. The filming style reminded me of the same style used in Koyaanisqatsi that eventually found it's way into the hands of Trent Reznor for the Nine Inch Nails video Closer. If that wasn't enough to pull me in, the Jacob's Ladder style of creepiness that runs throughout the movie would also have sufficed. I'm so sick of movies like Scream and Signs that have a certin wacky predictablity, and plot that fit together so tightly that it's a wonder why the charecters in the movie don't figure out what's going on. Here we are now with a visually intense what-the-why-the-hell-is-this-going-on creepathon that doesn't seem to pander. The movie contains very minute amounts of actual violence on screen, much like Jacob's Ladder and has this kind of decent into insanity where ""why?"" just sort of becomes an invariable question. As far as reasons are concerned for the source of or cause of the evil, lots of theories can be hypothesized. Mine goes along the line of thinking that the lesson learned by the movie is that much like the government, the only way to stay safe from evil is to partake in it's execution. No pun intended. I give this movie a nine out of ten because as much as I would have enjoyed some female nudity from Amber Tamblyn or Naomi Watts the movie would not pander to my idiocy. Thank you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not a patch on the Japanese version,"I might have liked this film more if I hadn't seen the Japanese version first. I found the digressions from the original plot in this version irritating in the extreme. The business about the horses is spooky, but not really anything to do with the main plot. The same goes for the stuff about the barn. The director appears to have thrown in stuff from Ringu 2, without any regard for whether it belongs in this film or not.Then there was the child actor who played Aiden. His performance wasn't as convincing as that of Takashi Yamamura as Yoichi in the original, and I really couldn't bring myself to care too much what happened to him, which killed the suspense.SPOILER WARNINGI also found it puzzling how after Richard electrocutes himself in the bathtub (in a shocking, but gratuitous scene) Noah suddenly arrives virtually out of nowhere, then they seem to make it back to the cabin on the mainland in an unreasonably short length of time.Rachel's choice of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a tape to replace with the cursed video seems pointlessly nasty. Why put it in a children's video, and not, say, an 'adult' film which a child would be unlikely to see? Is it okay for children to be cursed to die as long as they're not HER children?",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A classy horror film!!,"Every once in a while you come across films that leave a lasting imprint on your mind. 'The Ring' is most certainly one of these films that have started a new trend in horror movies! It almost makes it into the category of 'The Exorcist'.I did not move from start to the end just to find out what or who was killing the people who watched the video...and along the way I was taken on a roller coaster ride with many twists and turns in the story. And I can tell you honestly that when that moment arrived---the final scene---I was quite disturbed and terrified for a few hours after that!! However, at the end of the movie there were a few questions unanswered....I hope they are answered in the sequel due in 2005. After reading the other comments, it seems almost mandatory to watch the original Japanese version....but at least this time round I will know whats coming!!! If I was to rate this movie....it would be a perfect score just for its imagination and genuine horror!!!!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing!,"This movie is not like many other horror movies. This one is actually proper made with a good narative and very good composed. Its a big piece of art. The stoyry is not that much about jump scares, but you can feel it all over your body. Im going to say that I usually wasnt a fan of horror movies, just because a lot of them is very bad. But after I saw this the first time, I looked at horror movies for at least a month and I discorvered one thing. For me, this movie is the best of them!You may wonder why I didnt give it a 10 after what I wrote. Well, for the genre its amazing.

"not the best thriller ever, but highly effective","""The Ring"" has something going for it that most thrillers today do not. It's interesting.  Never mind what people say about it not making sense, because it makes pretty good sense if you pay attention to the movie.  I'm not saying that ""the ring"" doesn't have it's flaws, but if you're looking for the next ""exorcist"", stay home and wait. But if you're like me, and just looking for a thriller that actually thrills, and isn't carbon copy of modern-day crappy excuses for thrillers, check out ""the ring"" it'll leave you entertained and talking about it for plenty of time after you leave the theater.

A Real Horror Movie!,"So you're disgusted with today's horror spinoffs of previous spinoffs, which are still as pathetic as some of their predecessors, only the director has add a few topless girls and some flesh eating to try and gross you out.  It you are a true horror fan of any kind you will agree that this just does not cut it.  We want to be scared.  And how can you take a film seriously when you have a mutant alligator eating the villagers, hmmm...?  Anyway, The Ring manages to achieve what others horror flicks have not - to scared the ghost out of you.Based on the Japanese film, Ringu, The Ring spins a modern-day equivalent to the Exorcist, with the whole demonic girl idea.  What it does that The Exorcist did not (despite Exorcist being a better horror), was that The Ring developed the story beyond demonic possession into a mysterious and macabre down-the-rabbit hole investigation of how, Samara (the demonic girl), came to be.I have loved horror films since a tot and through the years have only seen a few that were truly frightening or horrifically disturbing.  I can easily say that this film is the only horror that comes to mind in the past 5-10 years that was a good fright.  I highly recommend seeing it and as a test of how brave you are, watch the film alone one night with the lights off.  Then go to be later that night and see if you don't hide under the covers.  :)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

To these criticisms I say only this: use your head.  The movie gives you a multitude of clues, but it does not lead you by the hand.  As is typical of Japanese Ghost Stories (of which this movie is one - look for the original), not everything is explained, but many of the little things can be explained if you think them through enough.I would like to say for the record that I have never found a movie scary before in my life.

Unbelievably scary,"I am not a person to get scared easily by movies- I have seen everything from Vampires and Scream to The Exorcist and was not even mildly affected by any of them. But this movie really did it for me.For the next HOUR after viewing the ring -on a warm Sunday afternoon I might add- my heart was racing so much I thought I was having palpitations. My friend andrea who saw it with me (who also has a history of immunity towards horror films)and I were speechless, and andrea jumped as her phone rang as we were exiting the cinema. For ages after that we kept saying ""oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh"" and stuttering in awe. A movie has never before affected me even a fraction as much as The Ring did, as we speak I am in fact home from school because I could not sleep a wink last night from fear.So, just a warning to anyone out there planning on seeing this movie- you better be damn tough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Two hours of baloney that overbuilds to....nothing,"Spoiler free, no specific actions or character details givenThe Ring will entertain you fully and you will have no unanswered questions if you accept anything that is thrown at you and never stop to ponder even the simplest details.Okay, there's a videotape that kills people after they watch it. A little girl is involved. We know that, but there's unanswered questions. Well, the movie does give you answers, which are satisfying as long as you don't ask a single follow-up question. If I want to know why some angry kid went on a shooting spree at school, the local news will give me the answers why. Instead, ""The Ring"" IS that troubled kid. For any question I ask, be it ""how did this happen?"" or ""why?"", the answer is a basic, uninspired ""uhh, because"". He may even give me an answer that he thinks makes perfect sense such as ""I want to kill people so I got a gun and did"". And of course, if that's all you ever heard of the case, and no other explanation were given for the series of questions that would follow, you'd be completely satisfied, right?Well, not for most people, but then here you have the Ring which pulls that crap with almost every important question you'd have. Yes, you learn how this video kills people, as demonstrated in one of the two ""big reveals"" of the film that is so powerful and scary that I think ""Oh,"" and shrug. The other big reveal a is red herring near the end that's just a bit of dialog - basically ""Uh oh, what we thought was the case really isn't, and now it's actually worse!"" The film ruins this too, giving no explanation, reasoning or motive whatsoever for what was just explained. Savin' it for the sequel I guess.The end made me realize that, more than anything, I could have summed up this film in one sentence and saved myself a lot of time and letdown. Yes there's a little girl, a well, and a mysterious video that kills people. But why, how, and what do they all have to do with each other? Well, the big ""why"" is revealed without much more than ""well, uh, because"". ""How"" isn't answered at all- not in any logical, explainable way unless you just accept the very silly and ostensibly MEGA CHILLING super payoff that I think I was supposed to have seen. Of course, after seeing what I saw, I'd still like to know ""how"" that event, upon which this movie's very premise hangs, is possible. No explanation attempted. You just buy it, 'cuz it makes the story super neato, you know?As for ""what do they all have to do with each other?"" Well, the movie goes on for an eternity trying to make this the big mystery. In fact, if I gave you the answers to what happens, then went into detail of how this is visually represented, you'd probably think there'd have to be SOMETHING more going on, and probably say ""oh, that's what happens? How? Why? (there's those troublesome words again).Nope, there ain't much of a story here. It's a concept that, when stripped down, comes down to a special effect, one that has different motives than what we were led to believe. Huh, pretty powerful I guess, or so I'm supposed to think based on the Sixth Sense ""slowly zoom in on the character as they reveal the 'big twist'"" shot. I mean, sure I know that the movie's last ten minutes are supposed to be pretty profound and I'm not supposed to question it. I suppose it's just the natural learner in me that says ""Gee, now I know the big secret. The video kills people by doing what I just saw. What again is the motive for this, how again does it work through a plastic videotape, and why does it take 100 minutes of buildup for the basic or nonexistent answers I received? Huh, what? Distract me with the end credits and release a couple answers on a special edition DVD released in time for the sequel? Sure, sounds great.To make matters worse, no one in the movie is appealing. The protagonist is a pest and a (expletive). In addition to other annoyances, she's rude enough to walk up to someone's horse, let it out of its cage, and watch its resultant gory death as its little girl owner cries in horror, all without a word of apology or explanation. I can also ponder credibility leaps like how she can be holding a dessicated corpse while up to her waist in putrid water and not think too much of it.Of course I'll get a personal message ridiculing my stupidity. How dare I try to find logic in a film that, as a horror film, shouldn't apply to logic? It's simple. I got the film, got the message. But you know, after two hours and all that praise, I expected a better ending than that, or at least some explanation beyond ""it's just magical. Accept it."" Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a horror film too, but Leatherface didn't kill people by popping out of a tree and making his chainsaw hover at his victims. If a movie isn't going to bother being realistic, it should at least give a better explanation than this film did.But hey, this movie is the perfect conformist's exercise. Everyone else loves it, so surely I must be stupid if I don't. I guess I need to just watch it and accept it, not asking any questions or pointing out flaws in the story since that's clearly what everyone else has done. Then once I'm done with that I can go and love Blair Witch instead of actually wondering what it was on the screen that I was supposed to be terrified of.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

After the first scene I began to learn that when a TV was in the room and I didnt want to get too freaked out I should close my eyes. (bad mistake) but it was impulse and I wish so bad I could have been a little less freaked out.In any case I came home SO excited.

"Too Many Questions, Too Little Answers","The Ring had a chilling concept and much potential.The Concept:  A tape, filled with seemingly random and meaningless bits and peices of footage, is deadly.

Who's behind it? Who kills you? How can anyone detect when you are watching a videotape? Etc.., are many of the hundreds of questions you will be asking while you watch this movie.  The problem?

I haven't covered my eyes at the movies in a long time...,"...and I'm not saying that in a negative sense. The Ring, a remake of a popular Japanese horror film, is about a mother/reporter who looks into the mysterious death of her young cousin and four of her friends. Their deaths are rumored to be because they watched a video tape, after which they had seven days to live. Following their tracks, Rachel (played by Naomi Watts), comes upon the tape, and after watching it, begins to believe in its myth. Now she has seven days to solve the mystery behind the tape, before it claims her life.There's more to it than this, of course. Rachel has a son who seems to have some semi-telepathic abilities. She also gets help from Noah, a photographer, and father of her child. Other than that, I don't want to give away any of the movie's secrets.The Ring is quite good at making you jump. Some may call them cheap thrills, but there's more to it than that. The days seem to fly by so fast, you're really counting the time left when suddenly the next freaky thing occurs and makes you shift in your seat. At several points, I covered my eyes because, I knew I was going to jump, and I really didn't need more nightmares tonight. I haven't covered my eyes for a movie in a long time.So, is it as good as the original? I think so. I love the original, but at the same time, there's just something cleaner about this version.

"forget the plot holes, this is an instant-classic chiller","The Ring is not a horror movie or even a thriller. This is definitely a ""chiller,"" an emerging genre which seems to be blossoming after the success of The Blair Witch Project. Like other movies of it's ilk, it combines the sometimes sickening fright value of horror movies with the thrillers' unique way of packing a suspenseful detective story into a ticking-clock (""i hope they make it...i hope the make it..."").It's a distinctly non-Hollywood kind of filmmaking, I can't think of any of the popular chillers of the past few years that has been particularly satisfying for an American audience so used to nice, neat endings. The one that came closest to tying everything up, The Sixth Sense, is also the most celebrated, interestingly enough.Yes, a lot goes answered at the end -- some of it is deliberately ambiguous, some of it begs questions that actually SHOULD have been answered, and a lot of it can't make any sense. This movie's biggest flaw is asking questions that it never even attempts to address, let alone answer.But plot is not the strength of this film. It's strength is an impending sense of dread -- the waiting for the horror to happen -- and this movie is so great for making you feel that dread almost constantly. There are great stretches in the film when nearly nothing ""scary"" in the traditional sense happens, but looking around in the theater at all the covered faces, you would think somebody was getting knocked-off every three minutes.Kudos to the director and the cinematographer Bozen Bazelli for creating what I think is the most visually-arresting movie since Requiem for a Dream. I recently saw a preview of the director's upcoming project Butterfly, which, despite being a science-fiction melodrama, is just as hard on an audience as The Ring. It's what you see and how it is shot that frightens you, rather than you what know. Zimmerman's score is incredible -- I just bought it today, and I saw the movie last night.There's nothing here to challenge last summer's The Others as the best of the new chillers, neither will this film keep you up at night (like Blair Witch did if you saw it before the hoax was exposed). But it is a feast for the senses, and well-worth the money, which is true of few movies these days. Ignore the plot holes, and just LOOK.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original Japanese version is much better!,"Just a few brief thoughts... In my opinion the ORIGINAL Japanese version of this movie (Ringu, 1998) is much better. There is also a Japanese sequel which is equally good (Ringu 2, 1998). The prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) is somewhat more strained although it tries to explain the history of why things happened in the other two movies. The American version of the film is a direct copy of the Japanese one, and not nearly as good. The only hassle with the Japanese version is having to read the sub-titles.

I haven't seen the original version, so I can't really compare it.  All the actors were very good.  I also like some of the transitions between scenes.  As for it being really scary, depends on just how screamish you are.  What I would suggest, though, is to not read any real in-depth reviews of it since a lot of them might give away too much.  How important is it to see this in the theaters?  not really critical.  I would go to one of the earlier shows to save some money. Although it was interesting having several teenagers in the row behind constantly asking one of them who already saw it if a certain part was going to be scary.  Like other people have said, a lot of the questions that get asked durring the movie are never really addressed.

Prepare to be disappointed,"There is a lot going on in the Ring, but none of it actually amounts to the horror film that critics are calling it. This film is hardly anything more or less than a weird, and often ridiculous charade of a ghost story, which is occasionally evocative but less so than it is dreary. sometimes it is on the right track, but usually it is not.After the bizarre death of her niece, Rachel Keller, a young journalist is asked by the departed's mother to investigate. Her search leads her to a motel cabin where she finds an unlabeled video cassette. She players it once, it contains about twenty seconds of grainy miscellaneous shots including a dead horse, a girl coming out of a well, and bizarre ring of light. Moments later the phone rings and informs Racheal that she has a week to live. Can she uncover the truth before it kills her and subsequently puts her own son in danger.The story is kinda spooky, but it falls apart. In the end, the Ring is a failure simply because it makes no sense. True horror fans will watch the Ring and probably dedicate the rest of the day to figuring out what it all meant. As a horror fan myself, when I see a movie, I want to be scared and intrigued as I watch, not hours AFTER I've finished watching.As a protagonist, I kinda liked Naomi Watts. She doesn't have a lot to do but she does it well. A lot of her acting is done not with her words but with her eyes, in the same way Jeff Bridges acted with his body in Starman.I guess she is the only thing memorable about this otherwise mediocre motion picture.

the best thriller ever!!!,"It was just a year ago when my eye caught a DVD called ''The ring'' in a Videoclub. I had heard a few things about it but I didn't think that it would be such a big deal. However, I decided to borrow and watch it. I was totally astonished. From the very beginning to the end credits I remained absorbed in the magic of this movie. Even though the plot is a bit complicated, it is imaginative and totally innovative that it can lure even the most demanding spectators. According to it, there is a videotape which if someone watches, he dies after seven days. Yeah, it may be unrealistic but very challenging as well. Isn't it? Furthermore, the direction was great.Gore Verbinski, the charismatic director of ''The ring'' managed successfully to create a gloomy atmosphere where horror and mystery are harmoniously combined. This whole situation provokes to the spectator a weird feeling of anxiety and fear for what is going to happen in the movie.Undoubtedly, the outstanding performance of Naomi Watts, who proved for one more time how talented she is, has a great impact on them too.In many cases, the spectator puts himself into her place and tries to answer the questions about the cursed videotape. The whole movie is a quest for the truth, an attempt to survive from the evil that seems to live in the tape.

Lacks a good storyline.,"This is a horror movie, but if you've seen other horror movies youwon't be scared. It's good though, and some scenes are genuinelyterrifying. But the Ring lacks a good story. It's plot is very thin andconfusing, which makes it rather boring. Go see the remake of ""Carrie"" instead.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It DOES receive a ""ringing"" endorsement...","After spending Halloween night with the Scream trilogy (again) in my college dorm, a friend and I decided we were looking for something better, so we tried The Ring.  It was a purely impulse movie choice--we'd heard some good things but knew little about it.  My recommendation to you: Go See It.The film's basis is a video tape that brings about the death of its viewers within 7 days.  It's a decent enough scary movie idea--you know that right away the main character is going to watch the video tape and then have 7 days (or 2 hours of film time) to solve the mystery of why the tape is so deadly.  So it's already granted that not everything in this film will be a surprise to you--sometimes the people you expect to die do, and the bad things you expect to happen do.  But don't be fooled into thinking you've got it all figured out--it's more likely than not that you don't, and there are no false climaxes--there's really only one.The plot is well constructed--my friend and I who both delight in finding plot holes and poorly constructed scripts tried very hard to be disappointed with the film, or catch something the editors missed, but we couldn't. It's a good mystery, and halfway through the film you will want to stay solely to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle.  While, on the surface, the killer and the victims may not seem connected, the storyline actually does draw a line between the two, the video being the vehicle.  It's all explained, it's all there on film--the movie AND the movie within the movie.Technically, it's a beautiful movie.  Landscape shots are very well planned out, and it (thankfully) lacks in cheap special effects, dripping blood and gore (total gore time likely comprises 1/64 of the film), and poorly done computer miracles.  The Pacific Northwest was beautifully utilized, the sets were well done, the cinematography was excellent...I could go on and on.This is not your average Halloween slasher-pic scary movie.  It's Hitchcockian in nature in that it's based more on suspense and solving the mystery than on teenagers in ghost masks jumping out with large knives. For the Hitchcock fan, check out the in-film homage to Rear Window.The Ring is a well-thought out, beautifully filmed, intellectual, scary movie.  Definitely give it a watch, it's worth spending the evening afraid to turn on your television.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Could turn into a murderer invitation movie,"Watched it last night for the fifths time. Well made and Still suspending. They could make a complimentary movey for it from pov of a homicide detective who sees connected to all the all the people who died mysteriously. When they find the body of that old man in the bathtub they don't know it is suicide they look at the last person who who has visited him and it's Rachel. The van they check the videos in the boat and they see she does something to the horse and the horse go crazy so she's kind of get-together this off the horse to then the check the video of the security camera off Noha'a building and see a Rachel coming out of the building right after his death so they connected all the dots and come to this conclusion that she is the murderer and they arrest her. She has no way to defend herself, but she noticed that some are all going to help her to prove her innocence because Samara I still has conscience.
I think it would be so interesting in the smart to turn a scary movie to an investigation movie with an evil character with awake consciousness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unanswered Q's,"Some of us movie lovers out there will like this film (and I mean some!). Yes Naomi Watts is hot... and yes it does start out well and keeps you intrigued throughout the bulk of the movie. Does it die off or get weird toward the end? Yes!!! Of course it does! that's how you build for a sequel. That's why there are so many unanswered questions.If you do some looking around for the original ""Ringu"" you'll see that they had to make a sequel to it (seemingly because there is enough story to keep going-I know I want to know more). Maybe for some the answers don't come easy enough. But for me, thinking and wondering is part of the experience. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Somebody wake me when this gets scary,"It shouldn't take this long for a horror movie to get scary. I saw The Ring at a preview and I'm sorry it doesn't live up to the hype. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has more scary moments.First off this movie steals elements from so many other horror films and uses them incompetently. The whole into comes from Scream, the creepy kids who can see ghosts from Sixth Sense and on and on.An evil demon child ""who should never have been born"" makes an evil video tape that looks like a rejected Nine Inch Nails video and seven days after watching it, the viewer dies. So what does the heroine do, she shows it to everyone she cares and about, but won't let strangers see it.The one, genuinely, creepy moment comes at the end, but by the time you get to it, you want the evil demon child to get rid of all the morons you've seen in the movie so far. And the end was the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.Seeing this makes me want to see if the Japanese original is nearly half as dumb and incompetently done.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Classic Horror Film,"This was one of the most tactful, good old fashioned horror films of my generation. I don't scare easily, so it's hard for me to say this was scary, but I can say it was definitely very eerie and suspenseful. The plot was very well done and mysterious, it kind of leaves you wondering, but not in a ""the directors didn't cover it"" kind of way. More of a ""it's supposed to be like that"" kind of way. The acting was great, especially from David Dorfman who played Aidan, Rachel's son. He was an aloof, mysterious young boy whom, I think brought a lot of the eerieness onto the film. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good jolt in the night.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary as hell,"The Ring (2002) D: Gore Verbinski. Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn, Rachael Bella, Richard Lineback. Horror film based on the 1998 Japanese film RINGU is designed to shock, rock, and jolt its viewers, with the results being just plain scary as hell. Watts delivers a terrific performance as a news reporter who is investigating the origins of a freaky videotape whose viewers die 7 days after viewing it. The film borders on the absurd, but the atmosphere is unbearably tense. Loses 2 points, however, for the film's too many endings and an opening sequence that features teenagers that seemingly belong in a pop culture slasher film rather than this one. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence and grisly images.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Top notch horror movie,"The ring delivers plenty of chills with out being a slasher movie and having ""buckets-o-blood"".  The movie is actually kind of a combination mystery/horror movie.  The rumor of a mysterious video tape that people watch and then die 7 days later, is investigated by Rachel (Watts)when she investigates the mysterious death of a teenage relative of hers.  There are a couple of ""fright scenes"" but the majority of the movie revolves around the investigation into the mystery of the tape.  People in the movie (and the audiance) do see video, which sets us up for a 7 day deadline to get to the bottom of the tape, and try and solve the mystery to put an end to the curse.I found the mystery and the investigation to be interesting, and helped set a dramatic tension in the movie with the race against time.  Top notch thriller that I think will have a wide audiance appeal.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the creepiest movies I've seen,"I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard about the original Japanese version back in 1998. I heard that it broke box office records in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore and also won awards at film festivals in the US. When I heard that, I automatically knew that it would be great and one of the creepiest movies I had ever seen. When I finally got to see the US release, I was soooo shocked at just how much I loved this movie. I really didn't think that I would get that creeped out, but the whole time I was shivering and so tense that I thought I was just gonna freak out in the theater. When I left the theater, my heart was pounding and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days!!  This movie is a definite for all movie fans!!! If you haven't seen this movie, you better go out and see it right away. I give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Another pointless Hollywood remake,"The Ring is yet another Hollywood remake of a foreign language film which is barely 5 years old. As you would expect it is flashier, more action-packed, and loaded with tricksy camerawork and CGI effects, but it loses out in the creepy/suspense stakes. Whereas the original Ring was dark, grainy, and built up a sustained tension, this version is bright and colorful, full of vibrant images and packed with booga-booga jump scares no doubt aimed at pleasing the 18 year olds raised on a diet of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.Director Gore Verbinski has taken a classic and genuinely scary ghost story and turned it into your standard disposable Hollywood blockbuster fare. The industries constant remaking of recently acclaimed foreign movies (eg Les Visiteurs/Just Visiting, Insomnia, Open Your Eyes/Vanilla Sky) borders on insulting. Subtitles aren't *that* hard to read are they?",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good creepy beginning, but...","Gore Verbinski and Ehren Kruger simply do not know what to do with a horror story (in Kruger's case, that was apparent since Scream 3). Sadly, it proves what I've always believed: no matter how good the original story is, the final product will still be less than great in the hands of mediocre talent (see also Brett Ratner and Ted Tally's Red Dragon, they totally missed the heart of the story. Hint: The heart wasn't Lecter's conversations with an FBI investigator in the asylum-like it was in Silence of the Lambs, and it wasn't ALL Dolarhyde, OR the investigation...)The movie is overpraised by people (I think such praises reaches its nadir in the review that's currently on the main page for this movie. The guy sounds like a publicist, with delusions about the power of film. Sorry to break it you, but you don't hover above the masses, and the masses aren't stupid enough to throw away their VCR'S after watching, what is afterall-A MOVIE, and not a very scary one at that), but it does have its merits (however I give Gore Verbinski very little credit, even if he feels he's made the story he's own. Sorry, director boy, you OWE EVERYTHING to the original story. Try NOT making a movie that's a ""sure sell"" like the horrible movie ""The Mexican"", and that isn't reverently faithful to something which is pretty good to begin with-i.e""Ringu""). The movie has an great first third (seeing how the first victim's body ended up was pretty freaky), very low key and creepy, and you think its setting you up for a good slam bang finale.  It isn't.  Maybe I shouldn't have expected too much from a PG 13 movie.  Simply put, the movie lacks tension; Rachel's investigation lacks urgency, and the dates that are VERY frequently flashed across the screen give the movie an episodic feel that doesn't help matters at all. It goes NOWHERE, and the open ending is HIGHLY anti-climatic. Imagine getting on board a rollercoaster that sputters to a stop midway and you'll get an idea of what watching this movie is like.I love the concept though-a video tape that kills is something only the Japanese could concieve of (their love affair with technology and their personalization of it is apparent yet again. See also anime movies, in particular Ghost in the Shell-NOT a horror film however, despite the title).",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent movie ... but intensely terrifying?? I think not.,"I just saw ""The Ring"" and I loved it ... the video itself was extremely disturbing as were several other scenes. And the overall atmosphere was extremely creepy, mostly due to the use of music and sound effects. But the film is nowhere near ""intensely terrifying"" or ""the best horror film ever."" I'd give it an 8, but there are many horror films that are much better (""The Shining,"" ""Jacob's Ladder,""The Exorcist"" ""Last House on the Left"") Who know's, maybe I've just seen too many horror movies to really be scared anymore. I just wasn't completely terrified. It's an excellent film, but not all it's hyped up to be. Maybe all that hype is what left me a little disappointed at the end. All I know is that I won't be scared everytime the phone rings or the TV shows static, like someone I know told me they were when they went home after seeing the movie. And by the way, to clear up another misconception, ""Blair Witch Project"" was not scary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A masterful command of film directing turns a silly premise into a incredibly effective horror,"To get it out of the way: a killer videotape is objectively, a little ridiculous, and on the surface not a very frightening idea at all. For skeptics, especially horror skeptics, it would be tempting to write the film off for this reason alone. I would seriously urge you not to.What makes this film so effective is that it utilises atmosphere to entertain fear. The audience is not subject to regular, predictable jump scares. There isn't a character dying every 15 minutes. Yet you are kept in a permanent, undulating state of tension throughout because of how cleverly the film has set everything up.It achieves this in a variety of ways: the ever-present blue filter, the near-absence of music, the intertitle cards for each day of the week, progressively pulling us closer and closer to... we don't even know for sure. And last, the opening -- this is something a lot of horror films try to do, but in the majority of cases fail to execute as well: open the film with an incredibly suspenseful and ultimately terrifying 10 minutes, as way of locking the audience into a state of fear -- a state where the movie has showed them what it can do, and what do expect. A brilliant and sparingly used jump-scare is also delivered at the start, but rather than being predictable, it comes out of nowhere.What effect does this have? For the rest of the film, you are afraid of what'll happen next. The film barely needs to do anything at all, it only needs to suggest 'enough' -- you, the audience member, will create the fear for yourself. For instance, by virtue of the original jump scare coming out of nowhere, the audience is on constant alert for one even when the film doesn't look like it is leading there.In other words, this film very successfully adopts the 'less is more'. We get scared in the dark not because the dark is actively scaring us, but because our brains are projecting frightening thoughts onto it -- The Ring operates in the same way.---------------A point of contention: this vs the original. It seems that people generally prefer the version they see first. I personally think this is a rare case of the remake surpassing the original. The remake is more polished and controlled. Some will say this absence of grittiness lessens the scare, I disagree. To me the difference here is like one between a student film and a professional remake of the same thing. Mostly comes down to taste though, and which you saw first.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Outstanding, as well as scary","A very well made film that I enjoyed greatly.  Scarier (if it is possible) than The Shining and Psycho.  Creates a tremendous atmosphere of intensity and fright.  Do not go alone.  One fault, if it can be called one, is the lack of levity to release built up tension, but if you let yourself be scared, you will have a lot more fun.  It also has a rather good ending for a horror/thriller movie.  Altogether a wonderful experience, rating a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Just didn't get it,"Well, obviously quite a few people love this film, but I'm not sure why. I found the whole ""cursed video"" laughable, and was never able to figure out why a girl who was kept in a barn and drowned in a well would choose a videotape as her vehicle of revenge. For that matter, exactly how creepy is a wet 12 year old with stringy hair supposed to be? The point of killing random strangers seemed a bit strained as well. Overall, I found the cinematography disappointing and the acting never rose to the level of mildly convincing. Perhaps many of these elements made more sense in the context of the Japanese movie -- Ringu -- on which ""The Ring is based; I have no idea, since nothing I saw in this movie would make me want to watch the original.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Iffy,"I love horror movies. I have to say that I liked and disliked the Ring. There were moments that made me itchy as I sat and watched. But it just wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.Things were very predictable, in fact I predicted the end of the movie about 2 minutes after I saw the woman watch the video for the first time.What I don't get is the woman showed a loving side toward the little girl near the end, and supposedly freed her from her bonds of hatred. Yet it didn't end there.  At least it's left open for a sequel, which I highly recommend they do.I give it a 6 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very Satisfying Horror Film I Have Seen In Years,"This movie is somehow much more satisfying than the original version, but not as creepy.After the death of her niece, the mother request Rachel to investigate about the videotape that seem to kill anyone who watch it after seven days; that include herself, as she have to find the ways before it kill her in a week time.Just the plods are already creepy. Though compare to the Japanese it might not be that creepy (but don't think it is not creepy, because it is). And overall it is much watch able than the original, more enjoyable since you don't have to read the subtitle; bigger budget and makeup make the movie even more enthusiasm to watch.Reason To Watch: · Naomi look really great, · Brilliant acing by D.Dorfman · Amber Tamblyn, after all it is so hard to see her. · Very satisfying and money worthy. · Good remake and the director did capture Japanese style very well.Reason Not To: · Might be disturbing by the video, · Why is this movie was made even though the Ringu is still a new movie.· Might be very scary for some people.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Holds up fairly well.,"There is a lot of spooky and creepy imagery in this movie that will make some of you a little scared. The tape is creepy, the Naomi Watts' kid is creepy, this movie just gives off a creepy modern vibe and I like that. The movie has some cheesy moments and the color correction can be a little distracting but if you get invested in the story like I did you'll enjoy the film. It has a legitimate good mystery and cool ideas that translate well off paper. I really like this movie. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disturbing,"I'm not going to get into the whole thing about it being a remake and all of that.  If you're a smart person working a job and looking for a good scare, see this movie.  I grew up watching Freddy and Jason and every episode of ""Faces of Death"" hundreds of times.  I've seen all of the classic horror films from ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Exorcist.""  I even watched the original ""Ringu"" as well as ""Ring"", the Korean remake of ""Ringu.""  But this movie scared and disturbed me more than anything I've ever seen or read.Maybe it was the theater environment or maybe even the mood I was in, but this movie freaked me out.  Driving home wasn't easy and I'll have to see how I do going to sleep tonight.  And like I say, I grew up on gore and violence so it's not like I'm sensitive or anything.  Get some friends, head to this movie and watch grown men scream along side thirteen year-old girls. It's a lot of fun.  9/10.PS: Notice how many people are more disturbed by what happens in the ferry scene with the horse than the fact that four teenagers died.  You can waste all of the humans you want, but don't mess with the animals.  I love Americans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
